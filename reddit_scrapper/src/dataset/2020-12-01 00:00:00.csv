Up until now, (for about a year) I have been buying using DCA. I plan to continue this but with greater amounts and also some limit orders placed below the market price.

Right now it will take me approx 60 days to complete the purchase if only the DCA strategy comes into play. 

But I have also placed limit orders of about 5 times my daily purchase amount. These are placed at intervals between 10% and 30% below the current market price. I plan to adjust these as needed as the market moves in either direction.

k5xu8j,Narwhal-Proud,Newbie question - is Coinbase a scam?,"Long time crypto enthusiast, only recently decided to buy bitcoin.
Decided just before the US election would be good time to get involved.
Joined Coinbase. Fully verified and linked a bank account. Deposit 3000gbp.
Bought 3k of bitcoin. Few days later it’s worth 3500gbp so sold 500 profit and withdrew successfully. Few days later and the value is back to 3500gbp so decide to sell another 500. 
Coinbase app says my account is unable to sell. Weird I think, surely they’ll have emailed me to tell me this. Nope no email.
So I start a support case. Few days later they email me back to say my account can never link a bank acc (I already had), can never sell crypto (I already had) and can never withdraw to a bank acc (I already had). The email advises me to send the crypto elsewhere. I go to do that and the app says that this function is restricted too! I email them back and they ignore it for over a week! They don’t even have a phone number!

I work for a big tech firm and can’t believe that a company is doing this. We’re not talking a small amount of money and whilst I don’t desperately need it the idea that they’ve locked it away from me is kinda nuts.

So I can’t sell, I can’t withdraw and I can’t send it elsewhere. All I can do is buy more?
WTF that seems like a scam to me?

Anyone got any advice? I tried to post to their Reddit but you need a certain amount of karma 😂",1607004523,34,1

Now I believe in bitcoin 100% and 100% of my savings (and then some) are in Bitcoins, but even if it somehow crashes and disappear, I don't care. Bitcoin is possibly the ONLY shot at freedom I've got.

I realized recently just how enslaved I was. Business force closed by government. Everything I do or say, tracked (not in the US). Taxed at 65% of my income (yup). Basically a slave, enriching my owners.

We are taxed so heavily here, and in so much debt (especially with the virus now) that I basically have to work my entire life so my premier can afford another $425 hot towel on his private jet. In fact, probably more than one. Those people drink $5,000+ bottles of Champagne paid by us and party while I have to work around sick people all day. All this to enrich some asshole business owned who doesn't give a fuck about me.

I barely earn enough to cover my living. Bitcoin is the ONLY way I can ever be free. If it rises to $250k I will be basically set for life, and most of all, free.

I realize it might or might not happen, but I don't care. It's my ONLY shot at real freedom.",1606999249,100,1

k80ew3,SpawnMagic,How to accept bitcoin on WooCommerce without third parties?,"I recently setup monero payments on woocommerce, and it was simple: I added my address and let it connect to a remote node and an exchange to retrieve value, and it worked nicely. I've gotten about 3 orders with monero.

It made me realize I am leaving a bunch of ""value"" on the table by not accepting bitcoin, so I want to accept bitcoin as payment.

I tried to set it up for bitcoin which should be even easier and simpler as monero is far more complicated but I was either expected to use some ""PayPal"" type bitcoin service OR setup my own BTCpay server, making it way more difficult. 


Isn't there a simple plugin or app where I can upload my address or some type of key, like a view key but not private key so it generates unique bitcoin addresses for orders, and then when paid it can go to my wallet? 

I would prefer it doesn't reuse bitcoin addresses for privacy reasons but if needed that might be acceptable if it can at least track which orders are paid and associate the transactions. 


I am willing to redirect customers to a bitcoin only website, so it doesn't have to be woocommerce, I can setup a ZenCart, PrestaShop, or shopify or whatever is needed. I just want a quick easy solution that doesn't require me to use third parties or try and figure out how to install and connect BTCpay server on cpanel and somehow have it work with WooCommerce 

I looked into having BTCpay servers hosted by other parties but it sounds like they can just change out the xpubkey and capture customers payments? While they, if honest, can't steal from my private key... they can just redirect customers to their own private key, right? 
Or does woocommerce plugin somehow validate?

Seems like there should be a simple solution but I can't find it.",1607283528,15,1

No, it is never too late to invest in Bitcoin. Actually Bitcoin is known as a very high-risk form of investment by most investors. This is largely due to its fluctuations in prices and lack of supervision and oversight by the government. However, bitcoin remains one of the most profitable investment opportunities around if you can take on the risk and be careful so that you know when to sell.
Investing in Bitcoin is very different from investing in traditional options, and you need to understand that investing in Bitcoin comes with higher than normal risks. But if you have the patience and watch the market carefully, it is worth investing.

k7sz5f,SendMeDistractions,Can a deflationary currency such as bitcoin function in a global economy?,"Let me start off by saying I am huge supporter of bitcoin and blockchain. I have been hodling for years and studying cryptography and computer science. However, I'm not as informed when it comes to economics. 

Something that has been concerning me about bitcoin is it's deflationary nature. Hypothetically, if bitcoin were to become a widely used global currency (or even THE global currency), would this not cause problems for the economy? If you know your bitcoins are going to appreciate in value over time, then that incentivises us to hoard our wealth and not spend any of it. Surely such an incentive and resulting lack of spending would lead to an understimulated economy?

Also what do we do about the super wealthy? There are no doubt many early adopters who, in this hypothetical scenario, could now be worth billions upon billions. There would be a small number of people with an exorbitant amount of wealth and influence over the global economy. Not to mention the absolutely massive amounts of bitcoin stored in ancient wallets that we can't possibly know if anyone still has the keys to. What if satoshi was sitting on his old private keys all this time and suddenly floods the global economy with an absurd amount of liquid bitcoin?

If anyone who knows their economics a bit better than I do can point to any answers to these questions then I'd be greatly appreciative! I'm not trying to start any disagreements or arguments, I'm just genuinely curious about this stuff.",1607257894,190,1

ka1reu,clydedyed,Theory: By year 2030 there will be an industry and infrastructure which turns actual Bitcoins into accessories and jewelries.,"Ok, hear me out.

The only slightly disadvantage of Bitcoin to Gold at least currently is its physicality and aesthetic value.

Someone out there will want to take advantage of turning Bitcoin into something physically and aesthetically amusing and desirable.

How will they do it?

They use certain shiny metals/jewels that are not as valuable in the modern days and incorporate micro wallet chips into them.

By creating a technology to do so, they will also develop a very sophisticated and precise system where those jewelries (now with actual access to certain amount of Bitcoins within it) would easily be able to be recognizable visually and verifiable value wise.

Perhaps through smart phones (if that's still a thing in the future), people can just scan those jewelries, be it rings or necklaces or other forms of accessories, so that they know that it is valuable thus desirable.

Sure, it still carries the risk of it being lost or stolen but I believe that is already the risk that people take to have and use to flaunt their wealth and/or style.

I was just thinking about how gold gained value and how the same things can be applied through the advancement of technology in the future.

Individuals and institutions will not want their currencies to get devalued, and the only safe haven for their assets will become the Bitcoin monetary network.   


This feedback loop makes the network grow exponentially, as it feeds on the worlds monetary supply.

The problem is that it can’t just shoot up 10000000% in one run, because the existing financial network needs time to absorb it.

So then, it retraces, and consolidates before the next 30x run. That's why we are seeing these bubbles.

So then we have this channel of monetary energy feeding into crypto through Bitcoin as an intermediary, and some of that energy “leaks” to some of the altcoins, which causes even bigger percentage movements.

What this means, is that Bitcoin is approaching &amp;infinity dollars as it feeds from the existing fiat system, whilst fiat will see exponential inflation.

I know this sounds insane, but if you look at the math and approach this from first principles... this is the interpretation you end up with.

It’s a black hole in cyberspace that’s absorbing all assets as fast as it can, but is essentially limited by the bandwidth at which humanity can integrate this change into the system.",1607549333,52,1

k9zspz,UnusualEngineer,Must Read - Ledger Hardware Wallet for Bitcoin,"Stop worshipping the Nano Ledger Wallet. The amount of ass kissing this company gets here is ridiculous. 

Let's be honest. They suck and their product sucks.

Product: When I first receive the ledger, I don't remember it having even a plastics wrap. Just a cheap box. I open it up, took the ledger out: It has black dirty oily mark strikes on it, the metal parts are scratched, overall it looked like someone tampered with it. It felt like the product and packaging was put together in somebody's basement, not a manufacturing company. 

Software: Then there's the shitty ass ledger ''live'' software. Absolute headache and shitshow of a user experience. Even having a background in software engineering I had trouble navigating thought this non sense maze of an app. Click here, do that, go back to this menu, quit the app, blablabla. Then the you're only allowed max 5 cryptos at once on the wallet, otherwise you need to remove them to install new ones... You guys think Btc has a chance to go mainstream if the average public has to put up with these convolute instructions? Really?

Privacy: The fact that they got hacked and allowed these hackers to steal our personal info, name, cell, email, home address etc. and even contact people and tried to scam them of their wallet. C'mon. Aren't these fools suppose to be Security Experts? If they got hacked so easily, what does it say about their product?

Customer Service: As mentioned earlier, absolute garbage customer service. Couldn't tell their clients they got hacked and give us possible fishing scam emails. Also, that dude that got hacked, they couldn't care less and gave him the typical automated bot response.

Pretty underwhelming from all the bootlicking stories I read here. I'm breaking the mold and finally speaking out about this garbage cheap company that sales shitty ass products at an alarmingly high cost.",1607545333,19,1

k9x8wk,tookthisusersoucant,Shower thought: Could we build a system close to the existing system for retail?,"PS. This is a xpost from a comment that I made in Daily Discussions.

With standard BTC transactions, you make it, and that's it. Done. But when there is a 2 way trade involved and that other trade takes time (eg. delivery in 2-3 days) can we build a payment process that gives both parties confidence?

I'm imagining a solution that involves timelocks:

User spends to a 2-of-2 address between themselves and the retailer.  
The user and retailer can sign to spend the funds with a 2-of-2 signature at any time if everything goes well.

As with the current financial system, users can revoke the payment if needed, but to disincentivise it, there is a timelock such that the user can claim the payment back after N blocks and the retailer can claim the funds after N + M blocks.

This has the benefit that the user gets to show that they hold the funds needed for the purchase, and puts it in reserve so the retailer knows it won't be spent elsewhere. The user knows that they can revoke the payment if there is a problem that they can't resolve with the retailer, and the retailer knows that the money is eventually spendable by them if the user is unresponsive, but the user is still in full control.

Similar to the existing system today, users CAN play the system, but a little risk is expected between 2 parties. The user trusts that the retailer will send the goods, and the retailer trusts that the user will release the funds.

Or maybe, there could even be a contract that splits the funds in a conflict of interest. So a retailer may require that if there is a disagreement, then the user can only claim 90% of the sale amount back and the retailer will get the other 10%. If they both work together, then one person will get the max funds.

Ooh, what if there is a minimum fee aswell that makes the whole disagreement scenario a lose lose scenario?

If we did have an escrow service based solution, could the escrow be regulated so you have a tie to the legal system? Would that be a bad idea?

People are buying these hardware wallets built by small companies and they don't even know what they're getting into.

You could instead have a wallet that is secured by the device's Secure Enclave, which literally means nobody else for you has access. Apple has Billions$ at stake to keep their devices secure, versus some little hardware company which little resources.

Who would you rather trust?

With a proper iOS/Android app the device could be filled to the BRIM with malware/viruses/keyloggers and your funds are safe. The only real risk is if someone obtains physical access to the device, then in some extreme cases the chances of theft are higher.

Stop trying to ""act smart"" by choosing difficult solutions. Many times the best answer is the easiest one and it's right in front of your face.",1607530612,53,1

The same thing is happening in the Netherlands. The plan is to enforce it in the coming years. There are also talks that this will be introduced in the USA.

Of course you can choose to comply with the law, but I don't want to do anything illegal. 

This would also mean I can't send my bitcoin to a exchange anymore. They would only accept regulated custodial bitcoin wallets.

What I think will happen in Europe and the USA is a grey bitcoin world with self hosted wallets and a clean legal bitcoin world with KYC custodial wallets.

Sharma also states that ""there are reasons to think that the latest bitcoin boom has deeper roots."" Morgan Stanley manages more than $ 710 billion in assets. 

 Sharma presents a tight summary of the reign of five currencies that took turns in the role of dominant currency before the dollar, from the middle of the 15th century to 1920. These corresponded to Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, France and England. The period of supremacy of each coin was 94 years, on average. «At the beginning of 2020, the dominance of the dollar has reached 100 years. This would be a reason to wonder how much longer it could go on, except that there is no clear successor, ”Sharma argues.",1607804376,18,1

If bitcoin today can reliably hold $18,000 then that means in order to maintain that price $16,200,000 of bitcoins needs to be bought up daily (900 coins mined a day and 900x18,000 = 16,200,000). Now let's say we maintain this daily purchase demand of $16,200,000 all the way to the year 2060, that means we'd have the below values for bitcoin after each of the halvings:

2020: $18,000 ($16,200,000/(900 Bitcoins mined a day)) = $18,000 per coin)

2024: $36,000 ($16,200,000/(450 Bitcoins mined a day)) = $36,000 per coin)

2028: $72,000 ($16,200,000/(225 Bitcoins mined a day)) = $72,000 per coin)

2032: $144,000 ($16,200,000/(112.5 Bitcoins mined a day)) = $144,000 per coin)

2036: $288,000 ($16,200,000/(56.25 Bitcoins mined a day)) = $288,000 per coin)

2040: $576,000 ($16,200,000/(28.125 Bitcoins mined a day)) = $576,000 per coin)

2044: $1,152,000 ($16,200,000/(14.0625 Bitcoins mined a day)) = $1,152,000 per coin)

2048: $2,304,000 ($16,200,000/(7.03125 Bitcoins mined a day)) = $2,304,000 per coin)

2052: $4,608,000 ($16,200,000/(3.515625 Bitcoins mined a day)) = $4,608,000 per coin)

2056: $9,216,000 ($16,200,000/(1.7578125 Bitcoins mined a day)) = $9,216,000 per coin)

2060: $18,432,000 ($16,200,000/(0.87890625 Bitcoins mined a day)) = $18,432,000 per coin)

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming we don't see a hyper inflation with the dollar and instead it maintains a \~2% inflation rate $18,432,000 in the year 2060 would still have the same purchasing power of a few million today. This seems like a perfect retirement plan for the younger generation. I've also compared the U.S. dollar against an inflation calculator for the past 40 years. $100 in the year 1980 has the same purchasing power of \~$350 today. If the same thing happens for the next 40 years then that $18,430,000 in 2060 would have the same purchasing power of $5,265,714 today (18,430,000 / 3.5) which is pretty dam good.",1607803779,67,1

When I click on my wallet the balance says N/A and I get a message saying “error can’t synchronize the account, try again later.” On the settings tab the network provider and fist section is also empty. The wallet to which I sent the 800 is 15qC9d2jf71YJs2HuethUt1pC5to77TbVq . As you can see there’s been 1 transaction, which is sitting in the account. I sent my information and the error logs to mycelium support and they promptly came out with V35 that had bug fixes, which did nothing on my end. Now here’s where it gets weird, I’ve tried plugging in my 12 word seed to other wallets but nothing pops up and it says my last transaction was November of 2019 ( which it was OTHER than this transaction ). My mycelium wallet still shows the 15qC9d wallet as my receiving wallet but for some reason it is a completely different receiving address in new wallets. Not sure where to go from here, unless the mycelium app starts working it’s looking like a 800 dollar loss. 
Also, the mycelium wallet in which the seed is for shows both my 12 word seed and the receiving address as being that above, so it is 100% the right seed.

ke04xt,Experimenta7,Bitcoin Full Adoption and Usage,"Bitcoin clearly has become an increasingly popular asset. Institutional investors are massively buying it as a store of value. 

Let's be honest, buying, owning and transferring Bitcoin safely is not easy. After seeing so many seemingly smart people get hacked on here (please share your story if you haven't already), why is the difficulty to securely store this asset not an obstacle to it's global adoption? 

I just don't get how **most** people could get onboard. I mean I would definitely not recommend my grandma, my dad or most of my friends to own BTC. I wouldn't be surprise to see a picture of their seed phrase on Facebook. 

Is simplicity not required for BTC to reach a higher market cap? Isn't it simpler with gold or any other asset?

BTC survived 2017's attempted coup, but that will not be the last time they try. And next time, those attempting the coup will be much more sophisticated, with deeper pockets, a thorough understanding of BTC's protocol and its weaknesses, a paid army of programmers and private keys to large quantities of BTC, if not the majority of it. For all we know, someone somewhere already has a plan and is laying the groundwork for it. I say this because even though code and math cannot be bought, corrupted, gotten rid of, the people and institutions that write them can. 

The closer we are to the moon, the more dangerous and treacherous the road gets. We need cautious optimism, rather than allowing our greed to lead us to blinding euphoria.

kdxyfd,tonyyayo93,"Staking, what a good feeling","I was playing around in the binance app and then I read “staking”. I’ve heard about that a few weeks ago when a friend living in Jordan telling me about eth 2.0 and staking. So i knew it’s a sort of way to hold cryptos for an amount of time and being rewarded by a certain interest rate on the deposit. 
I went on and clicked stake TRX max amount for 30 days. In a second or two it stakes the whole amount and the process of getting rewarded started. I’m getting a decent 10% so that’s not too shabby. 
I come from a third world country, Lebanon. Over there, we’ve been living under the same corrupt regime that offered us 5-15% interest rate on deposit accounts for over 30 years. Turns out it’s the biggest ponzi scheme ever organized and now the value of every bank account is nearly zero. Anyways, because I lived there I’m familiar with high interest rates so I wasn’t really surprised by what we get for staking. But the fact that you can just deposit an amount of crypto close the deal and know that you will still get paid 10-20% in coins is just insane (you might still lose the value of the coins).This was the fastest transaction ever and proves that the world will end up turning to crypto and not going to banks anymore for financial services.

I'd been saving coins ever since I heard Coinstar allowed Bitcoin purchase from some kiosks

Saw a post about them expanding their offerings so went to the site seeing there was a kiosk nearby

Went to the kiosk coin in hand. Put the coin in the machine, and I think I was charged maybe as much as **10%** for cash. I do remember reading they wouldn't put your ""coins"" directly to BTC, but that it had to be cash (paper). Didn't much care, wanted to go through the process.

Then, bought the Bitcoin, using the newly acquired cash. Spent some cash for BTC,, but,, exchange price was $20,883.97. A \~**7%** markup.

On top of the markup, a service fee of **4%** was also applied to the transaction.

Finally, after getting my code and getting my coinme acct set up, I go to withdraw the BTC and there's a 0.00025BTC fee for sending it.

kdvs7c,asbillsaw,Please help! Need advice on how to help a friend with their (semi) stuck funds. WWYD if you were me? (cross post from ethtrader),"So I got a friend into crypto years ago back when you could trade on Binance in the US. They still have some ADA on Binance (Asia) and cant really send it anywhere because they don't have a hardware wallet. Additionally they live in a state where they cant open a Binance US account so they're not able to transfer to themselves. They want to get it out of Binance (Asia) and convert into ETH or BTC so its easier for them to trade.

The issue is that I feel responsible since I got them into crypto and I want to help. My first thought was that they could send the ADA to my hardware wallet and i can trade it for ETH or BTC to send back to their exchange wallet but then it convolutes my taxes. My tax software would essentially see me selling ADA that has no record of being originally bought by me. I haven't looked into the tax software i use (zenledger) to see if its something where I can just ignore the transaction and not report it.

My other thought was to buy them a ledger so that they can self custody and send the ADA to themselves. On one hand this makes me feel like im dumping the problem on them and giving them more work to do. On the other I feel like it'll be really confusing tax wise if i trade it for them and then send funds back to them. What would you do in my situation?

I found a Bootcamp style course at University of Toronto (see link). The course is essentially everything I'm looking for. The ability to understand and create my own blockchain (like I said I want to go DEEP). As well as adding another cert to my papers. Only downside, and a big one, it's 12K dollars.

Does anyone know of alternative programs at reputable organizations that provide a certification of some sort afterwards? I wanted to do something that would contribute to my required PD hours, hence the certification objective.

Alternatively, the education is really what I'm after, so if there are some good resources online for fee than perhaps teaching myself is the way to go? Ultimately Id like to learn Python and build blockchains and smart contracts. No better way of understanding them than to make them right?

I am pretty new to this stuff and am trying to figure it out while researching what I can from FAQs etc. But I haven't been able to find an answer to this question. 

Let's assume that BTC really does rocket to the moon and even past it in the next 5/10/20/50/100 years, whatever it might be. Realistically by that point, it probably would not be priced in USD anymore, but for reference say the value of 1 BTC = $1000000, or put another way 100 satoshis = $1.

Great for everybody who owns today if they are up 4000% over todays prices! But is the upper bound of value of a satoshi approximately equal to the transaction fee on the smallest practical bitcoin transaction?

e.g. I want to buy a chocolate bar that is worth about $1USD. If the value of that in sats is 100, and the smallest possible transaction fee is 1 sat, it would be 1% which is pretty reasonable. 

But let's say that a chocolate bar is 20 sats. The smallest possible transaction fee is still 1 sat which is 5%. Gets worse the more deflationary BTC becomes, which from what I understand is kind of the point of BTC.

So at that point, does a decimal get added if enough of the nodes/miners agree? Or is a purchase of that magnitude not what BTC is really for, the same way I wouldn't go buy a chocolate bar with gold bullion today, and that is the usage case for alt-coins or other currency? But if we still need alt-coins or other currency, is BTC really a perfect currency?

Just a curious question as I try to understand crypto a little bit better. Thanks in advance for any responses.",1608355359,21,3

Everyone talks about the price, the slow burn and how awesome bitcoin is, but what do you you guys want to get out of bitcoin once the time to sell finally arrives?
U
I'd assume a lot will pay off their mortgage, and maybe even spoil their kids where possible? 

Personally, I'm actually looking forward to the ride since I'm still a newbie. It's pretty wild, especially with a community that actually chats like you all do. With that said, I'm definitely going to get a car, hopefully electric too, when the time comes! Since I assume the electric cars will be much cheaper, and better by whenever that date arrives. 

Stay awesome and keep flying high! ☺ ♥

EDIT: Please be respectful of others and their comments. They have just as much right to do as they wish with their own bitcoin ad you do. We're all on this crazy ride together. As with most things, there is no correct answer, nobody holds the intellectual keys to what's right of wrong, and being rude makes nobody feel better.",1608345692,219,4

My question is then, does make sense that banks/government of the world would simply buy up all the available crypto and then sell it back to the population as currency? Leaving those who invested early as powerful millionaires if not billionaires and the rest of the population working for crypto just like patent WO2020060606 seems to entail. 

Forgive me if theres something I’m missing here to make this obviously not the case, but on the other hand without something I may be missing this seems like the obvious case . 

thank you for your patience with a nooby here , cheers to my first crypto investment . I’d be lying if I wasn’t hoping for a crash soon so I can invest heavily, but in the long run all signs point to crypto being the currency of the NWO, so even a small investment of $500 at nearly 30000 a coin  seems like it has the distinct potential of turning into tens of thousands of dollars.",1608341456,34,2

I have very basic knowledge on bitcoin investing right now, and plan to further it. Just coming across some questions I can't find the answers to, hence posting here. I'm a beginner, so please correct me if I am saying something incorrect.

I want to know if I can use my income in Canada, use an exchange based in Canada, then sell bitcoin in Canada? If so, what exchanges would be favorable for my situation?

And also if I am I able to sell it in the US while living in Canada?

How about if I use my income from Canada, use an exchange based in the US, then sell bitcoin in the US? 
What exchanges would be favorable for this situation?

How would the US taxation come into play here? I know for stocks there's limitations on TFSAs and such for Dual Citizens, so just curious if there's more info on bitcoin investments?

Hopefully I am making sense, just having a hard time finding this information. Any peice of advice or info would be greatly appreciated!",1608614399,5,1

khy58v,nanonerd100,SIM Swap hacks,"Hi, I should have posted sooner. I see others getting SIM Swap attacked so I wanted to add here. 

I was SIM Swap attacked as well. Here are key points. 

1) USE GOOGLE AUTHENTICATOR (or any authenticator). If you do, you should be OK. They were able to change my Coinbase password, but without my physical phone (this is how authenticator works), they were not able access my account. 

2) FOR CASH APP, YOU ARE VULNERABLE. REMOVE YOUR PHONE NUMBER FROM YOUR EMAIL ACCOUNT. For some reason (still scratching my head), Cash App doesn't have authenticator option. It uses a PIN to approve bitcoin withdrawals. Here's how they stole my bitcoin. 

The KEY is to hack your email. This is easy because many people use a phone number as a password recovery option. Once the hacker got control of my phone number, it was easy for them to hack into my email using the phone recovery option. Once they had control of my email, they could now do Password Recovery for a lot of other sites that I use with this email. For Cash App, once they got control of my phone number and email account, it was easy to change the PIN. Then \*poof\*, bitcoin is gone. REMOVE YOUR PHONE FROM EMAIL PASSWORD RECOVERY AND THE HACKER IS STYMIED.

3) REPORT TO POLICE. If you had a loss of funds, call the non-emergency line. The actual call takes less than 5 minutes. They will just ask for report. The lady stated that if they need any more info, someone will contact me. No one followed up. But this doesn't matter so much as the fact that you now have a legal record. And you can get report copy easily. THIS IS IMPORTANT if you wish to follow other avenues (e.g., wireless carrier, etc.). I made multiple calls to my carrier (metroPCS). I was shocked that there didn't seem to be any follow up (they should at least investigate who changed my phone number to a different device). Finally, the rep told me to send a letter, along with police report, to a fax number. They said police report is needed for them to investigate further. \*shrug\*, so I did. 

If you do #1 and #2, you should be OK.

khxxv0,midnightmoth,Ledger is worth saving,"Unpopular opinion right now, I know. I'm braced for the downvotes...

Let me say first that I completely understand the outrage. I am a customer of Ledger myself and am extremely disappointed with what happened. Did Ledger fuck up? Yes. Should they be given a free pass? Nope. Is the anger and loss of trust justified? Absolutely. Should we encourage a boycott and pray that they fail as a company? I personally don't think so.

Despite the data breach, the fact remains that the product itself is solid. They are among the top 3 hardware wallets for a good reason. Their technology works. It's well designed and easy to use. If they were to become bankrupt, I think it would overall be a net negative to the bitcoin community. I wouldn't say that their wallets are the best choice for everyone, but they fill a niche and raise the bar in certain areas that their competitors must try to match and exceed.

I'm also willing to bet that this cold splash of water will force them to go overboard on their security, and would be surprised if they had another fuck up at this scale in the future. I'm sure they know that if they don't demonstrate that they have taken steps to fix their issues, the public will never trust them again.

This breach is going to be a stain on their history for a long time. Any time someone asks for a hardware wallet recommendation, this breach will always be brought up. But anyone who buys a Ledger going forward will still benefit from their technology and any improved iterations.

I know many will strongly disagree with this opinion, which I understand and respect. This is likely to result in a significant amount of crypto assets being stolen. Your anonymity has been violated, and some of you are now concerned about being a target of a physical attack. I get it. It isn't good. Still, I just wanted to throw another perspective out there and see if anyone else agrees that maybe we should hold off on grabbing our torches and pitchforks for a bit.

Above all, let's all do our part to strengthen our community by educating newcomers on how to avoid becoming victims of these scams.",1608610879,52,1

1. Get a small piece of paper, a little bit smaller than the ledger box.   
2. With black marker, write ""is this phishing?"".  
 
3. Then put that piece of paper in the ledger's box covering the ledger.  
4. Done.

How secure is Coinbase and CashApp, for example? 

Do ya'll think Coinbase and others are paying attention to the Ledger data leak?

And a side question, how is the security of other hardware wallet manufacturers? 

Again, I feel like it's safer to assume ANY company can be hacked, from Sony to Ledger and everything in between.

 Prime Factor-Based Encryptions (both RSA  and ECC which is used by Bitcoin wallets as the wallet p2pk (p2pkh)  addresses) is now rendered useless BEFORE the advent of powerful Quantum Computers due to a Right Triangle-based CONSTANT time mathematical  solution. Pythagorean Factorization Formula: (x+r)\*(2B + (x+r)) = Side  A\^2 (which must be a Perfect Square Value). Where: B = (Public Key)\^.5; x  = a whole number; r = the Δ difference between (Public Key)\^.5 and the  next rounded up integer value.  After finding the Perfect Square Value  for Side A, use the Pythagorean Theorem (A\^2 + B\^2 = C\^2) to solve for  C.  Then solve the Prime factors (Private Keys) by the following:   Prime1 = C - A; and Prime2 = C + A.  I used our Crown Sterling random  number generator to test the new Pythagorean Calculator via Microsoft  Excel; We were able to both immediately and successfully factor 1,000 Public Key values of various lengths/sizes (see video for examples).  Global Security Consultancy firm Deloitte recently published that over  25% of ALL Bitcoin (approximately US$90B) is presently at risk of theft due to Quantum Computers which are now pre-empted by the above mathematical formula.   

&amp;#x200B;

Think its time to sell or risk potential theft?  I'm guessing someone is going to rent huge amounts of quantum time and start cracking these private keys left and right soon.  Please someone tell me I'm wrong.",1608889417,19,1

kjv2ea,AlvinVonDiaspar,Calculating bitcoin gains for taxation... Is every sell event taxed?,"This year I'll have to declare my bitcoin gains to the IRS of a European country, and multiple questions come to my mind.

I've made in the course of many months many small bitcoin purchases (sometimes worth 50€, 80€), and have recently sold BTC for EURO in 3 sell events. The amount of euros I now have in COINBASE is €1500, waiting to be transferred to my regular bank account.

&amp;#x200B;

SCENARIO 1:

Let's consider this scenario, all within Coinbase and the same tax year:

* I buy 1 bitcoin at $8000
* I sell 1 bitcoin at $9000 -- gain of $1000, never leaves Coinbase
* I buy 1 bitcoin at $9000
* I sell 1 bitcoin at $8000 -- loss of $1000

What are my gains after the year is finished? $0 or $1000?

SCENARIO 2:

Now let's look at this scenario:

* I buy 1 bitcoin at $8000
* I sell 1 bitcoin at $9000 -- gain of $1000, which never leaves Coinbase
* 10 minutes later, I re-buy 1 bitcoin at $9000

Do I need to pay taxes on the $1000 gain, even though it was reinvested in bitcoin right away?

You can set up a node. You can do as much purchasing with bitcoin as possible.

But you can also get in contact with the manager of your local grocery store to carry a bitcoin atm.

They get extra traffic and sales because they offer a bitcoin atm, and us hodlers get to enjoy more adoption as a result.

kju5i7,apatel500,Bitcoin Supply Shortage - Interesting Asset,"Hello,

I have been thinking over the past few months at BTC, and really thinking about the fixed supply. Lot of companies, institutions, and millionaires - are all jumping into this asset. Lot of companies that are recently jumping onto bitcoin are quietly doing so behind the public's eye. Once they have accumulated a large amount of BTC, they go public with the info to promote more buying. I realized that sooner or later if we keep going at this pace, price will start to rise faster than usual. Instead of 2-3k moves, we will see 4-5k moves up into new levels. 

Another interesting fact to think about, many of the coins in the supply have already been lost and we will continue to lose some as we go on in time. Many people that pass away, or forget their keys will end up losing their stack. We are lucky with this opportunity to invest in such asset that is scarce and widely adopted by many people today. 

I don't have much to share or promote but just something to think about as we look back in 20-30 years, many people will be struggling to purchase BTC since the price will be either too high or their will be an actual supply shortage companies willling to pay large price to accumulate.

Wish you guys a very healthy and great Christmas. Share your thoughts and good news on BTC price with your friends and family. Also Amazon is stacked with many bitcoin merch you can gift your loved ones this holiday, here is the one I have purchased for my family:

Its a glorified insurance company if you will. So how does it work? Well, it keeps your bitcoin. And if you hurt someone, there is obviously going to be a dispute, most likely. Since they hold your bitcoin, they represent you and have to settle the dispute, possibly being out bitcoin to the counter-parts DRO. So there are no prisons, your bitcoins are whats at stake. Its also a way to scale bitcoin because transactions can take place internally for most things. But large scale settlements are done on the blockchain.  


I could write a whole book about this thing and i probably should. But ultimately i should start the DRO and get started.

I sold at one price but the deposited price to the other coins were per a transaction some were $1866 some we’re $23 totaling over $2700 in fees for 6 transactions...

( example did convert $6652 received $4876 to the convert amount )

Example 2 did one convert $4000 received $3852 

Example 3 did $3665 convert received $2872 

I had 3 more transactions like these :( 


On one convert  nothing was charged at all as a matter of fact they gave me $8 more on that transaction 


I have screen shots of the PDF generated financials showing less fees and full transaction. Those fees are lower than actual funding and fees charged

kjsilr,TroyIzAnnointed,I'm about to use OKEx to buy Bitcoin. Is it safe?,"So pretty much, I'm a minor (17 turning 18 in April), but I want to buy Bitcoin now as it's value is increasing at an astronomical pace. I know I can use the ATMs but the lowest fee I could find was 8% which is INSANE. Maybe if I had established wealth and income, I could afford it but I'm only 17. I'm planning on buying 4K worth of Bitcoin, so using an ATM would cost me an additional $320.

So my mother agreed to open a bank under her name, strictly for me because my plan is to use the online exchanges as their fees are much lower, some not even having any. I tried Newton (no fees) but they denied my mother's ID and haven't responded to my emails (probably since it's Christmas holidays). Next was Coinbase but it did the same exact thing.

OKEx immediately accepted and approved the identification I sent them, which I actually found kind of suspect. I've found a few people claiming they got scammed but overall they got 5 STARS on Apple reviews with over 7k submissions, so I don't know at this point.

I would rather wait for a response from Newton or Coinbase and resolve the issue with them, but I fear BTC will rise higher before that can happen and I can't wait the whole holidays for a response.

Is OKEx safe to buy from them? I'm planning to immediately withdraw after purchasing and transferring it to my Electrum wallet.

I just don't want them to pull something last minute after buying and pretend the ID doesn't work or ask for documentation I can't provide from my mother.

kjsa31,brianddk,The tinfoil hat / OCD guide to withdrawals from Coinbase Pro to Trezor via Electrum,"Had occasion to do a small, but non-trivial withdraw from Coinbase Pro to Trezor via Electrum.  Since the ""How do I withdraw"" question is asked almost daily, I went ahead and documented my (OCD) steps.  If you wanted to, you could reduce the steps to probably less than 5, but this covers most situations.  I suppose you could start adding a faraday cage if you wanted to dial it up to eleven.

***

1. Pair your Trezor to a GPG verified up-to-date copy of Electrum
2. In Electrum create a receive request
3. In your notebook, write the first 6 and last 6 characters of the address
4. Click the eyeball icon to show this address on your Trezor
5. Verify the first 6 and last 6 from your notebook on the Trezor LCD
6. Click the copy icon in Electrum to move the address to the clipboard
7. On the address tab, click CTRL-F to start a search and paste the address
8. Enable ""show details"" for the address with a right-click
9. From details box, copy the Address, Pubkey, and derivation to notepad
10. Verify the first 6 and last 6 from your notebook with what was pasted in notepad
11. Log into Coinbase Pro and generate a BTC (only) statement for a current time period
12. Log into your email and find the last ""available balance increase"" msg from CB
13. Review your statement and write down what the BTC balance was 24 hrs before the msg
14. Go to CB Pro address book and add the address recorded in notepad
15. Verify the first 6 and last 6 from your notebook with what was just done
16. Begin a BTC withdraw from Coinbase Pro
17. Use the entry you made in your CB Pro address book for the withdraw
18. The address may truncate, right click on it and select ""inspect"" to view the HTML
19. In the raw HTML you should see the untruncated address.
20. Verify the first 6 and last 6 from your notebook with the address in HTML
21. Use the amount you recorded earlier from your statement.  Round down for fees.
22. Copy the suggested fee into notepad with your other records
22. Calculate the amount of fees suggested and deliberate if this is what you want.
22. Begin the withdraw to advance to the confirmation screen
23. In the confirmation screen ensure that the ""Total"" is less than the amt recorded earlier
24. Verify the amount is what you requested
24. Verify the first 6 and last 6 from your notebook with the address in the confirmation
25. Verify the fee is what was suggested previously
26. Accept the confirmation to commit the withdraw
27. Get a beer an wait for a while
28. Check electrum to see if any TXNs have started for your wallet
29. If no network activity is registered on that address check the CB records
30. From ""Portfolio"" click ""Withdraws""
31. Check to see if your withdraw is in the withdraw log
32. If it is, click the withdraw to get specifics
33. If it is not check your email and SMS for alerts
34. If your balance is reduced but your withdraw is absent, open a ticket",1608866925,21,1

kjr3gf,BroocePain93,I'm pretty excited to be back in Bitcoin. Shakepay has made it really accessible and lucrative to start again!,"I've sent this to a couple of no corner friends of mine who were looking at dipping their toes in and one other subreddit. I was turned onto this via an anons post on facebook and am paying it forward - quite literally. Use the referral below, or don't. Just don't sleep on this app.
============================================

I started using Shakepay a little over a week ago. I had previously owned  and sold it some odd years ago; a tiny amount, but enough for me to be familiar with the product somewhat. With the recent Bullrun my interest piqued again and I decided to take the plunge and Dollar Cost Average into a small position. My idea is that if Bitcoin continues to outperform expectations and fluff off criticisms as it has for the last 7 years, I want a seat at that table; even if I'm holding a small amount, to start - I'll settle for the kids table. What really sold me is the institutional money pouring into Bitcoin.

Anyways, if you have been referred, you unlock something called Shake for Sats. This is a once daily shake of the phone that yields a very very small amount of Bitcoin. The first day shake was something like $0.18. Where it gets interesting is this, as you shake daily, the reward goes up every single day. After you've hit the max streak of 120 days, you top out at around $1.55 a day. As long as you don't miss a day, you will remain at this amount. The rewards chart can be viewed here: [https://legal.shakepay.com/rewards](https://legal.shakepay.com/rewards).

The best part, is that it is literally a shake of your phone once every 24 hours. That's it - no surveys or other time consuming actions. The second best part, is that the company is currently running a referral promotion where new uses get $30 after spending $100! Nice little sat bonus that will cover any fees associated with the spread with ease.

TL;DR - Shake your phone once every day for free Bitcoin and if you use a referral or are referred you get $30 free.

I can PM my referral link and a non-referral link so you don't feel pressured :)",1608861469,2,1

The regulators are here, and they want to make things more difficult for the ecosystem. Make no mistake, the new proposed FICEN rules are insignificant in the grand scheme of things.

I understand the basics well but there is something that I just can’t wrap my brain around. Considering recent events and the regulation of Bitcoin that the US wants to impose, like requiring a name be attached to a wallet that moves $10k worth of Bitcoin, how does that affect an HD wallet? Would the info be stuck on every set of keys that wallet generates or would it be just on the set that moves money into the exchange?

Sorry for the dumb question, but in my mind your personal info, if collected, would be on one set of keys that you should never use again. I make 99% of my transactions from a Trezor and I don’t see how this new law would affect my holdings. Please educate me. Thanks!",1608858525,10,1

klp0x5,marfalump,Idiot question- Remind me why I need a hardware wallet instead of paper wallets.,"I bought sone BTC way back around 2013-14.  I still have my private keys printed on paper wallets in my fireproof, waterproof secret secure location.  The wallets were created offline on a laser printer I own.  I can scan the public keys and I see that my funds are still there, apparently safe and sound.  I am saving for the long-term.  BTC is part of my retirement.  I won’t need it for 20-30 years (unless it jumps so high I can retire early).

Recently, for the first time in a long time, I purchased more BTC.  I’ll probably DCA for awhile to accumulate.  I know paper wallets aren’t a thing now, so I bought a Trezor Model T.  I don’t have it yet- it should arrive in a few days.  For some reason I am feeling less confident with the idea of a hardware wallet.  I am worried about:

- My seed.  If I need to keep track of the seed, why not just keep track of the private key?  I can generate a key offline and send money to it.  Seems like the Trezor is just an extra step in the middle.  Enter seed to get key- why?

- What if it breaks?  My paper wallet won’t break, but technology can break.  I’d hate to be 60 years old, ready to retire, and the Trezor won’t “fire up.”

- I assume technology will be significantly different in 2060 and beyond.  Will I even own a machine that has a USB for the Trezor?  Imagine if I pulled out my Apple IIe to do some accounting in 2020.  It’d be sort of like that.

Amazon will send my Trezor in a few days.  Can someone reassure me that putting my BTC on it is the right decision for me?",1609155657,43,1

People with a clear opinion but most of the time clearly completely lacking any knowledge what it is and how it works.

To be honest even the pro Bitcoin posters are not that much better and roughly 90% or more of the posts are a meme contest, lacking any understanding or explanations..

I realize these posters are only a small spectrum of people but it does points out how hard it is to understand something as basic as money.

knp1po,barbodelli,What differentiates Bitcoin from a typical bubble or even a ponzi scheme.,"I come in peace. I don't think Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme. Nor do I think it's a bubble. There's obviously value behind it.

But my dad who is a 75 year old PHd scientist has read a bunch of articles that compare Bitcoin to a ponzi scheme. I want to explain to him that there is value behind the product (thus not a ponzi scheme). Proving that it is not a bubble is obviously far more difficult. Because anything can be a bubble. Real Estate in 2008 was in a bubble. Yet it costs the same if not more than it did back then. 

I have done enough research to understand the value of Bitcoin ultimately comes from the network of computers that operate the ledger. If the network was smaller the ledger would be far more open to manipulation. But because of how gigantic it is in size it is nearly impossible to manipulate. Also I understand the blockchain technology is something very useful and needs to be developed further because it has many more applications besides a global currency.

The part I am fuzzier about is the actual product. For example McDonalds produces food. As long as people enjoy the food and they can turn a profit selling it there is value in their stock. BitCoin was originally going to replace currency. But lately it hasn't really taken that function because it has some properties that make it a difficult medium to use for transactions. It's more of a traded commodity nowadays. 

So please help me understand. I would like to make a good counter argument to my father. I am also interested in learning more about Bitcoin as a whole.",1609417113,33,1

knocal,HallHuntt,Make Your Voice Heard! - FinCEN KYC?!? Reg,"I hope most of you are aware of the newly proposed FinCEN rule. I know there are quite a few threads already about this here, but nonetheless, I´m making another one. PLEASE go and comment at [https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FINCEN\_FRDOC\_0001-0121](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FINCEN_FRDOC_0001-0121)

You can write your own comment or use a pre-written one. Here´s a good one from [stopfinancialsurveillance.org](https://stopfinancialsurveillance.org). 

\---------

I oppose FinCEN’s notice of proposed rulemaking that would dramatically expand the financial surveillance dragnet by requiring cryptocurrency companies to collect sensitive information from personal wallet users (referred to by FinCEN as ""unhosted"" wallet users). The changes would require banks, exchanges, and other custodians to record and report the name and physical address of personal wallet owners who transact with their customers, which would unacceptably undermine my financial privacy and the financial privacy of others around the world.

Financial data reveals some of our most sensitive personal information, including our personal interests, the causes we support, and our plans for the future. FinCEN’s total failure to consider my and my fellow Americans’ privacy rights in the proposal’s cost-benefit analysis is especially concerning given that the proposed rule would dramatically expand the financial surveillance dragnet by mandating—for the first time ever—that financial institutions start collecting and reporting sensitive personal data not needed in the normal course of business. 

I’m also worried that the companies I use for cryptocurrency services won’t be able to figure out how to comply with the proposed changes. If that happens, I might not be able to take custody of the assets that these companies are holding for me. My assets, whether digital or fiat, are just that—mine. A rule proposed by the United States government that denies me my right to take control of what I own is antithetical to this nation’s foundational principles.

I’m even more disappointed that FinCEN decided to bypass the standard notice-and-comment period by providing only 15 days over Christmas and New Year’s for the public to provide feedback on this proposal. It seems like FinCEN has little intention of considering the feedback it receives from this pro forma comment period, given that the agency actually claims within the proposal that it has no obligation to solicit feedback from the public on this rulemaking. 

In short, FinCEN must not adopt these proposed changes.  

\----------

&amp;#x200B;

The mere fact that they published it during Christmas and gave it a 15 day comment period is in itself alarming.  There are 1.9m users in r/Bitcoin, but only 2k comments on the ruling. Comment professionally. Gonna link a more informative thread about it below.

kno39h,messiosa,What's the end game for bitcoin?,"Hello HODLers

I am very curious what the end game of bitcoin is. 

Let's assume BTC price stabilises enough to become a real store of value (which could take a very long time, especially if demand and hence price explodes). It can then \*technically\* be used as a medium of exchange (which seems to me will increase demand again and hence destabilise the price, but let's pretend it's fully levelled out). 

Is that the end game? To become the decentralised currency for the world (that I think the Satoshi whitepaper had in mind)? Or simply to remain a store of value? Or something else?

If it is to become a decentralised currency: I'm quite confused as to how this will work in practice, especially with supply decreasing. Won't people have to sell their positions in order for it to actually circulate as a currency?

I would love to learn more and I'm very open to being corrected on anything I've written above.

k4xwue,OkCheerio,Bitcoin crisis scenario?,"TL;DR Can crypto exchanges run out of fiat if everyone withdrew fiat all at once, if there was doom-and-gloom news that prompted such urgency?

Hey everyone, n00b here and have been doing a lot of research before buying into BTC. I think I'm about ready to HODL a considerable portion of my entire net worth into it (which is not saying much at all, relatively speaking).

However, one thing I was curious about was that if exchanges, similar to banks, could simply run out of fiat if everyone happened to rush, all at the same time, into selling their crypto for fiat. Just humor me here, but I'm brainstorming hypothetical, and perhaps stupid, ""worst case scenarios"" and can't help but wonder what would happen if Bitcoin reaches, say, $100K USD, then the next day there's global news that somehow leads all banks to suddenly ban incoming/outgoing wire transfers related to crypto. I imagine this would crash the price, along with crashing the exchanges, and you'd just be stuck with crypto that you can never liquidate?

Consequently, would one be f\*\*\*ed?",1606868534,12,1

If I were to spend 0.001 BTC from this wallet at an online store that shipped me something, wouldn’t they be able to see that I have 999.999 BTC in a change address AND have my contact information? If they were bad guys wouldn’t they want to come to my house and break my bones until I gave up the money? I mean, in this example there would be like $20 million in that wallet - that amount would probably make a good guy go bad.

If this is how it works, then how would a person combat this? (and, no, I don’t have 1,000 BTC - I wish)

Would a person want to move a small amount from this cold wallet to a hot wallet and then spend from that wallet? I assume this would help, but couldn’t a bad guy just go back a transaction or two and see the 999.999 BTC and then assume it was mine?

Does a person have to run a CoinJoin before every transaction that would include identifying information? I’ve heard Lightning maybe helps since payments look like they came from the previous node and not the original sender (I’m assuming it works like this and that it would be near impossible to know that the original sender has 999.999 BTC)",1606858228,7,1

Being that Bitcoin is decentralized, there is no standard, nor governing body, to dictate what notation should be used for it. Nonetheless, ""BTC"" has been the generally accepted abbreviation for Bitcoin stemming from the early days of Bitcoin.

""XBT"" is a new abbreviation for Bitcoin that is starting to come into use and reflects its growing legitimacy as an international currency.

The abbreviation ""XBT"" comes from the International Standards Organization (ISO) that maintains a list of internationally recognized currencies. The standard dictates that if a currency is not associated with a particular country, it should begin with an “X”, hence ""XBT"". Another example of this is the abbreviation for gold, ""XAU"".

k4sgp2,aarontuyet,"November - Played Perfectly (Shaky Hands WUT?) - one trade per day - $1,000 Model","Coming from being a hobbyist stock-trader since early 2000s I was surprised to see all the hate on day trading BTC. For me, it's one of crypto's biggest advantages over stocks for investing - being able to execute quickly without going through some crappy third party bank/financial institution. Started on COINBASE and quickly saw they basically steal money with ""algorithms"" on your buy/trade/sell prices. Now on [Binance.US](https://Binance.US), and loving the day trading primarily between high volume coins, USDT, BUSD, and normal fiat.

Anyway - I wanted to model what a very simple ""perfectly"" played month would look like versus the highly lauded ""hodl"" tactic pressed so hard here in reddit.  To make this super simple, we will keep it to one trade a day - the ""perfect"" part is either buying or selling at the max high/low of the day.  This is impossible (refresh!!!), but I still wanted to model the *potential* gains realizing that BTC is expected to keep trending up, and if that holds true, we can freely trade each day with **the goal to maximize the number of satoshis**, not necessarily the value.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumptions**: 

\*Using Gemini minute data from cyptodatadownload

\*Start with $1000 USD

\*For each day, you get ONE trade, to either BUY or SELL or HOLD your entire position. You have to use 100% leverage/risk, meaning on any given day you can only HOLD or SELL if you have BTC, or BUY if you have USD.

\*Determination is made looking at the max HIGH/LOW prices of BTC per day and if there is &gt;2% swing in value in favor of trader to sell.

\*I want to compare this to hodling, so we will start with buying BTC at the average of Open for 11/01, which was $13,774.85 for both the day trader, and the hodler.

&amp;#x200B;

**HODL Model**:

Buy BTC at 11/01 max low of $13,364.26 and you get .07334465 BTC.  Keep this until the end of November and sell at High Close of $19,883.33.  Total Value - $1,458.34.  Profit before taxes of $458.34

&amp;#x200B;

**Trader Model**:

Buy BTC at 11/01 average open - you get .07259606 BTC.

11/2 - only .5% gain on HIGH of the day from yesterday, so HOLD

11/3 - 3.6% gain on HIGH from previous day ($14,088.08), so SELL -  $1,033.29 USD

11/4 - BUY on low of $13,550 - .07625536 BTC

11/5 - SELL on HIGH of $15,776.99 - $1,203.08

11/6 - BUY on LOW of $15,193.77 - .07918246 BTC

11/7 - SELL on HIGH of $15,778.66 - $1,249.39

k4s2ta,jabatasu,Network fees for wallet transfer - spending or increase of cost basis?,"Scenario:

Day 1: Purchase 1 BTC for $10,000 on Coinbase

Day 32: Transfer 0.9996645 BTC to HW wallet to empty Coinbase account (1 BTC less 0.0003355 BTC blockchain network fees)

For tax reporting, I seem to have two options, but I'm sure only one of them is ""correct."" Let's assume 1 BTC is worth $10,234 on the day the transfer to HW wallet is made. (a 2.34% gain)

1. Report the 0.000355 blockchain network fees as spending on a service (realizing the 2.34% capital gain since purchase on the 0.000355 BTC spent of $3.63)

2. Report the fee as a sale of 0.000355 BTC at $0 price (realizing a $3.55 capital loss on the 0.000355 which had a $10,000 cost basis)

k5rk5i,Cris850,Help to make GPUs mining farm for altcoin,"Hi everyone, I am trying to make a small gpus farm to mine (about 3, 6 or 8 gpu). I've done a lot of research, but I still have doubts. I appreciate all the comments, they help me a lot.

My main doubts are the power supply cables and whether to buy sata or 6pin risers. The rest does not matter much.

1.I want to buy power supplies and some Riser GPUs. I have seen that from 1 1000W power supply there are too many cables (8-Pin for gpu) and enough for many GPUs. But I have seen that in my power supplies there are only 2 8-pin cables, that is only enough for 1 graphics card, so do all power supplies have many 8-pin cables for various graphics cards, or do I have to connect an adapter or choose a special model?

In other words, I don't know how it is possible to connect so many 8-pin cables to various gpus, if the power supplies I know only have cables for 1 or 2 graphics cards. I also have a modular power supply but I lost the extra cables, I guess it does support a lot of 8-pin cables (I must check)

2. I want to buy the ""GPU Riser: Chipal VER007S Sata"" but I read that I cannot connect more than 2 Gpu riser to the same sata cable. And sata cables are limited. Again, should I buy the sata model (and how could a PSU have many separate sata cables for each riser?) Or should I buy the 6-pin connector model (and again, where do I get that many 6 -pin connectors?)

3.I bought an RX5700 and really liked its mining power, but should I keep buying more RX5700 or is the RX5700XT much better? (I was recommended the XT and on youtube I see that the XT model has more tutorials) however the non-XT model is cheaper and apparently has almost the same mining power.

4.What is the ideal constant temperature for mining on GPUs? (Amd / Nvidia) and the maximum temperature? My idea is to get all the power possible but without overusing it, without degrading the components too quickly. I currently set everything to run at 50 \~ 65 ° C and never allow them to exceed those limits.

5.I have an RTX 2080 Super, it gives me 43Mhs in ETH. But it cost me $ 1600, while the RX5700 gives me 60Mhs in ETH and it was only $ 520. Should I sell the RTX to buy more RX? I think so

It would be great if you can give me tips for buying GPUs (like model, things to consider, etc). Electricity is not expensive so I don't care too much about efficiency, I prefer something cheap and with the highest possible power.

I think those are all my doubts, sorry for asking so many questions, I have researched for days but some things are complicated and would take much longer.",1606974839,4,1

k5rchm,mightyduck19,Tax and reestablishing cost basis,"TLDR: should I sell everything and buy right back to reset my cost basis? 

Long story shorter, I started trading/buying crypto a few years back and didn't really pay much attention to taxes. Unfortunately had to sell *almost* all of it in the middle of 2019 which mean that I had taxable events for 2020. The very small amount I had left after I sold in 2019 was basically what I started with when I started to buy back into BTC much more aggressively in the second half of 2019. Now, I have managed to build up a size-able position again and have tracked all my recent purchases closely but that small position that I never sold is starting to stress me out. The cost basis on that is pretty much a mystery. 

If I sold everything now and bought back I would realize a moderate gain but nothing crazy or eye turning (I think small enough that the government wouldn't waste any time on it). The value here is that my cost basis would be reset and I would basically be clean moving forward from a tax perspective. Conversely, if I just continue to hold and things blow up like I think they will, that mystery cost basis might grow into a much much larger discrepancy in dollar terms a few years down the road. 

I know I could technically re-trace all my transactions on the blockchain, but I made close to 1000 cross asset trades in 2017 and honestly I'm not about to go piece that back together. Just curious to know if anybody else has deal with something similar or has similar concerns.",1606973896,13,1

I just wanted to make sure that all of you guys are using VPNs.

Although TOR makes your IP address anonymous, your ISP can still track your activity.

If you want complete security/anonymity you have to use a VPN that doesn’t keep logs.

I have tried out a ton of them and my favorite is Nord

It has quick speeds, allows unlimited connections, is one of the cheapest, and doesn’t keep logs! Nord is based in Panema so they aren’t legally required to monitor their users or comply with any governments.

So my mom and I had a 8 hour drive across Mexico, and found that a good opportunity to talk about it crypto, it started with how was ""created"" about Satoshi and like a good mom she asked on the go, then when talked about how to you ""earn bitcoin"" so I talked about mining and simply buying from exchanges, here is where she didn't like it, let me explain.

We are used to Fiat, we where born and raised in a economy where our parents only know about USD, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dolar, Pounds, Yens etc, They are not in the idea that we can create a new economy apart from the banks and be safe about it, my mom thought it like I was ""gambling"" and she got a point, we go to casinos and get credit, we go to banks and get credit, we go to stores and get more credit. 

Then she connected everything this way:
The same way stores create credit, casinos sell ships to play, online apps sell powerups and what no, a internet community came together to create the perfect money, money that doesn't involve no bank, no greedy fees, only you and your hard own crypto.

What are the factors that determine competition among producers of mining hardware, who need to engage in R&amp;D in order to improve their equipment?

Is there a fierce competition between the producers, and is there any difference between the products of two high-quality producers?

When it comes to miners, do they immediately upgrade their hardware and try to obtain the best hardware available, or is there a huge variety in the quality of equipment among miners?

1. If I use Electrum Coin Control to freeze those transactions, will it only freeze the dust amount, or will its also freeze the original balance since they share the same address (Electrum manual only talks about freezing addresses, not UTXOs)?

2. If I use Coin Control to send those transactions somewhere else, will they then be decoupled from the original address balance, or can they still track me if I spend the original balance on those addresses that had dust sent to them?",1606962294,6,1

Therefore they do not care to learn how to control their private keys, but rather buy an ETF or another custodial solution. If more and more (traditional) institutions gain control over private keys they could pose a threat to bitcoin’s consensus. Meaning: they will not support the fundamental philosophy of Bitcoin but the interests of themselves. That would not be Bitcoin anymore. Therefore learn how to hold your own keys and tell your peers to do so too.

k6ye26,iamnik77,Seed phrase security - Titanium is like tissue paper,"Self-stewardship aligns with the philosophy of Bitcoin. But it involves wrestling with the problem that your wallet's seed phrase, a small collection of words on a piece of paper, *is* your Bitcoin. A fire-proof safe to hold it might give you peace...so long as the safe is never cracked or stolen. This is the single point of failure problem.

My Bitcoin holdings are paltry, so I don't have the problem of my seed phrase being essentially a million-dollar bill. But security is something I am pondering, especially since a small amount of Bitcoin today could be a small fortune in a few years.

This is one of my first ideas. It involves elementary school math. Many of you are further along, so I'd be interested in your methods. Below is a mock 24-word seed phrase. The top piece of paper contains the 24 words (buried in 36). And the bottom piece of paper with the coordinates is basically the key. 36 words may not seem like much, but they contain 1,251,677,700 different combinations of 24 words.

What are your thoughts? Is this just the same as tearing the paper with the seed phrase in half and storing it in two locations? What is a good way to ensure I (and my beneficiaries) can get to my Bitcoin but those with bad intentions cannot?

Bob has 1 bitcoin. He goes to Newegg to buy a new gaming PC for 2,000 USD. Transaction sales is 10% if he pays with USD. Uncle Sam incentivizes him to pay with Bitcoin by charging him 5% total sales tax.           

If Bob pays with cash, he's paying 2200 USD.              
If Bob pays with bitcoin, he's paying 2100 USD or 0.105 BTC.            

Let's say Bob pays with Bitcoin. 0.1 BTC goes to newegg while 0.005 BTC goes to uncle Sam / the U.S. Treasury.       

Bob is left with 0.895 BTC.

Bob pays nothing to the U.S. Government with regards to the bitcoin blockchain's transaction fee.

Here is what happens: say you have X bitcoins. If you want to withdraw them, Pro Coinbase says the transaction fee will be Y bitcoins. You can click on the ""Max."" button which *should* automatically fill in the ""Amount"" with the X-Y. But it doesn't! It instead fills it with X-Z, where Z is something on the order of 60(!) dollars equivalent. [Meaning, the fee remains what it should be but about 60 dollars' worth will be left on your CB account.] So instead of clicking the ""Max."", you simply put the correct amount (i.e., X-Y) in the ""Amount"" - and... instantly the message appears saying insufficient funds. Which is wrong, of course.

But if one ignores this message, the transaction goes through fine.

k6t12r,coinforward,Are bitcoin and energy the same thing?,"We live in a world that is constantly evolving and that requires a new supply of new energy. The only humanly created product that has changed all human life is the discovery and development of various energy sources. With these, we have made our lives change between the generations and development has made it easier for us to have a more modern and in many cases simpler life. But we have never developed a product that in relation to one to one can be translated into energy, until now.

Bitcoin enables the development of energy where it is needed and not where the resources are available for cheap or simpler logistics. Nor is it dependent on already previously developed areas that, for a fee, send surplus energy to less developed countries or areas.

Mining bitcoin to the same extent that you have energy costs for makes the energy we use free and infinite. We can now use the sun in desert areas, the water at sea, the wind up in the sky to produce enough energy for us to be able to develop enough energy to take the next step in the development of our civilization. What stops the undeveloped world from catching up with food, clean water, sanitary, thereby reducing certain diseases, education and development for all is a constant influx of free energy and a never-ending economic growth is cryptocurrencies. We should use our existing power plants to start producing bitcoin and thus pay for the energy produced, over time and with the halvings / bubbles every four years, we get a surplus of capital that goes back into the system to further develop the energy source. The earth should consist of an infinite number of computers that produce coins and also an infinite number of machines that produce free energy exactly where it is needed.

Big players who will eventually saturate the buying pressure. The fact they aren't panicking and dumping at any price but patiently feeding us tells me that Long term they are expecting much higher levels but this looks like an important top will a pullback to 10-13,000.

k7s53x,satsthestandard,Sats or Bits? Which side are you on for the next unit standard? Why?,"There's an on-going debate currently on twitter about the next standard to use.

Bits and Bitcents:
1 bit = 0.000001 BTC
1 bitcent = 0.00000001 BTC (a.k.a sats)

Approx $ price currently:
1 bit = $0.02
2.5 bits (2 bits and 50 bitcents) = $0.05

vs. 

Sats, KSats etc. 

1 sat = 0.00000001 BTC
1 KSats = 1000 sats

1 sat is approx. $0.0002 right now.

I pretty much into sats but Adam Back pointed out some good points on his tweet thread:

(ATH in Bolivares in Venezuelan currency ""VES"") were traded in Venezuela using LocalBitcoin, that is 233 BTC (last week, lowest since 2018), down from 274. traded volume is a constant USD amount. One BTC is around 19,500,000,000 Bs. Monthly minimum wage is 1.20 USD.","Venezuelan living here updating this week numbers!

We are very far from the 500 BTC weekly we were trading months ago. Even lower than 300 BTC weekly.

The reason (I think) is the value traded in LocalBitcoin is fixed to USD, so as the BTC price goes up the volume gets down.

The trade volume is constant at around 4,500,000 USD weekly. When we were   trading around 500 BTC, price was hovering around 10k. That is why. If BTC price goes up to 45,000 USD for example, around 100 BTC would be traded weekly.

Remember, this is only measured by LocalBitcoin (For sure the biggest exchange here).

You will forever, without any doubt, unquestionably be in the top 1% of bitcoin owners. Whether it moons to $300k or drops to $30. At the very least... you will be in the top 1%!

Simple math involved to follow. Also, this does not take into account that only 18.5 million coins are in circulation today or the fact that Satoshi holds a million of those. Or the fact that probably over a million coins are lost forever. All this takes into account is 21 million coins ever and a current world population of 7.7 billion people. Of course that number should go up so unless the population drops vastly, hodling 0.25 BTC means you are in the 1%. Welcome to the club kid! 

21,000,000 coins divided by 0.25 = 84,000,000

in other words, there are 84 million 0.25 segments of the 21 million.

84,000,000 divided by the population of 7,700,000,000 = 0.01090909...  

Boom! All you have to do is be one of the 84,000,000 segments with 0.25 BTC and you will forever be in the Top 1% of bitcoin owners. Yup, forever!  **FOR-EV-ER!**

k7jphz,Delicious_Context_53,The 20k Stag Hunt,"Alright you bastards listen up. Everyone is hesitating to buy at 20k because they are afraid they’ll be buying into a peak and it will plummet right after.

So it dips a bit and we buy a bit, and it creeps back up. 

In game theory we are trapped in something like a Stag Hunt game. It is not as famous as its older brother the Prisoner’s Dilemma. In it, you have two hunters who can either trust each other and cooperate to hunt a stag, or be timid and go with the safe play and hunt a hare. If A hunts a hare and B hunts a stag, A gets a hare and B goes hungry. If they both hunt hare they both catch hare. But if they cooperate and both hunt for a stag, then they catch a stag and it’s worth like 10x a hare. 

The key difference here is that doing the other players aren’t incentivized to screw you over if you try to hunt the stag. They are incentivized to help you hunt the stag. 

So if your strategy is to DCA and the price is close to 20k, just stick to the plan and don’t change it up. That’s what I’m gonna do, even if it’s at 20,052. 

Because breaking past the sell wall at 20k is the way to catch a meaty fucking stag.

k8vgmu,graydogstudios,Think bitcoin is overvalued? Right this,"So far in 2020 ALONE, the US government has printed:

$6,000,000,000,000 

Bitcoin total market cap (at 21 Bitcoin) is:

 $403,146,037,857 

... or roughly 6% of all the money that was printed THIS YEAR SO FAR ALONE. We aren't counting money that was already printed, old debt (total debt is set to hit 30 TRILLION soon), other loans, etc.

In a single month, the government printed (aka created out of thin air) more US dollars than the dollar market cap of bitcoin. Of course, we aren't even considering the 3M-4M bitcoins that are lost forever.

Now, keep in mind that estimates show roughly $100B were invested in bitcoins so far. This includes trading fees, electricity to run miners, buying cryptominers, etc. 

For instance, the S19 pro is $2k and mines at 110TH/s. Total hash rate is around 135 MILLIONS TH/s, let's round it up to a nice 1 million S19 pro. Of course there are older, less effecient, more expensive machines mining, but let's go for a minimum scenario: this implies roughly $2B has been spent for mining machines alone. We aren't counting electricity, maintenance, renting spaces, PSU, etc, and we aren't counting machines that broke and need to be replaced, shipping, time to run all this, etc.

As a comparison, some people have been mining for 10 years now, and those machines rarely last more than 3-4 years, if that. Some people only run them for a year.

All this to say, those people who invested all that money (including building full power plants, and some cryptomining companies buying HUGE warehouse for millions) don't think bitcoin is valueless, or overvalued. Nobody buys a small cap, risky stock at $10 hoping to resell it for $40; they buy it at $10 hoping to resell it for $600+ (see: Tesla).

MicroStrategy is raising 400M to buy bitcoins; they don't seem to think it's overvalued neither. And neither is Paypal, Square, etc.

Even if you absolutely hate bitcoin, there is no way in hell it's overvalued at $400B. Tesla alone is now valued at $600B and there is no way a currency that is borderless, decentratlized, semi-anonymous, secure, fast, safe, used worldwide (Venezuela, India, Brazil, even Africa!) is worth less than ONE car company selling roughly 500,000 cars a year, period.",1607394515,3,1

But, this would also imply that the US government would be the largest holder of BTC, as it would have no incentive to sell said BTC, unless it really wanted to. 

So, is this an issue at all?  Are there any potential ""attack vectors"" from the government offering the highest fees to miners, and miners only accepting  Fed payments as an example?  If the government owned more than half of all BTC, are there any issues there?

Thoughts?",1607393991,11,1
k8v3h4,OGKebabEater,An Island Nation with Bitcoin as the currency," 

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

While there's been some gains in the last week, I'm second guessing myself about not about not using that money to buy more btc.  Now I know that no one knows what will happen tomorrow with either, I'm curious to know what those of you here who have more knowledge and experience than me would do in my situation; hang in to the Moderna or sell and buy more btc.

THEN, after they conversation (if you can call it that) moves to a point where they are prompted to consider the fact that they are currently using a centralized digital currency already (the $), and that Bitcoin essentially represents opposition to such a dystopian future, they shit on it further by appealing to some bullshit like ""Well the bible says the devil will rule the world, so...""  


Now, I was raised conservative Christian, and frankly, this kind of (what, deliberate ignorance?) scares the shit out of me. It's like there is a huge swathe of the (American, among others) population who almost relish ignorance about the potential of decentralized currency. The people I've talked to reject it because they don't understand it AND because anything that could thwart a dystopian world ruled by centralized banks MUST (because Bible) be wrong. The end times are coming... so Bitcoin must be a fool's errand. It's the most pronounced kind of explicit disregard for the potential of this technology that I've come across, and it seems widespread, in my experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a weird issue that I thought was fixed a few years back with Bitcoin wallet to reduce fees. I guess not, or I am missing something...

&amp;#x200B;

My wallet received a transaction for the amount of  [0.54530200 BTC](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3JbNMb2Vpn5k6eCmDUDdRqnm5ke1otL9E1), yet when I  went and sent [0.51986042 BTC](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/81e681e4d7ed58a7645b3d8ae38c584e14954c359e3db8788b5ef645d65e9e64) out using ***bitcoin-cli sendtomany*** to 16 outputs, the wallet used **856 inputs** to send the amount that was available and cleared with at least 400+ confirmations in the first address.

&amp;#x200B;

The above TX cost me  0.03600705 BTC to send when it should have cost me a fraction of the amount had it used the address that contained the closest amount to the amount it's sending out...

Bitcoint-cli version 0.19.1

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas what I could be doing wrong or what I could be missing?",1607385535,8,1
k8sqv9,x2c3v4b5,Best Practices - Cold Storage Wallet,"Greetings everyone,

Let me preface my question and plan by introducing myself. I am a traditional buy and hold forever investor. Currently, I invest half of my paycheque every paycheque into index funds as well as wide economic moat companies and I will continue to do so until I retire/die. 

However, I have recently begun researching heavily into the crypto world and the more I research, the more evident it is to me that this stuff has a lot of value. As such, I have begun purchasing Bitcoin every two weeks as well and I have a Ledger Nano X for cold storage.

My plan is to have a 5-10% asset allocation of Bitcoin in my overall investment portfolio because this is what I am most comfortable with. I will continue to buy both asset classes every two weeks with zero respect for volatility and hold forever because I am very long-term minded.

Now, with that said, I want to implement the best practice possible in terms of executing cold storage. Currently, I have a old used laptop. I plan on formatting that laptop and turning off the network card (so that it cannot connect to the internet). Then, I will solely use that laptop to generate a new receiving address for my cold storage wallet every two weeks when I withdraw my coins from the exchange. Basically, my cold storage wallet will never be connected to a computer with an internet connection.

Please let me know if this is a good practice to implement, if it will work, if it is too extremist, or if I can improve. I have no intent on using the coins. I am not trying to day trade. I am not trying to get rich quick. Please let me know your thoughts. 

Thanks,

I just wanted to make sure that all of you guys are using VPNs.

Every website you access can see your IP address which can be tracked down to your exact coordinates.

If you want complete security/anonymity you have to use a VPN that doesn’t keep logs.

VPNs make you 99% anonymous by changing your IP address.

I have tried out a ton of them and my favorite is Nord

It has quick speeds, allows unlimited connections, is one of the cheapest, and doesn’t keep logs! Nord is based in Panama so they aren’t legally required to monitor their users or comply with any governments.

Here is a link to an amazing review of NordVPN: [https://therightvpn.com/NordVPNReview](https://therightvpn.com/NordVPNReview)

Happy surfing and stay safe!

People ask me everyday “Julian, how do i see success?!” And my answer is simple... “Solve more problems, help more people, and innovate!” I’ll be the first person to tell you that this might be easier said than done... as it was for me when I was $20,000 in debt. at one point all I wanted was to drive nice cars and travel to exotic places... and accumulate materialistic things..but that type of motivation only got me so far!  I hit a LID in my income when money goals were the only focus. I remember being 20k in debt and finding it in myself to shift my focus on helping others learn how to build a digital business.. I put together a plan to cater to customers and make sure biz partners and customers had the best experiences. I decided to solve more problems whether it was in the industry I was in or whether it was people’s problems that I could help them get through.. I also decided to innovate with marketing tactics and businesses.  Again, It was difficult to make that shift but in the long run it’s paid off. It’s one of the reasons why I’m still in business today and everything is scaling up. Try and shift your focuses TODAY.  The materialistic and monetary success will undoubtedly come your way if you can zone in on the right focuses.",1607381531,1,1

2. Should I use a 25th word or a passphrase to my 24 word seed? I've heard its for advanced users only so should be careful while using it.

I bought for the first time about 1.5 years ago because like most of us here, **I like the idea of a decentralized currency very much**. Since then I haven't been able to buy more but **I would like to start buying regularly again**, even if I don't buy much at a time.

I've used coinbase so far but  since I am a lot concerned with my privacy too, I am much annoyed by the fact that they require my ID, and I had to make a transfer to their bank in estonia just to be able to buy more BTC (otherwise my identity isn't proven according to them...).

I could deal with it but *now they are asking me how much I plan to trade per year, and what is my field of industry*. According to Coinbase it's required by my gov. and if I don't provide the info, I'll be blocked from trading on January 8th... To me, this is not at all compatible with the idea I have of BTC ""philosophy"".

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm planning on using TOR for any BTC related matter from now on, and I'm looking for an honest alternative that allows me to buy bitcoin and transfer it to my wallet without having to lay down my personal data.

My initial strategy was to keep this other 17k for other investments to diversify more as I'm young,.

My monthly salary from my job covers my rent and all my outgoings, with plenty left over to save atleast 1000 bucks a month. I don't really have any major debt.  I wanted to utilize the other 17k for investments such as 10k for a mortgage on a flat to rent out for extra income, and 7k to split between investments into company's and for a day trading account to slowly move into from paper trading. 

So I can most definitely get by and survive without this 17k, and now I am debating whether to buy 10k of bitcoin now whilst it's dipped a little, and buy the the other 7k when I get it soon, because the price will go up. Or wether to wait to get the 7k and buy it all at once, hoping that it will dip more throughout December.

kayf8q,Majestic_Bit_5821,It's time to put PoW (Proof-of-Work) to bed!,"Simply put, Proof of Work is the first, and arguably the most robust and secure, consensus mechanism that first grabbed the world's attention in the last decade with the sky-rocketing popularity of the mega-star of the crypto world 'Bitcoin'. With a market cap of close to USD 350 Billion out of a total estimated crypto-market cap of USD 555 Billion, at the time of writing as per coinmarketcap.com, Bitcoin is the undisputed star attraction of the brave new world of cryptocurrency and DeFi. PoW has had a big hand to play in this, by giving the anonymous and trustless world of crypto, the very important attributes of trust, security and credibility, that we value so much, when dealing with our hard-earned money. It has pulled Bitcoin, and as an extension the whole of crypto, from its cocoon of arcane and mystery, to the legitimacy and dependability of real-world, mainstream economics. But in this world of belatedly increasing awareness of the global environmental crisis, has the computationally dense and power-guzzling PoW mechanism overstayed its welcome?

Proof of Work is a consensus mechanism used to build trust in the anonymous world of crypto. Each new block or addition of value in a blockchain, which creates the immutable history of all the transactions happening in bitcoin all over the world in a distributed ledger, has to be validated by this mechanism. This ledger hasn't been hacked even once, even in this terrifying new world of quantum computing. Why is that? Simply because it is almost impossible to replicate the amount of computational energy required by PoW for each block formation, in an attack that would additionally require more than 51% of the millions of nodes/participants to collude and use unfathomable amount of computational power to regenerate each proceeding block, from the block of first change, within a short time frame of 10 mins. PoW is what gives crypto its trust, immutability and transparency, unseen in the world of legacy finance and world economics, which is still dependent on gargantuan behemoths like banks and central banks to provide that.

However, in order to achieve this PoW, just the Bitcoin blockchain uses around 0.2% of total global energy, while the value share of Bitcoin in the Total Global Economy stands at 0.002%. This is simply untenable if bitcoin and crypto-currency has to become truly mainstream and realize its full potential of making wealth truly democratic, equitable and accessible to all. No more concentration of power, wealth and influence in the hands of a select few.

Besides being as far away from being ""Green"", as anything I can think of, PoW has also become the biggest roadblock in crypto achieving its aforementioned goal. When bitcoin was just another new fad for the adventurous and tech-savvy millennials in the early 2010s, anyone with a decent GPU on his PC could download the bitcoin client and participate in mining Bitcoins, thereby earning bitcoins as mining rewards. That was when the no. of nodes on the bitcoin network was in a few hundreds and the total computational power required by PoW was still within the reach of the common man, so to speak. Now with the computational power requirements in the network for mining having risen exponentially, PoW has given rise to centralization, the very nemesis blockchain set out to conquer. It has given birth to mining pools; massive mining farms with thousands of ASICs, accompanied by endless cooling towers, all lined up to do only one thing; keep computing the hash gazillion times till the PoW for a block is complete. This has taken mining out of the reach of the common man or cybergeek, piggy-backing on whom bitcoin became the behemoth it is today. This has led to a handful of entities spread across the US, Europe and China having close to a monopoly on bitcoin mining and hence the entire network. Profitability provided by the economies of scale that these mining pools enjoy has made centralization inevitable.

These issues have not gone unnoticed by the crypto-community. Pioneers in the field have dabbled with consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Stake, Proof-of-Use, Proof-of-Elapsed Time, Proof-of-Authority, and many more. Ethereum 2.0, the blockchain with Ether as its native currency, the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, is moving into PoS from PoW in the near future, for example. However, we as a community of forward-thinkers have yet to come up with a consensus mechanism which marries the security and reliability of PoW while shunning its tendencies of centralization and incomprehensible wastage of electrical power. Yet, we cannot wait for a panacea of consensus mechanism to magically appear, for us to finally do away with the expensive and increasingly morally-hazardous PoW. It has overstayed its welcome and has to go now.

Bitcoin, with the headstart it has had and the network effect that has eventually kicked in, will remain the leader and most-valued crypto for the foreseeable future. Hence, the onus is on it to lead us into the unknown but exciting new future. The relative centralization of the network should work in its favour by making quicker decision-making possible. It should shun PoW in favour of a new consensus mechanism, which is more in tune with the realities of the new decade. ",1607672719,8,1

The information they are asking for, I plainly just don't have anymore. I got into bitcoin 7+ years ago purchasing with cash at localbitcoin Australia for my first bitcoins.   
I then tried trading some and due to emotional and nooby calls I lossed a lot of bitcoin and decided to leave them in the exchange for years, ultimately forgetting about them.

Now they're asking me this, I have no freaking clue and more importantly why the fuck should I even comply?

All I can say is i'm glad I don't have any funds with them anymore, obviously they won't be happy with my reply then what, they freeze my account and what ever bitcoins I have with them?

Very confused bittrex user, any insight would be much appreciated.

kau3b8,CertainCoat,After all bitcoins are mined what would stop miners introducing large minimum fees.,It seems the future of bitcoin mining will feature large pools. At the moment there is an incentive for large pools to keep bitcoin running smoothly because they get rewarded in bitcoin for mining. Anything that would harm the value of bitcoin would harm their reward. When things transition to them making money from fees though there is no longer such an incentive and they could say introduce a minimum fee of 200 dollars and refuse to include any transaction other than that. In a free market other miners will move to such a pool as that will be the pool with the greatest reward. This would seem to introduce a market where fees are set optimally for the miner at the absolute highest the market will bear.,1607655131,35,1

(OTCQB: SMME ) in light of the payments and credit card industry move into adopting crypto currency technology to facilitate payments SmartMetric has now moved forward its planed release of its crypto key storage technology for use with credit and debit cards.
“For a number of years we have been working on an engineered solution to bring together the power of biometric card based security, large scale encrypted memory incorporated into an existing credit and debit card format, said today SmartMetric’s President &amp; CEO, Chaya Hendrick.”
Now that one of the major payment cards networks has announced its move into Government approved stable crypto SmartMetric is now able to offer a card platform that has embedded inside the card a biometric fingerprint scanner for validating the card user and automatically given the validated user access to the encrypted crypto keys stored inside the new SmartMetric Crypto Payments Card.
The SmartMetric Crypto Card solution has its own crypto key secure element inside the card protected by firewalled encryption.   This allows for the safe storage on the card of encrypted crypto keys in a highly functional manner.  
SmartMetric has built inside its crypto payments card significant memory along with a crypto engine inside a secure element chip separate from the secure element used to perform credit and debit card transactions.  By having two separated firewalled secure elements we are able to provide a much higher security than current card architecture provides while also providing greater memory and added encryption power.",1607649597,0,1

I signed up, verified my identity, and placed an order of BTC for a small amount to give it a try. 2 days passed and they sent an email saying my account needs to be verified by placing an order using wire transaction before I can do anything else. In other words, “pay $25 in fees to your bank if you wanna buy bitcoins with us.” At least Kraken does not have this catch and Kraken let its users know beforehand that they only accept wire transfer to deposit and withdraw. I checked my bank account yesterday and it turns out that after 3 days they debited my money from my bank account and I can’t get my bitcoins out of Gemini because I have to verify my identity placing an order through wire transfer, I can’t even sell my bitcoins to Gemini because I have to verify my identity. However, they CAN take money from my account without me “verifying” my identity first?

I submitted several tickets throughout these days and they only replied 1 time with an automated message.

I don't know how is that Gemini is recommended here so much when someone complains about other exchanges because based on my experience they have been the worst exchange so far. Maybe is my fault for not assuming all the comments here recommending Gemini are paid comments.",1607648211,6,1

Introducing Portfolio View - The simplest yet STILL POWERFUL crypto tracker and portfolio manager.

It has ALL the features that you could ever need from a crypto tracker: your portfolio balance in any currency, a view of the price and price changes change of all the cryptocurrencies, price graphs for all the coins, our Portfolio profit and loss for various time frames, a transaction adding system and alert system and the list goes on but the key difference is that Portfolio View somehow manages to stay SIMPLE AS F\*\*\*. Not just simple, but also looks absolutely amazing (in my opinion).

Not only that but it's also stupidly fast. Like seriously as soon as you click the app icon, everything is loaded. As soon as you click a coin, the price chart is up!

It's only available on iOS (for now) sorry Android users. Here's the link to the website and the app download, go check it out!!!!

kbsis2,Crypto__bull,Coinbase basket portfolio thesis,"Coinbase crypto basket portfolio thesis

My thesis here is to a allocate / diversify across all of Coinbase offerings, and adding to / reallocating as Coinbase releases new coins.  BTC, ETH, LTC and XRP would have the highest allocations, with BTC being the largest.

The main reason for this thesis is that I believe that coins on Coinbase will perform better than others (generally speaking), as these coins will be more accessible to NEW MONEY, as crypto becomes more mainstream, and more mass adoption occurs.  Noobs will see new “cheap” coins, and want to get in on them

I’ll refer to this as the “Coinbase basket” of currencies

It could look something similar to this:

Let’s say you have $10k:

BTC: 20%
ETH: 15%
LTC: 7%
XRP: 7%
Random Coinbase coin #1: 2.5%
2nd random: 2.5%
3rd random: 2.5%
Etc ....
20th random: 2.5%
(Assuming there are 20 random coins, this # has been going up for many years)
Total of 100%

You will need to adjust these %s, as Coinbase releases new coins, to shave the gains off of the coins that have risen more, to fund the purchase of the newly released coins ... trying to keep with this target % strategy...

Reason being I believe in this theses is as mass adoption begins, Coinbase will be at the forefront, and all of the sheep will be buying up every cheap coin they can find....

Thoughts?  Flaws??

Skip the “don’t keep your coins on an exchange” type comments, because this Coinbase basket is totally separate from a core HODL position which is held in proper manner

kbs2mn,CryptoMillennials,Bitcoin Midterm Idea/ Possible Buyzones,"Too many times, i´ve read the question, where to buy bitcoin conveniently! 

This is what i think, what TA might suggest. Don´t take my word for granted and kindly do your own research alongside reading my idea. Knowledge is Power! :)

Bitcoin suggests a bearish shortterm bias. We can´t see all too many buyers on current levels. If Bitcoin fails at our local resistance, our first Support is probably going to get tested. On the first support we could be in for a bullish bounce, however, if it breaks down there, we are probably in for testing our second support zone.

Most desired buyzone would be the golden pocket zone below 13,7k, but bitcoin might not retrace fully in the current bulltrend, and bulls are in theory expected to step in prior to the 0.618 fib.

It is hardly ever recommended to catch knifes, although if bitcoin meets the second support zone, i will happily ladder some orders nearby, and also keep some cash in case we visit lower levels.

At that point is it not a question of technical analysis, but if we believe in bitcoin as an assets in the closer future. And if we do, an even lower price shouldn´t be much of a concern, we will be able to buy more, and wait for the next move to the upside.",1607791018,0,1

One way to stop a 51% attack is creating a new fork leading the attacker in losing billions of dollars invested to perform that attack. How is that fork created? Who creates that fork?

Since I have been reading all those ""fairytales"" about finding forgotten BTC on old USB drives, I sometimes find myself trying hard to remember if I maybe DID in fact hear about Bitcoin 5 or 10 years ago and even bought/received some. 

I of course realize that at least with me this is not the case. I have indeed heard about Bitcoin a few years ago but I have never sought out to buy or otherwise get ahold of it.

Or maybe have I? 

Sometimes it's fun to let your imagination loose. 

5-10 years is a long time. I sometimes don't even remember things that happened a year ago. 

Maybe I bought/received BTC at such a time when it was so much a vague and funny thing that my conscious mind didn't even bother to record the fact. 

I searched for the word ""bitcoin"" in my mail for clues. What if I stumble upon some confirmation email of a purchase or installing an app on my iPhone? 

Not surprisingly, I didn't find anything. But it wasn't such a long shot.

kbniv6,reddito321,Pro tip: store your seed with a simple scramble algorithm,"After seeing the case of the guy whose wife had access to the seed and fell for the phishing scam, here goes a pro tip:

Save your seed with a scramble algorithm. For instance, you can write the words in a different order:

Real seed: 1,2,3,4,...,23,24
Written seed: 2,1,4,3,...,24,23

It’s simple enough for you to remember and strong enough to provide you an additional security layer if someone by any chance has access to it.

If you want to take precautions on the after-death, give a person you trust (e.g. your son) the algorithm and another, completely different person (e. g. your daughter), the seed. You can leave instructions to the seed holder to look for the algorithm holder etc.

I would not put a wife/loving partner as a person of trust on this matter. After you’ve come to my age, you’ve seen enough divorce cases in what you thought was the perfect couple. Sometimes nothing necessarily bad happens for the couple to break up, simply the love comes to an end (wonder if this isn’t bad enough...). Your kids, au contraire, will always be your kids.

Stay safe you’all. It’s a pleasure to be part of this community.",1607771762,18,1

I wasn’t quite sure where to post this, as I looked for a specific ‘Western Union’ sub and found one but it isn’t very active, and I thought people who utilize Bitcoin possibly have also utilized Western Union before. Maybe? Haha.

For the last year and a half or so, I’ve been sending money to 4 people in Mexico - long story short my cousin’s ex-wife who is now my best friend and my ‘nephew’ moved back to Mexico from the US two years ago and I’ve been sending them some money about once a month to make their financial situation a bit better.

I went to send a Western Union, like I usually do, and it said the transaction was declined, which has never happened before. They sent me a “Global reinstatement form” to fill out, which asked me all sorts of personal questions - full name, address, DOB,
Employer, etc. They then asked for a bank statement, a paystub, and a copy of my passport.

Since WU is obviously a pretty well-known and federally regulated company, I didn’t think too much of it. But now, after hitting send, I’m realizing I sent a company my bank account number, passport number, SSN, etc. I am starting to get a little freaked out that they asked for so much personal info and now anyone on WU’s end could open it and take whatever info they wanted...

Anyways; 1. Is it typical for Western Union to ask for all of that personal info? I assume it’s because WU sees quite a bit of fraud via Nigerian Princes asking little old ladies for large sums of money? 2. Will there be any issues getting my account “reinstated”? I can’t imagine there’s any issue with me sending money to my family/friends in Mexico? It’s not really any of the company’s business why I’m sending money, is it? Trust me, I’d use Venmo or Cash App if Mexico actually utilized either.

Backup your 2FA keys, security phrases and all login details!","PSA: I've seen this come up multiple times for exchanges (and again today to someone who lost access to his account and can't get it back), wallets and others so this is just a reminder to everyone as many seem to overlook this. 

BACKUP YOUR 2FA KEYS!
BACKUP YOUR SECURITY PHRASES
BACK UP EVERYTHING (including the emails your account is connected to etc) 

The reason you set up 2FA is for additional security so people can't pretend to be you. Companies or exchanges you have your crypto on will be very hesitant to give out account access to someone who doesn't have it (just because you formatted or lost your phone etc), so don't expect it to be a simple chat with customer service. Otherwise technically any person who can get access to some of your personal docs may be able to contact and pretend to be you. And if its a private wallet it's even more difficult. BACK. UP. EVERYHTING. 

Whichever way you want to do it, whether it's physically written down somewhere, or your authenticator app set up on a separate phone and so on, you NEED BACKUPS. 

Remember, in the past you had banks to hold your money for you. In crypto, you are the bank, so you have to be more organized with your access and security details.

I had a similar issue with coinbase a while back which ended up working out, although it did take a few weeks and a lot of work. Otherwise weren't as lucky. BACK IT UP!",1607935155,19,1

kcmult,Jonah7154,How do these Consensus Mechanisms Apply?,"So I have been doing research attempting to understand the concepts of proof of work and proof of stake systems. I have some overall questions that apply to both and some for each individual system.

To start with the general questions, how is consensus actually reached? All of the explanations that I've read just simply state because of (staked tokens/computing power) the network reaches consensus on the transactions. Do all of the miners/validators keep track of all of the transactions within that block and then compare? How do these validators/miners keep track of all of the transactions? How do the validators/miners know if transactions are fraudulent?

For proof of work systems, does the computing power simply work to solve ""computational puzzles"" and continue the blockchain, or is that computing power also put into collecting an individual ledger of the transactions within that block (and then compared to reach consensus at the end of the block)?

For the proof of stake system, how is it ensured that the fees accrued by mining the block are lower than the amount staked by the validator? Is consensus reached by comparing each individual's block and using the most common ledger?

Lastly, how would a 51% attack work in each scenario? I know for PoW the attacker would have to have &gt;50% of the computing power, and for PoS the attacker would have to have &gt;50% of the staked tokens, but what is the practicality of something like this happening in each system. If all the miners do is validate transactions, wouldn't they only have the power of creating blocks that deny certain transactions? They couldn't give themselves free coins because they don't have access to the private keys. Right? What exactly could a 51% attack do and why?",1607906779,5,1

kdsn2b,dannywitz,Prediction Game: What will the price of BTC be at 8pm on Sunday (12/20) ? Closest-to-the-pin wins the pool! Prize target is 0.1 BTC!,"Prediction Game:

Steps:

1. Make a prediction of what you think the price of BTC will be on the above date and time, and send the entry fee of 0.00025 BTC, to this address: bc1qd95v8ctctssawv5uzznzywcqcw56lc5ukdqclv
2. Then PM me your price prediction, and the wallet address you sent your entry from, and I will put in your entry.
3. Whoever’s prediction is closest to the actual number wins the pool!
4. Prize target is 0.1 BTC to the winner
5. The winning wallet will be announced in the comments

Please read the expanded rules. 

**Expanded Rules** 

1. The Winner will be whichever prediction is closest to the price of Bitcoin(BTC), on 8 pm EST on Friday 2/18/2020, as determined by the price of BTC, here: “https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin”
2. Entry fee is 0.00025 BTC. Please send exactly this amount.  If you send less than this amount by accident, then you can send a second transaction with the balance of the entry fee, and I will put in your entry.  If you send more than the amount by accident, I will refund you anything over and above the entry fee, and put in your entry.  There will be no other refunds for entry fees other than that.
3. The Prize target is 0.1 BTC, but the actual prize amount depends on how many people participate and it may be lower, or higher. 
4. This probably doesn’t need to be said, but be careful where you send your entry fee, if you send it to the wrong wallet, I obviously can’t put in your entry, or give you a refund.
5. The winner will win 100% of the pool minus(-) an administrative fee of 0.00002 BTC per entry (it takes time to enter this stuff into a spreadsheet, and manage drawing mechanics, etc.)
6. The maximum number of entries is 500
7. This is not an investment of any kind, and I will make no guarantees of any kind for returns/losses.  I will do my best to guarantee that the game is fair and transparent, but it is a game, and it’s for entertainment purposes only.  If you put in your entry fee, and your prediction is closest to the actual number (based on the measuring method stipulated, e.g. “BTC price as reported by Coinbase”, etc), you will win the pool. If your prediction is not the closest, you will lose your entry fee.  That’s it.
8. The pool prize amount depends on participation
9. We are all responsible for our own taxes

For example, if you wanted a multisig for spending immediately, plus a timelocked key as a failsafe.  They used Liquid's key policy as an example of that -- five-of-nine plus two keys usable only after two years had passed without movement.

First, I know bitcoins are mined by computers solving math problems (correct me if I'm wrong please), but why do people receive bitcoins for that? Why is resolving specific math problems worth money?

Second, Where does bitcoin come from. I don't really understand the concept of it, it's a piece of software but where is the software is there a database with all of the information? 

Third, what are bitcoin blocks and blockchain?

Fourth, I know the number of bitcoins that can be mined is  21 million in total. Why this specific number and where does the bitcoin come from? Imagine that I'm the creator of bitcoin and have access to the software, what stops me from giving myself a ton of bitcoins and then just sell it? If it's a software, it can certainly be hacked or altered right?

Finally, is the bitcoin market unstable?  Is there someone making huge profits from bitcoin(like bankers make a profit from banks)? And will eventually crash and everybody looses it's money like happened to  Lehman Brothers in 2008?

I feel there are a lot of people that are thinking that *'this is it, my FINAL chance to jump onboard the rocket',* YOLOing all of their money and chucking it in. Heck, even I will hold up my hands and say that this was me before I went to bed, contemplating taking out all of my savings and just yeeting it at BTC. I was trying to do the math on the possible ROI if it were to go to 100k and beyond 🚀. It's a good job I've got the willpower to see sense.

With there also being the increase of news coverage, now you have every Joe Blogg, your Dad, Uncle Steven, Karen from the office and even your Nan in here grave receiving mainstream coverage of BTC hitting new highs and telling them that Crypto is the space to invest.

Although this is a very exciting movement, this is really dangerous territory for FOMO newcomers and even regular crypto buyers. Just a word of warning to all of you who maybe don't have as much willpower, don't go pumping your life savings in on this bull run,

However, I'm also a closet bitcoiner and couldn't resist sending him some bitcoin for christmas (a small amount but more than I would usually give as a christmas present.

How will I get him engaged into the cryptospace most effectively? He can obv. do whatever he wants with the coins but I was thinking i'd suggest him I keep the passphrase somewhere secure but have him store the pin code to the device. 

Now, he can't really go to an exchange to cash out due to being underage but I'm afraid he'll start trading shitcoins once he finds out about swapping services etc. and will eventually lose his coins and interest or worse, lose his coins to a scam. So I'm also contemplating keeping the pin and the passphrase to myself so he can add bitcoin to the account but isn't able to spend them until he's 18.

&gt;  
&gt;Around this time everyone was talking about micro-transactions and for once the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model to consensus was actually becoming the popular option, even though for years prior it was rejected for having been no less centralised than any other traditional institution.  
&gt;  
&gt;I was never a fan of PoS and still, to this day, it’s not an option I would personally be satisfied with. This is because...

In this article I describe the thought process as to how I created a digital currency targeted at the application of instant real-time micro-transactions, which has been running for almost two years to date.

* Transparant
* Reduced economic complexity. All those middleman in our current financial system are not nessecary.

Everyone here is concentrating on the function of store of wealth. However, when we all store our savings in bitcoin, inclusive companies and institutional institurions, the wish to exchange with it will grow.

* First between financial institutions
* Then between companies
* Then between companies and consumers
* Then between consumers
* Then between iot devices and companies
* Then between iot devices and consumers
* Then between iot devices

kfshzh,robgraves,Noob question about dust and fees.,"So I've recently decided that I'm going to start Dollar Cost Averaging and and buying Bitcoin say every week for the long term.  I also recently acquired a hardware wallet.  So all of these small bitcoin purchases of say $20 or $25 a week I'm assuming would be considered dust and such my hardware wallet would slowly acquire multiple inputs, say 52 a year of $20 or $25 worth each time say times 10 years is 520 different small inputs.  The impression I got from another thread I read (specifically this one from MyCelium: https://www.reddit.com/r/mycelium/comments/6lwwq2/faq_why_are_my_fees_so_high/)     Is that this could potentially get costly in fees if I ever wanted to send all of those inputs to my hardware wallet out.  Is that accurate?  Would it be better for me then to say save up a bunch from each month or couple months and buy more in bulk?

khs4gj,zorg621,Silver versus Bitcoin?,"Before beginning, just know I use lots of run on sentences so the thoughts may be hard to follow. 

I wanted to spark up a debate. I've been a long time believer in silver due to a number of reasons. It's industrial usage, the pairing to gold throughout history as a store of value and hedge against inflationary government fiat currencies, it's physical verifiable nature and durability, and a variety of other things. 

I believe in bitcoin for a number of the same reasons. I hold silver, bitcoin, and just a teeny bit of gold. Recently with the rise in prices of both, I'm contemplating selling much of my numismatic coins for more Bitcoin. Silver is excellent, I love the appearance and feeling and physical nature of it. However it also has many drawbacks. It's extremely cumbersome to own and transport. I frequently have nightmares of someone breaking in and stealing my silver coins, and while they are relatively secure the fear still exists. Bitcoin is much easier to secure in my opinion, especially with the use of multi-sig. Silver is extremely difficult to transport and it's super heavy in bulk quantities and subject to seizure and theft. It's also very obvious you have something you're transporting, whereas with bitcoin that's not necessarily the case. The fear of being unable to verify the current supply of silver not only on our earth, but in the known universe, is horrifying. With the rapid advancements in space exploration as well as technology here on earth I fear that silver will be as plentiful as sand like the winklevoss twins discussed. I also fear that even though the perth mint claims they won't make any more of these rare numismatic coins that there isn't much stopping them from doing so anyway (other than a reputation hit) and crushing the numismatic value. 

Silver would have great benefit in a true shit hits the fan scenario. In an apocalyptic event where bitcoin is unusable because of an EMP blast, destruction of the internet, or destruction of electricity (there are things like the blockstream satellite and ability to transmit over radio waves but I'm discussing a reality where btc is COMPLETELY gone), I can see silver becoming the new bartering tool alongside consumables. That is the only scenario I can see silver being a better inflation hedge than bitcoin. 

Honestly though if we enter a reality where we are essentially forced back into the dark ages for a few generations and it's a constant fight for survival and we don't have electricity or the internet, I'm not sure survival is worth the constant grind and I probably wouldn't want to continue surviving anyway. 

I am not going to sell all of my silver, but I think I would like to convert 70-80% into bitcoin. Any benefits to silver over bitcoin that I missed?",1608590484,10,1

Does anyone have any legit theories on who the inventors are?  I find it hard to believe this was invented by one guy.  My theory is that some Central Banks created it, possibly through an organization like the Bank for International Settlements.

For some reason there is this false notion that Central Banks hate crypto currency, or that they hate bitcoin.  It's really not true... they've been planning to completely replace the financial system with Cryptocurrencies.  For Central Banks, Governments, and the financial sector, having the ability to earmark, and track currency is a massive advantage.  

Central Banks envision cryptocurrencies that have the ability to be ""earmarked"", or only used for certain things.

Want to donate money to Sudan, but scared it will fall into warlords' hands?  Problem solved.  You give the government crypto marked to only be used on essentials.  And you can track the crypto to see how it was used.

Same thing on a microeconomic level.  Government wants to give aid/subsidies to poor people.  But they don't want them to buy crack cocaine with it.  So, they get crypto earmarked for only food, or essentials.  And, if someone makes a business of taking all of this earmarked crypto, and exchanging it for non earmarked... they'll get caught, because it's all on the permanent blockchain record, and would be easy to pick up with monitoring programs.

I really want to get into bitcoin at some point.  But my fear is that one day Central Banks in unison are going to announce their rival cryptos.  And Bitcoin will collapse into irrelevancy... only becoming relevant for people doing illegal things, and investors who want to gamble.

I think Bitcoin's days are numbered.  It is going to be seen as a dinosaur... a pioneer, but outdated.  It'll still be useful in illegal markets... but once it loses its mainstream appeal(as it gets overtaken by more mainstream, bank/government backed cryptos), its value and use will plummit.  

I also fear that once these ""legitimate"" currencies pop up, there will no longer be a  reason to keep Bitcoin around.  It served its purpose, and made everyone trust a completely cashless system, based on 1's and 0's.  I think once the Central Banks' real, new tech cryptos come out, Bitcoin may be relegated to the history books.",1608583752,42,1

kivh5v,Shardy_Taxi,Found recovery mnemonic after 3 years of searching but still can't get access...Help plz?,"So back in 2014/15 i bought some BTC and had a wallet on the old blockchain.info site. I had used a few coins to purchase ""stuff"" and had some change left over which back then wasn't much so was quickly forgotten although i always knew i had saved the 21 word recovery mnemonic on a hard drive somewhere somewhere.... 
2-3 years ago i remembered i still had these coins which become worth a few thousand dollars so i thought i should find them again.... 
2 years later till today and sifting through 7 hard drives and billions of files i finally found the 21 word recovery mnemonic. I keyed the words in and i was given a link to my wallet id and the password but then when i attempted to log in it said ""authorization required, check email"".... back in those days 2fa was disabled by default,  i used temporary email addresses to create the wallet and was never required to authorize logins via email nor was a phone number registered.  There also wasn't  silver or gold memberships as today.  
So i emailed support and the response i got was that i should use my 12 word,  not 21 word, recovery phrase and reset 2fa.... but this makes no sense as i had used my original 21 word phrase and recovered my login credentials but the damn thing still won't let me in.  What was the point of having such recovery mnemonic and how the hell am i gonna get around this email authorization??
The wallet is worth $30k+ and times are tough, can anyone make sense of this and know a solution?",1608738720,48,1

Wouldn’t this stop inflation? 

I suppose the whole world would have to agree, and I suppose a lot of people would become complacent and not want to produce.

Even if Bitcoin is the new one world currency, what is to stop people from raising prices?

The answer is that eventually robots, A.I., and quantum computing will be able to do all work for humanity and there will be no more money. Then the question will be- In what way should we allocate resources to the people? But, the AI could help solve that problem.

There will be major change soon. I’m excited.

This would most probably need a smart contract, which begs the question if this would be possible on something such as RSK? If not, could it be done on ethereum, with WBTC?

In terms of who gets the funding, could some kind of voting system be put in place?

I don't have all the answers, and this may not be technically feasible - but I worry about the trend of private corporations funding core developers as that could lead to fundamental changes in the protocol that might favour some of these corporations.

Extremely new to Bitcoin, but with a decent understanding of cryptography and computer security. I absolutely love the fact that Bitcoin removes the need to trust any central authority.

However, I'm having a hard time figuring out what risk I'm willing to tolerate. It seems like I have to trust somebody, at the end of the day. If I buy a hardware wallet, I have to trust that it wasn't tampered in the mail or backdoored in a way that is unknown to the community. I could download the bitaddress repository and use it on an air-gapped computer with a fresh Linux install, but I'm still trusting the codebase. It seems like the only way to have security is to write my own software for generating public/private key pairs, and storing a paper wallet. Then, I have to trust that my code doesn't have any bugs.

I'm having a hard time figuring out who to trust. Can somebody give me some peace of mind?",1608733092,4,1

I know that almost any altcoin is honestly a shitcoin but I do think that some alts have potential and think/thought they will outperform bitcoin because you know that dumb money will buy xrp over btc cause it's cheaper. (I don't have any xrp, just an example)  

The main alt that I hold is eth. Which I still think is an amazing project idea only if it scales to those 100k transactions per second that they have been talking about since 2017. But imo if it fails to scale then it's honestly worthless.

IMO BTC has made it, it's a ""finish product"", I don't see it ever going away (enough people believe in it being a safe haven, a store of value, an inflation hedge, and most importantly real money). 

So now the conversation around BTC has shifted, it's no longer speculation about if it's going to be money or not, it's how much time it will take to onboard everybody (The day when Peter Schiff said I was wrong LOL). But every other crypto (like eth) are still pure speculation imo.

kjqbrk,Fiach_Dubh,FICEN Regulation MegaThread - Make Your Voice Heard - Wish Mnuchin a Merry Christmas &amp; Happy New Year,"This thread will be stickied until **January 3rd - which is also the deadline** for comment on the new FINCEN rules &amp; regulations.

Dear r/Bitcoin 

[I’m Blowing the Horn](https://youtu.be/7lwJOxN_gXc?t=219)

The regulators are here, and they want to make things more difficult for the ecosystem. Make no mistake, the new proposed FICEN rules are insignificant in the grand scheme of things. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t give them Hell for trying to sneak in some last minute shenanigans, at the 11th hour, of an outgoing administration, during Christmas. (A cowardly act, no matter your political affiliation). 

This subreddit has more than 1,825,000 subscribers, many of whom are lawful American citizens, voters, taxpayers &amp; Bitcoin enthusiasts.

So make some noise, but be respectful and professional if and when you do. 

Be sure to let them know that [it's not worth risking Republican control of the Senate](https://twitter.com/F_D_KB/status/1342211429542277121) over [Mnuchin's personnel vendetta against Bitcoin](https://youtu.be/B1zA3vNsiQQ?t=136).


At the time of posting this thread there have been 284 comments made. Lets get that to 2100.

This thread will help host information &amp; options for community members to make their voices heard on these new draconian rules. If you have any ideas on this action, please leave a comment. I’ll try to update it with more options and information as they become available. 

**Some good background on this:** 

Everyone Should read this one:

AND: Kenneth A. Blanco Director Financial Crimes Enforcement Network via https://www.fincen.gov/contact

[Rumor is](https://youtu.be/6DyuKaaMOVM), the Office of Management and Budget has the final say on these FINCEN rules, so be sure to submit a copy of your comments there too:

**Closing Thoughts and Strategy:**


It's probably more important to leave a comment on the actual proposed rules, then to send Mnuchin a letter he won't read. But both are encouraged. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget angle might be the best place to target. Please submit your comments respectfully and professionally to as many of the available avenues for comment and feedback as possible. But do not spam or be disrespectful in your conduct. Please also contact your local senator and congressman for wider effect.

Special Raffles as well. 1 ticket per person than you have to answer a question after you potentially get your ticket picked an and best responses get those.

We have wallets (hardware or software) with public/private keys, and they generate wallet addresses which we use for transactions. When we lose our hardware wallet and then try to restore on another one, we are able to recover all our Bitcoins because they're all stored on the blockchain.

How does that exactly work? 

Doesn't the new wallet generate a new public/private key pair? Isn't the bitcoin linked to the specific private key of the wallet that we originally lost?

Does the new wallet search through the blockchain for all previous transactions and then tally up our Bitcoin total?

kjmx7o,Remarkable3897,Reflection about the price of Bitcoin.,"There's one thing that I keep thinking about it, and is the following:

The price of Bitcoin is determined based on the willingness of who owns Bitcoin to sell for a specific price and another one to buy my limit order. 

There could be the case where the demand is still high, but nobody is willing to pay +30k for a BTC and at the same time not having enough bitcoins in the exchanges.

For example in the housing market. The supply is very low, the demand is very high and yes prices went up 10%, but not 100%. If there was a point in time where no houses where available for sale, prices will go up more, but no one will be willing to pay 1M for a house that was 300k. People in search of a house will go to alternative assets (renting, hotels, etc)

With this I mean I see a path towards 25 or 30k. But at this levels it's hard to think this could go up 5x from here.

I'm most likely leaving something on the table.

Thoughts?

They are having a giveaway of BTC, but you have to deposit 0.002 BTC (\~700 USD at the time) of writing to ""verify"" yourself and withdraw. I ""won"" 0.55 an example.

To newcomers, do be careful. The principle of if it's too good to be true applies here. Also notice the code to ""redeem"" is a generic promo code. They just give you a crazy amount of money and hope you lose your senses. I was honestly only expecting to get $50 which would be a high but reasonable marketing expense.

kjlbbt,TacticalWolves,Bitcoin and the Great Definancialization,"It might start with the most obviously over-priced financial assets, such as negative yielding sovereign debt, but everything will be on the chopping block. As the rotation occurs, non-bitcoin asset prices will experience downward pressure, which will similarly create downward pressure on the value of debt instruments supported by those assets. The demand for credit will be impaired broadly, which will cause the credit system as a whole to contract (or attempt to contract). That in turn will accelerate the need for quantitative easing (increase in the base money supply) to help sustain and prop up credit markets, which will further accelerate the shift out of financial assets and into bitcoin. The process of definancialization will feed on itself and accelerate because of the feedback loop between the value of financial assets, the credit system and quantitative easing.

However, did you know that pennies are the likely inspiration of why Satoshi (the genius) chose 21 million bitcoins as the planned supply?

This is because the total satoshis that will ever be mined is within 5% of the total penny-value of the USD money supplies in 2009, the year Bitcoin was created.

If you don't believe me (or if you do!), feel free to check my math:

2009 USD Money Supplies (cents):

M0: 200,000,000,000,000
M1: 170,000,000,000,000
M2: 830,000,000,000,000
M3: 830,000,000,000,000
---------------------------------------
Total pennies: 
2,030,000,000,000,000

Total planned satoshis: 
2,100,000,000,000,000


That means there are only 3.45% more planned satoshis than 2009 cents!

500/25800=.01937984 *$400,000=$7,751.93 

on average Bitcoin has return of 363% so if it follows the yearly average by December 2021 it will be at $93,380. 

With the same math a $500 investment next December, with an average return, will be worth $1,809.67... I think it will be at $400k and you’ll make $7,751...

The problem is, I don’t have too much to work with at the moment. As mentioned, I have $12,000 in savings. 

I’m 26, current salary is $60k, and I don’t have to pay rent for the next 4 months as I am living at home until I return to my apartment in NYC. (I have a subletter atm). 

I’m single, no kids, some student loans still to pay off (about $10k) but no credit card debt. I feel like I’m in an okay place. 

So..... would it be dumb to just buy $6k worth of bitcoin today? or tomorrow? would like to buy around 24k if it goes back there but I don’t wanna hold off for too long. Obviously I know it’s not recommended to buy at ATH but who can even know anymore?

Ok now on to what I’m trying to say: Fuck it. 

I seriously cannot believe how much the US government is just absolutely fucking the average person right now. I’m torn between thinking $600 is too much or too little. 

Background:
This summer I turned 18 and decided it was time for me to work I got a job in a small construction company and we were seriously understaffed. Like way too understaffed, half the time it was just me (who had no experience) and my boss. I pulled 15 hour days for 6 days a week and thanks to supreme leader Cuomo made less than someone on unemployment. Now because of the government’s ridiculous money printing policy my bank account will be worth shit in 10 years. 

I’ve invested in some Bitcoin but honestly I can’t take this anymore. I just said fuck it and shipped all my money into BTC. I don’t even care if that’s a stupid move. My friend just told me that with his parents help he bullshitted unemployment this summer and made more than I made. Honestly fuck that dude. He just shows me how screwed the system is. Bitcoin gives me a chance to better my life over the next 15 years and I hope more people learn about BTC so they can get off the USD. I will now HODL until the moon.",1609001070,81,1

I just want to be sure that when I buy Bitcoin and if God forbid Tether gets sued by the SEC that my Bitcoin will not be affected.

**“At the time of the next halving event, around may 2020, Bitcoins will be produced at a rate of 900 BTC / day and, by that time, there will be around 18.375.000 coins in circulation. The stock to flow will climb to 52, which is much closer to gold.”**  
Bitcoin price gets higher because of the halving.  


It’s false because if there’s no demand for Bitcoin, its price would collapse. Scarcity doesn’t create demand by itself.

S2F model assumes the demand will be there, but there’s no guarantee for it. There are multiple things out there which affects the demand, but S2F is not one of them, scarcity simply doesn’t create demand. I think PlanB's disclaimer agrees with me **“Any information found on this page is not to be considered as financial advice. You should do your own research before making any decisions.”**

If you are still not sure, think about this hypothetical scenario, let’s give all the Bitcoin maximalists 100M$, they would invest it into Bitcoin and the price would shoot up because of the sudden demand. Or let's redistribute all the Satoshis Bitcoins to non-Bitcoiners, price would collapse because they want to take profit as soon as possible. These examples had nothing to do with the Bitcoin's S2F model yet they affected the price heavily. 

S2F causes less sell pressure through halving’s which can be seen higher prices in Bitcoin, but it doesn’t create the demand which is one of the key driving forces for the price. Only fewer coins are sold through miners after each halving, at the same time their relevance in the selling side is fading while more responsibility is given for the hodlers to keep existing Bitcoins out from the exchange platforms.  
Enjoy the ride, but justify your Bitcoin holdings by using some other metrics than S2F.

Unemployment insurance basically refilled my savings and now I have a few extra in coin as a rainy day fund.

Specifically, I was unable to find answers online on what or who is the driving force behind halving, and issuance of new bitcoins to miners. 

On halving: I understand this happens on a schedule, but how can that be possible without a central authority? Is this something hardcoded into the bitcoin network that is just scheduled to occur automatically once every X years? 

On new bitcoins: this goes hand in hand with the previous question, but who or what is actually the entity issuing new bitcoins to miners? Again, is this something hardcoded into the network? 

One final question is, if the answer to these questions are ""yes"", and these behaviors were hardcoded into the bitcoin network by Satoshi and others who created it, then can bitcoin traders be sure that other ""hidden features,"" that aren't publicly known except to the creators, are not also baked into this network?",1609398332,8,1

k4bdp4,graydogstudios,"I'm sick and tired of people saying Bitcoin is ""risky."" Bitcoin is one of the safest investments in the world.","Now don't get me wrong: bitcoin is volatile, but so is the stock market, or even bonds. I've held bonds that lost 60% of their value overnight. Ask the bondholders of Bear Sterns how it all worked out for them.

With that in mind, bitcoin is everything but risky. In fact, USD is far, far riskier than BTC. Over time, the USD has lost 99.9% of its value. My grandfather earned $150 per week and he raised a family of four with no problems, his wife never worked. Today what can you buy with $150? Today, both parents work and they can barely sustain 1-2 kid.

Hell, more recent example: I bought my original iPhone for $599. I thought it was a complete ripoff. Today, the cheapest recent iPhone - not even the premium one - starts at $999. 90% inflation over 12 years. See what you can buy today for $1 vs. just ten years ago. I clearly remember McDouble were $1.19 here, now they're $2.49. Money is losing value year after year. Hell, we just came with a $350G deficit here and we are not even done with the virus. This is money they are printing, printing, printing, and handing to their buddies.

**Bitcoin is probably one of the safest investments in the world**. Even with gold, you have to pay a storage+insurance fee AND even if you store it in a ""safe"" place it could still get stolen from you under some circumstances (see: [https://archive.is/8XBqS](https://archive.is/8XBqS)). Not even talking of getting robbed at home, etc.

Also, gold has barely gone up at all. It's at the same price it was 10 years ago, pays no dividends, etc. Oh and good luck trading your gold fast - my bank charges a 10% fee over spot price, eBay charges you 12%, etc. Gotta mail it, insure it, etc etc etc.

Bitcoin? A block is printed every 10 mins. 21M max limit. In fact, if every millionaire wanted to buy one bitcoin, well, they couldn't. Sure, the graph might look volatile, and it's not the best if you need to quickly access capital, but if you do six-months smoothed average, it's actually relatively stable. Bitcoin has always gone up on average, with the occasional dip of course, but long-term, it's not insane to believe it will keep going up.

People think Bitcoin is a scam? Paypal doesn't share that view. Neither does square, several hedge funds manager. The big players with thousands of S19 don't seem to think bitcoin is a scam, neither. People in Venezuela, India, China neither. 

Even at a market cap of $350B, of which a certain portion is lost for good for sure, bitcoin is ridiculously underpriced. Paypal is valued at $250B and that is one company in one sector; even in payment transactions, you have TONS of big players. 

With the way bitcoin is used now - poker website, intercountry trades, even lightning network - I refuse to believe bitcoin is only worth $350B right now. Just as a store of value - a category in which it crushes gold and obliterate USD - bitcoin is worth at least $1T. Might sound a lot, but $1T is nothing compared to the global economy ($80T per YEAR). 

Bitcoin is safe, protected by the laws of cryptography. Maths. It's literally the best store of value there ever was. On average, bitcoin has gone up around 8% per month (average of all monthly returns) in the last five years, and way more before that. 

Even at $20k, BTC is a bargain, but I wrote this to insist that bitcoin is NOT risky. It is volatile, but something volatile can go both up or down. Tesla is volatile, do you hear anyone complain about it? 

Long-term, bitcoin is extremely safe. You are guaranteed there won't be more than 21M (no guarantee on USD or even gold!), that it will always be tradeable (as long as one person is in bitcoins, it lives) AND I haven't even talk about growth/adoption, more and more people are getting in bitcoins every day (Paypal a few weeks ago!), increasing demand, while supply remains the same (and not even that - cuts in half every four year).

Bitcoin might crash, and it has, but it always recovered higher. Proof: today. Bitcoin was manipulated down to $3k, and here we are, back at it. It didn't die.

Bitcoin is a genius invention, like the wheel, electricity, the internet, etc. It is THE internet money now. I use (send, buy, trade, receive) bitcoins daily and it's absolutely great. To see holding bitcoins as ""risky"" is having the wrong mentality, period. Holding USD, while the government does whatever it want with your dollar, is far more risky in my eyes.",1606789207,26,1

k4avre,mishxx88,Coinbase is closing my account and customer support is not replying to my emails about my missing funds.,"So, I have been using Coinbase for over 3 years now and always enjoyed using their platform, but I was never expecting what happened to me with what I thought was one of the most trusted crypto exchanges in US.

Long story short, I had made a transfer from KuCoin to Coinbase with USDC and apparently they do not like their customers using Hong Kong exchanges, so they send me an email that they are closing my account. I logged into my account immediately and was re-directed to a page where I had to transfer all of my funds outside of coinbase so they can proceed with closing my account, but only to find out 50-60% of my funds are missing. 

I emailed coinbase support and they replied that I had to login to my coinbase pro, because the rest of my funds were stuck there and I have to transfer them on my own to my coinbase wallets. The problem is anytime I login to my coinbase pro account, it redirects me to the same page always where I have to transfer my funds to other wallets and it does not show my missing funds on there. 

I explained to them what is happening and they kept replying back with almost the same emails as the previous ones ""please login to your coinbase pro account"" its like they are not even reading my email.

I have sent 8 emails in which I explain to coinbase support what they have to do as I had found other users to be with the same problem as mine when their account were closed. Basically, **""if your Coinbase account gets closed and you have some funds (crypto or fiat) on Coinbase Pro, chances are you won’t be able to withdraw those funds right away. They have to manually transfer the funds to your Coinbase account so you could withdraw them.""**

The last email I received from coinbase was 12 days ago on 11/18/2020 and since then I had sent about 7-8 emails asking about my funds. They have caused me so much stress, I cant even explain it. Its traumatic when 50-60% of your investments are held by a company that is not responding to your questions for 12 days and here I am a believer in Bitcoin and crypto that one day we will make a better world, but if these kind of companies are running crypto, then we are in trouble. At least if I have a problem with my bank, there is always someone to help me. Coinbase support on the other hand, its like if there is a problem, don't expect coinbase support to help you, you are on your own. 

I have filed a complaint with FDIC, since most of my funds were in USD and I really did not want to go this route, but at this point I have no idea what else to do.",1606787529,185,1

We BTC believers believe that the price of BTC is going up for all the reasons that we think Bitcoin is special. But if that’s the case, why do nearly all of the alts and shitcoins, most of which are inferior to Bitcoin in function and/or recognition, still generally correlate with BTC price? Does that signal that lots of the money driving prices across crypto, including Bitcoin, is still speculative in nature?

k48edl,Rhysing,"With crypto spiking again, what about Bitcoin as a product should I know that would incentivize me to buy it over something like Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum?","I was around during the craze in 2017, I bought hardware to mine with, and depending on what was the best profit in a day given a GPU heavy mining style, I would alter what I mined. Mostly ended up mining Ethereum (it mined the fastest and with its price spike, ended up turning profit when it was at $300) which I hold a good chunk of and have seen that companies like Microsoft and Amazon investing there. 

I was wondering, with Bitcoin holding the largest crypto market share and spiking harder than other coins, what should I know about its use and future that could incentivize me to dip further into it as a product. Are there dangers to Bitcoin, an end-of-life?

I hear talk that it is the namesake of cryptos that keeps it on top, while that makes sense to a degree, it must have some backing as a product to give that credit.

I’ve continued to discover new ways to buy Bitcoin, whether it’s through coinbase or various apps. I personally don’t want to keep my Bitcoin on these apps, and so I’ve been transferring them to my cold storage crypto wallet after purchase. I recently found the app, ABRA, that includes a new feature: interest earning cryptocurrency accounts. 

What do you all think of ABRA, and is it a good idea to utilize the interest earning account feature they provide?

Thanks in advance for any opinions on this matter. 

All the best,

k4rrqc,The_Bitcoin_Dude,This is how miners will be profitable after the last Bitcoin is mined.,"There are two ways that Miners earn Bitcoin:

1. Newly minted Bitcoin.
2. Transaction fees. 

Currently, the majority of miners' profits come from newly mined Bitcoin.

By the time the last Bitcoin is mined which is around the year 2140, Bitcoin should reach or have reached mass adoption. This, in turn, will heavily increase the number of transactions that are happening on the Bitcoin network; therefore, increasing the transaction fees that miners receive. They should be able to operate solely off of transaction fees and not newly minted bitcoin.

This is one of the many built-in precautions that allow Bitcoin to be continuous.

I'm conscious it may involve a totally different architecture but just as a thought exercise.

Why couldn't Bitcoin work in 'accounts' where you would control the private key of the account, sign a transaction with your private key, the miners would check that you own this account, that the private key is correct and that the balance of the transaction does not exceed the total amount of the account. 

And then transmit to nodes a block with the state of the accounts and the valid transactions included, nodes would check that the accounts balance, that the transactions included are valid, but then just record on the blockchain the updated state of the accounts.

If this worked the size of the blockchain would be quite stable and the only concern we would have in terms of scalability is bandwith.

1. I had a small amount to invest so I started with Coinbase, bout at the 16,500 dip, just bought more at the 18,500 dip. My strategy is to just buy dips and hold. I want about 70% BTC and 30% Eth. Hold for 5-10 years just investing about 5% of my pay since my employer stopped 401k match. 

2. Coinbase fees are crazy, I don’t think I’m on the Pro. I setup a Kracken account but it seems harder to fund with my bank as Coinbase is kinda user friendly. 

3. I ordered a ledger S, my plan is to move coin from Coinbase and setup the hardware wallet. I know being a new customer I wasn’t included in their hack but I know never to give the 24 word phrase. Do you guys think the hardware is ok to derive the pass phrase from? I was thinking of doing a usb tails install and do an offline 24 word key and just use electrum. Any thoughts?

4. I just see so many people loosing their money through hacks. Any advise there besides the obvious? Coldcoin sounds better but harder to use. I don’t want things to get complicated if I die and my wife has to marry hacker man to get my coins.

Combined with retail excitement stirred by PayPal and Square, BTC gained 165% in 2020.    


Intuitively, sellers have derived fair value for their BTC investment to-date, but it's not obvious whether BTC's arc will extrapolate 2020, or whether massive institutional investment in 2021 will make 2020 look quaint.

But is there any substantial reason to why one should not invest into BTC, what can happen to BTC in the future that will make BTC worthless?
(And no alien invasion or data hacking as those reasons are not as likely to be happening I think)

So please, if I may ask you, convince me not to invest into Bitcoin! 

(I myself have invested money into BTC to spread my financial risks and not only investing in stock market or having all money in my bank).",1606836533,22,1
k4mz9n,genacgenacgenac,Bitcoin Cash: why should we care?,"Bitcoin Cash was a hard fork.  Paypal offers it as a payment medium evidently, a value proposition veiled in mystery -- see their flippant, valueless FAQ below.   There is some gnashing of teeth on reddit over bitchcoin, some practical but mostly philosophical, but how does it affect Bitcoin investors in any way?   


BTC has become viewed as a safe value store because it's immutable, limited supply, etc.  On the other hand, [BCH implementation is unabashedly fluid](https://www.bitcoincash.org/roadmap/), chasing the magic elixir for quick transaction settlement and that tasty Wendy's Trippple.  Can't we all just live in peace and sleep well knowing Bitcoin doesn't need to support retail?

## What do I need to know about Bitcoin Cash?

The following information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute an endorsement of this type of Cryptocurrency. Consider seeking tax and financial advice from licensed professionals.  


Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was created to be an alternative to Bitcoin, something for everyday transactions if Crypto becomes widely accepted as a currency one day.  
 

The number of transactions that can be processed every second is an important measuring stick. For example, Visa credit cards process around 2000 transactions per second, and can handle a lot more. Bitcoin maxes out at about 7 transactions per second. This rate is fine if Crypto is only ever going to be used infrequently to buy something like a Lamborghini, but not if it needs to be flexible enough to also pay for an Uber or purchase get groceries.  
 

Bitcoin Cash, with the capacity to support more than 100 transactions per second, is helping to show that Crypto could one day be a viable option even at the checkout line.  
   
**Quick facts**

* Bitcoin Cash is a “hard fork”, or branching off, of Bitcoin that eventually became its own separate Crypto due to philosophical differences about the purpose of Bitcoin.
* While Bitcoin can process about 7 transactions per second, Bitcoin Cash can support more than 100 transactions per second.

A little technical, but there are probably enough people here with quite some knowledge about this, so maybe someone can provide some insight.

&amp;#x200B;

In that video, he is talking about the size of the space of private keys.

* How confident are we that this space is actually exhausted by the random number generators that we typically use? Do we know anything about their probability distribution? This can easily be resolved by using dice, so it only seems to be a minor problem. But I also wonder about algorithms used on a computer.
* I understand that one doesn't need to choose the same private key but only a key that leads to the same address. According to [StackExchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/8804/is-each-bitcoin-address-unique), this reduces the set from 2\^256 to 2\^160. It also involves elliptic curve calculations and hashing. How does this affect the estimates from that video? Do we have an idea how well-behaved these mappings are, both with regard to exhausting the space and the number of preimages of an address? If this doesn't work well, the number of addresses could infact be a tiny fraction of those 2\^160.",1606900059,13,1

k5nd23,soundssarcastic,Securing the everyday desktop for BTC transactions,"Hello, Newbie here.
Been reading lots on Lopp, lurking this reddit, and keeping an eye on what friends have been saying and I pulled the plug on buying a Ledger Nano S.
I was going to use either Kraken, or Ledger Live, and maybe use Electrum wallet as a go-between for the PC and HWW for its added security. (Honestly I still feel a bit over my head for the 25th passphrase thing.. the 'easy' guide I read was like 45 steps and 3 other apps to verify signatures and such??)

My main question is about securing my desktop for these transactions. I use it for everything. Games, browsing, alone at night things, banking, everything. What are the chances theres a snake in the grass thats been sitting around undetected scanning for keys and Im just unaware? Is there an antivirus you trust? Is there a protocol you do before making a trade?

I dont want to be ultraparanoid and buy a new laptop for this kind of thing, and Ill just inb4 ""Use Linux"" (sorry no ty.) But I obviously am a bit paranoid.
I wont be dealing with huge sums, but Id rather be careful than negligent.

k5kuuw,turkeygravy,Cautionary Tale and Long Term Concern,"Until Mid-July 2017 I held BTC in an exchange. I knew the BCH hard fork was coming and reports were that there were no guarantees that exchanges would allow users to claim forked coins. This was enough to finally convince me to move crypto to a hardware wallet. 

I had friends who started investing in 2017 as a quick money strategy like many others. They were very limited in their knowledge of the technology other than ""it's going to the moon!"" I explained the reasons to hold onto your own keys to a friend and he said he'd do it - but it took him a few weeks.

On July 30th he asked me how to do it. He wasn't going to get a hardware wallet in time, so I told him to move them to a digital wallet first while he awaited his hardware wallet. I told him: download the wallet (he selected Jaxx), write down the seed, transfer a small amount of crypto, then practice recovering the wallet at least once BEFORE you transfer the rest. 

Calamity ensued.

He downloaded the wallet, transferred 2 BTC and 13 Ethereum right away. When he didn't see it appear in the wallet immediately, he deleted the app and reinstalled it. When it prompted his recovery seed, he didn't have it because he never wrote it down. Full stop.

He now effectively has a $45K car sitting in a garage that he can see, but never unlock. He's tried countless means of gaining access, but it'll never work.

As I've thought about this over the years, it's easy to say, ""what an idiot"", but ultimately I sense that larger adoption of crypto as currency/store-of-value/whatever requires larger, easily digestible education for the masses on how it works and how to utilize it responsibly. 

This is not an easy task, but there's a ton of bright minds in the crypto community. Without it, I feel we'll find more examples like this and impede larger adoption.",1606950605,5,1

k6ermn,austrolib,Has anyone actually read the court filing against Tether Limited/Bitfinex from 11/05/20? I'm fairly concerned at the amount of people who dismiss out of hand what could be a serious issue.,"[https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.524076/gov.uscourts.nysd.524076.154.0.pdf](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.524076/gov.uscourts.nysd.524076.154.0.pdf)

I have pasted the relevant sections of the case. I've heard people dismiss Tether skeptics as spreading FUD and never looked into it until recently. Now that I have, I have to admit I am concerned to say the least.

**A. Defendants Lie To The Markets About USDT** 

Tether issued a stablecoin called “USDT,” which it promised was fully backed by U.S. dollars. Tether and its officers promised the market—repeatedly—that (1) each USDT would be backed by one U.S. dollar held in Tether’s reserves; (2) Tether would issue new USDT only in response to legitimate market demand—*i.e.*, customers willing to exchange dollars one-for-one for USDT; and (3) customers could redeem their USDT for U.S. dollars at any time. *Id.* ¶¶ 116, 125– 34, 147–50, 165–67, 174. 

Tether distributed USDT through Bitfinex, a crypto-exchange that also told its customers that USDT was fully backed, 1 for 1, by a reserve of U.S. dollars. *Id.* ¶¶ 115–34, 148–51, 160–61. Using a Bitfinex account, customers could buy new USDT that was issued by Tether’s treasury or could redeem USDT for U.S. dollars, at which point Tether should have delisted (or “burned”) the redeemed USDT, to keep the USDT supply at the same level as Tether’s U.S. dollar reserves. *Id.* ¶¶ 117–18, 158, 195–96. 

Secretly, Bitfinex and Tether were under common control. *Id.* ¶ 152–53. Potter and De- fendant Giancarlo Devasini—Bitfinex’s CSO and CFO, respectively—created and controlled Tether’s holding company, *id.* ¶ 153, and Devasini and Defendant Ludovicus Jan van der Velde— Bitfinex’s CEO—were the only directors of Tether Limited, *id.* ¶ 154. Defendants hid these facts, creating the illusion that USDT was supported by two independent entities, *id.* ¶¶ 152–61, thus reassuring the market that USDT was fully backed by U.S. dollars by creating the illusion of an independent entity that distributed and could monitor the legitimacy of USDT. 

Defendants’ assurances were lies. USDT was *not* fully backed by U.S. dollars; it was only partially backed, and thus debased. Tether did *not* issue USDT only in response to genuine market demand; it issued unbacked USDT for its own purposes without regard to real demand. This reality is clear from expert analysis of the USDT blockchain—the digital ledger that records all USDT transactions—and public information about Tether’s and Bitfinex’s banking history. 

**1. Expert Analysis Shows That Tether Did Not Issue USDT Only In Response To Legitimate Customer Demand** 

Expert analysis of the USDT blockchain shows that, contrary to Defendants’ representations, Tether did not issue most USDT in response to legitimate market demand. Rather, 72% of all USDT that Tether issued through the end of 2018—purportedly $3 billion worth—flowed to just two addresses. *Id.* ¶¶ 203, 208. One address (“1J1d”) transferred all USDT it received to the crypto-exchange Poloniex, *id.* ¶ 205; the other address (“1AA6”) transferred all USDT it received to the crypto-exchange Bittrex, *id.* ¶ 206. If the demand for USDT were genuine, USDT should have flown through numerous customer accounts on numerous crypto-exchanges. Instead, it was disproportionately directed to two exchanges through just two addresses. This indicates that Defendants used the 1J1d and 1AA6 accounts to issue USDT to themselves or to co-conspirators, not in response to market demand.1 

This lack of genuine demand is confirmed by comparing the activity in the 1J1d and 1AA6 accounts to broader market activity. From January 15, 2018 to January 23, 2018, for example, 700 million USDT were issued and more than 400 million USDT were transferred from Bitfinex to both the 1J1d and 1AA6 accounts and other accounts. *Id.* ¶¶ 212–14. On January 24, 2018, a report entitled “Quantifying the Effect of Tether” (the “Tether Report”) was published online, *id.* ¶ 212, concluding that “that Tether may not be minted independently of Bitcoin price and may be created when Bitcoin is falling” to boost bitcoin prices, *id.* ¶¶ 212, 305. For the next ten days, transfers of USDT from Bitfinex to other addresses continued at the same rate as before—but no new USDT was issued and transfers to the 1AA6 and 1J1d addresses stopped cold. *Id.* ¶ 213. If the owners of  the 1AA6 and 1J1d addresses were independent actors, they would have kept buying USDT as the same rate as before—just like other traders. But they did not. This indicates that the owners of the 1AA6 and 1J1d addresses conspired with Tether and Bitfinex following the Tether Report to avoid scrutiny. 

**2. Tether’s Banking History Shows That USDT Was Not Fully Backed By U.S. Dollars** 

Tether’s promise to keep as many U.S. dollars in reserve as there were USDT in circulation was simply not possible given Tether’s troubled banking history. Bitfinex and Tether’s banks cut off their accounts in early 2017, *id.* ¶¶ 223–35, and they would not regain access to correspondent banking for another six months, *id.* ¶ 239. Yet during those six months, Tether issued 409 million new USDT—nearly ten times as much as in the prior two-and-a-half years. *Id.* ¶¶ 240, 242. There is no plausible way that Tether could have received or held the $409 million required to fully back those issuances without access to correspondent banking. *Id.* ¶ 241. 

Tether’s promise is even more implausible given its relationship with Crypto Capital and Fowler, who used illegal shadow banking to manufacture the illusion of Tether’s promised cash reserves. Crypto Capital and Fowler created accounts in the name of shell corporations, where Bitfinex and Tether directed customers to deposit currency. *Id.* ¶¶ 354–59. These accounts were closed when banks caught on, driving Crypto Capital and Fowler to create new accounts in what Potter called a “cat-and-mouse” game. *Id.* ¶¶ 344–45. 

Yet even when Tether experienced liquidity issues despite its relationship with Crypto Capital and Fowler, it continued to issue new USDT, revealing that USDT was unbacked. For example, in April 2018, when Tether issued 130 million new USDT, Bitfinex complained of “extreme difficulty” in honoring redemption requests because it could not access funds it held with Crypto Capital. *Id.* ¶ 248. Similarly, in October 2018, when Tether issued 250 million new USDT, Devasini complained that Bitfinex needed $100 million to honor redemptions. *Id.* ¶¶ 250–51. If USDT had been backed, there is no scenario in which Tether could issue new USDT while strug- gling to redeem old USDT. If Tether had actually received the millions of dollars necessary to issue new, fully-backed USDT on either occasion, it could have easily honored any redemption requests. *Id.* ¶¶ 219, 249, 251. 

**3. Tether’s Strategically Timed “Burning” Of Over A Billion USDT Shows That USDT Was Not Fully Backed By U.S. Dollars** 

Tether’s delisting (or “burning”) of over a billion USDT in 2018 further confirms that USDT was not fully backed by U.S. dollars. In November 2018, Tether published a letter from Deltec Bank &amp; Trust (the “Deltec Letter”) that claimed Tether’s account there contained over $1.8 billion, enough to cover all then-outstanding USDT. *Id.* ¶ 252. 

A month earlier, however, Tether had delisted 1.04 billion USDT—nearly 40% of all then- existing USDT—to bring the total amount of USDT in circulation down to just under 1.8 billion. *Id.* ¶ 253. It is beyond unlikely that independent investors all coincidentally decided to redeem 1.04 billion USDT in the month just before Tether published the Deltec Letter. Even if they had, the USDT blockchain would show customers transferring a total of 1.04 billion USDT from ac- counts on other exchanges to Bitfinex or the Tether Treasury in October 2018, *id.* ¶ 254, but the blockchain shows net transfers of only 72 million, *id.* ¶ 255. And if they had redeemed 1.04 billion fully-backed USDT, Tether and Bitfinex would have had to send $1.04 billion to redeeming cus- tomers—something they could not do in October 2018, when they were pleading for Crypto Cap- ital to send them one-tenth that amount to honor redemptions. *Id.* ¶¶ 250, 257. The only plausible explanation is that the 1.04 billion USDT Tether burned was not backed by U.S. dollars at all.     

**B. Defendants Use Debased USDT To Manipulate The Crypto-Commodity Market2** 

By convincing the market that USDT was fully backed by U.S. dollars, Defendants effec- tively created a money printer—they could create USDT on demand that the market would accept as equivalent to U.S. dollars. Defendants then used the debased USDT they created to drive up the prices of crypto-commodities, inflating a massive bubble from which they profited in several ways. 

For this scheme to work, Bitfinex and Tether needed the cooperation of other crypto-ex- changes—Bittrex and Poloniex—where one could trade USDT for crypto-commodities. Tether worked closely with Bittrex and Poloniex to list USDT on those exchanges. *Id.* ¶ 318. Instead of requiring a new address for each transfer, as was typical, these exchanges facilitated the scheme by allowing repeated transfers from Bitfinex to the 1AA6 and 1J1d addresses. *Id.* ¶¶ 313–16. Plain- tiffs allege that the Defendants worked together. The Exchange Defendants’ must have been aware of the unbacked nature of USDT and its use to manipulate crypto-commodity prices based on the pattern of transfers and issuances they could observe, but ignored their obligation to report suspicious transfers. *Id.* ¶¶ 208, 320–21, 324–26, 331–33. And the Bitfinex/Tether Defendants were working with Crypto Capital and Fowler to mask Tether’s inadequate reserves, with Potter trying to quell the market’s liquidity concerns even as Devasini begged for unlawful access to capital. *Id.* ¶¶ 342–66. 

Once Defendants transferred USDT from Bitfinex to Bittrex and Poloniex, they traded it for bitcoin and other crypto-commodities, and sent those crypto-commodities back to Bitfinex’s exchange address, where the conspirators sold the crypto-commodities to unwitting market partic- ipants for U.S. dollars. *Id.* ¶ 264. The data confirm it: When large amounts of USDT flowed to the 1AA6 and 1J1d addresses, there was significantly more trading of USDT for bitcoin on Bittrex and Poloniex and significantly increased flows of bitcoin back to Bitfinex. *Id.* ¶ 265. 

Defendants’ trades inflated crypto-commodity prices. These were not like most crypto- commodity trades, which exchange one crypto-commodity for another (say, bitcoin for ethereum). Trades among different crypto-commodities affect the market’s perception of one crypto-com- modity’s value relative to another, but not of crypto-commodities relative to other asset classes. Because Defendants were trading USDT for crypto-commodities—and because the market be- lieved USDT was fully backed by U.S. dollars—the market saw their trades as adding *new* money into the crypto-commodity market, not merely moving existing money around within it. *Id.* ¶ 272. Thus, within hours of USDT being transferred from Bitfinex to the 1AA6 and 1J1d addresses, the price of bitcoin increased appreciably. *Id.* ¶ 273. 

Defendants designed their trades to keep crypto-commodity prices up. On average, they transferred ten times as much USDT to Bittrex and Poloniex after crypto-commodity prices had gone down by 5% or more than they did after those prices had gone up. *Id.* ¶¶ 276–77. By buying crypto-commodities while prices were falling, Defendants pushed prices back up. In Febru- ary 2018, for example, after bitcoin prices had fallen to under $7,000, Defendants issued 36 million USDT, and the price promptly rose to over $8,500. *Id.* ¶ 274. Defendants also timed their trades to keep crypto-commodity prices above “round number thresholds,” creating the impression that prices were subject to “floors” below which they would not drop, inducing other traders to pur- chase. *Id.* ¶¶ 295–96. Devasini all but admitted this manipulation in October 2018, when he implored Crypto Capital to provide $100 million to redeem USDT, warning that bitcoin could “tank” to below $1,000 “if we don’t act quickly.” *Id.* ¶ 362. 

Defendants’ conspiracy created the largest asset bubble in history. At its height, bitcoin traded near $20,000, before falling to less than $4,000. *Id.* ¶ 272. Defendants bought crypto-com- modities using debased USDT and sold them at grossly inflated prices, reaping huge profits. Bit- trex, Poloniex, Crypto Capital and Fowler also had substantial crypto-commodity holdings, which benefitted from inflated crypto-commodities prices. *Id.* ¶¶ 341, 366. Bittrex and Poloniex further benefitted from increased trading volume and extra commissions. *Id.* ¶¶ 339–40. These profits, however, came at the expense of Class members, who purchased crypto-commodities falsely in- flated by Defendants’ manipulation.",1607060053,20,1

Kraken has been involved in few grants for bitcoin open source projects as well. But was it done for the [marketing](https://twitter.com/La__Cuen/status/1276155513600970752)? If they have money for sponsorship what is stopping them from hiring few devs who can integrate LN support for Kraken?   


**Solution:**  


1. I am honestly done with this BS and won't request anything now. Either you can do the same or atleast stop using these exchanges. Instead I have started working on a better exchange for India and hopefully will go live in few months. 
2. Crowdfunding of open source projects like bitcoin core, ln implementations, bisq, OmniBOLT etc. I think bisq can have more volume if API is available to integrate it in apps/websites.
3. Contribute in projects like TDEX and OpenDEX. Use them more than CEX once they go live. If required to use a centralized exchange prefer Bitfinex and others that support segwit, LN, Liquid etc.
4. Maintain a list of exchanges that support latest bitcoin technologies. Will help everyone.

k6dyh5,Blargton,Question about the flow of information between bitcoin nodes during a double spend,"Hi there, I'm trying to learn exactly how the flow of information works between Bitcoin nodes during a double spend. Would the following situation be how the Bitcoin network deals with it?

&amp;#x200B;

Alice has 1 BTC. She loads the same seed onto two different bitcoin wallets and sends 1 BTC to Bob from one wallet and the same 1 BTC to Joe from the other wallet at the same time. Let's assume there are only 2 nodes, nodes A and B, in the entire Bitcoin network for this example. (aside from the bitcoin wallets)

&amp;#x200B;

1) Bitcoin wallet 1 tells node A: ""Alice gives Bob 1 BTC"" This transaction gets added to Node A's mempool.

2) Bitcoin wallet 2 tells node B: ""Alice gives Joe 1 BTC"" This transaction gets added to Node B's mempool.

3) Nodes A and B contact each other but reject the others transaction from their mempool because it is in conflict with the transaction already in their mempool.

&amp;#x200B;

So at this point, the two nodes would have different mempools, right? Now, let's say they're both mining nodes and Node B finds the nonce first and publishes the next block, with ""Alice gives Joe 1 BTC"" in it. This block would get propagated back to Node A and Node A would have to incorporate it into its blockchain, right? Does Node A then compare the trusted block from Node B with its mempool and delete ""Alice gives Bob 1 BTC"" since its in conflict with this most recent block? How would it know that it can completely trust Node B's block immediately upon receiving it enough to delete a transaction from its mempool?

&amp;#x200B;

Or would it simply reject Node B's block and try to make its own blockchain? How would that then play out for the next few blocks? Would these two nodes just never be in sync again unless there is a third node that can choose the longer chain between the two?

k6d4k2,CRYPTASY,CRYPTO EXCHANGE or CRYPTO CHESS ?," Bitcoin Exchange became a Chess Game where Smarters win.

Most of miners and/or bitcoin owners do their best to never keep their bitcoins frozen without any trade movement, they surely go to marketplaces, groups, pages, chat channels to promote Bitcoin selling offers where buyers have a need to get the best rates from vendors!

While competing other marketplaces online we tried our best to evaluate every single need of all crypto lovers and users in the most known bitcoin exchange marketplaces, someof them charge higher fees, others charge you extra (more than normal) commissions on trade fees, but all of them charge you even for the deposits where users don't enjoy a free wallet by hands.

Using CRYPTASY, the exchange became light and easy. Most miners and vendors  offer their Crypto ressources with best market price rates for Buyers/Customers in [CRYPTASY](https://cryptasy.com) , special rates on commissions and trade fees, and free of charge fees on your deposits lifetime, you have the choice of using [CRYPTASY](https://cryptasy.com) a free Bitcoin wallet, or make profit using bitcoin exchanges with your trade partners.

k6pm6k,cummins7,Retiring with Bitcoin tools / safe withdrawal rate similar to 4% rule,"Hi,

Wondering if anyone has any tools, or any kind of methodology similar to the [4% rule](https://www.fa-mag.com/news/choosing-the-highest-safe-withdrawal-rate-at-retirement-58132.html?section=47) but with the majority of investments in BTC rather the stock market? 

Long story short - trying to convince wife to invest more in BTC rather than in index funds, given the potential asymmetric return / BTC mooning over the long term. She is concerned that even if we got to the $1M figure in BTC (assuming living off $40k annually for arguments sake), that it's not going to be earning any compounding interest, like it would if it was all in index funds e.g. SMP500 or what have you. I guess one option would be to put it all into something like BlockFi and earn interest, but that seems insanely risky / full retard mode. 

At the moment I'm investing all my HSA into GBTC, and have a self-directed IRA where I'm maxing out in BTC. I'm also DCA very small amounts on a daily basis . We are also planning on investing in real estate / multi-family units so should have rental income from that long term. My 401k is still in index funds, as tempting as it is to try pull that all into BTC as well, I think my wife would castrate me :D 

Really just curious as to how others are approaching this and looking at retirement / implementing something similar to the 4% rule but with the majority of your portfolio in BTC rather than the stock market :) For reference I'm currently 31.",1607103738,38,1

It's been stuck a couple days, and in that time, I've decided I'd rather have it canceled outright, if possible, even if I have to pay a decently sized fee. 

I restored the trezor wallet to Electrum, thinking there was a way to double-spend my BTC to a new wallet without RBF. I'm still fairly new, and mostly just know the basic idea of RBF, and know that my transaction is incapable of it since I sent it with TS to start with. 

I'd prefer not to wait for it to drop from the mempool, because I don't want to go through the potential headache of trying to get BlockFi to sent it back to me, as they haven't even responded to my CS inquiry sent 2 days ago. Is there a way to do it, or do I basically have to hope that the transaction is dropped from the mempool before confirming? Thank you.",1607102885,2,1

My friend (we’ll call him John), said cool I’ll buy some (mind you, we were early teens). He didn’t have cash or any kind of credit card so he used the entire gift card, on Bitcoin... in 2009-2010. He made the purchase, and they continued on with their day.

Fast forward, 2017... BTC ROCKETS in value. John, remembering that he had purchased BTC back in 09’-10’ went on a search for the computer they purchased it on and here lies the issue. There are 3 computers it was potentially purchased on, his, his brothers, his friends.

I understand what ETFs are and I am invested in a few that cover several different sectors. However, I see all this talk of Bitcoin ETFs coming and... what, you're just buying an IOU of Bitcoin??? Why not just buy the actual coin??? 

This sounds a lot like Robinhood offering BTC for purchase, but actually you're not buying BTC, you're just buying the rights to hold BTC. This sort of thing would make sense for gold since gold is so hard to transport, but BTC can be sent in minutes.

Seems to me that Bitcoin ETFs are just a fancy shiny sticker to slap on the coin to entice the dinosaurs on Wall Street. Am I wrong? I would love an explanation because I'm having a hard time wrapping my brain around it.",1607097969,31,1

k76ahl,Ghostcarapace3,Bitcoin citadel thread,"Hey guys! Let's talk about the creation of bitcoin citadels. There are a couple of topics to cover here.

1. Location. Location is key here. Some people are hesitant to move to the US. Others can't. Others are hesitant to leave the US. Then of course we get into issues of everyone's favorite climates. 
2. Tax mitigation architecture. Alaska. Florida. Nevada. South Dakota. Texas. Washington. Wyoming. All good states with no income tax. Property taxes are still unfortunately a thing here, and this is where lawyers can help. A bitcoin citadel can be anything we want it to be, and very novel and creative legal strategies to make the citadel completely tax/revenue neutral as a society are a desirable goal. 
3. Self reliance. Any ""gift"" that a government gives always comes with strings. Building a citadel in such a way that it demonstrably receives no benefits from other taxpayers goes a long ways towards solidifying the idea that the citadel is its own independent entity, and something akin to its own city-state. 
4. Internal governance. A citadel should have its own laws and it should have an internal governance system to handle those laws. 
5. Food production. Bitcoin citadels should be self reliant for both basic necessities of food and energy production.
6. Research, technology, and R&amp;D. Stepping into a bitcoin citadel should be akin to stepping 200 years into the future. 
7. Governance. Technocracy. Democracy. Social consensus of expertise. Important topics. 

Lastly... if someone were to create a group to incorporate a town in say south dakota (need 100 people to do so) and called it bitcoin citadel 1. Would you be willing to move to live there so that the necessary population cap can be reached?",1607169609,21,0

k761mf,kallerosenbaum,F*ck the mnemonic sentence checksum!,"TL;DR The checksum causes more harm than good. Make BIP39 checksum optional to improve security.

The checksum is between 4 (for 12 words) and 8 (24 words) bits. This is a very weak checksum. For 12 words, this would mean 1/16 probability of failure to detect a mistyped sequence of VALID words!

The words themselves are a much stronger checksum. Any misspelled word has a much higher probability to be detected due to word missing in wordlist; It's unlikely to misspell a word so that it becomes another valid word.

When does the checksum help you? It's not when you write down the mnemonic on paper. The paper/pencil doesn't check the checksum. The checksum could help when you want to recover the wallet. If the checksum is wrong AND all words exist in the wordlist, it will help you realize there's something wrong with it.

But you'll also realize there's something wrong with it if there are no transactions or bitcoin in your ""recovered"" wallet, or that you don't recognize the addresses generated in it. The checksum, at best, only helps you realize it earlier.

The checksum also has a major turnoff: It's hard to generate a mnemonic without a computer. You can roll dice to generate 128 bits of entropy, but then you need to put those bits into a computer to calculate the checksum, ""the final word"". This ""final word"" step is a security risk. If you're a novice, it's very hard to do the final word generation in a secure way. This risk is far worse than the dubious benefit explained above.

If wallets would accept mnemonics without checksum you could create a mnemonic with ONLY dice and a wordlist and give it to a hardware wallet or airgapped computer and be done with it. You don't have to setup a secure environment to generate a nearly useless checksum.

Exactly how BIP39 could be modified to make checksum optional is another question, but it's doable.",1607168325,46,1

So I gamble online and the payout is with bitcoin. I send my winnings to BRD then to CashApp, then I sell the bitcoin for cash. 6 days ago, I sent $160-worth from BRD to CashApp, and it is still pending as of right now. 0/6 confirmations. I usually send with the slowest option (1-24 hours) as it is much less fees than the others. I have read that the fees likely have something to do with it. I’m not panicking, just frustrated at having to wait this long. Does anyone know of anything I could do to fix this issue? Also, is it true the money gets refunded after 30 days? Thanks for the help!

here’s how you can help: before you post, _pleeeeease_ spend 5 mins searching to see if your question or a similar one has already been answered. 

if you want to have a discussion, raise tangible points that can be discussed. stop asking people to educate you or tell where to learn. find resources, bring them back and ask specific questions. this helps have better discussions.

k7g478,meowmixx76,Change my mind about Bitcoin,"I don't intend for this to be rude in any way; I am genuinely curious and have not found answers to the  issues with Bitcoin acting as world reserve, or settlement layer. 

I've been working my way through the literature on Bitcoin, mostly the [Bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page) and [Gradually, then Suddenly](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/series/gradually-then-suddenly/) articles from ""Satoshi Nakamoto Institute"". 

I've gathered all my thoughts thus far below:

[https://thinkoutloudnews.substack.com/p/bitcoin-still-makes-no-sense](https://thinkoutloudnews.substack.com/p/bitcoin-still-makes-no-sense)

But the synopsis of my concerns - or what I don't understand - so far is this:

1. What does mass Bitcoin adoption might mean for lending, or other financial obligations, like settlements. The enforcement of debt and the ability to *track money* seem, to me, like some of its most important properties. If I can’t tell how much Bitcoin someone has, how can they be made financially responsible in court? Perhaps we already have this problem today, to some extent, but it seems to me that Bitcoin would increase its scope greatly.
2. I’m still trying to piece together what exactly how much control governments really lose under Bitcoin, whether I can see that as a positive or a negative, and whether I agree with Dalio that governments would ([or ](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-cannot-be-banned/)[*could*](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-cannot-be-banned/)) take action to prevent it. I'm thinking about this purely on utilitarian ground; I don't find arguments about the ethics of ""stealing"" convincing
3. The percentage of hash rate owned by Chinese firms is another looming concern I haven’t really seen an answer to either (65%). 51% of Bitcoin’s hash rate is what it would take it manipulate the network by an attacker or state actor.
4. The answers folks have given me on Bitcoin’s energy consumption—which is already matching Switzerland’s—have not been good either. One response to this [recommended to me](https://unchained-capital.com/blog/bitcoin-does-not-waste-energy/) boiled down to the benefits of fighting inflation “worth” climate change. The promise of a “lightning” network that settles transactions as an intermediary seems promising, but requires more research on my end. Has anyone done any estimations on what wide Bitcoin adoption looks like on this axis?

Any further resources or direct answers would be super helpful!",1607203612,16,1

k7cyvu,Cool-Attorney-3240,A way for everyone to profit off bitcoin!!!,1 new cryptocurrency put on a website that is the same as bitcoin except to artificially drive up the price some bots act as supply and demand and the bots are programmed to cause the stock to go up a lot in a set amount of time. The number of coins is limited just like bitcoin and there are halvings to make it go faster or there are no halvings and the bots just drive it up it depends on what's most useful. So literally there's a cryptocurrency program to go up so everyone gets rich and everyone can profit from cryptocurrency. We also tell people when the stock will go back down so they all can cash out to the bots and any issue that the price might go back down the bots take care of.

Since the cold wallet was first created, there have been several forks where Bitcoin Cash and SV were created. After sweeping the bitcoin, what happens to the equivalent bitcoin cash and SV? Do they have to be swept separately as well? Also after sweeping, does that mean that no future forks will affect the bitcoins in the new wallet? Seems like another benefit of importing (rather than sweeping)/ leaving the bitcoin in cold storage is that if bitcoin forks again, there’s a bonus of new bitcoin iteration.

k8bdc6,disciplinedhodler,Abusive Parents,"One day there was a family of a drunken violent father and a charming manipulative witch of a mother. They had lots of children.


The father would go out and beat people. He formed a gang with his friends, recruited some of the kids that were like him and went out on a rampage. They had many rackets; protection, kidnap, you name it. But because the father was the meanest, badest, toughest guy you ever saw nobody could do anything. Some kids protested but found themselves beaten up, abused and locked away. The father and his gang got bigger and bigger, they needed better clubs and bats to whack people with. So the father looked toward the mother. 

The mother was a socialite. She and her friends had mastered the art of brainwashing and magic to such an extent that she could sign her name on a bits of paper and this paper was so enticing and magical people would do or make anything for it. She woukd dish it out to her friends, they could also make some themselves But being witches they were also greedy. So she said to the father: 

Give me an IOU that you will pay back with Interest. 

Sure, my gang and I will just collect from the kids. 

And so it began. The father got bigger, gave his chums some of that sweet magical paper to make bigger clubs with. Bribed some of the dumbass violent kids to join him and the rackets expanded. 

The mother did the same, she expanded her network by recruiting the intellectual but lazy and arrogant kids to her gang. 

Meanwhile the sweet, productive and innocent kids trusted their parents without question. First they worked for worthless grades written on bits of paper. Thus accustomed they grew up and churned out weird and wonderful inventions for worthless paper. 

The mother took those inventions and realized she did not even need paper any more she could just tap  large numbers onto the computer and the naive kids would giggle and dance happily, producing even more. 


The greedy mother kept doing so. Her gang of course benefited from her direct handouts and bought luxurious houses, cars, everything made by The Innocents. 

The father being in debt to the mother used any means possible to pay her back with interest. At first shouting at the innocents, then beating them, abusing them. Telling his chums not to pay them much. They did just that and more, keeping more and more for themselves. Private Jets, beach houses you name it, private islands, they would enjoy. Their rackets gor whackier, they closed down their genuine space program and gave the money to some of their chums in subsidies to run private space programs. They created false emergencies, they blew things out of proportion and awarded a kid who joined their gang 500 million dollars to create a car company.Then painted him as a one man genius IronMan inventor. All kinds of mania. 

The innocents worked harder and harder, but things got so expensive because of their parents' gangs. One day, with their sunken eyes and hollow expressions the kids all dragged themselves out of their dingy shared hovels and rat infested studio dungeons and: 

1. Committed suicide en masse 
2. Became violent in the street but got the shit kicked out of them
3. Discovered a magical little orange coin, created by one of their own. A coin that would one day grow up to liberate them. 

You choose the ending.

**Bitcoin**

**Controlling Bitcoin**

You don’t really “hold” bitcoins (BTC) or “have” them, instead you control them.

You control BTC with a private key, which is really just a very number. A number with nearly 80 digits. Sometimes this very big number is called a wallet, but let’s just call it the private key because there is something else that we are going to call a wallet.

You can receive BTC from others by publishing a non-secret very long number (commonly called a Bitcoin Address) that is generated with your private key. The BTC Address is really just a very long number that could only have been created with your private key.

You can send BTC that your private key controls by creating a transaction that says you give some amount of BTC to someone else’s BTC address. You use your secret key to mark the transaction as official in a process is called “signing” (which is short for “cryptographically signing.”)

**The Private Key**

Because the sending and receiving of BTC requires the private key, the PK is the most important piece of information related to your Bitcoins. This must always be kept secret, and must never be entered into any computer. Not in email. Not in text message. Never tell it to anyone over the phone.

This very big number would be hard to remember, even though it is critical to controlling your BTC, so the world invented an easy way to keep track of your private key. This way involves 24 short words. These words come from a pre-defined list sometimes known as the BIP39 word list. With the 24 words, there are many trustworthy hardware and software products that will help you recover your private key and thereby recover control over your BTC. These bits of hardware and software are sometimes called wallets, and unfortunately there is one more thing that can be called a wallet in the Bitcoin universe. Let’s only consider using a hardware device to recover your private key. If we do this, we can call it a hardware wallet for now.

Hardware wallets that can restore your private key from BIP39 words will only need the first four letters of each word, so backup copies of the 24 words often only contain 24 four-letter words. When you create a backup of the 24 four-letter words to be kept in a non-digital format, this is called “cold storage.” Cold storage 24 word lists should never be typed into a computer, phone, or any other digital device because it could lead to someone else gaining control of your private key, and therefore control over your BTC. Cold storage lists could be written on paper and kept in a safe or hidden around the home, but paper can be damaged by heat, water, and other physical forces. To avoid losing your cold storage backup, people often carve the 24 words into a piece of metal (such as titanium or steel) which will survive more damage than would a paper backup.

**The 25th Word**

There is one more layer of security that you can add to your 24 word list. This is sometimes called the 25th word, or Passphrase. This 25th word is something you come up with that is not necessarily on the BIP39 list. This 25th word can be up to 100 letters, and is case-sensitive. It becomes added “salt” for randomizing your private key, and using the 25th word makes it nearly impossible for someone to guess your private key. Using the 25th word is strongly recommended.

Going from a cold storage backup to a functioning hardware wallet can be done by following the manufacturer’s instructions. Remember: No one will ask you for your 24 words. Anyone that does is trying to steal from you.

If in doubt for which hardware device to use, go with Ledger.com. The Nano X is a nice device, and the Nano S is nearly as good at half the price. Either one will work.

**Software Wallets**

Once you have a hardware wallet setup with your 24 word (or 25 word) private key, you are ready to send or receive BTC. All of the BTC that you now control is sitting in one or more “confirmed transactions.” In this context “confirmed” means that the whole Bitcoin world (the blockchain) agrees that the transaction is valid, and “transaction” refers to the cryptographically signed transaction that I mentioned earlier that someone else created to send you the BTC.

To check the amount of BTC you control, you would have to look through every transaction in the history of Bitcoin, and that would be incredibly time-consuming and tedious. This is where a type of software that we will call a “wallet’ comes into play. You connect a “wallet” to your hardware wallet. In this setup, the hardware controls the private key, and the software wallet does the work of looking through the blockchain to tell you how many Bitcoins you control.

The other thing the software wallet does is to ask the hardware wallet to do the cryptographic work necessary for sending or receiving BTC. Receiving includes either creating a new non-secret very long number (BTC address), and sending involves the cryptographic signing of a transaction directing some of your BTC to go to someone else’s non-secret very long number (BTC address). A trustworthy wallet that you can download for Mac &amp; Windows is named Electrum.

**Summary**

* Find the 24 word backup. Never tell anyone the 24 words. Never type the 24 words into a computer.
* Get a Ledger Nano S
* Setup Nano S with the 24 word list. (This is the exception to typing in the 24 words.)
* If a 25th word is a part of the backup, setup a passphrase on the Nano S.
* Download Electrum and connect to Nano S.
* At this point you could spend BTC, or convert to USD.",1607315397,2,1

k8kwhg,InterestedCake,"How bitcoin would likely never replace fiat, and would only act as a liquid storage of value.","Disclaimer: I own bitcoin and am a believer of its value.

I'm just wondering what the general sentiment of people who believe in bitcoin is in terms of replacing fiat? Since in my opinion, bitcoin would never replace fiat as the mainstream currency due to the modern understanding and nature of economics. 

More specifically, bitcoin by nature is deflationary, and due to the limited supply, would ultimately increase in value if people were to believe in it and use it as a currency. And as much as people bash inflation, it is pretty much proven that for a healthy economy, a low level of inflation is a must, as the alternative, deflation, would only cause a regression of the economy. To illustrate this point, imagine that I told you that in a year the money you own would be able to purchase twice as much as you can today. Would you still buy anything today? What happens is that this deflation in money would make you hold on to your money instead of spending it. The implication for the overall economy is that no one ends up spending, production decreases, and the economy tanks. It is now believed that the great depression had to do with deflation.

On the same note, what I believe can be related to bitcoin is when the u.s. dollar was still under the gold standard. Under the gold standard the value of the dollar was tied directly to that of gold. The u.s. government could not print more money. The gold standard was eventually abandoned due to the great depression and a need for government stimulus. 

So what I am trying to say is that, we have already in history abandoned a system where the main form of currency retained its value, for the most part (the gold standard), due to the need of low levels of inflation in a healthy economy. I belive the value of bitcoin is that it provides a very liquid form of currency that also retains value. Of course, there's privacy and other benefits but I don't think they're too relevant for this discussion. It has its value but ultimately cannot replace fiat, since the whole reason we have fiat is because we realized that a currency that has limited supply has its flaws as being the major currency. 

Also, to me there seems to exist a paradox for the widespread adoption of bitcoin. For bitcoin to become mainstrain, people would actually have to spend it as a currency. However, with its value rising and the general commitment of the bitcoin community to hold on to their coins, people are incentivized not to spend the money; hence, it becomes hard for bitcoin to become mainstream.

I'm curious as to what others think. And do people believe that bitcoin will ultimately replace fiat. If so, how?",1607361769,13,1
k8ksif,Zrovavej,How to prepare for tax season?,"So I hear they're introducing laws (here in the U.S.) to make Bitcoin more taxable. I'm tech savvy but not enough to try my luck at tax evasion, so I'd better start taking note of whatever information they need. I originally assumed they would only care about how much profit I made, but then I saw a video that mentioned they also look at hold time so now I'm confused.

You can love him and you can hate him (or be the one that didn't get in time), but Bitcoin can't be ignored any longer.

Bitcoin's unique story alongside its tremendous network effect it wins makes it a coveted digital resource that even its great opponents can't help but rub their eyes out, gape their jaws and think about their thoughts as Bitcoin warms up for another round.

k8ixj2,Pickinanameainteasy,How anonymous is sending BTC from an exchange?,"So, I've been paying for things via BTC lately. But I want to make sure I can get the desired level of both privacy and economy.

What I did previously was purchase BTC with my debit card thru Cash App. I transferred the BTC to my wallet. Then transferred the BTC from my wallet to the recipient. Because I have multiple private keys, this transaction is very anonymous since on the blockchain one address received the BTC from cash app and a different address sent the BTC to the recipient (I may be totally wrong about this, so please correct me if I am).

From a privacy standpoint, this is great. However, economically it isn't great because in order to get the fastest approval, I need to pay high miner fees. Therefore a $3 purchase effectively becomes a $6 purchase.

However, if I purchase the BTC from cash app and transfer it directly from cash app to the recipient I can avoid these miner fees (bc I assume cash app handles that, idk). So, if I want to purchase with BTC, this seems like the logical thing to do but how does it affect my privacy?

If I send BTC directly from cash app to a recipient, how does it appear on the blockchain? Does it show Cash app's wallet sending the money to another wallet. Or does cash app create individual wallets for each person with a cash app account, and in turn that wallet's address is shown sending the money to the recipient (effectively identifying you)?

What is the preferred method to maintain privacy but at the same time be economically efficient?",1607355845,14,1

k9b2cd,TheRavenSayeth,"Warning: If you're on iOS and use Authy, OTP Auth, or the Yubikey Authenticator app with Touch ID then there is a Security hole wherein a new fingerprint can be added to gain access to your app. This may also apply to Face ID. Here are steps to check if your app has this same Security hole.","This is a flaw that's been around for a while with a number of apps. I have not tested this with Face ID, but odds are if the flaw exists in Touch ID then it also applies to Face ID since Apple implements the two systems in a similar way. 

Ideally when there are any changes made to your iPhone's Touch ID settings, any app that utilizes that feature should recognize the change and require your password to recertify you to the app. Some apps like LastPass and Bitwarden do this, in that if there are any changes to your Touch ID it should temporarily block using Touch ID to unlock the app [until you enter your master password](https://i.imgur.com/sD0yy3Q.jpg). This is useful because if someone gets your iPhone's PIN and adds their fingerprint to your settings, they won't suddenly get access to your password vaults.

These are just the apps that I've tested but it could apply to more authenticator or security apps. Test the app by:

1. Open the app and see that touch ID with your usual finger unlocks the app. Most people use their right thumb.

2. Go to your iPhone settings and add a new finger to the phone (try something like your left index finger). Assume this is an intruder's finger.

3. Open the app again and see if your left index finger unlocks the app. If it does then this is a problem. If it instead prompts you for your password again then the app is safe.


This problem isn't new and [Bitwarden had this flaw a few years ago](https://community.bitwarden.com/t/detect-changed-biometrics-fingerprint-and-re-prompt-for-master-password/704/5) until they finally fixed it. It worries me that apps based on security aren't taking this seriously, but if you want your finances to be secure and you use Touch ID at any stage in your security then make sure the app you're using detects changes in biometrics.",1607455707,7,1

k99cwo,DubiousGames,Where to buy BTC,"So I'm completely new to crypto, but am looking to invest 1 or 2k in bitcoin. I made a coinbase account and went through all the personal and bank verification steps. Throughout this, the bank limits on the account constantly fluctuated, and I was able to transfer about $500 onto the account. The limits then settled on the ridiculous $0/day for bank transfers, and $5/week for card transfers.

My credit score is great, and I have about $10k in my bank, but when I applied for a higher limit, it was rejected, and now I have to wait 30 days to reapply. This honestly feels like a joke, I mean, $5/week? It would take years to even invest the $2k i want to invest.

So because of that bullshit, and also because the coinbase website overall has seemed really glitchy (constantly removing and readding my ID verification, the changing limits, etc), I'm thinking of closing the account and buying the BTC somewhere else.

Any recommendations? Ideally I'd like the verification process to be fairly short (not more than 1 or 2 days) and most importantly, I'd like to actually be able to buy BTC with my money without arbitrarily low limits.

k97tyr,Rex_Scorpio,Bitcoin helping put me through graduate school,"Just wanted to share a story of how Bitcoin has helped me help others.

In 2016, frustrated with disparities in health care, I decided to leave a good paying job in the media to enroll in a psyd (clinical psychology doctorate) program. It’s an amazing program where I get to learn a ton and spend 20 hours a week working in community mental health. The only problem is that students in the program are not funded so we pay a fairly brutal tuition and have limited opportunities to earn income. 

In December 2017, I sold most of my Bitcoin preparing to begin school in fall 2018. Although I wanted to hodl, the timing could not have been better as the money essentially paid for the first year of my program. It truly felt like a miracle.

Now I am in year 3 of my program and still have a bit of Bitcoin left. This month has been a bit strained for my wife and I financially, and were it not for Bitcoin I would be far more stressed. I think we can hodl and make it to January, but the money is there if we need it. It’s possible the price could crash, but it would have to go pretty pretty far down in the next 25 days for us to be in trouble. So Bitcoin really feels like a security blanket during a needed time.

Just wanted to share this with the community. There are many stories in the media about people doing bad things with bitcoin or losing out on a big investment. But getting into Bitcoin has done nothing but help me along my desired path of working in the field of mental health :) Let’s all hodl to the moon :)",1607446387,6,1

k96gzg,mr_byu,"A lot of work is yet to be done. (Don't worry, optimistic post.)","Don't get me wrong, I also like to smoke some hopeium occasionally. I get excited watching the charts too. It would be (and will be) fun to go to the Moon. 

But allow me to share with you guys my recent thoughts on why I suggest a ""true bitcoiner"" should rather  pay attention to (and cheer for) the technological and infrastructural developments first and foremost. Price comes second, and always in the light of the former.

A ""true bitcoiner"" in my dictionary is someone who is in this whole adventure mainly for the sake of humanity. Someone who truly wants to see Bitcoin changing lives for the better.

Now, what I noticed is that many people here (myself often included tbh) come from the premise that Bitcoin is already perfect as it is, we just have to watch the slowpokes of the world slowly realize this, and then MOON TIME, BABY. 

But the thing is, technologycal advancements don't work this way.

Mr. Andreas M. Antonopoulos pointed out several times that technoligical breakthroughs don't just happen overnight. They require the steady improvement of the basic technology, the adaptation of infrastructure, user interface and other things. 

Simply put, **a lot of work is yet to be done** for Bitcoin and the whole crypto revolution to achieve their maximum potential. I mean real technical problems/barriers we still need to solve. We could (and probably should) make Bitcoin and the surrounding infrastructure more secure, more private, more intuitive to use, etc.

We will get there, I am sure. Just as it has been the case with the internet. But it takes time and real human effort. 

I think all of the ""crazy"" projections of the price of BTC (500k, etc.) are plausible – but plausible only if people smarter than most of us keep relentlessly working on this thing.

When I look at the price skyrocket, though I might get a little adrenaline rush for sure, I only allow mysfel to feel truly cheerful and proud if I feel that the price is a true representation of how and to what extent Bitcoin can actually change lives for the better.

If the price is higher than what I think is truly ""deserved"" at its current state, I get excited but cautious, too. We know that the nature of cyclical bubbles is that the price action keeps outpacing the reailty.  It's not inherently a bad thing but something to bear in mind.

Moral of the story: it's fun to cheer if BTC pumps. But please guys, if you let me give you a friendly advice: if you believe in Bitcoin, don't watch only its price and the institutional frenzy surrounding it. 

Listen to some tech people regularly, too. Listen to Andreas, for example.

It would seem to me that there would be a universal consensus here as long as it can be fully vetted properly through the community as being a viable option. 


Honestly this basic question has me more concerned than anything else as it seems obvious if that was the case then it would have already been done.  That said there must be other factors which I haven't considered. This is why I'm here today and posing the question to the community for your thoughts.


A few of the different reasons that I can come up with off the top would be one of the following scenarios:


1) QC is either currently not a threat and /or never will be to BTC 


and/or 


2) For some reasons we are not privy to the governments that can destroy BTC with their QC don't want to for some unbeknownst reasons. 


The second option seems counterintuitive since we all know that the banks control these entities and that they are the direct competition to bitcoin.",1607441783,11,1

k95iu4,belcher_,The first CoinSwap on testnet - Massive improvements to bitcoin privacy and fungibility are coming,"Imagine a future where a user Alice has bitcoins and wants to send them with maximal privacy, so she creates a special kind of transaction. For anyone looking at the blockchain her transaction appears completely normal with her coins seemingly going from address A to address B. But in reality her coins end up in address Z which is entirely unconnected to either A or B.

Now imagine another user, Carol, who isn't too bothered by privacy and sends her bitcoin using a regular wallet which exists today. But because Carol's transaction looks exactly the same as Alice's, anybody analyzing the blockchain must now deal with the possibility that Carol's transaction actually sent her coins to a totally unconnected address. So Carol's privacy is improved even though she didn't change her behaviour, and perhaps had never even heard of this software.

This undetectable privacy can be developed today by implementing CoinSwap. I've been working on implementing this for the last few months.

Today is a big day: **the first multi-transaction CoinSwaps created on the bitcoin testnet.**

The user (let's call her Alice) sent 0.05 tBTC split up over three transactions:

https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/74a584b6ac8c1adb3cdbbe745fb50a75d9ba38072867452fa21a788629cc444e

https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/adbd17a703d47783f681ea16e947d12d9b9a6855e3b393e4b384c527f0d91ede

https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/493770838b8fae159e245eeb990d3dcb23b7a8357031d03d864b8272e8caea08

These transactions don't look particularly special (which is the point), but they are CoinSwaps. Following the CoinSwap protocol, those coins are transferred off-chain to the market maker Bob. Even though the coin are unspent at the time of writing, they are unilaterally controlled by Bob.

In return Bob sent coins back to Alice also in three transactions:

https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/a5f76805a088aedff2e4cc49c6933d99883dcac447d1032a7530cf40cf49432e

https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/6944b32f9a8388c5a0e706cdfd1f91ec4a8897a35476b4ccf536513894ade0d9

https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/5334036eda24d265fc2adee37e52c9216a7e108b3ddbe7a550bd9f71d693349c

Bob sent 0.0499 tBTC to Alice, again with the CoinSwap protocol and so those coins are actually possessed by Alice now. The difference between 0.05 tBTC and 0.0499 tBTC is the fee which Bob earns to provide him an incentive (In the real world the fee would be set by market forces, the 0.001 tBTC used here is just an example).

This privacy protocol is non-custodial. Alice and Bob are not able to steal each other's money at any point in this process. Because of the low risk of theft we can expect market forces to push the CoinSwap fees down very low, in the same way that fees for creating CoinJoins today on JoinMarket are very low.

Using multiple transactions (three in this example) is needed to avoid amount correlation. Alice made a CoinSwap for 0.05 tBTC but nowhere on the blockchain is the actual value 0.05 tBTC found, instead any surveillance analyst spy would see the values 0.02919015, 0.01233641 and 0.00847344 for Alice and 0.01286471, 0.02457554 and 0.01245975 for Bob. Those numbers can be generated randomly using any algorithm, and the surveillance analyst spy would have a very hard time figuring out that the transactions are related at all.

These example CoinSwaps have a visible 2-of-2 multisig address. But the plan is to later use a protocol called ECDSA-2P which allows us to create 2-of-2 multisig addresses that look the same as regular single-signature addresses. This allows CoinSwaps to blend in with the rest of the bitcoin transactions out there. Even the old-style p2pkh addresses starting with 1 can be CoinSwap addresses.

CoinSwap is the next generation of bitcoin on-chain privacy tech. It improves on CoinJoin because it provides much greater privacy, and even improves the privacy of people who don't use it. CoinSwap also uses less block space and therefore is cheaper in miner fees.

The future of bitcoin privacy and fungibility is bright. I continue to work on this project every day.

k9o2gv,oriok92,A financial system bailed out,"Fractional reserve banking is not exactly how the banking system operates right now, to understand how the banking system works, it would be interesting to analyze the baking structure through a credit lending process and unwrap step by step all financial engineering build on the background.

To make it as simple as possible, let’s simulate the process of an individual taking out a mortgage to buy a house, since the currency is borrowed from a commercial bank (buyer) to the transaction of the currency to another bank (seller), the seller's deposit account. Every step visualized in both balance sheets of the commercial banks.

At first the loan is created when the customer borrows currency, the balance sheet of the buyer bank looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v64u5nrbe4461.png?width=463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a54107296c2ecfec9f61259e6ae8f728d0385a28

In the asset side of the commercial bank appears the loan, in the liability side, the borrower's account is credited with a new deposit. At this moment money is created out of nothing with the loan matching the other side of the balance sheet. Bank deposits are simply a record of how much the bank itself owes its customers. So, they are a liability of the bank, not an asset that could be lent out. Realize that the bank’s business model relies on receiving a higher interest rate on the loans (or other assets) than the rate it pays out on its deposits. It is important to mention that the repayment of this loan exempting the interest, destroys the same amount.

Proceeding with the house purchase, this is how the transaction between banks look like when the house buyer and the seller settle the transaction:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1kfe1kgde4461.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd5583695fb03a1120eac719df84a430a3c7807c

As seen in the figure, deposits are transferred to the seller’s bank along with reserves, which the buyer’s bank uses to settle the transaction. Unfortunately for the buyer bank settling all transactions in this way would be unsustainable, the buyers bank could run out of reserve to meet possible outflows or reserve requirements which fixes a Deposit/Reserve ratio limiting potential loan demand.

Under this scenario, a withdrawal or a potential loan lent, could place the buyer's bank under the minimum reserve requirement. Being a commercial bank in this position, it is necessary to borrow liquidity in the repo market. Also, banks with excess reserves are in the opposite situation, lending liquidity in the repo market in exchange of earnings.

The Repo market is an over the counter (OTC) market where financial products are traded between two parties in exchange of cash, generally treasuries as are the pristine collateral with low risk. This is how the exchange looks like between two entities:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5cib1fyee4461.png?width=1287&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=198da019490f6352513da5e525e4626c58488543

Institutional investors lend cash in exchange of collateral typically T-Bonds as we mentioned, after a short maturity generally a few days the bank buys-back the treasury at a slightly higher price, earning the counterpart a little profit.

To keep in context with the FED policies, central bank uses net transactions data reported by commercial banks for a particular computation period (few weeks) to calculate reserve requirements applying the reserve ratios. If the commercial bank reserve is less than the reserve requirement, it must borrow from the discount window. That means borrowing directly from the central bank which lends at an interest rate usually 1% higher than the repo market rate. Basically, it is much cheaper to borrow from the repo market than directly from the central bank.

On September 2019 a disruption in the repo market led to a sharp spike in short-term interest rates, shown in the chart below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/42inz20ge4461.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4752e353263d3f95ce376d28f0dde9f3d03ff2ce

As we described before, trying to find liquidity to cover lack of reserves, commercial banks found out this scenario. Institutions refused to lend for treasuries and asked a higher rate, as a consequence, the rise in liquidity demand made the repo rate to sky-rocket forcing the central bank to step in.

Realize that liquidity problems were already hitting the economy even before the COVID crises. This reveal how commercial banks are in the edge of insolvency as they need liquidity to keep issuing loans that make them earn with some interest and keep the business afloat.

However, like in 2008, the FED intervened with Quantitative easing (QE) program. This monetary policy tool is not necessarily inflationary as the general public believe. In this situation is generally used to recapitalize the banking sector. Let’s draw how a commercial bank balance sheet looks like after a central bank QE purchase:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pftqv6qhe4461.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34eadbfc66b50719f98f17749405315acef17678

Notice that central bank liabilities are the same reserves as the commercial bank’s assets during all the process, reserves are under the central bank umbrella. At first, the bank is under the minimum reserve requirement and owns all kinds of assets (T, MBS…). In this case a treasury, and the FED is directly purchasing it, adding the asset in its balance sheet and creating reserves out of nowhere in its liabilities side which mirrors the commercial bank’s assets. As we mentioned before this is not directly inflationary but provides the commercial bank with new reserves extending the loan facility to a new level, QE basically greases the printing machine.

Additionally, QE is used to manipulate interest rates. The chart below shows how interest rates are adjusted according to the increase or decrease of bank reserves. When reserves grow, interest rates decrease. And when reserves decrease interest rates rise.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pglzxc0le4461.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b761653066f05c6835f58946a004524716aaf2cf

So, QE is also implemented to keep interest rates low to incentive corporations to borrow. As interest rates goes to 0% demand for credit grows.

The following chart shows how interest rates are kept artificially low as the big debt cycle is broken since 2008.

k9mf0q,bitfufu_2020,BitFuFu- the world's first hashrate standardization platform will be launched on December 15,"In 2021, the starting point for any newcomer in the cryptocurrency industry may start with BTC at 20,000 dollars each. Bitcoin price has increased by 140% in 2020 while higher price will inevitably bring new ""innovators"" in the industry. BitFuFu, the world's first standardized hashrate mining platform, applies hashrate standardization as the core element for pricing. Users can select mining products based on production efficiency more conveniently and intuitively. Meanwhile, the platform's hashrate products have achieved the first-class standard in the cloud mining industry: one-click orders, no need to go through those complicated steps such as selecting proper mining machines and mines, machine maintenance, mining pools connection, etc., Users can get bitcoins at a low cost.

&amp;#x200B;

Standardization of hashrate = multiple models of the same series are intelligently proportioned into units with the same standard power consumption (energy efficiency ratio). 

&amp;#x200B;

What does hashrate standardization mean to users?

At present, the market competition in the cloud mining industry is very fierce, and more and more cloudy hashrate platforms are emerging, and the good ones and the bad ones are mixed in the industry. Both new and old ""miners"" are well aware that the pricing of cloud hashrate contracts on various platforms is uneven, and it is difficult for users to define the impact of mining output caused by messy conditions and multiple variables. The development of the industry requires different platforms to compete, and the transparency of mining output of different products requires standardized measurement.  However, the current process of ""standardization"" is just a ""draft"" or “slogan"".

&amp;#x200B;

Hashrate is an abstract digital commodity along with the birth of Bitcoin. Because of the different types and qualities of bulk commodities (such as soybeans), it is difficult to trade if they are not quantified or classified at the same standard.

&amp;#x200B;

Take soybean products as an example which are traded frequently. When soybean products enter the market, they must be standardized. For example, when buyers and sellers trade soybeans, the contract terms are formulated by the international market platform. For example, the trading time, the unit quantity of soybeans corresponding to the first-hand order, the type of soybean products, and the quality are all standardized on the platform. Both parties only need to buy and sell based on price, without considering the quantity of soybeans, product types, quality standards, etc. For users, commodity standardization avoids messy conditions and multiple variable factors, and only needs to pay attention to commodity price changes. Commodity standardization not only enhances the transparency of commodity prices, but also regulates industry standards, reduces the asymmetry of information between parties to transactions, and increases industry openness. Therefore, the answer to the standardization of the cloud mining industry is hashrate standardized products, so that the market price of hashrate will be more transparent, and users will be more convenient and intuitive when selecting and trading.

&amp;#x200B;

What is BitFuFu's standardized hashrate product?

The core indicator of the mining machine for digital currency output is the energy consumption ratio (J/T), which is also the only indicator of product standardization. The energy efficiency ratio (J/T) of each model of the mining machine of different brands currently on the market is not the same.

&amp;#x200B;

BitFuFu combines multiple models with similar energy efficiency ratios through the BitFuFu efficient hashrate allocation center and smart matching backstage to package multiple models into a 30, 40, 50 and other series of standardized hashrate products. Customers only need to pay attention to each series. The energy efficiency ratio can be traded without having to choose different brands and different models of mining machines. Taking the '30 series' as an example, this series mainly includes the Antminer S19Pro model, S19 model and other mining machine models of about 30J/T, and the ""30 series"" standardized package which is obtained by intelligent proportioning of multiple models.

&amp;#x200B;

Standardized hashrate products allow users to calculate and select mining output more conveniently and intuitively. For the industry, more efficient hashrate product transactions and circulation promote the healthy development of the industry. For partners, mining machine manufacturers and mining farms in the market are also easier to settle, and the platform will soon be online for hashrate trading and direct operation of multi-power mining farms.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to innovative product design and technical capabilities, BitFuFu still has the general advantages of cloud computing platform:

The mining output is transparent. The BITFUFU platform provides mining services through real mining machines. The platform connects to the designated mining pool according to the user's instructions, and the mining pool directly distributes the digital currency mining output to the user's Cobo wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

The choice of hashrate is flexible. Compared with the traditional mining and hosting business model, the purchasing threshold of the BITFUFU service is lower, started from 10T hashrate. On the basis of more flexible selection, BITFUFU provides a very competitive combination of long and short periods. Therefore, their advantage is quite obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

To make purchases and leases safer, the BITFUFU platform selects the world’s leading mining machine manufacturers, such as Bitmain, Shenma, and Yibang; and unites domestic and overseas compliant mines, which are located in Russia, the United States, Xinjiang, China, and Sichuan, China. Relevant documents are reviewed by the platform to ensure supplier compliance; using the 7\*24 smart mine operation and maintenance system, after the purchase is completed, the hashrate will be allocated to users automatically. The real-time power failure detection will allow users to be compensated automatically; By cooperating with F2tPool, a world-class mining pool, to improve the security and stability of cloud mining products and services, BITFUFU make every user worry-free. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Standardization of hashrate, transparency of mining output, flexibility of hashrate selection, and security of purchase and lease"", BITFUFU is committed to providing global users with true, stable, convenient and safe global TOP-level cloud mining services. The platform will be launched globally on December 15, so stay tuned.",1607494025,2,1

k9kqxn,Tyrell-WIllick,Question About Cold Wallet,"Greetings,

I understand that the concept of cold wallet is a Bitcoin storage that it is to kept your assets offline in a device that never reaches the Internet (unless it is to sync its transactions and its amount with the blockchain in case it needs to be recovery using the seed) On the other hand, a hot wallet is a Bitcoin storage that is constantly connected to the Internet ready to send and receive bitcoins either in an online exchange or in your personal Bitcoin wallet on your phone. 


I am thinking on creating a Tails boot device in my USB, encrypt it using a strong pass phrase, set up electrum, and save the seed. I will generate plenty Bitcoin addresses and save them in a text file to use them every time I want to send bitcoins to my cold storage wallet.


Will I find a problem over time when sending money to old addresses?

Will I encounter any problem at the moment I want to sync my electrum wallet to the blockchain after a long time?",1607487375,11,1

I recently moved my HSA from index funds into GBTC last month, bought in when the premium was 22.8% at $20.16 a share.

I also recently did an annual transfer from my employers HSA into Fidelity, so have a chunk of money I'm looking to invest.

Question is - I'm wondering if I buy in now with the premium at 23% - is this likely to drop considerably next year with a Fidelity ETF? And even if it does, if Bitcoin moons (which everyone seems to say it will do in 2021) - does the potential drop in the premium not really matter if the price of bitcoin goes up to say $40k or $50k (or more)? 

Other option is just sticking it in index funds, but I don't really want to do this! If Bitcoin moons I'll feel like an idiot for not putting it in GBTC. However if it doesn't and I do put it in GBTC and the premium drops down to like 5 or 10% - then this also isn't great. 

At the moment I'm thinking I'll just DCA over the next 30 days or so into GBTC - but would love to hear others thoughts - I'm still a newb in the space :D

kadhf1,facepalm5000,Fiat funhouse mirror merry-go-round,"After continuing to go down the rabbit hole, it feels more and more like so much of the economy (so many companies and startups) is pointless. Do we REALLY need more engaging social media? Do we REALLY need more cashback credit card deals? Do we REALLY need better amazon recommendations? Are we actually creating value or just shuffling cash around while wasting time and slowly becoming poorer as a society via relentless inflation, taxation and capital misallocation?

**Inflation:** With fiat currencies being randomly inflated at large and unpredictable rates each year (6% last year, 20% this year for the covid bailouts), how are companies and individuals supposed to make real economic choices on where to best allocate time and resources? when prices are stabilized/manipulated/inflated, how can companies really know if they're even creating value or just riding a ponzi inflation wave created by central-bank-debt-monetization-powered deficit spending?

**Misallocation:** Furthermore, even if companies and individuals are making a profit, if they hold their savings in fiat, it's just an icecube melting away. So then we all need to take on the risk and cost of actively investing money into stocks/bonds/mutual funds/etc. We then take on market and economic risk. If we hold a sizable amount of stock in company X (because we couldn't just hold it as money), then we now have to care about how company X is doing. This is a distraction for someone who just wants to store their savings. I'd agree with Saifedean that the vague awareness we all have that prices will go up next year so we should spend the money this year, creates a mild (or moderate) but ubiquitous anxiousness in most people that their money is not safe just sitting in a savings account. They are forced to deploy that money even when they would have otherwise preferred to just save it. So then they deploy it hastily, on things of little lasting value (they waste the money buying stupid shit because that's a better option than just losing 10% of the purchasing power next year).

**Taxes:** Beyond that, even after we find a way to effectively invest our savings, we get taxed up, down, left and right. Income tax, property tax, capital gains tax, sales tax, excise tax, etc.  The taxes themselves are bad, but what's worse is that we don't even have a guarantee that all the tax money will be put to a useful purpose. The tax money go into a giant black hole with no guarantee of value provided for money, nearly zero accountability and nearly zero transparency. 

So it feels like we're all colluding in a massive game of resource misallocation musical chairs. And it seems strange that more people aren't viewing manipulated monetary policy as a bigger issue. 

More and more, Bitcoin just looks like an ocean of clarity, sanity and calm compared to the funhouse mirror merry-go-round of fiat.

Stack sats. Put them on ice. Opt out. Full stop.

kabbnn,Giagle,2 Years ago Exchange Bankruptcy CUBITS from UK,"Hey guys, as the title said on this day 2 years ago I lost 1 btc and 7 ltc to the exchange CUBITS in UK (iam from Germany).

Long story short, my bad was back then the price dropped and I was to unpatient to wait it out (biggest financial mistake of m life) and I transfered it to cubits. ONE FUCKING DAY later the exchange went offline and till this day they are under investigations.

The moment after I transfered it I had a bad feeling and wanted to send it to my coinbase. Didn't worked. I think they wanted to keep as much worth of currency as possible. I then heard the fraud happened to them back in February 2018 but they still accepted transactions till this day I did it.

So that was 2 years ago, since then I didn't invested, didn't followed the price etc because I couldn't believe my ""bad luck"", but of courses it was my fault (no patient, not a home-country based exchange, afraid of the price dropping etc.)

Since it's 2 years ago it's still bothering me of course, but I just wanted to know here if there is by chance anybody who was at this exchange back then and if, how do you see this case?

For anyone else, keep you're coins safe, don't make the fucking failers I did.

Cheers",1607586757,6,1

Since by some projections there will be as many as 4-6 million lost BTCs by the time the last ones are produced, I'm wondering if anyone is working on a way to find them. I mean, if they exist through a key, then just like passwords or credit card details, maybe they can be 're-generated' or hacked by simply running an algorithm that tests all possible combinations of letters and numbers until a combination yields a BTC balance. I mean, even if you ran an algorithm that took a very long time, it would be financially worthwhile.

 \- If you send your entire balance there’s one less output, because you don’t need to have any coin returned to your wallet

ka6qhp,Akael,Why would an angel investor require the company they are investing in to be invested in Bitcoin and blockchain?,"I hope this question is appropriate, I really don't know where else to turn.

I have a business relationship with a client, and they are getting a very large investment from an angel investor. This investor though is requiring they invest from $10-20 million US dollars in blockchain investments, and bitcoin.

This particular company has an FDA approved drug, and have been getting lots of big offers trying to buy the drug from them. This would be highly lucrative, but they are more interested in marketing and selling it themselves. 

This seems a bit weird to me that this would be a requirement, but I really don't know enough to understand why this would even be a thing.

Before I get preached at, I know the rules:

- Don't keep coins on an exchange.

- Don't trust Coinbase.

- No private key, no coins.

I know... I know.  Honestly, from 2013 - 2017, I was actively buying and trading BTC like crazy.  I was also buying items online with BTC.  I put some in cold storage.  

I left the .5 BTC on Coinbase for these reasons:

- In case I needed easy access, I figured it would be easier than pulling it out of cold storage

- At the time, it was only worth $500, not thousands.

- As time went on and it grew in value, I became obsessed with the thought, ""If I take it out, I have to tell my tax guy and pay taxes.  I don't know when exactly I bought this particular .5 bitcoin because I buy and sell and trade all the time.""  

- Around 2017, I sort of lost interest in BTC.  I still follow the subreddit and prices, but I haven't bought any in forever now.  I have probably only logged into Coinbase 2 or 3 times since 2017 just to check in.  (I checked recently and my BTC is still there.)

I have debated cashing it in, but I'd like to hodl just a little while longer.  However, I fear the government won't understand I am still hodling and they'll expect me to pay taxes.

Essentially, MicroStrategy is looking to borrow money in order to purchase more Bitcoin

Business intelligence company MicroStrategy is looking to go even deeper down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, and now says it plans to raise $400 million through the issuance of convertible senior notes. MicroStrategy plans to offer the notes, which will mature on December 15, 2015, to »qualified institutional buyers«.


The company plans to use the capital to purchase more Bitcoin:

Essentially, MicroStrategy is looking to borrow money in order to purchase more Bitcoin. Buyers of the notes will be entitled to bi-yearly interest payments. Starting with December 23, the notes will become convertible to cash, shares in MicroStrategy, or both .

my  question is first if its possible to recover, i see mixed responses  when i try to search for others who had a similar experience, its a 120gb samsung SSD

and 2nd how do i  go about explaining to the data recovery professionals that i want my  wallet recovered without telling them its actually bitcoin to protect  myself?

I’m a Canadian currently living in Japan and have a decent amount of BTC.

Needless to say, I’d leave Japan before I ever considered doing that. As of right now, in Canada I’d only have to pay capital gains taxes on it.

Here’s the question. If I were to move back to Canada tomorrow, once I officially relinquish my Japanese work visa and declare I’ve moved back to Canada, how long would I have to wait before I could sell the BTC in Canada and pay taxes on it there?

**\[video\]**

I'm pretty new to Bitcoin and learning every day. I share my findings on my YouTube channel and in my latest video I share my findings on the topic of whether Bitcoin can be counterfeited.

Check it out here please: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPwY4Fj72G4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPwY4Fj72G4).

Would love to hear your thoughts!

If you prefer to read instead of watching a video I've got you covered; the full transcript of the video you find below.

**\[in text - transcript of video\]** 

So, Noncounterfeitability basically means that the money cannot be duplicated into a fake one. 

For instance, the government is trying to keep people from creating and using counterfeited dollars.

For one, it's illegal to use counterfeit money. 

Secondly, the government does its best to use watermarks, etcetera to distinguish the fake one from the real one.

But is there a way for us as ordinary people to distinguish a fake dollar bill from a real one?

If I go to the closest supermarket and I pay with a 50 euro paper bill, they use a device to check if it's real.

It's the same thing with gold, silver, or any other precious metal.

If someone would give you a golden bar, can you tell if it's real or not? Probably not. You need an expert to tell you if it's the real deal.

So, is there a possibility of counterfeiting Bitcoin?

I've gone through the rabbit hole on the internet of finding a solid answer to this question but every video or article I find has its own spin to it.

What I keep hearing repeatedly is people talking about the so-called 51% Bitcoin attack, and I think this is what we need to look at when finding an answer to whether bitcoin can be counterfeited.

To explain what the 51% attack means, you need to understand how the blockchain works.

As I mentioned in the previous video, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of computers, are mining Bitcoin.

Mining Bitcoin is somewhat the same as playing the lottery. 

They all are trying to guess the winning number. This winning number is also called a hash, and that's something to keep in mind as we dive deeper into this.

Every 10 minutes on average, the Bitcoin code creates a new winning number, or a so-called hash, that the mining machines are trying to guess.

The moment a machine guesses the correct hash, a new block is created with all its new Bitcoin transactions.

That new block will be added at the end of all the 600,000+ blocks already in existence. All those blocks in total are what they call the blockchain of Bitcoin.

You must understand that guessing the correct number or hash is as difficult if not more difficult than winning the lottery.

The big advantage mining machines have to us as buying 1 lottery ticket is that they can guess the correct number many times per second. 

The number of guesses the machine can make per second is called its hash rate.

This hash rate principle is fundamental to understand when it comes to Bitcoin's security or other cryptocurrencies, for that matter.

My computer's graphic card, for instance, has a hash rate of around 52,000 Kilohash per second. It means it can make 52,000,000 guesses or hashes per second.

If you visit the website blockchain.com you see the estimated hash rate per second for Bitcoin. 

Currently, the estimated hash rate per second for Bitcoin for all the computers combined is 129 E hash per second. 

I don't know what E stands for, but I do know it's the third enlarging step of a billion. 

In other words, 1 E hash per second is not 1 billion hashes per second.

It is also not 1 trillion hashes per second.

It's also not 1 quadrillion hashes per second.

1 E hash per second means 1 quintillion hashes per second. It's a million times a million. 

[https://coinsutra.com/hash-rate-or-hash-power/](https://coinsutra.com/hash-rate-or-hash-power/) 

Every second, all the computers combined make a million times a million guesses to win the lottery ticket.

And that times 129.

Coming back to my single graphic card, that's close to 2.5 million of my graphic cards working every single second.

Why is this hash rate so crucial for the security of Bitcoin?

Well, the more hashing power there is, the greater its security.

We now know that all the computer power is used to guess the right hash every single second. The moment the correct hash is found, a new blockchain block is created with its transactions.

Now we are circling back to the 51% attack discussed a few minutes ago.

To cheat the system and counterfeit Bitcoin, one needs to have 51% of all its computing power. 

In other words, to fake Bitcoin, they need to have the computing power that can generate around 66 E hashes per second.

That's close to 1.3 million high-end graphic cards working every single second.

Many experts say it's impossible to organize such an attack due to its size in hash rate. You will need so much computing power, which will cost you billions of dollars in hardware and electricity costs.

Furthermore, if one would find 51% of all the hash rates of Bitcoin, it would be way more profitable to just choose to mine Bitcoin instead of attacking it. 

There won't be a financial incentive to do such a thing, they say.

Some say governments could do such a thing when they feel threatened by Bitcoin. They don't need a financial incentive; they just want to destroy Bitcoin.

On the other hand, if governments were trying to eliminate Bitcoin, they probably would rather use laws to prevent Bitcoin from growing any further instead of organizing a 51% attack.

In short, the 51% attack means that one can create an alternate version of Bitcoin's blockchain where you could be double spending your Bitcoins.

In other words, it's somewhat the same as creating fake dollar bills. 

If you want to know more about how this works precisely, I suggest you Google '51% attack Bitcoin.'

The most important thing to remember here is that when such an event would occur, it means Bitcoin isn't that safe as all Bitcoin supporters had envisioned it would be.

Some experts say Bitcoin won't fall in price when such an event happens because they know soon enough when a 51% attack took place and take appropriate actions. Not sure what those actions will be, but okay ...

While others say, Bitcoin will be worthless when a 51% attack occurs.

I don't know who's right, and I think no one knows because it hasn't happened yet with Bitcoin.

There are 51% attacks that were successful on other cryptocurrencies. Still, those are a lot smaller in hash rate than Bitcoin and, therefore, easier to attack. If you Google '51% attack cryptocurrency' for instance, you will find more information about it.

All-in-all, I can't do much else than to believe the experts on this, and again, they say it's impossible to organize such an attack on Bitcoin due to its hash rate size. Furthermore, there's no financial incentive to do so, they say.

Therefore, I give Bitcoin a 5 out of 5-star rating for the 4th characteristic of good money.

Please let me know in the comments what you think of this. Do you think Bitcoin can be counterfeited? And if so, would that mean the end of Bitcoin?

I also would like to know what you think of my attempt to explain Bitcoin as a total beginner. 

Since I'm pretty new to Bitcoin and blockchain in general, there's a chance I was wrong in one or more of my conclusions. Please let me know if that is the case.

Would appreciate anyone weighing in on a discussion I had with a CFA. We are both crypto holders and are very bullish on the 2021 outlook however one question we could not find the answer to.

Could bitcoin be perpetually depressed by an establishment ie the FED ( who has been buying corporate bonds to prop up the market and are slowly starting to buy corporate debt) In an effort to discredit crypto currency (Bitcoin) could they not also engage in the unlimited shorting of Bitcoin futures that only need to be settled in FIAT. My understanding of shorting bitcoin is the short seller does not need to borrow the actual underlying asset (Bitcoin) they only need to provide the cash settlement equivalent to Bitcoin's market price. Because of the limited supply of Bitcoin and the ever growing supply of FIAT, what is stopping a government from filling market orders and driving down the price?",1607733508,5,1

kbc881,just_acceptance,Questions that need answering - TL;DR: Why Bitcoin?,"I have been in the crypto scene for a while and have had various cryptos. I understand why people like cryptocurrencies and hate fiat currency. I do too. However, I don't quite understand why Bitcoin is king. 

Some questions...

* The future is increasingly green and people want to use sustainable energy. Bitcoin uses a lot of energy almost none of which is sustainable energy. Why would this not result in people going to a more eco-friendly crypto?
* How can people be confident the transaction fee from mining will be enough to power the network after block rewards are gone?
* Do we really want to live in a world where Bitcoin is the king currency and store of value and those who hold it are extremely wealthy and the wealth gap expands dramatically? This would no doubt lead to an angrier and more troublesome world.
* If governments create their own cryptocurrencies and supply happens to be finite, wouldn't that tank Bitcoin's usage, price etc? 

I don't take first mover advantage as a great point either. The first social media network had that, too.

I would really appreciate answers to these, especially any which aren't along the lines of 'if you don't understand, sorry', since this is what I sometimes get as a response. Thanks :)

kc9ljz,lazarus_free,"When sending BTC to an exchange, use Samourai's Ricochet to avoid being blacklisted","An interesting feature of Samourai Wallet is 'Ricochet' which basically automatically adds 5 hops to your transaction before sending it to its intended destination.

This is useful when sending Bitcoin back to an exchange because normally chain analysis companies look for blacklisted addresses within the last 4 hops. So imagine you receive some BTC which has been in an illegal activity 2 hops ago, then if you send to the exchange you may be blacklisted.

Now, not all exchanges do that, there's no need for alarm. I have sent many times from exchanges and back and tested sending coins after a Coinjoin or exchanging to Monero and back and then sending and never had a problem with my exchange. So no need to be paranoid.

However, if you want to be sure, just use Ricochet. It calculates the total fee of adding 5 hops, lets you choose the priority, and it will automatically keep bouncing your coins 5 times until final destination.

Obviously can take a bit more time but worth it when sending back to exchanges.

To use it: as easy as when sending tick 'ricochet' in Samourai Wallet.

Xinjiang also happens to be the site of [the largest incarceration of an ethnic minority since Nazi Germany](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/china-cables-the-largest-incarceration-of-a-minority-since-the-holocaust-1.4089726) a fact recognized and well documented by every major media across the planet including the [Chinese government itself.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html). 

Now here is where it gets tricky. Miners flock to this region attracted by cheap electricity rates which is paid to the local government there, along with kickbacks, taxes and other fees, as is typical of doing business there. Now its noteworthy to point out that this is the same local government that is running [modern day concentration camps.](https://www.vox.com/2020/7/28/21333345/uighurs-china-internment-camps-forced-labor-xinjiang). So any  money paid out here eventually all flows into the same government coffers.   
  
Essentially means that the likelyhood of a portion of our transaction fees eventually going towards funding [modern day slavery is quite high.](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/uyghurs-sale).
  
There is a certain dark irony in the knowledge that a lofty concept like bitcoin, which was intended to inspire and represent a kind of  freedom across borders is in fact inadvertently playing a role in accomplishing the exact opposite.

kc63cl,consideranon,Gold is just a meme coin.,"""A [meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) is an idea, behavior, or style that becomes a fad and spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme.""

I've seen the argument floating around that bitcoin isn't anything special. That it's just a meme coin. It's value generated from rampant speculation and cult like adherence to the idea. Fueled by actual internet memes. Eventually, the music will stop and it will all come crashing down. 

The exact same argument applies to gold.

Gold is a meme. You can try to argue that gold has intrinsic value. It can be used for jewelry and electronics. Sure. But it's worth $10 trillion because most of it is sitting underground in vaults. And it's sitting in those vaults because damn near the entire human species has been infected by the gold meme. We all think gold is valuable, so we're willing to trade our time and the stuff we don't need for gold based on the shared delusion that we'll be able to trade it in for stuff we do need at a later time. Gold is valuable because a critical mass and network of humans believe it to be. 

Bitcoin is a meme. There's nothing intrinsic about it that makes this particular, absolutely scarce cryptocurrency worth orders of magnitude more than every other one. It was just the first mover, and therefore, it has an unassailable, viral network effect that has proven impossible to overcome. Bitcoin is the meme that's infected all of our brains, is starting to infect institutional investors, and will continue to spread at an increasing rate and eventually infect the whole planet. 

And the gold meme is dying. 

Why the hell would I want to store value by way of buying and holding a heavy, clunky piece of metal that I can lose, have stolen, be readily counterfeited, is a pain in the ass to trade, and that isn't absolutely scarce? Not only that, but because gold is overloaded with the store of value use case, we get far less value from its actual physical utility (e.g. electronics, dental work, jewelry, etc) than we could. What technologies would be economically viable if gold only cost $20/oz rather than $1800? 

On the other hand, bitcoin weighs nothing, I can keep it in geographically distributed backups, store it in my brain, transfer it to anyone on the planet relatively instantly for a dollar of fees, and it's provably, absolutely scarce. And it's not useful for anything other than money, so we not missing out on the economic utility of a physical resource that we lock away underground. 

Once you 'get' the bitcoin meme, you realize how immensely powerful it is compared to the gold meme. Tech people 'got' it first, because we were able to understand the cryptographic and distributed system well enough to trust that it wasn't just a scam. Now, non tech people are starting to 'get' it too, in part due to the fact that it just isn't dying like all the naysayers predicted, but also due to an increasing network of trustworthy individuals giving it their stamp of approval. 

Slowly, then suddenly.

2.

In other words, the pool absorbs all the risk from how much mining rewards the pool actually earns.

If 1-2 are true, then, for a given miner, the question whether to mine or not simply becomes a question of whether the cost of running the mining equipment and paying the pool fees is less than or greater than the current mining reward which depends on the current price of Bitcoin.

kc1snd,SpockSays,I wish someone explained it to me like this years ago...,"“Investing” in bitcoin isn’t the correct way to think about it, in my humble opinion. What you would actually be doing is “saving”. Instead of saving your value/monetary purchasing power in inflationary dollars (or whatever other fiat relevant to your locality), you have the option to save your value with disinflationary btc. It’s simply a better monetary vehicle to hold and/or increase your purchasing power in for long term savings. Just dollar cost average with small amounts of cash that you do not need to spend and want to save. Slowly watch your stack of btc grow in both units and in value over time.

If it helps understanding, I do not consider owning gold investing either… Gold is simply a harder monetary instrument over dollars. And further, btc is a harder monetary instrument over gold.

The term “investing” makes sense in the context of putting money into a business, stocks, or some mechanism for cash flow, etc... not in savings via various monetary instruments.

The main psychological hurdle to overcome is fully switching your personal unit of account to bitcoin as the monetary unit that is the goal post to increase the number of. Not USD or whatever other inflationary fiat.

Everything in the normal economy is denominated in fiat, especially taxes. That’s fine. Earn your fiat as income and spend your fiat for all your expenses. Pay your taxes in fiat.

Every time you sell bitcoin, you are activating a capital gains tax event, which is not ideal and only hurting yourself in the long term. Don’t give the government more money than you have to.

In other words, earn as much money as you can, live below your means, make responsible investments to increase your cashflow, pay whatever taxes you are legally responsible for… And then, for all the extra money you earned that is pure savings, it’s better to store it in bitcoin for long term savings.

Then one day far in the future you may have to sell/spend some small portion of your bitcoin, just as anyone decides to spend from their savings...and that’s ok, because in the future the value of your savings will have appreciated greatly. And for all the bitcoin you have been holding for over a year, the gains have lower taxes because of long term capital gains vs short term.",1607824201,45,1

kceidf,CyreexCS,My 18 Year old Brother is in the Hospital because of his Crypto Addiction,"I really can't talk about this anywhere else but I want to share an experience here.

Some Background: Me and my brother both live in ""Algeria"" (north africa) where Crypto currencies aren't allowed by law but We really didn't care about the gouverment implication on Crypto.

We have been both huge fans of crypto since early 2017 after hearing about it on a Teamspeak sever but at that time we were both young and we really couldn't afford to Buy some, we kept Collecting money and doing small chores to earn some money and as soon as we collected a respectable amount ($100-150$ each with our shitty currency cash) we would buy from People we met on facebook Crypto groups since we don't have International credit cards here and as I said we were young

We kept doing this for the past 2 and a half Years or so and we tried to always distrubute the money on several accounts because we really were afraid that one of our accounts get closed and we wouldn't be able to get Money back. We did this process for the past 2 years and we managed to finally reach the 0.9-0.1 BTC lately (a bit less than *$2000*)

I really just Hold crypto because I love it but I can't deny the Financial benefits that we can gain, My brother took this Side very seriously since he wanted to leave our country and Study abroad and Crypto was for him the best way to make money faster and to pay for his tuition abroad so each penny he made was put into His accounts and he deprived himself from anything else.

2 days Ago we woke up to the day we Feared the most and to find out that one account containing over $480 got closed, He really started crying and went full Psycho he locked himself into his room and didn't really want to talk to anyone. He later went out of his room with his hand full of scars and Just collapsed.

We had to take him to the hospital and He had to get a surgery, He is now awake but he Still needs to stay there for another day and hopefully will be fine even though I don't think things will be great for him. My parents Decided that my brother needs to get some therapy as soon as he leaves the Hospital but they really don't know the reasons. My brother won't talk about crypto with them and all he says is that this country is shit and that he can't bare living here anymore and that he wants to kill himself if he spends one more day here .

I'm Here not to blame anyone, I will never deny that He is responsible for what happened to him and that his Greed is his Issue and I totally Understand that some of you may blame us for Opening crypto accounts in Countries that ban it but It really sucks to be in his shoes and to get money off you in this Fashion.

Here's another prediction. Bitcoin will definitely breach six figures by December 2021.

Dec 2012 - $13 (First halving year)

Dec 2013 - $1000 (Four-figure breach)

Dec 2016 - $800 (Second halving year)

Dec 2017 - $20000 (Five-figure breach)

Dec 2020 - $19000? (Third halving year)

Dec 2021 - Six-figure breach

![img](d4vtsq93gz461 ""A clock stops for nobody. Tick-tock."")

In late-2016, early 2017, we retraced 61.8% (fib) before building back up throughout 2017 to $10k and beyond. You can expect a similar retrace this time as a secondary bear trend grips the market over the next month or two post-holiday season.

kcdu5e,sammyaxelrod,Mass adoption for retail customers,"Just an idea. I feel like a big drawback to btc for every day spending is the sat system and the decimal points. Like a cashier asking for payment at Starbucks isnt going to say “that’ll be 0.000123848 btc please.”

I’m used to it from my constant DCAing but for the average Joe, this is too confusing.

For example if Apple wanted to hugely increase profits from their 10 billion Apple Pay transactions each year, they could cut out the credit card companies and pay a fraction of what they currently pay in merchant fees....but I believe the sat system holds a lot of companies back from mainstreaming for day to day use by customers. 

Is it feasible for companies like Apple to use btc but market it with some kind of simpler fractional system like fiat? Like 1.55 “Eddies” or whatever they call it, which would translate into says when the block is written but the customer would see simplified numbers.

I’m not sure what the drawbacks would be of this or if it’s plausible but I feel like it would be a good way to help with the confusion for everyday consumers to mass adopt. If companies like Apple used btc for even 10% of their transactions that would be hundreds of millions saved in merchant fees alone for them....I guess this is what PayPal is doing but I wonder if there’s another way?",1607878044,5,1

kd6sz0,MiguelLancaster,The case against holding your own keys,"""Not your keys, not your coin"" 

We've all heard that repeated countless times, and it's a phrase that in a lot of ways truly does embody one of the core principles of bitcoin -- absolute sovereignty over your personal finances. 

This spirit is also the driving factor behind 20% of the current bitcoin supply being estimated as ""lost"" -- holding your own keys exposes your coin to the risk of user error.

""Not your keys, not your coin"" is not a one-size-fits-all ethos. A hardware wallet isn't right for everyone. If we want mass adoption, then we're going to have to accept at some point that holding your coin with a third party custodian can be safe. The population en masse simply aren't cut out for managing this on their own -- for them convenience is key and the simple truth is that holding with a custodian is more user-friendly. 

Is the risk higher or is it just different? I suppose that depends on the user. There is inherent risk in either method.",1607980716,214,1

kd5h52,Levi_2212,How do smart contracts work in DeFi?,"A few months ago I started to get interested in the blockchain and in particular in the use of smart-contracts. I saw that the most important **dApps** are all from the **DeFi** sector and I asked myself some questions about their mechanism.

I want to take *Compound* and *AAve* as an example.

There are 2 types of users, lenders and borrowers.

When a user connects his wallet and decides to use the dApp, where are the funds deposited? In dApp smart-contract? When a user receives the loan, is a new smart contract created? Are the loan specifics included in this new smart-contract: interest rate, duration, etc? These were my first questions...

I would like to understand how data storage works in this type of dynamics, what is onchain and what is not.

I came to the conclusion that smart contracts are created for each ""loan"" because I cannot understand how a single contract can manage old, current and new loans.

The functions that come into play are many:

1. When making a loan there are these variables: contractors, interest rate,  loan duration, monthly repayment  size, amount of collateral.
2. During the life of the loan, the contract should be updated with the interest and principal already paid, establish how much remains to be paid and whether the collateral is still sufficient to cover in the event of default.
3. Once the debt is fully repaid, dissolve the contract and return the collateral to the ex-borrower.

Here, let's say that I don't understand how all this flow is managed. From the little I know, it seems impossible to me that a single smart-contract can do it, which is why I deduced a new one is created for each loan request. These contracts in turn are recalled by a main one who updates them according to pre-established  functions.

Correct any mistakes I made in my reasoning, thank you.",1607976824,1,1

( assuming the price range stays like this for a few more weeks ). What are the approximate fees for buying and selling those btc and which place has the lowest fees for that? If you buy at 19.2k and sell at 19.4k, that would count into 200$ profit but how much the fees would be approximately for selling it at 19.4k?

She also added

“Increase the understanding in the Senate about Bitcoin, what it is, what it does, how it can be an asset that can grow and develop as an adjunct, so basically alongside our fiat currency, and that it should be allowed a clear path and avenue — an interstate highway in fact — to grow and develop alongside our fiat currency.”

My question is, when does it make sense to upgrade again? I am assuming the next step would be to make a multisig setup but at what BTC amount does this make sense to do? Are we talking 10 BTC + or is a hardware wallet alone not secure enough for even a couple of BTC? I know that hardware wallets are incredibly secure but they do leave a lot of room for human error. Do we know how influential people in the BTC space like Raoul Pal or Preston Pysh store their bitcoin?",1608042124,34,1

Specifically, what happens to the stability of the network?","Hey, please forgive me for any fundamental flaws in my question, I don't know a lot, but I had this one question regarding the stability of the network after all the bitcoins are mined.

Currently, there is a big incentive for people to maintain the network, they receive bitcoins as rewards for mining, after all the bitcoins are mined, the incentive is significantly reduced. They will still receive the transaction fees, but I am not sure how much that adds up to compared to the new bitcoins received.

Further, the network currently also faces some issues where parallel chains exist for a while until they are eventually resolved to a bigger chain, this causes some transactions to be reversed and hence they sometimes take a longer time to complete. If the number of people maintaining the network reduces due to the reduced incentives, how can bitcoin scale up to be of everyday transactional utility with such significant delays in payment processing?",1608040875,13,1

kdl74a,Uberdriver_janis,[Thougts/Tips] My dad thinks about getting involved in Bitcoin,"`tl;dr

Dad got government money. Might have to pay it back in the upcoming 10 years. Thinks about placing it in Bitcoin`

So my dad got some money from the government because of Corona. Now it is still unclear if he is even allowed to have that. We got told that in the next 10 years there always could be a check if specific people are allowed to get that money or not. So it could happen that in 5 years we need to pay that money back.

Because I got first involved into Bitcoin this year when the prices where at the bottom now my dad thinks about putting it into Bitcoin as well instead of just letting it sit around and collect dust.
He asked me what I think about that and I told him that I don't really know much about Bitcoin but if I'd have to guess that in 5 years or even in 1 year he could stand in a really good position with the money he could place now. But as I said that's far away from any profeccional prediction.

What tips would you give him and what would be the best strategy to buy in this case? Place all in one or for example buy every week a small portion...

kdkbye,Suraz_Bhattarai,"As the bull market continues, Bitcoin is becoming more and more popular among the rich"," 

More wealthy mainstream investors are attracted to the cryptocurrency field, especially for the number one cryptocurrency BTC. Currently, since March of this year, Bitcoin has risen by 270%. This is a huge return on investment, and many top mainstream investors are wondering whether it is wise to stay on the sidelines while Bitcoin is growing.

Earlier this year, Wall Street billionaires such as Paul Tudor Jones recognized Bitcoin and even invested part of their investment portfolio in Bitcoin. At the same time, some large corporate organizations have not been excluded. Square, Stone Ridge and other organizations have also purchased a large amount of Bitcoin this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps this has made many top investors increasingly believe that Bitcoin has now become a worthy asset in their portfolio.

One of them is Christian Armbruester, the founder of Blu Family Office. This investment company represents wealthy clients in London. He admitted that Bitcoin has a place in a diversified portfolio and he is also considering more in the industry investment.

When talking about Bitcoin, he said: ""We are looking for trading opportunities in a very exciting field.""

Even after criticizing Bitcoin for many years, he became one of the people who accepted Bitcoin investment. Bernstein Research asset manager Inigo Fraser-Jenkins recently managed a company that manages $631 billion in assets. He changed the contrast. Special idea, although in 2018 he said that it is impossible to invest.

But now, InigoFraser-Jenkins encourages his clients to get some bitcoins as part of their portfolio.

According to Grayscale, a digital asset management platform, both companies and individual customers have unusual capital inflows. The company has earned $2 billion in revenue in the past two months alone and has been buying Bitcoin and Ethereum on a large scale. .

This can only confirm that more funds have flowed into Bitcoin. JP Morgan said that as Bitcoin continues to grow, this situation will cause gold to suffer a blow that has not been seen in years.",1608032937,0,1

This requires that you trust this person 100%.

Is my assumption correct that using a 25th seed phrase (and not giving it to anyone) eliminates this problem? Or what is the purpose of the 25th phrase?

If that is correct, you still have the issue of securing the 25th phrase. Would it be safe to store this in a password manager? Or even just in some cloud storage where only you can access it?

Storing it in the cloud almost completely eliminates the risk of you losing access to it. And if someone else could access it, they could not use it without the 24 recovery words.",1608031384,33,1

I would like to inform all the guys here considering service of Bitpanda to avoid using this platform. Recently I had experience which I will definitely not forget. During the withdraw some technical issues happened on Bitpanda side and ended up by my withdraw being credited twice to my bank account. I put the money aside as I was expecting that bank would claim that back as not proper transfer - but Bitpanda would have to put claim to their bank for sending double transaction by mistake - nothing like that happened. Instead of that a not even month later I received letter from Austrian debt collector company, charging me almost 200€ more, demanding the payment. Well as I was sure that no one called me about the transaction, it was not charged back by my bank and I have not received any email, I decided to search - I found emails from their support contacting me twice and sending instructions for the payment - unfortunately these emails got sorted as spam, I guess that because they were demanding payment and from support email which is not usual in my inbox.

So this is how they treat customers after their own technical issues.

Im thinking since one of the post that was affected stated they only wrote down their seed  offline and somehow the btc got transfered out then it should be possible for a hacker to program a backdoor to get ur seed phrase during the initialization when ur ledger is connected to the app. If true this would be horrifying.

As I understand, the redeem script generated for each address in a multisig wallet at index X will use each of the public keys from the cosigners at index X (the first address is index 0, second is index 1, etc in the key's bip32 keychain).  So the first addresses from the two wallets: single sig with A and the multisig with A, B and C will contain a hashes of redeem scripts that contain the public key for the first address for A. So if a signed transaction is broadcasted for the first address for either of these wallets, the public key will be exposed. If the tx is broadcasted for the multisig address, then this removes the sha256 protection on the single sig A address, leaving only ECDSA to protect the funds, essentially being a form of address reuse.  Does this pose a security risk?

I think the same question applies for rotating keys out of an existing multisig quorum/wallet to a new multisig quorum. So if an existing 2-of-3 multisig wallet uses keys A, B and C, but C becomes lost or compromised, then is it safe to generate a new key D, create a new 2-of-3 multisig wallet with keys A, B and D, and transfer funds over? Public keys generated from A's and B's bip32 keychains will have been reused here.",1608023653,8,1

I knew nothing about Bitcoin when a very enthusiastic guy I met kept telling me I had to get some, he was up 100k in 2017. Eventually I was convinced, and became obsessed learning about buying it and various alts, trading etc. I was also in a very dark time in my life, and I think that played a part in my awful decisions.  


I had £30k in savings, and I said to myself I'd put 10k in to Bitcoin and Alts. But for some reason over a matter of weeks I became a bit mad and decided to put it all in. Literally days after I bought it all, the big crash happened and I lost 50% instantly. I felt sick to my stomach. I wanted to sell after it dropped a bit as I panicked, but my friends told me just hold, it will be fine. It wasn't, and we all know how low it got in the past few years.  


I then made more stupid mistakes trying to trade, and buying into ICOS, selling a few alts at the top, and buying again at the bottom, just very stupid decisions. Looking back, I think I lost my mind!  


So I became very depressed after all this, feeling very ashamed for losing all my money (thats what it felt like). I decided I would keep all my coins regardless of what happened, which I guess wasn't a bad idea, at least I didnt sell it all at the bottom! And strangely after a few months I realised my relationship with money changed for the better, I felt less uptight about it. So maybe that lesson was worth the cost! It also pushed me to work harder to make money  


So now years later, Bitcoin has gone above its all time high of 20k. I think my average buy in originally was at about 18k. 

I am still down 30% which has shocked me a bit, as I didn't realise I'd made that many mistakes to lose that much even now. I put it to the back of my mind the last few years and thought that when bitcoin hits 20k, surely I'll be pretty close to my original investment.   


So really I just wasted a lot of time, and now it will be like me buying in at 25k or whatever price it will be when I reach my original investment!!! What a shame. If I'd waited just a week later to put in my money originally, and only put in 7k, I would have more than I have now. But to be honest I probably would have been too scared to invest anything after the crash  


Sorry for the long story, felt like getting it off my chest, and seeing if anyone else has similar stories

keedx7,Wise_Gift_2771,Is it too late?,"Hi everyone, 

I first took notice of Bitcoin in 2017 when it began flooding the headlines as its historic rise started. I’ve never had any spare money that I could justify spending on scratch cards let alone Bitcoin, something which I knew very little about. I very quickly forgot about Bitcoin, to me it was nothing but a pipe dream. 

The past day or so I’ve noticed Bitcoin dominating the internet again, rising to massive prices. The anxiety of seeing a currency raise to over $20,000 when you saw it at $1500, I’m sure it’s a feeling you can all relate to. 

Anyway, that powerful sense of FOMO has struck me again and I seem powerless to it. The sensations are unequivocally amplified by the coronavirus pandemic, and my own personal economic hardship.

Realistically I may only be able to purchase £20 worth a month, and I’m not sure if that’s even worth it now. 

Thank you in advance to anyone that sees this post, and any tips or insights are greatly appreciated.",1608142184,14,1

Money that’s backed by the trust of those participating in the network, something owned by everyone and no one.

I honestly didn’t care who won this U.S. election, the true vote humans will face is the acceptance of Bitcoin. I am in agreement with Raoul Pal, I truly believe this technology will become a life raft away from this corrupt financial mess we’ve all been forced into.

I’m proud to have 1 of the 21 million coins in existence. If this succeeds or not is irrelevant to me. I believe something is wrong with the system and I took a stand against it. That’s why I love Bitcoin, it provided me a meaningful way to protest against my government, and I’m forever thankful to Satoshi for that. Cheers everyone!",1608138108,2,1

We broke to 23k with NO mainstream coverage, when will they cover it? 30k,40k,50k?? Will we see an explosive retail bull run this time, or will it be ignored until All the political drama cools off?  

    Also I see people worried about big sell offs and having a repeat of 2017-2019+ bear market, am I the only one that feels this won’t happen? I feel like there will be short term strong pull backs, but for the most part it seems with how slow we climbed up to 19k-20k and held, it seems like that’ll be the new bottom. So it is possible we will no longer see prices cheaper than that. 

Just wanted to create a discussion and see where people’s sentiments are other than,”OMG NEW NEW AND NEW ATH!!!!” EVERY 1k movement. It’s hype as hell for sure, but this should be considered small movements at this point compared to when mainstream goes crazy for it.

A crash isn't expected this time around and bitcoin is being accepted in more and more places. Most ""experts"" are estimating anywhere from 100k-1m per coin in 5 years. So a 5x - 50x increase if everything pans out? I like those odds. That's way more than possible from my IPOs and SPAC investments and it's simply buy and forget. No researching and following multiple stocks.

As the value of paper money keeps going down and min wage likely increasing signicantly in the next year or two, I think BTC will become more and more valuable while cash becomes signicantly less valuable. Not to mention BTC is limited. The government can't just print more. So when BTC is dried up by extremely rich investment companies, the value will go sky high and very few consumers will own a good chunk of them.

I'm really stupid because I've been a computer guy since a kid (2010) and I've seen Bitcoin rise and I used to use it (and I'm sure everyone knows stories like this) but I had 20 BTC at all time from just online exchanges and sales and services. I traded those BTC for Paypal/Liberty Reserve for $5 a piece.

Well, now Bitcoin is about to hit $23,000 and I'm in awe. I invested a little bit in April at $8,600 and would've been happy to double my investment, let alone nearly triple it. However, I invested so little that I'm actually furious I didn't invest more. I also sold at $19.5k (was worried abt it hitting 20k then crashing).

I know I am stupid, and I know there's a lot to learn moving forward, but for those who have been long term, you really think its gonna go past 30k and beyond? and do you think there will be a big crash for a chance to invest more? sorry if these are really stupid questions.",1608194602,7,1

kgawsr,kujahjh,"FOMO: Should you invest in Bitcoin, when, and how?","Hello /r/Bitcoin community,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm someone who's involved in the financial independence community and we usually push hard for people to play it safe and consistent by investing into index funds, and allow time to work its magic.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm no different and the majority of my advice to others follows that train of thought; I believe in it strongly and it is an approach that has worked well for me over time.  However, I've also been putting some portion of my investment into Bitcoin (for years) and have proudly hodl'd all this time, and will keep hodl'ing for many years to come. 

&amp;#x200B;

Due to this, I decided to write up a short introductory article for anyone in the FI community who might be interested in getting into Bitcoin and to give them some guidance on how to think about their approach.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's face it, none of us here really know what's going to happen with the price tomorrow. At this moment in time the price has risen $600 since I published my article and by the time I actually post this thread, it might be back down again. Who knows!

&amp;#x200B;

But there's one thing that I grow more confident in as time goes by - and that is that the argument for Bitcoin as a viable asset to be held in an investment portfolio becomes stronger as more and more credible organisations and high net worth individuals get involved. I myself am not super smart, but I know that the likes of Michael J. Saylor and Jack Dorsey aren't going to blindly put their money into something that they don't believe has potential in the future - not without some proper research into it at least. 

&amp;#x200B;

In essence, as the case for Bitcoin grows it becomes more and more important (in my opinion) to have some portion of one's investment portfolio in it - as though it's another asset class that you should have some level of exposure to. Nobody bats an eye when someone mentions diversification into different assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate etc, even if they might have some opinion for or against it - it's only when you mention Bitcoin that someone may suddenly flip a switch and think you've lost the plot. Perhaps in the past it was easier to see that side of the argument because it was a ""new and unknown"" thing, but time is moving forward and so is adoption which makes me feel that this is something you don't want to sit out of.

&amp;#x200B;

But that being said - Bitcoin is definitely exceptionally volatile and high risk, and I know that everybody here knows that. So my belief is that getting into Bitcoin isn't a matter of ""when"" in terms of ""what price is good to buy"", but is actually a ""when"" in terms of ""have you set yourself up for success"".

&amp;#x200B;

I think by taking this approach, where you are able to understand that Bitcoin is a risky asset with massive potential and have your ducks lined up to weather any type of storm, a normal person who might've thought of Bitcoin as ""poison"" based on the negative opinions of others can actually give themselves a chance to benefit from this phenomenon.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so why am I here and why am I preaching to the converted?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I'd like to share the link to my article ""[FOMO: Should you invest in Bitcoin, when, and how?](https://www.fiscribbles.com/post/fomo-should-you-invest-in-bitcoin-when-and-how)"" - I read the rules of the subreddit and I didn't see anything against this so I hope this is welcome, but apologies in advance to the mods if this is a no-no. 

&amp;#x200B;

The contents of the article are what I already wrote in this post but in more detail - you won't miss out on much if you don't click in but I'm hoping to get some feedback and support from this community and more importantly I'd like to find out if my way of seeing Bitcoin resonates with you all.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've a few moments and would like a break from all the ""to the moon!"" posts, please give it a chance and if you find it interesting then there's no harm in sharing it forward with some others who might find it helpful to see Bitcoin from the perspective of someone who advocates investing steadily and safely.

&amp;#x200B;

kgopyz,thesbaron,My great BTC gift idea!,"I will start by saying that I wish I had started this 2 years ago, 1 year ago or even 1 month ago...but **better late than never**.

Quite a few years ago my parents loaned me some money, approximately $10K, for a business venture. Long story short that business venture did not work out, and for a while afterward I struggled to find a solid career path, just making ends meet. My parents kindly allowed me to repay them when I had extra $, which wasn't that often in those days. Eventually, I paid them back around $6,000 of the original $10,000 and they told me not to worry about paying the rest. That was years ago and they probably haven't given it any thought since then, but I have and I think I have the perfect way to finish repaying them.  My parents are recently retired, living comfortably off of their savings &amp; social security but I find myself worrying about them as they probably once worried about me.

**So here is my plan:** Without their knowledge, I’ve started paying them back the remaining $4,000, storing it in BTC until the day they start asking me about Bitcoin.  Over the next 6 months, I will dollar cost average in $4000, purchasing \~$150/week, transferring it to a separate wallet.  I feel it is inevitable, as bitcoin becomes more mainstream, that at some point in time my parents will begin asking about bitcoin and I can’t wait to explain to them that they have been hodling, with diamond hands, since late 2020!

kgntlt,poo_finger,Maybe you guys can help me out.,"So this is going to be in the 2014-2015 time range. I was mining on ghash.io, but I wasn't using their exchange. I was also mining doge and other alts at the time as well. The exchange I was using supported pretty much every alt in circulation, but I can't for the life of me remember what it was. Seems like there might have been a scandal where they shut down trading and withdrawals for a minute and everyone started getting antsy. Definitely not part of the Mt. Gox fiasco. 

Any of this ring a bell for anyone?

I think I switched to coinbase after that. I'm going to try to get back into these old accounts. I'm positive I still have some sats sitting in at least a couple of these places.

It seems that Bitcoin itself is a great invention, and I'm certainy happy more people are investing and using it. But it seems to me that people have forgotten why Bitcoin was created, and what it means for the world. Bitcoin wasn't created to make us all rich, it was created to be an alternative system to a corrupt financial system that destroys wealth and enslaves (most) people. Have we forgotten about the growing inequality? 40% of american cannot get afford to miss 500$. Even more live pay check to pay check. Do we realise that the soon destruction of our current financial system will cause MASSIVE instability on our planet? The current financial system is a hell, we are applauding the current rally, but it seems we forget its all because the corruption and destruction of our current system, that so many people depend on for food and housing. We should be happy Bitcoin is growing, but we must also not forget that we are the lucky ones, and that before Bitcoin will take over, we must first go to potentially a very unstable and maybe even dark time.

I ended up finally deciding to cut a check and invest into Bitcoin over a month ago.  So far so good but compared to many of the early investors or those that bought during the last dip, my volume as it relates to BTC ownership is considerably lower than yours.

There is no doubt I’ll buy again but it’s just a matter of when.  Based on what I’ve read it’s possible, at some point, whales will liquidate and that will bring the price down 25-30%, which would obviously be a time to buy if you’re in this for the long term, which I am.  

Disclaimer - I’m completely sold that regardless of what happens in the short-term, Bitcoin is the way of the future and the choices we end up making today with have a major impact 10+ years from now.

With that said, Is it ludicrous to think a 25-30% dip isn’t reasonable within the next few months?  Or do I side with my good conscience, be patient and just wait to see if a dip happens? (My bad conscience is telling me to stop being a pussy and buy some more before it continues to blow the roof off).

1. If I link my bank acccount to my digital wallet, are there any privacy concerns if BRD undergoes hacking or something like this?
2. BRD uses Coinberry to buy coins. Is this a problem? Any security concerns?
3. Since I signed up for BRD, if I use my coins to buy something will I be able to be tracked, I'm not thinking of doing anything crazy, just want to know if I have privacy or since I downloaded an app I'm a bit hooped.
4. \*Edit: if I use coinberry to fund it and have to verify my identity, do they store this information, if I transfer it to another wallet (BRD for the time being) is it linked so they know who I am? I'm probably being paranoid, but I'm a rookie so better safe than sorry :)!
5. At what dollar amount do you think an investment in a hardware wallet is warranted (I don't make too much money at the moment).
6. Any general advice you think I may benefit from? All advice appreciated. :) Thanks in advance!

kfahh2,jonnylangefeld,Total Bitcoin Nodes and 51% Attacks,"Hi, I follow Bitcoin closely since early 2017 and am very technical. So I would say I understand some things, but there is one thing I couldn't wrap my head around yet:

I've been researching the total amount of Bitcoin nodes now for quite a bit and understand that there are two kinds of nodes: Listening nodes (which open port 8333 for inbound connections) and regular nodes (which don't listen on that port).

Famous Bitcoin personality [Jameson Lopp](https://twitter.com/lopp) wrote in [his blog in 2014](https://blog.lopp.net/bitcoin-nodes--how-many-is-enough-/) that listening nodes are better for securing the network and that he's using [bitnodes.io](https://bitnodes.io/) to see how many listening nodes there currently are in the Bitcoin network. I've seen [bitnodes.io](https://bitnodes.io) cited before in other sources so I do believe that they are legit. Lopp further writes in 2014 that the amount of nodes previously reported was around 100,000 and then dropped to around 10,000, because [bitnodes.io](https://bitnodes.io) decided to only include listening nodes.

If you check the [bitnodes.io](https://bitnodes.io) website today it's not much higher than 6 years ago, it's at around 11,100.

I found [this tweet](https://twitter.com/francispouliot_/status/1125139855313387520) of 2019 by another popular Bitcoin personality [Francis Pouliot](https://twitter.com/francispouliot_), stating that a lot of people believe there are only 10,000 nodes in the network, but it actually is more than 100,000. Reading the replies to that tweet implies that once again the difference between listening and non listening nodes is referenced.

The data Pouliot used is provided by Bitcoin core developer [Luke Dashjr](https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr) through his personal website.

[This chart](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/historical-dygraph.html) I find best because it shows a historical evolution of the Bitcoin network node count (Check out [this link](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/) for other data he provides).

And while I'm not quite sure how Dashjr calculates the amount of non listening nodes, there are two things that caught my attention:

1. The amount of listening nodes is way lower than reported by [bitnodes.io](https://bitnodes.io) \- why?
2. The total amount of nodes peaked early 2018 (understandably so), but declined since then and is now a bit below 50,000

For the following let's assume a node count of 50,000. Wouldn't be a 51% attach possible for let's say a government that doesn't want Bitcoin around or another party with a lot of assets?

Let's say they bought 25,000 of the [latest Antminers](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020201217175623088BNBQS0t80649) for $3,559 a piece. That would be $89mio total cost for hardware. Even if that amount tripled for a 51% attack (like electricity costs and shipment etc.),  let's say one doesn't have to spend more than $300mio. If we assume a BTC price of $20,000, that would only be 15,000 BTC they would need to breach to break even. And the incentive would increase with higher BTC prices (since the amount of nodes seems to stay flat and is rather decreasing since 6 years).

$300mio seems like a low amount for a government with stimulus packages in the trillions if they wanted to destroy a ""currency competitor"".

Now I'm wondering: Is my math wrong? Is there something I'm missing? Is the return on invest just not high enough to spend $300mio? What are your thoughts?

**EDIT**

I just realized that my math about nodes needed for a 51% attack is wrong. To control 51% of the network an attacker wouldn't need to add half of the current nodes to the network, but actually the same amount of nodes again. So that would be not only 25,000 nodes, but 50,000 nodes an attacker would need to come up with and that would double the cost assumed above.

Also some comments alluded that it's not about node count, but about hashrate. But that would only mean that each of the attacker's node needs a higher hash rate than the average of the current nodes. Which I would assume the latest Antminer does provide (since there is a lot of older hardware running the current network).",1608252694,32,0

kfqc67,POKONEILL,Bitcoin Denominations,"Have any of you given any thought to the commonly used bitcoin unit names, or “denominations”. When we refer to bitcoins, there are only 2 commonly used unit names, or denominations. We either refer to a “bitcoin” which is priced at roughly $23,000 right now, or a “Satoshi” which is priced at roughly $0.00023 right now. I have noticed when speaking people about purchasing bitcoin, that there is a great deal of resistance to buying something that is priced as highly as $23,000, or at a price as tiny as $0.00023.

 I find myself spending a great deal of time trying to explain to people that they can buy any fractional unit of a bitcoin that they want, but human nature seems to make most people hesitant about buying something if they cannot own an entire unit of it, or of having to spend close to $50,000 just to own 2 units of something. The denomination naming conventions seem to simply cause a huge, and completely unnecessary mental block for people.

 If we could introduce a new, more digestible denomination name, and get some major influencers within the crypto and bitcoin space to help to make it a universally known and used denomination, it could eliminate a huge roadblock to bitcoin’s acceptance. I was thinking that we could use the name “Nash” as a name for a denomination that refers to 1/1000th of a bitcoin. We could use any name, I like “Nash” since it would be named for John Nash who introduced the idea of “ideal money” back in 1995.  I personally have very little social media influence, but if anybody finds this idea to be interesting, I would ask you to post about it in your social media accounts, and try to spread the word. 

As small as this idea seems, and even though we all understand that we can buy any fraction of a bitcoin down to 1/100,000,000 of a coin, I truly think that this could be a significant step towards mass adoption.

Is this because of network congestion? Might my tx go through if I try it again this weekend? or perhaps once all the excitement over ATHs dies down?

Is this rejection in terms of sat/byte or is this because the total fee (0.00000141 BTC) is too low? Might I  get more traction with more bytes in my tx, such as 2 inputs &amp; 4 outputs instead of 1 input &amp; 2 outputs?

At this point you might ask why not just ++ the sat/bytes, but I have 2 tx I am trying to move along (2 inputs and 4 outputs). I could combine them into one tx (more bytes == higher total fee) if that would help move the BTC along.

It is only when we want or need something more than we want savings, and we don't have a sufficient supply of bad money, that we then rely on good money.

This doesn't just apply to BTC.

But in recent years, mining has and is becoming more and more expensive, so what if in one moment the mining becomes really, really not profitable and miners start shutting down their nodes? 

Will the difficulty be adjusted to the conditions? If not, this means that the network will become vulnerable, but on the other hand, if the difficulty is lowered, the network will be vulnerable once again (meaning that someone with a ton of asacs can do a 51% attack)

Just to note that this could happen not because of bitcoin, but other factors, for example, if the electricity costs go up on a global scale (the reasons can differ, maybe war or some kind of catastrophe)...

I previously sent some coins from Coinbase --&gt; Ledger without anonymizing them. Does this mean that any and all future Ledger public addresses have now been linked to my Coinbase account?

kfm1om,Mektzer,"Bitcoin is just a bubble, a scam, a ponzi scheme, fool's gold (click bait)","You can believe whatever you want of course. What I can tell you is that the Internet was seen exactly the same way during the 2000 bubble. The majority of people thought that it's nothing concrete, nothing of real value, and that its only use case is for stocks speculation and international illegal activities like drugs and porn and so on. The reality is that 99% of the people involved in crypto are not using it for illegal means, same as for the internet and same for USD cash. 

All my friends are still telling me that crypto is no more than a speculative asset that will burst in a bubble just like in 2017, and that it's actually a scam for fool people, fool's gold. At the moment I'm fully in the green because people who believe in crypto are in for the long run and just HOLD (as you said trying to be an improvised day trader and going in and out of the market will most likely just net you losses). It has proven to be way better than just park money in the bank and watch it get killed by inflation. The time of those sweet 7% interest returns on locked bank depos are over. For the first time in history, interest rates are basically negative and the US just keeps printing more and more trillions to overpump a stock market that is overextended and had an insane 10 plus years bull market. All the big companies can just get money for free and keep buying their own stocks. Billionaires are getting richer, while the poorer 60% don't own stocks and are getting more and more enslaved by all kind of debts.

I don't want to convince anyone because it's impossible. What I urge people to do is to do extensive research on this technology and these assets and build their own informed opinion. I, like everyone else, also believed (in 2013) that this bitcoin thing is a scam and that it will get banned by governments eventually. Economist  Saifedean Ammous thought exactly the same before studying crypto, changing his mind, and writing the book ""The Bitcoin Standard"". Well today Bitcoin has more transaction volume than Paypal, so they decided to allow their customers to buy and hold crypto, Binance exchange is rolling out their Visa cards and Coinbase exchange is about to go public and makes more money than Deutsche Bank.

BTC has a long way to go. IMO we will see around $200k in the next 10 years. In terms of the volatility we’ve seen from price ranges of $1k-$24k, the amount of opportunity available to long biased algorithms will lead to the greatest returning assets in the next ten years. 

Because these funds are long biased, you’re only capturing upside, which means lowering downside risk almost entirely. (Depends on the algo) But with all the volatility ahead, there’s no doubt this will be one of the highest ROI investments you can make.",1608529012,5,1

I'm fairly new to BTC. I (think I) understand the hypothetical decentralized nature of bitcoin, but I'm struggling to see how this can be the case when Bitmain holds (used to hold?) 51% of the hashrate. 

For reference, this is an older thread I read on the subject ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tjcuc/bitmain\_approaching\_51\_of\_total\_bitcoin\_network/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8tjcuc/bitmain_approaching_51_of_total_bitcoin_network/)) 

That was 2 years ago, is this still the case? 

According to this hash rate distribution chart, Bitmain now only controls 10.2% of the hashrate: [https://btc.com/stats/pool](https://btc.com/stats/pool). Is this accurate? If so, how centralized and susceptible are remaining Chinese miners to the CCP?

kh9ozl,ibtclieve,Better get your 0.00269 BTC,"As /u/dan_held pointed out on Twitter sometime back, if you take the total number of Bitcoin ever possible (21 million) and divide it evenly by the current population of earth (7.8 billion) you get roughly 0.00269 bitcoin per person alive today. 

That got me thinking, if Bitcoin is headed towards being the next global monetary reserve like we're thinking it will, then 0.00269 BTC will be the kind of money that someone makes and spends over the course of their entire life and at today's price of roughly $23,800, that much bitcoin only costs you $64. That's the kind of asymmetry in the risk / reward profile we're talking about - where a $64 bet on Bitcoin today could be enough for a retirement fund and then some.

Obviously the population will change (even though Bitcoin wont) and you could argue it's even less needed than 0.00269 due to lost coins, but if we keep going like we are a person might never need more than 0.00269 BTC. For the life of me, I can't imagine a single person with 2 brain cells to rub together and $64 to spare who wouldn't be interested in taking a bet like that, on the chance us freaks are right.",1608523593,21,1

- have keen foresight
- have grueling patience
- are true believers in blockchain technology and are unemotional about volatility in price
- are more concerned with preserving value than with greed
- can withstand sharp criticisms from seasoned professionals (i.e. Warren Buffett) who may be beyond their years
- are underground and defiant (consider the origins)
- maintain an obsessive interest in potentials
- can communicate memetically

1. Expect direct communication on scams.
2. Expect SIM swap attacks, now they know people email address, phone number, and such, people could try to get into accounts at major exchanges.
3. Enable white listing on accounts on exchanges. Coinbase whitelisting make you or a hacker wait 48 hours to add a new address to withdrawal funds
4. Use a 2FA authenticator app, make sure the email account to that app has 2FA as well in case they try to download an authenticator app on a SIM swapped phone.

Kinda sad that she can't see the good in it right now. But what can you do?

To give context, my friend had a very very bad first experience with cryptocurrency. I don't know the full story, but she dealt with a shady 3rd party trader who promised to give her profit. Well she did end up getting a profit but she also got flooded with texts and calls trying to scam her everyday. So after all that shit, she pulled her money out and never looked back at cryptocurrency since. It's sad because it seems like she was just looking at it to make a quick buck, which isn't a good mindset considering that cryptocurrency requires a good span of time before it can become more wide adopted and thus profitable. You can't expect it in days, weeks, months, or even years. There's always volatility but the long term directions seems to be upward which gives me hope for bitcoin.",1608516182,55,1

Since I cannot post in r/CryptoCurrency because of lack of karma, I would appreciate somebody also sharing this to the sub.

It seems like I am also a victim of the ledger data leak and am revisioning my security measures. So far I have not received an E-Mail from Ledger and also not appearing on haveibeenpwned, but I get sketchy crypto phishing mails daily now. I ordered the ledger exactly one week before the hack took place and find myself now in the unfortunate situation that the internet knows I am involved with assets. It still feels uncomfortable to know that your physical address is out there.

Anyway, measures I have taken before within and outside the cryptospace for my online security:

- Hardware wallet (the irony)
- E-Mail hosted in Germany
- 2FA for every account involving finance/messaging
- Password Manager MFA-protected with a Yubikey
- Seed is not with me, but in a Bank where only I have access to
- Avoiding Cloud Storages and selfhosting my shares
- General Brain Usage

Especially the last one is a feature I often miss with coworkers and friends. I always check the sender email and sometimes feel paranoid, but it pays out several times per month before clicking any link.

What are your best practices and how can I enhance my security in your opinion. Bonus for people who tell me how I should handle the actual data breach with the company. Should I file an official GDPR complaint?",1608513968,12,1

kh6xec,Heretic0000000,"After learning about the Ledger data breach, I'm way more hesitant, and frankly scared to buy a Ledger/Hardware wallet :(","I know this technically has nothing to do with the actual technology behind hardware wallets and has everything to do with the digital aspect of it all, but still, lots of people have already lost all of their bitcoins due to the phishing attacks, which most likely took most victims by surprise. And just about everyone else is rightfully pissed.

Like at least with Wasabi I never had to enter my email, phone number, or real address in any part of the process. All I had to do was verify the PGP signature to make sure the wallet I downloaded is legit.

Yes, I know that when it comes down to it, you use a hardware wallet completely offline, but when the wallet maker needs your address to send you the product, a phone number to verify you are you, and your email to send you a receipt, and a newsletter (and other services) as an option that many will opt in to - doesn't that defeat the point of any sort of security? Especially considering that data breaches like the one Ledger has suffered happen ALL THE TIME NOWADAYS, like seriously all the time. It happens so much...

If you're trying to separate personal information from your purchase, It's not like you can buy a used Ledger (which would be unsafe I'm guessing) and buying from third parties like Amazon will always have the possibility of the device being tampered with.

I feel like I'm better off buying one of those titanium block sheets (I forget the appropriate term) and just writing my private keys on that. Maybe not as secure as an offline hardware wallet, but at least I have the piece of mind knowing my personal info isn't tied to it; it's not like someone will send you a phishing attack relating to the titanium sheet website you bought from, makes more sense if it seems like it's coming from someone like Ledger, an actual hardware wallet manufacturer. 

I still want to buy a hardware wallet (and most likely still will lol), and Ledger still seems like a good choice, but I will definitely wait and see how everything plays out (how Ledger ultimately handles all of this) to make an informed decision. And of course, I'm here asking for advice, opinions, and just you're personal thoughts on the matter. Please tell me if I'm being stupid for adopting this mindset as well.",1608513672,26,1

Get closer to the Bitcoin whole figures, before it becomes impossible for normal people to acquire bitcoins!

If bitcoin goes up, you buy, if it goes down you buy! Daily small investments can actually help you many sats in the long run! Only every once in a while, you might want to sell just a tiny bit, to keep on making fiat to keep yourself satisfied!

khmus7,kraken-jeff,FinCEN’s New Rule Is About to Wall Off the Poor from Our Financial System Forever,"The Financial Crime Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) rules already prohibit financial institutions from opening accounts for homeless, unhoused and refugee populations who don’t have physical mailing addresses. Now, FinCEN has proposed a new rule that would prohibit those who are fortunate enough to have accounts *from even sending money to these people*, if that money is a virtual currency.

The rule would also prohibit financial institutions from sending money to smart contracts designed to eliminate the costly middlemen responsible for financial exclusion to begin with. Worse yet, FinCEN is trying to sneak the rule into law over the holiday season, giving the public only 15 days to respond. The rule itself forever walls off our financial system from those who need it most, and short circuiting the public comment process erodes the confidence Americans have placed in FinCEN.

Late Friday afternoon, apparently at the personal direction of the outgoing Treasury Secretary, FinCEN rushed to publish a proposed rule creating a new reporting requirement for financial institutions. The proposed rule is problematic in several respects, but one stands out from the rest: It would require customers who wish to send virtual currency from their financial institution to a recipient to report the name and physical address of the recipient. If the customer cannot report the recipient’s address, the financial institution must reject the transaction.

FinCEN tries to justify this rule by likening it to the venerable Currency Transaction Report (CTR), which has applied to cash and coin (paper and metal) transactions for decades. Historians of the CTR know better.

To be sure, the CTR has long required financial institutions to report their own customer’s information to FinCEN, but the CTR has never required reporting information about the recipient. In spite of this, FinCEN takes the baffling position that the proposed rule is “consistent with existing requirements.”

Twenty-five percent of the U.S. population is currently unbanked or underbanked. Sadly, existing requirements do indeed prohibit financial institutions from opening accounts for homeless people, refugees and others in this 25% who do not have enough money to afford a mailing address.

Existing requirements do, however, permit them to receive money from those who can afford to pay account maintenance fees and live in neighborhoods that attract physical branches. The proposed rule would go beyond existing requirements to literally outlaw people sending money to the less fortunate using their financial institutions.

The proposed rule does not just reserve today’s financial system for the wealthy. It also seeks to wall off tomorrow’s financial system from the poor. Beyond just prohibiting transactions with humans without home addresses, the proposed rule would prohibit financial institutions from sending virtual currency to smart contracts, which have no name or physical location to begin with.

Smart contracts are a swiftly-advancing technology created specifically to eliminate the need for risky, expensive middlemen. The need to use these middlemen is what keeps the poor out of today’s financial system. The proposed rule would choke the flow of resources to this technology, ensuring that tomorrow’s financial system will be just as exclusionary as today’s.

FinCEN is required by law to ask the public what we think about the proposed rule, and to give us enough time for a meaningful response. The government almost always gives us at least 30 days to do so, and oftentimes 60 days or even longer for important matters.

Instead, in order to jam through this rule with minimal public input, FinCEN is providing only 15 days over the holiday season for the public to consider the rule’s consequences, even though they know it is vulnerable to challenge. This is unprecedented, and patently inappropriate for such a dramatic departure from existing law.

Kraken will fight to stop this. You can help. Read the [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1216) here and submit a response as soon as you can. We will be submitting ours, too.

khmgzh,thatguykeith,My totally amateur predictions on what we’ll see during this bull run.,"The previous high for bitcoin before this run was about $19,200.

If the pattern of that ATH nearly exactly repeats the previous run-up, we’d be looking at a high of $23-24k (already happened) and a drop back to $8-9k. It is curious that the last ATH went parabolic from February to December, but I honestly believe that was coincidence and doesn’t price in what would have happened this year without Covid.

There’s also some rationale to $90k happening soon (months not years), if the current run is proportional to the previous one and the whales are headed our way.

The big X factor is institutional investment, which I think has permanently changed the dynamic of crypto investing since the last ATH and will support price stability, but there’s no telling what level it’ll settle at for any extended period. The 23-24k mark does seem to have some weight.

My guess (no math involved) is that $15k is our new floor and if we ever get there again it’ll be very brief.

I need to get a wallet, and based on the value of my BTC and ETH, I feel like I should get a Hardware wallet.

I know it was the e-commerce platform that got hacked and the device is still ""fine"" to use, but why not just buy a Trezor or something else and start fresh?  Any thoughts on Trezor, or other safe, and user friendly hardware wallets.

kidyja,consideranon,Bitcoin isn't the bubble. Everything else is.,"Bitcoin isn't the bubble.

Everything else is. 

Excess value is being stored/saved where it shouldn't. 

Assets are valuable either because they're scarce (hard to make more of) and large networks of people want or need them (gold, land, easy to remember web addresses, trademarks, desirable art, bitcoin, even well managed fiat) or because they generate income (businesses, rental properties, bonds, loans, tax payers, employees, your own ability to work and get paid).

The stock market has become distorted because everyone has realized that cash is trash and savings accounts yield 0 interest. So, we've all started dumping our savings into the market to preserve wealth. This is increasingly detaching the market value of stocks from reasonable expectations of income generation relative to the asset value. e.g. how many years will it take to recoup your initial investment and then some from dividend payouts? Some people are starting to think that index fund investing is the next big bubble to pop. I don't know if I'm convinced of that yet, but it's a [compelling](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) narrative. 

Meanwhile, assets that are scarce and in demand are constantly under attack by human ingenuity to make them less scarce or less in demand. 

1. We're mining more gold in absolute numbers every year than any point in human history, at 2% per year. Asteroid/deep sea mining on the horizon might mine it even faster.
1. We're starting to use land more efficiently. Vertical farming. Lab grown meat. Remote work + digital social revolution. Dense housing. Seasteading. etc.
1. Web namespace has expanded with new top level domains. Apps don't even need a URL. 
1. It's always been hard to detect conterfeit art. 3d imagining and other technologies are probably making it harder. 
1. Fiat is getting inflated away as the money printer goes brrrrr.

I could go on. This is not to say these things won't continue to have value, because they will. They all still have utility. But they're commodities. Commodities aren't good stores of wealth, because humans will never stop trying to figure out how to eliminate scarcity, and we're really damn good at it.

Bitcoin is the only perfectly scarce thing to ever exist. It achieves this because it's scarcity isn't rooted in the physical world. It's scarcity is memetic. It's scarce because we all agree that it's scarce. Anyone is allowed to try and fork it to make it less scarce, but they're fighting game theory and a swarm of cyber hornets that will engage in the raging meme wars over digital gold supremacy that will leave attackers broke. Better to just buy some bitcoin and join the party.

And because it's perfectly scarce, it can absorb excess value that's currently over inflating other assets beyond their reasonable value. But, in order to fulfill this purpose for 8 billion humans, it needs to be worth $10s or $100s of trillions, not $450 billion.

Don't trust. 

Verify.

kidqhd,InitialConcern5260,Formula - Leveraging Crypto for Real Estate (while staying in custody of crypto).,"My apologies up front for this post.  I seek to clarify the potential of crypto / btc to acquire real estate.  I come from a real estate background and have just recently dipped my toe in crypto.  I have a metamask wallet and the first coin outside of eth i bought was PICKLE.  yes, I'm that ignorant.  I just needed to make a trade and it was badass.  Ever since I have been seeking ways to the massive, traditional Real Estate market with the bleeding-edge, anarcho-capitalist crypto world.

Here is what i am proposing.  I need holes poked in it and better suggestions for a better mousetrap. 

My client has Real Estate in Panama:  [https://www.panama-lawyers-investment-mgrs.com/project](https://www.panama-lawyers-investment-mgrs.com/project)

He will Exchange this for Crypto.  

My proposal seeks to keep the Crypto / Buyer in possession of his crypto while controlling the Real Estate.   The Buyer can use, sell, lease, improve etc the real estate as he is the owner.  In fact, the package comes with turn-key property management so the buyer never has to step foot in Panama if he/she/they so desire.

Deed to property is placed in Escrow / Trust / Custodian account by Seller

Crypto equivalent of Purchase Price is placed in Same account by Buyer.

Buyer pays payments of 6%, Interest Only, for 5 years.  Payments can be in Fiat or crypto acceptable to both parties.

Year 6 the balance is due (Balloon payment).   Payable in crypto or fiat.

From the Crypto / Buyer side, they are leveraging Crypto while staying in custody of it to buy real estate.  The crypto should appreciate in 6 years.  The Buyer can spend fiat vs crypto, further leveraging their crypto.

Seller gets payments for 5 years and a lump sum in 6.

Buyer also gets a Panamanian Bank account and Panamanian corporation to hold the real estate.

Economic citizenship / passport is available for investors of over $300k USD.

This is diversifying political risk on top of diversifying currencies.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this make sense?  Does this appeal to anyone with new-found crypto wealth?  Can you do this anywhere else, at this point in time?

This structure needs to be in the form of a Smart Contract for the 2nd transaction, imo.

Thank you in advance.  This is a real scenario.  I need real crypto people to savage it and help make it a viable formula for leveraging crypto for real estate.",1608670070,7,1

So the one big upside to the pandemic and all the free time during lockdowns is that I discovered the world of investing. I started putting money into stocks and BTC back in March/May, perfect timing I'd say as I have basically tripled my savings in less then a year. I'm still young (27y), got a stable job and so I'm pretty risk tolerant. In fact, at the moment I'm only invested in 1 stock (currently comfortably sitting at 34k EURO) and then I've got 0.38 BTC. 

There's two issues I have now with the recent bull run:  
1. FOMO  
2. That stupid psychological need to own one whole bitcoin

I have been contemplating for the past few days whether I should sell some shares in order to buy the remaining 0.62 BTC, which would be incredibly satisfying and calming to my mind. To do this, I would need to sell 1/3rd of my shares. I won't name the company I'm invested in, but it is one I am 100% confident in it having a return of 300% in 2-3 years, and even much more afterwards. 

I know most here are hardcore bitcoiners and may even tell me to ditch the stocks. Save yourself the effort if that's what you'll say cause like I said, I'm very confident in the company. Knowing this, if you were in the same situation, what would you think is the best thing to do?",1608665667,24,1

kiblzh,segdy,Anyone using Bitcoin Code? Got unusable for me,"I have used Bitcoin Core from the beginning on. The few GBs in %APPDATA%\\Bitcoin were OK. Some years ago, I had to move the `blocks` and `chainstate` directory to an external harddrive (I used `mklink /d` to create a link) ... blockchain was maybe 60GB and things still felt OK.

One week ago, after \~3 years absence, I started the Bitcoin Core client again. Meanwhile even my external harddrive is too small but meanwhile I have a multi-TB NAS. I again used `mklink /d` to create the Links to my NAS (over SMB). I achieve top speeds around \~14MB/s when accessing the NAS over Wifi. Yet it took my a week to download the 265GB worth of blockchain!

Now that it's finally downloaded, Bitcoin Core seems to be **unuseable** with this setup: It takes an hour or more until it even starts. And then it has to catch up on the new blocks which takes many hours, just for a few days or hours of changes. During all this time, a simple drop in network connection makes Bitcoin Core crash.

I get it, \~14MB/s is not the fastest but is normal for accessing a personal NAS over Wifi. It seems to me, Bitcoin Core would check the entire block chain single start, accessing all 365GB from the NAS. Of course, this will take forever.

Anyone using Bitcoin Core in a **similar setup (blockchain on NAS over Wifi)**?

Does it work?

Are there any tweaking options to make it more useable?

ki9fw2,cryptodgn,Which hard wallets are safe?,"So after the ledger hack, I wonder, which hardware wallets are safe? And I am not just talking about seed generation, but also the processes involved. 

I have never purchased a hardware wallet, mainly because it did not make any sense to me to keep my keys private, but my information public the moment I purchased the device. It was obvious that, at some point, trezor or ledger could be hacked, as their devices can be safe, but their IT systems are probably standard or substandard and are the weakest point of failure of the chain.

Not your keys not your bitcoin is a good moto, but for me it makes more sense to store some crypto it exchanges with multiple redundancies that are less prone to failure, and some in hot wallets. You can always generate the seed phrase, store it, send the bitcoin to the hot wallet and delete the app. If you want more safety, you can go multisig.

Whats your opinion here? Is it really worthy to have a hardware wallet? If so, which one?",1608657065,9,1

ki8td4,stackingsatseveryday,Global Reserve Asset vs Global Reserve Currency?,"Michael Saylor has been saying that we should promote bitcoin as a reserve asset, not as something to compete with USD or other foreign currencies and accept regulations that the KYC requirements being proposed i.e. sacrifice the privacy aspect to allow the governments some control (thus less chance of banning it or doing something more severe). Raoul Pal has also been saying that he would prefer to allow things to be more regulated so that more institutional investors are comfortable to get in. (all these could also be thought of as a trojan horse move to get bitcoin even more momentum)  


Many other bitcoiners believe otherwise and think that bitcoin is destined to become the global reserve currency -- the cat is out of the bag and there is no way to stop it. I have been thinking about this a lot lately and I think there is very little chance for outright banning in the U.S. and other developed countries but can't help wondering if there is anything the governments can do to cause FUD/panic selling and constraint bitcoin's price somehow. They can impose additional capital gain perhaps but that will also make because hold on to bitcoin longer and do less trading.  


What are your thoughts? Do you agree with Michael Saylor? If not, what do you think the government can do to regulate bitcoin even more than the proposed KYC regulations?",1608655231,11,1

kin2v8,CalebBrownCFP,Bitcoin Troubles?,"Hello,

My name is Caleb Brown and I am a registered Certified Financial Planner, I have had a lucrative career as both an advisor for large corporations as well as multimillionaire clientele. ""Better late than never"" has always been my investing strategy and currently with the price of bitcoin skyrocketing to new levels seemingly daily it was my turn to become apart of this currency of the future. My portfolio currently consists of 12 different friends/relatives who have all invested differing amounts as well as investments from my self. Through this pool of money we were able to accumulate 6.403 bitcoins. My plan is to slowly and methodically acquire more and more Bitcoin for both myself and my clients. With projections well into the $100,000s for the future of bitcoin, getting time in the market is essential. Through short selling and a few other techniques I was able to yield a 13% rate of return on bitcoin when compared to its trading price in the given timespan. I'm looking for serious investors to turn this operation into something remarkable.

Attached is my LinkedIn profile as well as my personal webpage.

I can be reached via Reddit DM for questions!

kiltdo,Yodel_And_Hodl_Mode,Safety Tip: Is it time to use a separate reddit username for Crypto? Probably,"The Ledger fiasco seems like a good reminder to think about safety in general.

It's probably wise to create a reddit username specifically for talking about Bitcoin (and anything crypto related).

Think about it:

Let's say you post in r/Bitcoin or r/BitcoinMarkets using your main reddit account. As Bitcoin keeps surging, there will be more and more incentive for criminals &amp; scammers to start going through those subs to find potential victims.

All it would take is a comment in one of those subs about reaching a goal, like owning one full BTC, or maybe 10 BTC, or whatever. A scammer could read that and start going through older comments you've made in other subs to see if they can figure out your identity.

Creepers do that all the time. A few years ago, I went on an OKC date with a woman who'd found my reddit username by googling something specific I mentioned on my OKC profile. Something seemingly unimportant. In my profile, I mentioned being a fan of an obscure band. She said she googled the band name &amp; the city we lived in, and my reddit comment was one of the things that came up.

At the time, it seemed creepy, but harmless. But that memory came back to me the moment I saw this thread.
It doesn't seem wise to post about Bitcoin from my main reddit account, so... I made this account specifically for this purpose and it's about time I start using it. Perhaps you should do the same. Then again, I bet lots of you already do this. In fact, this is something I should have done a long time ago.

Safety first. And HODL!  2021 is looking like it could be an amazing year.

To boil it down - it's that it is possible to make other cryptocurrencies that have more or less identical traits to those of bitcoin. Part of the selling point behind bitcoin is its technology, network, security, track record, and reliable store of value. This can be copied. Maybe not easily or successfully, but with time there's no reason to think there won't be successful alternatives.  So if this is true, wouldn't this take away from the ""scarcity"" argument of bitcoin? Because, in a way, the alternatives sharing all of bitcoin's positive features are like an extension of bitcoin (basically a similar asset). I get that bitcoin is more or less considered the OG coin and has prestige to its name, but over time would other successful alternatives create a sort of dilution effect on bitcoin's price?",1608695380,29,1

The jist of it is, for governments to print their way out of the crises we find ourselves in with fiat, then a government needs to print orders of magnitude more than they do now. But, if all governments around the world did this at the same time, then that doesn't disadvantage anyone as all is equal. He goes further to say this is probably what will happen, with the IMF creating a cabal or bucket of world currencies, and to be a member each government will have to print x amount of fiat and follow certain rules. The interview talks about it in much more detail and how fiat can become as desirable as bitcoin by being essentially as low inflation wise.

So if that is what is on the horizen.. thoughts? Are you concerned?",1608694607,10,1

kikl8c,satanist_oak_homo,Will the finite limit of 21M be the demise of bitcoin as a currency,"Please free to debate and prove me wrong. Very interested in your inputs:

**Will the finite limit of 21M be the demise of bitcoin as a currency**

As we know, a maximum of 21M bitcoins can ever be mined unless the system is ""democratically"" changed.

Assuming it doesn't change and people continue to adopt bitcoin as a currency or store of value, the value of bitcoin would most likely increase over time.

1) From an economics perspective this is undesirable. Inflation is desirable in order to keep the people productive by forcing them to constantly create value to beat inflation.

2) Economically powerful entities can acquire large quantities of bitcoin, ""hodl"", and set the price, at which point bitcoin loses the properties of sound money.

3) While assets like gold, diamonds, and even fiat (to a different degree) are finite and tend to attract investors, there is always speculation as to how much can be mined/printed. With bitcoin, there is no such speculation.

Conclusion:

Entities will therefore ""hodl"" and set prices. Bitcoin is not sound money. It is likely bound to become worthless when a ""better"" cryptocurrency gains popularity.",1608692334,40,1

I used to ""mine"" data for the SETI program years before bitcoin came along, and you know the blockchain thing was pretty much working back then, you used to get credits and crap, I don't even remember what but I remember leaving my PC ON working all night and day... for finding alien life... you know, reach the stars, better ourselves.

When BTC came along I mined quite a bit, also have a few mates that lost 100s of BTCs, same as me, on old hard drives, or old corrupted drives. To be honest, even if I still had them, I would have most likely sold them when I got my first mortgage, to pay for my house so I can live in it. Otherwise I could be holding BTC whilst living in my car. Obviously, if I still had a few thousand BTCs I would have to drop 1 or 2 at a time per month, or even less. It would take me decades to liquidate. I would also have to pay the TaxMan %50 of my profits, so again... how is BTC actually helping, you are just putting money back in the government pockets? I should probably try and find some of my old wallets, see if I still have anything worth selling:))

I am bitter because even now, I hate BTC so much I cannot invest in it, even if we are ""all"" getting rich. My gut just tells me NO. Same as investing in human trafficking, drugs, terrorism etc. Then again, who would benefit most from anonymity??? So you keeping feeding the individuals that really need anonymity, well done.

I am bitter that the world has enough wealth to provide for everyone, so that we all live happy lives but no one wants to do that. F greed and self entitled morons.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate BTC but love the principle behind it, it is such a shame that unfortunately it isn't used for its main and only intended purpose. Not only that but it is killing pretty much every other altcoin out there. You can't even buy anything with BTC since the fee alone makes it unpractical, and if you do buy something today it would be a huge loss. I remember when Amazon allowed BTCs, I was going to get a laptop worth £3000 for 2.5 BTCs, in 2018... the devaluation of that item would be... lets say -£60000.

&amp;#x200B;

Since every BTC fanatic, sorry lover/promoter out there keeps shouting hold, going to the moon, gonna be 100k etc. Why is 1 bitcoin entitled to a $100k value and a human life almost nothing? I know that everyone is so damn greedy that, yeah, why not have 1000 BTC valued at $100k each? What will you do with all them bitcoins? How will you converted into cash, since the BTC value is only as good as the cash value. If we were to eliminate FIAT currency and go full crypto, what would the BTC value be then? Why are you so happy that the BTC value is so high? Plenty of altcoins out there that do the same thing, even better, faster and more power efficient than bitcoin so why is BTC more valuable? It's not, just that more people mine it because of its inflated and fabricate price. Altcoins fail because no one wants to mine, there is absolutely no incentive to do so when the altcoin is affordable and costs pennies and is used, look at XRP. Are you %100 sure that the ""no one owns %50+ of the mining power""? That maybe someone out there owns shit loads of mining power? f I put in a few million $ in mining equipment, I would be very happy if 1 BTC was $100k, and I would make damn sure it stayed up there by making sure I added to the mining power and was up and running at all times. So easy to split the mining power through different entities, criminals hide money and assets like this all the time. Easy for someone to have %70 of the mining power right now, and all of you are shouting keep going man, keep going, thank you for my cut. Do you actually care? Nope, as long as you make money.

&amp;#x200B;

Why are there only 21 million bitcoins to be mined when there are billion of people in the world? I mean at least make it so everyone could own at least 1 BTC. If that wasn't set-up to be extremely rare from the beginning... I don't know what was. Of course the value goes up if it is in LIMITED supply. Isn't this how manufacturers drive their prices up? Bring out a ""LIMITED EDITION"" product and ask twice as much as the standard one? Price of gold, platinum, diamonds, pearls, truffles, endangered species etc. It isn't just the demand, it is also how hard it is to get hold of them, how much works goes into the extraction process. So why not fabricate that extraction process, make it deliberately harder and harder...

I told a mate of mine that, well you invest in BTC, so why not in criminal activities since you only care that it makes a huge profit in very little time. \[Gotta point out that the only scheme that provided huge returns in very little time are pyramid schemes... just gotta mention that again\]. His response was that no, because those are immoral and illegal. Of course he is %100 sure that whoever controls the majority of BTCs are very moral anonymous individuals.

&amp;#x200B;

You guys keep telling investors that they are dumb about speaking against bitcoin. Obviously they went to college, universities, have years of investment experience... and go through rules and regulations against money laundering, due diligence etc but are dumb. Every fibre of their body shouts that bitcoin is a Tulip Fever, a pyramid scheme, because, simply put it is. The facts point to it but everyone is buying into it. Not to mention that bitcoin was invented by a shadowy figure or a group of mysterious figures with coding that people still don't understand to this day. If this is not something you should invest in, I don't know what is safer than that:))) I can only imagine that the pressure from their clients and greed just like in 2008 is causing some of them to invest in BTC.

BTC is insulting to companies and individuals that actually provide something to society.

# So let's recap:

* **Satoshi Nakamoto is NOT a real person, so please stop quoting the name as if it was Einstein.** 
* **BTC was invented by Santa Clause, or maybe the Easter Bunny? Or some nefarious group of individuals. Who knows and who cares, right?** 
* **Some of the code is still unknown and some of the logic behind is still a mystery, but no need to look too much into it because it just works and no one knows why.**
* **Fabricate a product that is artificially made to be available in limited supply and artificially made to be very hard to get hold of. Nice $$$$$$$ to however started it. I can throw Scientology in there due to mentality and the amount of time it took them to be the powerhouse they are now. Longer term game, very long term game.**
* **It is supposed to be decentralised and yet it can be controlled by whoever has the most mining power. Pretty hard to prove that 1 entity has the majority of mining power unless they declare it publicly out of the goodness of their heart.**
* **It is supposed to be decentralised so that the banks and governments doesn't have a say, and yet they still do, since the value of each BTC is measured up against the USD. If you sell they get %50 of your cut (UK), depending what country you live in I guess it could be lower taxes. If BTC becomes ""too big to fail"" the government could simply just stop printing currency and let the price of real currency go up against the BTC, see which will win. Of course they would still need to replace old paper currency, but no more printing of new ones. This would need to be a coordinated effort by everyone. Kill BTC, easy and done. Could also just make it illegal. Maybe they should if you can't prove what each BTC transaction was used for.**
* **It is supposed to be decentralised and yet the miners and most wealthy control it. The individual that pays the most fee on their transaction is the one that has the highest priority.** 
* **It is supposed to be decentralised and yet the value is defined by the demand and anonymous individuals, which could be fabricated by the whales. Something happened between 2014 and 2017, someone very clever did something.**
* **You cannot use it in real life as actual currency, impractical. I'll go buy my bread and milk valued at £3 and pay a fee of £10 to process my payment. I have to pay for it, not the seller. Even if let's say you felt like paying a £10 commission fee, it would take anywhere between 10 minutes to 2 days for your payment to clear, depending on your fee, if the fee is too low it might not even go through.  No one will tell you the payment didn't go through, you would need to constantly check the transaction. Get a camping tent and be ready to camp in store waiting for your milk and bread.**
* **It is very impractical when trading person to person to or paying for services, you always need an exchange. Same as above, the confirmation could take so long that I could potentially double spend by sending my other wallet the same transaction with higher processing fee, and due to the greedy miner fees they would process that one first, the second trade would just fail or get forgotten after hours or days.**
* **The whole definition of a pyramid scheme is that it is** ***""a form of investment (illegal in the UK and  elsewhere) in which each paying participant recruits two further participants, with returns being given to early participants using money contributed by later ones ""*****. Sorry to point it out but isn't this the definition of BTC? Everyone is telling everyone to hop on the rocket to the moon. The more people buy the better for the early investors, the more miners there are, the more the pyramid grows. The moment either people that own a lot of BTC sell, people stop buying or the moment the BTC mining network stops mining, it all crumbles down.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Funny how there are so many people bitching about COVID with all kind of conspiracies, and yet no one bats an eye at bitcoin:))) Covid killing people and making some very rich, pharmacies will get paid a set fee for every vaccine they administer... that's printing money. BTC just making some very rich. Same people could be behind both. I bet that the majority of BTC supports have absolutely no idea how it works and why it works how it works.

If a COVID vaccine came on the market, but no one knew who made it, only that it works, for now not knowing the long term effects or what it was made of. Would you take it? If enough people promoted it, I bet you would.

Or would it mean that Bitcoin itself has increased to 500k due to demand, scarcity, value, etc...?

And let’s say it is the first example, and due to inflation bread cost $100 dollar a loaf, would that mean to buy the bread in Bitcoin you would have to spend $100 worth of Bitcoin to buy that bread?",1608774481,16,1

kk6qlx,smokingmoneyprinter,Bitcoin’s Rally Has Already Outlasted 2017’s Epic Run," Bitcoin approached $20,000 in 2017 and finally topped the mark in 2020. What drove the rallies, and what happened in the days following the peaks, show how much the market has changed in three years.

The digital currency, which has more than tripled in price this year, hit its first record of the year 24 days ago and has continued climbing, trading as high as $24,273 on Sunday. On Wednesday, it closed at $23,299. In previous rallies, such gains have quickly reversed course.

Bitcoin bulls say the money fueling this year’s rally is coming from more reliable sources than past rallies. Since September, big new investors have collectively bought about half a million bitcoins, worth about $11.5 billion, according to analytics firm Chainalysis, which tracked the holdings of investors with at least 1,000 bitcoins in wallets that are less than a year old.

kk6li1,samueldirt,The next Bitcoin?,"
A really interesting idea from the makers of www.earth.io 
Mapping out the complete earth into 10x10m tiles and letting users buy these on a digital marketplace.

First thought: seems like a scam.
Especially the selling process isn’t well designed at this point.
Things that disprove that theory:
Co-Founder of Oculus VR, Dillon Seo who helped to build a company that ultimately got acquired by Facebook for $2 billion is a confirmed part of the project.

Also the Developers will have a Twitch Stream soon, revealing more insights into goals and developments.

Currently you can earn money from property you sell with a profit or from Property Tax (roughly 1% of property value per day)
The developers have also mentioned a future implementation of a own crypto currency and a possible transformation.

So where are we now? 
Basically 1 1/2 Months after release.
Since then the price per tile in the US has skyrocketed towards nearly 9$, making a growth of over 8000% in that timeframe.


Prices in European countries have barely broken 1$ per tile and are expected to follow the development of the US. 


The website seems to run unstable, although the devs are making constant tweaks to the Servers to counteract the massive rush of Traffic towards the Website.

I would certainly recommend to everyone who is interested, to do some research and look into the website.
Seems to be a great chance, especially for beginners who want to invest.

Only invest money you are willing to lose, since this is a website in the very beginning.
I’ve invested about 900$ in total and am currently at +80% after a week and a Bit.

3. Generate paper wallet addresses, move bitcoin to them and save the paper wallet addresses on clean USB sticks  
4. Store the USB drives in a secure location  


The old computer is windows 10 and has been used before (not a clean install), but now it is just sitting on my shelf with no use and no internet.   
I know in theory there is a risk that the computer could be contaminated, but in practice would that even matter if it is not and will not be connected to the Internet?

Trying to figure out a way of calculating the possible future value of say $2,500 invested today in 20 years time, assuming 6% compounding interest monthly (through BlockFi) **AND** taking into account the possible future value of Bitcoin vs what it's worth today. 

I know there's a bunch of compounding interest calculators out there, but I'd like to also somehow factor in the current value of Bitcoin, e.g. $23,000 and an estimated future value, let's say $500,000 in 20 years time for arguments sake. Even if it just assumes a constant annual growth each year over 20 years from $23k to $500k. 

Has anyone done something similar to this with formulas in a Google sheet or whatever? I'm too dumb to figure out how to do this with FV calculations or whatever / would probably fuck it up, so figure someone smarter than me may have already done this. 

For context, I'm planning on withdrawing some medical bills out of my HSA and sticking it into BlockFi and letting it compound. Problem is, I need to convince my wife that it's going to do a lot better long term this way rather than sitting in index funds earning 8% or whatever.

kjhgb3,gbitg,Idea for a privacy preserving shipping method. Ledger inspired,"Thanks to Ledger latest hack, I had an idea for a privacy preserving shipping method. I think the best way to protect against this kind of leaks is **to not provide the information in the first place**.

Unfortunately it requires (at least one) delivery carrier to adopt such method and use it. Probably many carries would need to adopt it.

Here's how it works:

\- User goes to the delivery carrier website and insert his/her shipping address

\- User receives a ""one time shipping code"" (OTSC) in return. A 32 char gibberish tied to your real address.

\- User proceed to buy a Ledger Nano S on the Ledger website and input the OTSC code as the ""shipping address"".

\- Ledger website stores the OTSC code and ship the item to that OTSC code. The code is 100% opaque to Ledger.

\- Carrier ship the item to the correct address thanks to the extra knowledge they have. They can map the OTSC code to your address (key part to understand is that only the carrier can do this)

\- Carrier hands over the Ledger Nano S and the OTSC code is destroyed. Meaning that it is not valid anymore to ship stuff. The correlation to your address is gone.

\- Ledger database is leaked but it's full of meaningless OTSC codes :-)

Of course the real address is (temporarily) stored in the carrier database but at least that's the only place where it is stored. It's way better than have your real address stored everywhere just waiting to be leaked out.

A better and more flexible approach has been proposed in 2009, where at any point in time a carrier knows only the recipient (last leg), only the sender (first leg) or none of them (inner leg). Why no one uses it?

kjffuk,Cryptology3366,$REEF (Polkadot Project) launching on Binance Launchpool . A gem 💎,"This project is definitely one to watch out for.  it is the first polkadot project to be launched on Binance launchpool Below is overview on Reef 👇🏻!!


Reef Finance (“Reef”) is a multi-chain smart yield engine and liquidity aggregator where any DeFi protocol can integrate into. Powered by Polkadot, it shares its security model with the ecosystem, and enables cross-chain integrations across various DeFi protocols. Reef gives retail investors access to the DeFi landscape with a low technical entry barrier while at the same time augments the decision making process based on users' risk levels.


Reef's infrastructure is a chain of multiple smart contracts composing and integrating on top of the ecosystem. This entry component is called a basket engine which communicates with the liquidity aggregator and the analytics engine. 


It allows the user to invest/divest into multiple DeFi platforms with a single click and reduces the necessity to manage the outputs of the activities manually (e.g. LP tokens). The engine is being extended to support insurance cover of the basket and multi-hop strategies. 


The infrastructure will support multiple chains including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Plasm, Moonbeam and Avalanche. This will allow users access to a large number of DeFi platforms.The REEF token is a utility token used to vote on different proposals such as releasing new features, readjusting certain parameters in the system and more. Besides governance, the token can also be used to pay protocol fees.



Tokenomics:

Total supply: 20,000,000,000 REEF

Initial Circulating Supply : 3,965,900,953

Sale price : 0.0009 USD

Initial Market Cap : $3.5 million 

Listing Date : Dec 29   6 am   UTC ON BINANCE 



U can start farming reef on binance in about 4 hours from now. Just deposit you Dot, BNB or BUSD to earn rewards. Its free right..So I think everyone should do this. You can earn some juicy $REEF rewards ;)

I've been working on logging &amp; computing advanced volume data with a dynamic start and end time: Currently have VWAP &amp; volume profile (70% value area volume, VA high, VA low, POC volume, POC price) available. The volume profile can be adjusted with a tick size, default 0.5.

I also have volume data (total volume, total buys/sells, cvd, net long, net short &amp; open interest) available per tick, which can be requested by including the timestamp you're looking for.

I'm looking to offer this as a data service which can be included in their algo trading through API's. At this point the infrastructure is up &amp; running and I'm looking for some people to pilot this and give feedback meanwhile delivering value to your algo's. Currently BitMEX is supported, but happy to discuss other exchanges when there is enough interest.

You can PM me for more details and example data to review.

If you know any other communities who would be interested, I'd be happy to share more details there.

kjebet,TheIceMenAreBack,"11 facts about Bitcoin, could we see it changing hands for more than $100K within a year?"," 

1. Bitcoin creator, [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#:~:text=Satoshi%20Nakamoto%20is%20the%20name,devised%20the%20first%20blockchain%20database.), is still a mystery figure. Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the person who designed bitcoin but there’s still doubt about the real identity. Over the years, many people have been linked with the same, including Nick Szabo, Dorian Nakamoto, Hal Finney, Craig Steven Wright, and others. Some people consider Nakamoto might be a team of people. As of May 2017, Nakamoto is believed to own about 1 million bitcoins with a worth of more than $20 billion.
2. Bitcoins are limited in number. You might’ve heard about bitcoin mining, the process using which bitcoins are generated digitally. So, does this mean there could be an infinite number of bitcoins? That’s not the case. A pre-defined schedule has limited the number of bitcoins. They are slowly approaching a total of 21 million and the mining process is getting harder with each passing day.
3. It’s impossible to know the sender/receiver details. Bitcoin addresses are a long string of 34 alphanumeric characters. Using that address, it’s impossible to tell the recipient. Probably, this is the reason why most of the illegal transactions are carried out using bitcoins. To protect privacy even further, most wallet programs assign the users a portfolio ID, which is also used as a username.
4. Pizza was the first thing (good) purchased using bitcoin after the first bitcoin transaction took place between Satoshi and Hal Finney in 2009, the first recorded purchase was made for buying pizza worth $25. To do so, 10,000 bitcoins were spent.
5. Bitcoin network is much powerful than supercomputers according to the experts, Bitcoin networks has a computing power of 2,046,364 Pflop/s. This is my personal favorite fact about bitcoin. If you go ahead and combine the computing power of the 500 most powerful supercomputers, you’ll get a combined fever of 274 Pflop/s.
6. Bitcoin has been sent into [outer space](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.coindesk.com/a-bitcoin-wallet-is-orbiting-the-earth-at-five-miles-per-second%3famp=1). In 2016, Genesis Mining, a bitcoin cloud mining provider, set bitcoin to space. This was done using a 3D bitcoin model and a bitcoin paper wallet, which were tied to a weather balloon. The whole journey was recorded using a GoPro focused on the model and wallet. Once the weather balloon reached a height of 20 kilometers, the ground team made the transaction to a paper wallet. Another transfer was made to the wallet once it achieved the maximum possible altitude of 34 km.
7. A bitcoin transfer is an irreversible transaction of bitcoin. However, against popular sentiment, bitcoins are only used for less than 1% of the world's time (source: NY Times).
8. The FBI has one of the world’s largest bitcoin wallets. When the FBI [shut down](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/02/alleged-silk-road-website-founder-arrested-bitcoin) the operations of the Silk Road, it also seized the owner’s assets. In that process, the FBI also became one of the world’s wealthiest bitcoin owners, A report from the Wired magazine claims that the FBI controls as much as $120 million.
9. Losing a bitcoin wallet means losing those bitcoins just like you save your money in your online bank accounts, your bitcoins are saved in a bitcoin wallet. It’s a highly secure storage wallet. But, if you lose it, your bitcoins are lost forever. It’s also impossible for any person to use your bitcoins from your wallet until you give it to them. Also, if you have a bitcoin address, you can see the number of bitcoins the owner has.
10. The Blockchain has an alternative to all traditional platforms. For example, you can gamble via Bitcoins on EarnBet-an online licensed decentralized casino and require NO KYC in the process. Its house edge is transparent and can be verified via the Blockchain.
11. Bitcoin is highly volatile. Since its launch, in past, one-decade bitcoin has become one of the most important phenomenon in the digital world. Its price has touched thousands of dollars. However, the price keeps fluctuating and it remains volatile. Predictions have also been made that bitcoin might fall in the future if it follows the current path. This is because a small number of people, about 10, control the majority of bitcoin. This defeats the entire decentralized nature of the currency.",1608811281,0,1

I'm a newbie from the Balkans, this is a throwaway for obvious reasons . I have followed Bitcoin for a while now, but didn't have money to invest in March as my job was unstable back then and I needed the money elsewhere. Sadge. Now I want in, but would need pointers as to how / where to buy. My initial investment would be around $1500-2000 and would buy every month for a couple hundred bucks from then on. Some things to consider: 

- Idc if it's at an ath right now
- Idc if it dips, I'm not putting this money into it for short term gains
- Idc if I lose it, but that seems unlikely anyway 

Thanks folks.",1608999596,13,1

kkkwnh,buildie292,Best exchange in terms of fees to buy bitcoin in Ukraine.,"Hello all,

I've been thinking and researching a lot lately about investing in bitcoin. I think time has finally arrived.

My strategy is long-time hodling. I do not plan to trade it or buy any other cryptocurrencies.

My plan is the following:

1. Get myself a hardware wallet. Trezor looks like the promising for me.
2. Register on the exchange to buy the bitcoin (50% right now and next 50% probably by DCA).
3. As soon as the bitcoin is on my exchange hot wallet, transfer it immediately to my hardware wallet (no key - no funds, right?).

I like in Ukraine and, unfortunately, the most user-friendly exchanges and apps (like Coinbase and CashApp) are not supported in my country. Therefore, based on my research, the best exchanges  in my country are Kraken and EXMO.

I know that EXMO has been hacked recently and something like 5% of their funds have been stolen. I think they can only be stolen if you hold them on the exchange, which, as I said, I'm not gonna do.

Kraken and EXMO both support buying by credit/debit cards, but the fees, in comparison with wire transfers, are just too high (3.75% for Kraken and 3.99% for EXMO). EXMO supports wire transfers only with EEA banks and Ukraine is not part of that agreement, which means that EXMO is lost cause for now. As for Kraken, they support wire transfers either through Etana Custody or Silvergate Bank. Did anyone use them? What can you recommend?",1608999045,3,1

All fundamentals and macroeconomic/geopolitical indicators make look Bitcoin unbelievably underbought.

All the smart people who have studied this say that Bitcoin is severely undervalued and should be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

So I’ve been wanting legal income and something more secure. But I just lost a 4 pack ($8000) is what I’d sell it for. It was stolen by mailman or something.

That said, he did bring up a paper published by two professors from Texas and Ohio State tying Bitcoin price pumps to Tether issuance, and questioning Thether's dollar collateralization to their tokens (i.e. creating coins without holding the dollars to back them). Essentially, the conclusion is Bitfinex/Thether are pumping pumping the price.

The total I will need to pay back in 5 years is $128,000 (including fees and interest). I need Bitcoin to hit $28,500 per coin within the next 5 years to break even. 

Why am I doing this?

1. Bitcoin is a superior store of value than anything else on earth and as such I believe it is massively undervalued. If it hits gold’s market cap it will be $500,000 per coin. I believe it will exceed gold’s market cap.

2. It is one of the best performing assets of the last 10 years. It has a Sharpe ratio of over 1 which I’ve never seen (it’s risk/reward is amazing).

3. There is a wave of institutional money that’s coming. We all see it every week, another big investor or company announces they are in bitcoin. This is a unique position to front run the smart money. I’ve never seen an opportunity like this.

4. Macro economic conditions (zero interest rates and vast money printing) are causing people to seek places to store their money so it doesn’t lose its purchasing power. This is leading them to bitcoin.

5. The year post halving has always seen bitcoin’s highest increases in price. That happens next year. Plan B’s stock to flow model is looking more correct by the day.

This post is going to draw a lot of criticism. And rightly so, most people should NOT take out a loan to buy bitcoin. I am in a unique position where I’m single, live frugally, in a good paying job with no other debt. I can comfortably pay back the monthly repayments.

He starts explaining how the reactor consists of a balance of different forces, some of which reduce the power output  and others increase it. This old man tells the court how the things which reduced the power output were all taken out (in attempt to get the output up), and then as the output started growing unpredictably,  what they thought was going to shut the reactor down actually caused it to blow up further.

If you swap out 'the power output' with inflation, and the nuclear engineers with 'the fed', i think you get a pretty decent metaphor here.

I was mining ethereum for a bit and I got out of it and abandoned everything when I found out as it was just not worth the can of worms. 

Any tax experts here who know how to actually deal with this?  How do I claim it, and how do I pay it?

It sounds like you probably do need to do it as a business, but other than that they don't really go into much detail.  Like how do you report it, where do you send the money etc.  My tax person can't do anything without an official form like a T4 etc.

Over years I started adding more to the second one to the point that I had around 4BTC on the account with passphrase.

Today after all those bad ledger news that has been going around recently I decided to connect it and transfer my bitcoin away.

For some reason ledger did not accept my pin code and after 3 attempts deleted everything. I went back recovered the account using the stored key phrases but now I can't remember the passphrase I used for the second account. And just like that I lost close to 4BTC!

There is a list of passwords I usually use and I might need to try them all one by one in different variation but the process on ledger is slow and time consuming.

Is there anyway I can import ledger seeds to a software wallet and then try different passphrases to speed up this process?

After having my personal data publicly available online thanks to ledger, now I have lost 10s of 1000s of dollars to their state of art security measure of 3 failed password attempts = self destruction.

km3v0w,jokerspit,A simple explanation on BTC value,"Bitcoin is an infant asset class on the world's stage; for only a decade now.  It's value comes in its volume of transactions, its hash rate, it's number of nodes, its scarcity, its usage.  Without all of this, the value isn't there. 

So Fiat comes in.   First miners, then people like me buying it in 2013 with nigerian/russian phone cards.  Then you get exchanges and Coinbases allowing credit cards.   In late 2017, it was a small subset of retail investors buying into FOMO.  

Us OGs knew that when institutional money came in, there would be fireworks.

Today, institutions ARE buying Crypto in an increasing fashion.   They are partnering with crypto companies, hiring devs for their own blockchains, and flat out buying coins and grayscale derivatives.  There are futures and options markets.  As new products like DEFI and NFTs develop - it brings in more money.  Institution also have a lot MORE money than retail.. 

**When more and more money comes into a fixed amount of coins,  the market cap and price HAS to go up. **

So what's this mean for the future?

Well gold is another asset on the worlds stage, worth about 11 Trillion dollars in it.  BTC only has about 500B in it.   

If BTC reaches parity with Gold, that's 22X higher than now.  If Bitcoin reaches half parity with Gold, that's 11X.

I don't see investment in this new asset class stopping anytime soon.  IMO - It's still cheap.

We’re making the world better in so many ways!","For those who are not familiar, gold is an amazing anti corrosion conductor and has numerous other properties that give it productive value. Years back, I would hear the argument that gold is more intrinsically valuable than BTC for this very reason.

With that being said, the price of gold today reflects its increasingly obsolete role as a store of value / safe haven asset. If folks stop hoarding gold for those purposes, the price will plummet and productive entities in science and engineering will have greater access than ever before. The ensuing wave of innovation will be dazzling.

Regarding the dated argument that gold is intrinsically more valuable than Bitcoin, remember that we are more scarce, more fungible, more trustworthy, and increasingly more in demand... Among other points.

My current crypto portfolio involves 12% ETH, 5.5% ADA and the rest is BTC.

I'm thinking of selling my ETH for BTC as I think this bull cycle will have a bigger emphasis on bitcoin. With billionaires, funds and other buying strictly bitcoin, it might have a higher pressure on the price while ETH might just move upward but just because bitcoin is going up. ETH 2.0 came out and wasn't very dramatic. I am staking my cardano and won't sell as I feel that it's undervalued and could explode over the medium term.

km2kjv,SuperJew113,"I just wanted to discuss the vague concept of ""honesty"" in currency","I grew up with a dad who had a masters in business, and the credential to teach a micro or macroeconomics class. He was a GS13 in the Federal Government in the 70's-90's, and you might he looked quite a bit like ""D-FENS"" in Falling Down, even down to the horn rimmed glasses. But he was a defense engineer like D-Fens, he was managerial and on the civilian side of government operations.

He imparted on me Fiat, why it can work, and it currently/then was working. Those $'s and $bonds are basically backed by the US Treasury, its government, its infrastructure, its economy, its people, its empire/imperialism. And this was why in spite of no longer being backed by gold reserves and effectively as good as gold, were now backed by those concepts. 

To me it made perfect sense back then and I suppose under an ideal timeline to me it still makes sense. 

Here's where both me and him got blind sided: Egregiously high levels of grift/corruption/theft/kleptocracy and a propaganda network to support it among Americans/knee cap their own country, that for me, and I think on some level him, and we're both very sad to say this, can undo even a very powerful country like The United States.

Something feels very wonky, and I see that pic of Steve  Mnuchin and his wife, with that sheet of $currency, something is very wrong. To me we basically have criminals running our country. 

As I understand it, $'s are just not anywhere near as scarce, as they were 10 years ago. I dunno if we've felt the full force/brunt of inflation. $'s can printed off with as little effort as a keystroke basically. 

I work for a living. I work hard, yet I don't make a good living.

My dad was a selfless public servant to this country, and now the Fox's have gotten in the henhouse, and are running the show. I don't want to be paid in their currency, especially for how hard I work vs how little I make. 

Question: As a former patriotic American (I'm still patriotic, but every day seems worse than the last in this shithole), would I be correct to say that bitcoin is looking like a helluva lot ""more honest"" currency to be paid your wages in, than historically me taking $USD for my labor?

km1u3s,discosoc,Some context (and caution) on what's driving Bitcoin right and what can come next.,"I'm not here to tell you to invest or not in Bitcoin, but rather talk about some of the reasons Bitcoin is getting stronger right now, and how it relates to the overall US economy.  My hope is that maybe people will stop treating Bitcoin growth as some vaguely magical thing that happens on wishes and dreams.  Speculative investing certainly makes that happen, but there are larger reasons for the current growth cycle: institutional investors.

First of all, I want to make clear that what I'm talking about is more related to institutional investors (II) than anyone else.  These are large entities or companies that look for ways to earn more money with the money they have, and on a scale well-beyond what a random person can do.

OK, some basic facts to get us started:

* The US dollar is very strong right now.
* Interest rates are very low.
* Businesses are not expanding.
* The US economy and stock markets are both being propped up by the Fed and Congress.

Normally, when an II is sitting on a huge pile of cash, they invest it somewhere based on what's going on with the economy.  For (a simplified) example, they move money into stocks for gains when markets are doing well and into treasury bonds for interest when they aren't doing well.  

Now for various reasons, there just aren't many good places to park huge amounts of money:

* A strong US dollar normally means invest in foreign economies, but Covid has crushed most growth opportunities there.
* Interest rates being low means little incentive to simply loan the money out or invest in treasury bonds.
* Businesses aren't expanding, so even if interest rates were higher there simply isn't much demand.
* The US economy might look good on paper, but it's being driven by a rather narrow set of industries uniquely situation to benefit from a pandemic (mostly tech) and held up by Fed policy.  As post-vaccine life takes hold in the next 6+ months there's going to be major (but unclear) economic changes.

*In short, institutional investment in Bitcoin right now has less to do with Bitcoin being great, and more to do with trying to figure out where to park money until economies start returning to normal.*

So what does this mean for everyone else?  At the absolute minimum, I would expect Bitcoin to drop as the economy recovers and IIs have better (read: traditional) places to put their money.  They won't abandon it or anything, but large transactions (sells) will impact the price.  A few headlines of companies selling their stake in Bitcoin can easily trigger investor panic.  In particular, look for signs that any of the above points are changing.  If the US dollar weakens, interest rates increase, businesses start expanding, or the US economy stops being propped up by the Fed, Bitcoin is going to drop.",1609198367,43,1

km1onv,trakatan,Selling bitcoin is stupid,"There. I said it. Financially speaking is incredibly stupid. Unless your life depends on the bitcoin you hold (which is stupid in the first place because you should only put into bitcoin what you can afford to lose), selling bitcoin is stupid. Is stupid, and you have to pay taxes. So it's stupidity squared.

You need a house? get a mortgage. Need a car? get a loan. Or stop buying more bitcoin, but DON'T sell your bitcoin. Don't sell your bitcoin to buy stuff. Your bitcoin savings will outperform all your loans and mortgages in the next 5 years.

If you do otherwise you don't understand what bitcoin is and you deserve to pay for your stupidity by selling your bitcoin to someone who understands what bitcoin is.

I'm not talking about people who had some traumatic experience in life and need to sell because of that. I'm talking about people who post ""I'm selling when bitcoin gets to X"". 

Nobody ever said ""I'm happy because I sold 5 bitcoin worth 50k to buy a new car"".  Because if had gotten a loan for 50k and hodl your bitcoin, you would now have more than 120K. And this will always happen.

""Yes, I sold 10 bitcoin in November 2020, paid taxes and bought a house, and I'm really happy"" will say nobody ever. You will punch yourself in 10 years time for such a stupid decision. You will never ever own 10 bitcoin again.

Bitcoin will rule the world. Only 21M btc. Unlimited fiat. If you sell, you are stupid, and I hope you....

km0omo,Legiann,A Bitcoin Shortstory,"It was thursday morning, I took the underwater metro to go my work as usual. I was early today as I wanted to buy myself a sandwich. I walked into this little store and laid my favourite sandwich on the counter, the one that actually contained some meat, I believe it was pork. I pulled ouy my wallet to pay for the sandwich, these portable hardware wallets are quite fast nowadays, for a while they were mainly used for storing some satoshis. The cashier looked at me and asked if I wanted a receipt after the satoshish were deposited. The sandwich was about 3 satoshis, so I wasn't interested in the receipt and kindly declined. These past receipts have been sitting on my wallet account for ages, I did not feel the need for a new one.

While walking through the metrostation I deposited a satoshi into the account of a begger on the side of the station, seemed like he needs it more than I do, what's 1 satoshi anyway. Some strange years ago it would've been about 4 dollars, but that's a term already unkown to this newer generation. Generation B they're called, as everyone these days dreams of owning a bitcoin we decided to name them Generation B. Very few people are able to say they own a full Bitcoin themelves so anyway, but this generation looked promising enough. I wonder how many satoshis would it even take to get there..",1609194726,13,1

kmig7q,Adamsimecka,Michael Saylor is a genius. But not for the reasons you might think.,"...yes, Salor is a very astute investor, CEO, and economist. But his bitcoin strategy is almost flawless.

Let me explain. 

He buys $175m worth of bitcoin for an average price of $9,882.

Then, after he is in (personally) he leads his company, Microstrategy, to buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of BTC between $10k and $12k.

THEN he raises another $650m to buy BTC for his shareholders at an average of about $22k.

Think about that. His ""personal"" position of BTC is well below his company's and his shareholders' position.

If BTC ever started to crash, or his company or shareholders want out, he would have plenty of notice and opportunity to dump his stash first.

I know what you might be thinking... isn't this illegal? Actually it is not - at least not according to current insider trading laws since BTC is not a publicly traded company. Saylor is not obligated (nor required) to disclose his personal bitcoin holdings.

Gold’s worth is only high due to the high-level perceived value given to it (e.g it’s shiny). Gold is not used for much by the average person, what practical value does it have other than the value we assign it? It has other, better primary used... such as, it is a great heat/electrical conductor while having very high anti-corrosive properties. Due to this, it is used generously through out computer hardware. Gold is also great as a medical utility as it has a high biocompatibility with the human body and high resistance to bacterial colonization. As BTC/ETH price rises, the price of gold stemming from the belief of it being a secondary store of value should, and will go down due to a better hedge against the dollar being elsewhere. In turn, computing hardware becomes cheaper, and thus computing power increases at a decreasing cost — cc: Moore’s law. In short, gold is much better suited not as a to store or increase value, but as a way to lower costs and subsequently increase technological ROI.",1609257956,6,1

I downloaded and installed Tails to a USB ([https://tails.boum.org/](https://tails.boum.org/)).   After it was burned to the USB, I booted into Tails, and **did not** connect to the internet.    I enabled persistent storage, then created a new wallet with the already installed Electrum, paper recording (for now) the seed.   I then took a photo of the QR code for the public key, and logged off.

After removing the USB, I created a new wallet in Electrum on my Windows 10 install.   I used the public key to create a watching only wallet (which is a misnomer....it's excellent for watching and receiving BTC).   I then moved all my BTC to that wallet.

The idea is the Tails install will never touch the internet.   Instead, if I need to spend BTC, I'll log into the Tails install to sign any transactions, then broadcast that from the Windows wallet.   I realize this is more difficult than a hardware wallet, but the price seemed right (free) and I can't really see how the security could be reasonably defeated (except by physically stealing my keys, or somehow installing some malware that survives reboot and makes it into Tails).

What do you all think?   Decent solution?",1609254267,36,1

kmg04y,couchcushion-find,Suggestions on recovering my couch-cushion find,"Hi Reddit, apologies for the noise. There really doesn't seem to be a more appropriate sub for this.

This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. I've found an install of Multibit HD 0.5.1 on a computer I hadn't switched on since 2016. Miraculously, I remember the password and there's a little BTC in there. Not a lot, not really worth sending it to Dave even at current prices, but enough that it'd be nice to move it someplace more useful. We're talking xx,000 sats.

The situation I'm in is this: I have a list of transactions to and from the wallet displayed in Multibit HD. The TXIDs check out on [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com), but Multibit HD is unable to get a status for them, so it shows the remaining wallet balance as unconfirmed. So it seems like I have full access to the wallet, but Multibit can't parse the blockchain. It claims that it has 10 peers and there are no blocks remaining to process, so I'm assuming that a change made to the blockchain since Multibit stopped being supported now means it can't parse blocks or transactions correctly.

The wallet is old enough that its public address is P2PKH format, and I have no evidence of there being a BIP39 seed anywhere for it, so restoring it that way is off the table, sadly. What I thought I might be able to do is export the private keys from Multibit and import them into something more current like Electrum before moving the balance into cold storage. Unfortunately, it seems like Multibit HD can't export keys, only Multibit Classic can. External utilities to export the keys out of a wallet seem to fail in one way or another. Most solutions to this problem on Google were written between 2017 and 2019, and involve extracting the keys from the .aes file with one of these utilities, or just ignore that Multibit HD can't export private keys.

So that's where I am, Reddit. I have a wallet, I have the password, I know how much is in it, I just don't seem to be able to get it into a position where it's properly usable on the blockchain. Reddit being the font and source of all wisdom, I humbly ask: does anyone have any Multibit wallet sorcery they can suggest?",1609254140,4,1

But it doesn't make any sense, if bitcoin was purposed as a payments alternative it would have to be able to process 1000s of transactions per second. I'm sure the creator/s knew this but proceeded anyway.

If that's the case then 2.5 billion bitcoins at $39K a coin, then he's richer than all the oils tycoons in the world, which brings us back to why invest in wall street stocks, when bitcoins will make you super rich over night.",1609386772,18,1

knhvrs,justinlongbranch,"Bitcoins popularity in the media won't happen again like 2017 until it breaks 40k, 50k, or more","Bitcoin is just now starting to be mentioned in the main stream news media.  This is a good thing.  Institutional investment in Bitcoin is passingly interesting. Bitcoin surpassing it's previous ATH is a bullet point.  Bitcoin doubling its ATH is a headline.  

This is a purely psychological issue, going from 2,000 to 10,000 is news worthy, because there's such a huge difference in those price points and people can work with those numbers easier in their heads.  Makes for catchy headlines, journalists do their jobs the hype train leaves the station and it rockets to double the price. 

However, as numbers grow in size the anchor points become more and more spread out.  So when Bitcoin regained and passed it's previous ATH this was huge news for people that follow Bitcoin.  But to people who don't, it barely registers.  Getting to 40k, doubling it's ATH!  Now that's newsworthy to the casual observer, that generates headlines, that generates clicks.  Once it breaks 50k then it's halfway to an order of magnitude change.  100k? You won't be able to look at any media without seeing Bitcoin everywhere. 

The path there whether long or short will be an easy to follow graph for media organizations to display in made for tv graphics.  It's real meme material.  And when that happens then we see some real major fomo growth rockets to the moon.

TLDR;. Bitcoin is going to the moon, it's not news til it's halfway there, or at least twice as far as it's been before.",1609385405,57,1

I have the following question. If the time it will take me to find the value of the message with the SHA-256 is the age of the universe x37 (2 \^ 256); So, how is it that for example with an ASIC miner I find this message in a maximum time of 10 minutes (period of each block)?

Or the same BTC algorithm adjusts the difficulty according to the number of mining nodes so that they find the NONCE in no more than 10 minutes. Since that way it wouldn't take forever to find that longed-for NONCE.

I could buy a whole BTC or partial. Wait until it dips (it might never).

AFTER buying bitcoin through paxful, your funds will be locked until KYC is completed. There is no warning of this beforehand. If you are unable to complete the KYC verification your funds will be permanently locked in paxful. You cannot even trade them back to your original form of payment

The KYC is some of the most aggressive I have ever seen,  involving submitting photos of government documents as well as a live 'video selfie' of your face for facial recognition purposes

k46nu1,hodler_hero,"When anyone asks ""Why do we need Bitcoin""","Bitcoin is often referred to as a speculative asset by many in the western world, with few to no ""real world"" use cases. Many of these individuals live in a unique socio-cultural bubble enabled by central bank monetary expansion. However, billions of individuals across the world do not have the luxury to ignore Bitcoin and it's unique monetary properties. [https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/11/assad-syria-collapse-313276](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/11/assad-syria-collapse-313276) 

In Syria, the economy has deteriorated to the point that hyperinflation has played a major role in destroying small business and washing away individuals' life savings. Nongovernmental organizations are now quietly warning of a Syrian famine as the nation has not secured enough wheat to last the   
remainder of the year. Countless Syrians stored their wealth in the Lebanese banking system, believing it to be to secure. However, simply put, the entire Lebanese banking system turned out to be a Ponzi, enriching a few members of the Lebanese elite at the expense of two nations' stored wealth. These stolen funds then ultimately end up in places such as off-shore financial structures in the Cayman Islands and London Real Estate, which in turn increase the wealth and leverage of the transatlantic elite in Europe and the United States. The elites then use this economic influence to buy   
out individuals, companies and entire nations. Every tinpot third world dictator and oligarch has property or assets via various financial structures in the Western World. Don't believe me? Look at the furious response of the Russian government to the passage of the Magnitsky Act. [https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/07/magnitsky-act-kremlin/535044/](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/07/magnitsky-act-kremlin/535044/)

Bitcoin nips this toxic feedback loop in the bud. If individuals in Syria and Lebanon had easy access to purchasing and securely holding bitcoin, the influence of the state on economic affairs would profoundly wane, allowing sovereign individuals to engage in economic transactions and store wealth without concerns of seizure or hyperinflation. The state would lose a great deal of leverage over it's population and as a result, these nations and perhaps the world would be a more equitable, just and free place. Bitcoin enables ALL of this. When people attempt to discredit it or say its a toy, just remember the place of profound privilege and excess that allows them to say these things.  

That being said, if you are from the United States or Western Europe, please do not engage in any Bitcoin transactions with individuals from internationally sanctioned countries due to the risk of incredible legal peril. These nations are merely useful examples to provide since they had stable, relatively well functioning economies when Satoshi's whitepaper was produced and have since slid towards becoming failed states.  

Final notes: If anyone could produce a solid analysis on how Bitcoin affects power structures in third world countries or has any relevant information on this, that would be very helpful to the community and the world at large! 

TLDR: 1. not your keys, not your coins 2. Bitcoin enables freedom and sovereignty, 3. Governments have historically abused and will continue to abuse monetary systems to pursue various agendas, oftentimes with tragic consequences for society as a whole. 4. **The Bitcoin revolution is NOT a success until individuals anywhere in the world have seamless and effortless on ramps (off ramps not needed :D) to acquire Bitcoin in order to a. securely transact goods and services and b. store and retain their wealth.**",1606774429,17,1

How’s that panic floor working out?,"U/bigbitcoinbull was one of the shill accounts I was referring to in my recent post “User is Suss”. Despite the name, this fanny bandit was a freshly created account that posted numerous times across r/Bitcoin to doomcry that any correction below $18,000 would surely result in a drop to $13,000. This guy acted like a major know-it-all douche, surely sold out, and was hoping to incite other’s to panic. He gave us a bunch of senseless FUD, ate a lot of bad karma, and I hope he lost out by having not bought back in yet. Stay strong HODL gang recruits! Not everyone who preaches skepticism is being intelligent or authentic. Always be a least a little wary of brand new accounts, operated by knowledgeable users, that make aggressive price claims",1606774306,8,1

there is no transaction id. no transparency on where the money is. no way they can check the status. there is no way for them to pay more to get the transaction accelerated. they are in the dark, completely at the mercy of an incompetent credit union.

meanwhile, im watching bitcoin transactions in the order of millions being confirmed for &lt; $15 in hours or less with full transparency at each step.

k43i9d,jroseland,Guy Paypal-disputed my LocalBitcoin trade from Sept - what should I do?,"I've been on LocalBitcoins for several years, got hundreds of trades under my belt.

Back on Sept 13th, I did a Bitcoin-for-Paypal trade with a guy, *annoyingly* he sent me the money in broken-up amounts from 4 different Paypal accounts. I released the Bitcoins from escrow when I'd received it all. Yesterday this guy disputed all 4 Paypal transactions, I received emails from Paypal stating...

&gt;Unauthorized transaction - The buyer reported that someone made the order without their permission.

I could respond to the disputes in Paypal but then I have to let Paypal know that I'm selling Bitcoin for Paypal funds. And Paypal would also probably want my LocalBitcoins receipt for the transaction so I'd have to explain to Paypal that this one LocalBitcoins trade represents the 4 disputed Paypal transactions. **Might I lose my Paypal account (had it for +10 years) for letting them know that I'm engaging in LocalBitcoin trades?**

The trade was only about $70 total, should I just take the loss to avoid getting my Paypal account red-flagged for engaging in crypto-trading? I'm an American living in Bulgaria so I'm wary of Paypal scrutinizing my account.

The guy (I have his username and real name) is still on LocalBitcoins and active so I could change my feedback on the trade and let everyone know he's a scammer BUT I'd rather avoid getting in a retaliation war with some petty scammer (although he has a 100% feedback score like me).

I did email the guy (at all 4 of his email addresses) telling him to clear the fallacious Paypal disputes from his end since he received all the Bitcoin he was owed back on Sept 13th. He opened the email but did not respond.

k4jhns,B1ggusDckus,Warning: Avoid Ledger hardware wallets,"I'd like to tell you about the experience I had with the Nano Ledger X. All in all, it was so bad that I decided to get a Trezor and never look back. Should have definitely done this in the first place, but the Nano X looked nice on paper. The bad thing is, I will never be able to leave this experience behind me since my data is now to be found on the internet.

\-Their software is a pile of crap. Bluetooth pairing issues with the Nano X, price doesn't show correctly, price history has gaps which show wrong pricing

\-It's highly inappropriate that they have advertisement to buy cryptos from their partners on their app; What are you? Instead of creating a scummy side business try to fix the user experience first or properly secure your customer database.

\-Nano X broke after literally using it five times (within 1 1/2 years). They won't replace it without getting my device back which still contains my private key and can't be reset. I've asked them to send them proof of destruction but they won't give in. Oh btw, only took them 15 days to answer my support request.

\-Lost my data during the data breach. How can you trust a company with your assets if they aren't able to properly secure a simple database (and the data shouldn't have been stored in the first place)? And fuck you Ledger for leaking my phone, email, address and name into the darknet. Now everybody knows I own cryptos.

Honestly, I've lost complete trust in Ledger. They seem to have a very wrong attitude. I wouldn't be surprised if their RNG is flawed as well.

tl;dr

I highly regret being a Ledger customer because of their shitty software, their subpar hardware and the fact that they didn't even manage to secure a database containing customers private information.",1606823675,149,1

k4j9gq,Wayne-Kinoff,Early prediction on next bitcoin,"
Afternoon ladies and gents, lately ive been investing a fair chunk of coin into this website called earth2.io which is still in a very premature growth stage at the moment. It seems very promising and ill give you a very quick run down of what it is.
Basically earth2.io have digitalised the whole earth into 10m2 tiles. You can buy any tile you want in the world whether it be the Eiffel tower or your local brothel, and when more and more people buy in the same country, the value of your tiles go up. 

So its a simple supply and demand equation although they have also added additional ways you can bring in revenue which you can DYOR, they will be increasing the amount of revenue streams the more its developed. 
Im checking it every day and the land tax im earning from the tiles ive bought, is constantly going up, and there is more and more people buying up places on earth.

10 years ago im sure there were many doubters about bitcoin, so imo its worth a cheeky stab cause you just never know.

Let me know your thoughts before i put my weekly wage into it.

The cost of fiat infrastructure is enormous and uses a tremendous amount of energy and natural resources.

Fiat is inherently insecure - if you are physically robbed or the money is physically destroyed you have no recourse. If you want to store it safely with a bank you will be charged for the privilege.

Each week I purchase a set amount of BTC based on the cost. The instructions are as follows (the amounts of BTC are just an example, but I think you get the picture):

* If BTC &lt; $5000, buy 0.05 BTC
* If $5000 &lt; BTC &lt; $10,000, buy 0.02 BTC
* If $10,000 &lt; BTC &lt; $20,000, buy 0.01 BTC
* If $20,000 &lt; BTC &lt; $40,000, buy 0.005 BTC

k5e2pm,Juana3000,How to turn a Raspberry Pi into a Bitcoin trading bot with no extra hardware and open-source software!,"I'm having a lot of fun with this and thought to share it with all Bitcoiners. 

This is what you'll need:

* Raspberry Pi 2GB RAM ($40). If you plan to run long (multi-year) backtests you will likely need the 4GB or 8GB version (2 GB is enough for shorter backtests and trading live).
* Flash-card, 16Gb ($7).
* Raspbian / Ubuntu ($0, open-source).
* Node.JS ($0, open-source).
* Git ($0, open-source).
* Superalgos (0$, open-source).

I'll assume your Raspberry is fully set up with Raspbian or Ubuntu. If it's not, just follow the manufacturer's instructions.

Let's get on with the rest of the software set up:

1. Download and install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Download and install [Superalgos](https://github.com/Superalgos/Superalgos).

You don't want to run the Superalgos GUI on your Raspberry… the 2GB RAM version won't be able to cope with it.

**The clever setup is to use the Pi as a backend service that you access from your regular machine's browser. That way you can leave the PI on, trading 24/7, while you do your stuff on your main PC.**

So, run Superalgos with the `noBrowser` option, and add `minMemo` too (to prevent the RPI running out of memory):

`node run minMemo noBrowser`

The command will start Superalgos backend servers on your Pi!

Then, open Chrome (the only tested browser) on your regular machine to access the Superalgos backend web server. You will go to the Raspberry's IP address on port 34248. Like this:

[`http://RaspberryIPNumber:34248/`](http://RaspberryIPNumber:34248/) (make sure you use the actual IP Address in your local area network!)

Once in, click Stop on the Welcome tutorial, right-click to open the design space map, and click on the Network hierarchy. Expand the hierarchy (plus button on the menu) and find the Network Node.

&amp;#x200B;

[Remember to right-click to access the design space map!](https://i.redd.it/kmklep6b6t261.gif)

Now, access the configuration of the Network Node (select Configure on the menu) and change the host by typing your Raspberry's IP address:

`{`

`""host"": ""RaspberryIPNumber"",`

`""webPort"": ""34248"",`

`""webSocketsPort"": ""18041""`

`}`

Exit the configuration by withdrawing the mouse pointer from the configuration bubble. The GIU will auto-connect in less than a minute, and you are ready to go!

If you are not familiar with Superalgos, then right-click to open the design space map again, and click on the Welcome to Superalgos tutorial hierarchy on the bottom-left corner, open the menu, and click Resume.

The tutorial will take you through all the basics and help you run your first data-mining operation, your first backtest using a demo trading system, and even your first live trading session on Binance. The tutorial answers all of your questions about what Superalgos is and how it works... it's fun, and it's fully interactive... you start fiddling with the app as you go and learn all the basics right then and there.

It'd be too long to explain everything the app does, but I can say it covers an impressive stretch of what is required to do some big-time trading, including pro data mining, data visualization, visual strategy design, visual strategy debugging, coordinated deployments of multiple bots, etc. Just give it a go and see for yourself!

Once you go through the first experience, you may learn to design your own strategies or use the ones shared by the Community.

&amp;#x200B;

[This is how a strategy looks...](https://i.redd.it/64rqrqgw6t261.gif)

**The set up you just created is the minimum expression of a** [**trading farm**](https://docs.superalgos.org/suite-fundamental-trading-farms-concepts.html)**. If you have more Raspberries, or even old laptops or desktops gathering dust in the closet, pull them out, and set them up as new nodes on the Network!**

A trading farm setup may run distributed and coordinated tasks across multiple machines, and each machine may run as many trading sessions as the hardware can cope with!",1606930979,44,1

k5cm4c,TheAlmightyRedditor,Comparisons of Bitcoin and the Early Stock Market,"Now, I’ll start with disclaiming that I know there is a massive difference between a currency and a complete market. You can’t draw exact conclusions if you look at it up close, because fundamentally things are different. However, what you can draw from the two are human nature. Both the stock market and bitcoin has gone through periods of heavy speculation and devalue, as well as temporary bubbles (fomo vs overinvestment) in their early years. The Great Depression was caused by a lack of understanding of the market fundamentals by the majority of household investors who had paper hands when it all came crashing down. Not enough iron hand professionals and confident humans who buy and sell with purpose and understanding, just majority amateurs who let it die. But who wouldn’t? You’re scared, it’s an early market that has never gone through something like before and you are scared it might just go back to zero (lack of understanding). 

Now think of bitcoin, the 2017 crash was caused by lack of understanding of the asset and importance leading into the meteoric rise. Scrambled buying to get rich followed by people who didn’t know what was going on, and not a majority of players in the ecosystem fully understood the asset at that point, it was flooded by amateur household buyers. Now it reaches 20k and all the holders are getting ready for moon, meanwhile some of these iron hands see a insane gain in front of them, some 20,000%. So some sell. Not all sell all, they still believe in the currency and are smart traders just trading profit. Well, household traders see the dip and begin panic buying, leading us into this 3 month sell of period where the majority of the market who were uneducated sold out, bought to high, gonna cut my losses and move on. 

Now as we continue to look forward, people will continue to learn more and more about cryptocurrency and trust it’s value as these massive whales of public company continue to switch to blockchain as a back end. Visa is moving to an ethereum based stablecoin. PayPal offering on their site and investing heavily. Those are already two key players, and they are overcapping companies for the entire world as a whole. Not just Albertsons moving their live accounting ledger to blockchain. And when the less informed sell, it will be only a percentage of the market as a whole, and even that less informed percentage as a whole will drop as well as more people speculate less.

My point is, we’re still early here. Volatility will calm down for many reason, and I really think that if more companies keep jumping into crypto, we could really start growing more exponentially than people want to realize.",1606926871,2,1

k5ch9y,NinjaBoy123456,Keep Coin on Ledger or Exchange?,"I would like to contribute to the discussion of storing your coins on a ledger or exchange.

I truly believe that based on the Bitcoin trend that it will go into the hundreds of thousands of dollars in the next few years.  That raises questions in my mind about how trustworthy exchanges are.  If the price does go that high, will I be able to get my money? Is it hacker proof? Are the leaders of exchanges trustworthy? Will they run off with my money?

For example, banks are regulated and your deposits are guaranteed by the federal government up to 250k.  Are crypto exchanges regulated? I don't know.  Who runs them? I don't know. Who controls the money? I don't know. What if they closed down tomorrow? I'd be fucked.

Before I invest more of my hard earned money, I need a little more trust in the institutions.

This is a good argument for storing your coins offline on a secure hardware ledger.  Problem is, I don't trust myself to not lose it.  What if the house burns down? What if the hardware gets corrupted? What if I lose it?

I know I know.  I would need to store is somewhere safe. I could use a lockbox at a bank or fire proof safe.  Yes. TRUE! I still don't trust myself - that's just me.

There's a guy I follow on Twitter named Nicholas Cole. He's a freelance writer who was hired to write many articles for companies about crypto. After being forced to research and write so much he learned about crypto and invested. He then made hundreds of thousands of dollars.

I asked him on Twitter what he thought of exchanges.  He said this: ""If you have a vault/safety deposit box in a bank, maybe do it. But I don't trust myself to safely store a wallet like that. If you really want to safeguard, put holding across multiple exchanges: Coinbase, Robinhood, Binance, etc.""

That solved the problem for me.  I don't have to store it in a hardware wallet and get piece of mind that multiple exchanges probably won't fail at the same time.

Nothing is guaranteed, of course. But I'm going to follow his advice.

I know there are transactions fees but BTC is already being wrapped to other chains to avoid paying those fees. 

Miners will have to leave if incentives are insufficient. This will cause lower security and higher risks for all BTC holders. With institutional buyers on the rise recently, such a  risk cannot be taken. So, as the title says: Will BTC's price rise endlessly to maintain security? Will there be at some point a mass exodus to another chain that ensures fair rewards for miners/validators, causing BTC's price to crash suddenly?

If prices keep on rising forever, how is that different from a central bank magically increasing the supply of a ""stable"" currency?

Since Core uses hardened indexes it appears that any computer that can coordinate the multisig (derive the multisig addresses) MUST have one of the following:

1. The private key for the Core HD wallet
2. A list of every public key from the Core HD wallet that will be needed

Option 1 destroys the isolation between the computers and therefore the protection that multisig was supposed to provide.

Option 2 seems out of step with the push toward descriptor wallets. It is a ""bag of keys"" model, and the coordinating computer has no way to calculate where in the derivation tree a given public key actually sits.

Am I missing something fundamental here? Or does using a fully hardened HD tree just have these trade-offs? It really doesn't seem worthwhile to harden like this if you are going to be using the wallet in a multisig.",1606920161,7,1

k59dzg,LiamLinx,Investing Bitcoin for long term (unborn child)," Good Morning All,

Hope everyone is doing well. I've been on my crypto journey for around a year now, for most of the time I have been using coinbase pro as I have only been investing very small amounts. Just putting in small amounts each month, maybe a little more if there is a dip etc. I feel like very much an intermediate crypto user, I've done a lot of lurking!

I just recently discovered that my first child is due summer next year! So am beginning the process of investing long term for their future. I will be putting so much away in traditional savings accounts available in the UK (Junior ISA probably) but would also like to earmark a monthly payment probably something around £50 to be invested in crypto long term (18 years ish.)

I've just started to experiment with interest bearing accounts (blockfi and Nexo) and have been pretty impressed with them. At the moment it all seems very un-streamlined though I have to deposit my money in coinbase then buy bitcoin/ether then transfer into whichever account I decide to go for.

I guess my question is am I missing something obvious, is there no product that allows me to just set a recurring deposit weekly/monthly from my bank account, automatically convert it into crypto at current market rate for DCA and then hold it? For the long term I would really like to set and forget it otherwise I am too tempted to fiddle around!

I'm not looking to make millions here! Just have something for the future.

Thank you for your time!",1606916415,18,1

k6lbjg,SolarPanelDude,How does a Bitcoin ATM work? (from an boring economist standpoint),"  

Correct me if my assumptions are wrong. I go to a bitcoin ATM and bring my local currency. In this case, USD. I put them in, a digital transaction on a ledger is made, and then I receive the appropriate amount of bitcoins in my digital wallet based on the conversion rate.

But who do the dollars go to? 

This is not like a regular classical ATM in the sense that it is dollar for dollar. The operator of the classical banking network gives you remote access to your money, and handles the behind the scenes ledger work to make the numbers correct, in exchange for a fee. 

In a bitcoin ATM, you have deposited physical dollars into a machine.  Who owns the machine? The store owner? A random investor? 

Did the owner of the ATM have to put up an initial capital outlay to “stock” their machine with a certain amount of bitcoins available to be purchased? If so, then the owner of the machine must have seen an opportunity to cost to invest in the machine and put it on their property. They believed in the bitcoin system and so took that chance. They must also operate in both currencies in order for this to be a viable investment for them. 

However given that bitcoin is much more volatile than the USD, does that effect the value of their investment in a bitcoin ATM on their property? For example: (let’s assume my previous assumptions are correct)

The owner of a storefront buys a bitcoin ATM and stocks it with 100 bitcoins available to be withdrawn. At $20,000 USD a coin X 100 coins, it cost them $2,000,000 USD in the initial investment. Their initial business plan is to sell bitcoins at a 10% fee. Assuming the value remains steady, they eventually get back $2.2 million dollars in their machine which they take out and spend or save.

However if conversion value of the bitcoin crashes to $10,000 USD to bitcoin. Even selling bitcoins at a 10% markup, that means there machine will only fill back up with 1.1 million dollars. 

They have lost a significant amount on their investment. 

The owner of a classical ATM, does not lose money on their investment. They may not make much money if there is not a lot of business an thereby less fees, however they don’t lose money.

How is this accounted for in the network of bitcoin ATM operators and owners?",1607090172,3,1
k6laf6,moose702,New to the Game. Should I move my BTC off Coinbase?,"So I got convinced to buy into the BTC game a couple weeks back after regretting not getting into it earlier (like everyone here).  My buddy suggested Coinbase and so far its been easy to use and I've had zero problems linking my bank, buying coins, converting them, etc.

However, I'm seeing some Coinbase hate on here and now wondering if I made an unwise move and if I should keep my small amount (around $500) of BTC on there or move it elsewhere?  I plan to continue stacking sats and HODL'ing, just not sure if Coinbase is the best place to keep it.

I keep hearing about 'cold storage' which I'm assuming is one of those USB key devices and I've also heard about some 'better' exchanges such as Gemini.  Any suggestions or should I just stick with Coinbase?

Most responses address the ""not your keys, not your coins"" issue"", and that's totally valid.

However, some people just want exposure to the Bitcoin market, so they're not worrying about that aspect. So they go merrily over to RH and start buying BTC ""like a stock"" with the idea they are just going to treat it as such.

The problem with that is that Robinhood Crypto is actually a different company with it's own TOS that you have to sign before you start buying. Who reads a pages long TOS? Not many people. Check the box that you agree, move on. 

The devil is in the details. RH Crypto offers no (none, zero, nada, zilch) protections for crypto purchases. If they are hacked or go under, your money is gone. RH will tell you they're sorry, I'm sure, but they're not giving you any money back. And when you email, call, threaten, hire a lawyer, etc., they are going to show you the TOS you agreed to and tell you to move on.

Background: I'm a long term bitcoin hodler with potentially a big tax liability if/when I sell. I say potentially because I am currently UK resident, but if I sell after I leave the country I will probably not have any tax to pay (I will eventually be resident in a country with no capital gains tax). However, this may not happen for 10 years or more, and I may want to sell sooner in case of another bubble that I may consider unsustainable. So I'm looking at ways to hedge without actually selling, and futures could potentially be the solution. There are some exchanges that offer perpetual contracts (similar to CFD). I want to find one where I am comfortable with the counterparty risk and the cost of carry if the position is to be kept for years potentially, and also have no risk of liquidation no matter what the price is.

The last requirement requires the ability to use the actual bitcoins as collateral for the offsetting short position, which rules out BTC futures, spreadbetting and CFD contracts (the latter two would be ruled out by the cost of carry requirement anyway).

It seems to me that bitcoin exchanges are the way to go, and I am looking at Kraken and Deribit that seem to have perpetual contracts. I would like to know whether they can be used for what I'm after.

Say I have 10 BTC and the price goes to $100k and I want to sell them. I suppose I can deposit them at the exchange, have them available as collateral for the perpetual futures/swaps position and sell $1m worth of futures or perpetual swap at $100k with 1x leverage. My understanding is that this position will behave as synthetic dollars, and will never be liquidated, no matter what the BTC price is, is that correct assumption?

If yes, is there a carry cost for such a position? AFAIK in Bitmex it used to be that there was no cost other than the funding rate, which fluctuated of course, but on average it was positive for shorts. Which is consistent with the theory, as cash&amp;carry arbitrage would dictate that this should be the case, provided that USD rates are positive and cost of storage is higher for bitcoin. Is it a fair expectation to say that holding such a position long term would not be costly? (in USD terms that is, of course if BTC goes to $200k, then it will be worth only \~5 BTC)

If it is possible, is there a maximum time that such a position can be help open? Can I keep it for say 10 years? Besides the obvious issue of credit risk against the exchange and opportunity cost of capital of course, is there a technical or legal reason that this position can't be held open for that long?",1607072091,8,1

&amp;#x200B;

The way I understand it is that when you create a wallet you get a private key. That key is the thing that provides access to your bitcoin on the Blockchain. Stop me there if I'm already wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

And when you set up your hardware wallet, you create a 24 word phrase. If I understand correctly, as long as you have this phrase, you can always access your Bitcoin tied to it. You can even use any wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

So therefore, the recovery phrase must be tied to your Bitcoin somehow? How does that link happen? And how is that possible when the recovery phrase is created offline and stored offline? How does that phrase find my Bitcoin on the blockchain when the phrase is only stored on a piece of paper?",1607186558,3,1

k7alm7,peracar00,Small Family Perfume Business now accepting Bitcoin Via BTCPay Server," Hello everyone,

I talked with the moderator and they approved me posting here!

We are a family business running over 25 years, located in Serbia.

We mainly sell perfumes that are made in Serbia and they are inspired by popular scents. So far we have 3 retail stores in our city and a few franchises in other cities.

They are branded as ""Chez Pierre"" which is our company name.

Our main goal is to deliver high-quality fragrances for the lowest price possible!

We recently decided to accept **Bitcoin** as a payment method on our website.

The big reason for that is that PayPal sucks ass.

When you are leaving in a country that's not in the European Union, you have limited service of choosing payment methods and if you want to sell it worldwide well PayPal is your only option.

PayPal often time limits your payments, has a reversal hold on every transaction, asks a lot of documentation (which is fine) but their customer support never answers if something is out of a script and oftentimes you cannot even communicate with them. Last 12 months we had twice the money frozen without an explanation and it was really hard to talk with them.

Let's not start talking about their fees, they cannot compare to Bitcoin.

Overall it might be easier for the buyer to make a PayPal account and just purchase, but from the seller side, it's really a nightmare. Everyone is trying to avoid them and there is a reason why.

That's why we decided to encourage people to use Bitcoin and we are offering 10% off using code **SALE10** for Bitcoin purchases!

If you are a small business owner start accepting Bitcoin now, it's not that hard to set up and it's very easy to use.

Our website is: [https://shop.chezpierre.rs/](https://shop.chezpierre.rs/)

I got a high free warning message as the default fees were 3000% (hard pass ha) then I changed the fee type to static and moved the slider all the way left and the lowest i could get the fees was 125% (so like $150 just to move $130 to a friend).

k79x47,burnerboy1234,Crypto tax in the UK,"Crypto Tax in the UK

In light of the potential bull run that could result in a lot of people making considerable capital gains, I was curious as to how capital gains tax could be applied. 

My understanding is that the capital gain is realised once you sell an asset you bought (sale price - purchase price = capital gain). In the UK this is taxed at a 20% rate. With crypto assets where all ledgers are effectively anonymous, how can the tax authority (HMRC) work out how much tax you have personally realised? My thinking is that transactions between crypto assets (bitcoin to eth) can’t be tracked and therefore how can a capital gain be worked out from this (do you have to denominate every transaction into a base currency and work out capital gains from there).

Also if you use multiple exchanges and store funds on there then how can the realised gains be taxed ?",1607184010,16,1

k78lqr,ChemicalOlive63,If you can't fight them join them --- Speculation about big shift in US Government BTC stance,"TLDR...

* The US is scared of Bitcoin. Instead of banning Bitcoin, the best way to remove the threat of Bitcoin is custodying as much as possible within US borders while it's still cheap --- essentially making it within the control of the US government without them actually needing to buy it on their balance sheet and scaring citizens. 
* US remains a dominant force (most gold reserves, most BTC held within it's borders and largely within institutions they can control and still the worlds reserve currency). 

In the light of the following:

* Brian Armstrong's Twitter post @ Mnuchin potentially regulating self-hosted wallets and 
* Brian Brooks comments ""nobody's banning bitcoin"" .... ""the banks HAVE TO connect to the blockchain""
* Blackrocks pro-BTC take and increasing amount of companies adding BTC to their balance sheets and new US BTC funds coming out all over the place. 

It seems to make sense to me we are seeing a massive shift in how BTC is viewed by authorities in the United States - I think many of us know this. Bitcoin is still likely perceived as a threat, but I imagine in a Sun Tzu type of way... keep your friends close and your enemies closer, I think a very pro-bitcoin policies and stance could be coming to the US soon. I don't think this means they are publicly going to suggest people own Bitcoin or buy any themselves, they will let the market do the bidding for them. By letting big institutions custody BTC, they will be able to tax and regulate financial flows much easier. Ultimately, the gov will be the drivers seat no matter what happens with USD, Gold or BTC without taking any strong stance any which way.

If true.. smart, very smart by US government",1607179298,44,5

[u/coinbasesupport](https://www.reddit.com/u/coinbasesupport/) [/u/Coinbase-Olga](https://www.reddit.com/u/Coinbase-Olga/)/ [u/coinbase\_kyle](https://www.reddit.com/u/coinbase_kyle/) [u/coinbase\_dan](https://www.reddit.com/u/coinbase_dan/) [u/justin\_coinbase](https://www.reddit.com/u/justin_coinbase/) [u/coinbase\_cindy](https://www.reddit.com/u/coinbase_cindy/)

First of all, apologies for yet another thread about a Coinbase account being restricted.  However, the reason i feel i have to post is that I have read through a lot of other threads on here and have still not found the answer on how to contact Coinbase support, find out why my account has been restricted and how it can be solved.  Hopefully we can find a nice straightforward solution here quickly and i can post it up with updates.

What i have learnt as a relative newbie is not to store your coins with any exchange and to secure my own hardware wallet. I have now done this and look forward to moving my coin across from Coinbase.

So without warning or any notice email,  my account was restricted. I can´t use my funds. There wasn't any reason to do it that I am aware of. I have a fully verified account.  My verified bank account no longer works but my linked PayPal account does work for withdrawl. After contacting support i have had no response, my account is still restricted and I've not got any answer or response to my case.

To put it mildly I am rather shocked at how an account like this can be restricted from access with no heads up, no explanation, and no notice of what procedure to follow!  Unbelievable to be honest.

Any advice and help gratefully received.

k8fuia,Immediate-Host,Lightning Network stats overview,"Despite the active development that is going on in the space, fundamental stats like:

**Number of Nodes**: 15,025

It's the total number of funded nodes that have ever been added to the network, including nodes running over TOR. Of course the amount of active nodes is a little bit lower than that, but is increasing steadily.

&amp;#x200B;

**Number of channels**: 35,913

Channels are payment connections between nodes used to route funds from A to B. A  High number aren't necessarily superior though because the more (small) channels there are, the longer path finding takes to find a fitting route to the destination.

Multi Path Payments payments (for anyone curious: [https://wiki.ion.radar.tech/tech/research/atomic-multi-path-payments](https://wiki.ion.radar.tech/tech/research/atomic-multi-path-payments)) are improving this situation just as well as the value of 1 Satoshi increasing, because smaller capacity channels get more valuable and useful.

So looking really solid as well in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lightning Network Capacity:**

Is the total amount of Bitcoin captured inside payment channels. As of the time writing it is 1073 Bitcoin, the number is steadily increasing over time as well and reflects confidence in the network because more and more people feel confident putting funds in channels as lightning matures.

&amp;#x200B;

All stats can be found and tracked on [1ml.com](https://1ml.com) 

Despite merchant and exchange adoption, I think these are some stats to check over time to get an idea of the health and progress of the lightning network, which are looking really promising.

I see a bright future ahead.",1607344497,11,1

k8db3t,finalremedy,"My BTC was stolen, sharing my thoughts","I think this is my first post here. Long time lurker, but a shame it had be this kind of post.

Welp, that's it folks. All the BTC I had to to my name has been stolen on 11/13.

After checking my wallet a couple of days ago, I noticed an unfamiliar transaction that sent my remaining Bitcoins to some address on 11/13.

Not sure if it's a good idea to post the transaction ID, but I suppose I could if it sheds light on anything.

After I saw this, a rush of emotions came over me - despair, hopelessness, I had a pit in my stomach that was so dense, I nearly wanted to throw up. I could barely eat or sleep the day after. Even though it's been a few days now, those feelings are still very strong and I feel they probably will be for a long time. I keep waking up and checking the wallet hoping it's some sort of mistake, but it's real unfortunately.

It took a while for me to process through the situation just enough to put some thoughts together for this post, but I guess the point of this post is two fold:

1. It's a bit cathartic for me to be able to get some thoughts out
2. I hope that other people learn from my mistake - coin holders need to take security seriously. Be patient, learn about security of your coins, and enact what you learn. Be diligent. Convenience is an enemy of security.

The coins I had were originally mined back some time in 2013 if I remember correctly.

I really had no idea what I was doing at the time, but a friend turned me on to mining and I figured why not, may as well put my GPUs to use for something else while I wasn't gaming. When he first told me about mining, I thought hmm - I bet all this computing power is going to something like helping the government crack into things, but after some light reading on Bitcoin - it stood out to me as something special, so I decided to do some research, joined a pool and started mining some coins not long after.

Over the years, I sort of forgot about them and they stayed within my Bitcoin core wallet what I had used originally when mining, but three to four years ago my interest in the technology renewed and I really started reading more into the details of the technology and talking about it with coworkers.

However, after some time I noticed that the Bitcoin core client was becoming quite cumbersome having to store all of the blockchain data and I had moved on to laptops with less storage available than my old desktop and so I started looking at some of the more modern wallets and landed on Electrum.

I started using Electrum and it seemed to do the job well for what a wallets was designed for. I guess it's my mistake for not keeping up with the real (security related) news surrounding Bitcoin and wallets and various hacks and scams. My memory is a bit fuzzy, but I'm pretty sure I fell victim to a phishing attack vector within the Electrum wallet and possibly was led to download an update from a location other than the main site (github releases section seems to be faintly a thing that I remember). It was either this, or maybe my system was compromised some other way - either way it's a painful lesson in how not keep your coins secure. I really should have just put my coins into cold/offline storage.

It's a real shame, I was really proud of owning these coins having mined them originally myself and I was hoping one day that I could split them between my two sons when they were old enough to understand and appreciate the technology in 18-20 years and who knows how widespread the technology and understanding will be by then. I feel like I failed them.

I'm not really sure where to go from here, still trying to work through that. I've definitely been reading up more on security and how to make sure that something like this doesn't happen again should I find my way back into crypto. I wish I would have taken security more seriously up front, it ended up being a very costly mistake not doing so.

I don't have nearly the disposable income to get back what I have lost. At the current price, it'd take years upon years, and it's highly unlikely that the price will retreat significantly. However, I truly still do believe in the technology, I just find it a bit sad that the main way to participate now is to convert USD to BTC - I wish mining was still a thing for the average person.

Stay diligent and vigilant people, don't become lax like me. Read up on methodologies and practices for keeping your coins secure. Be patient and take the time to make sure things are done right.

If this post helps even one person to take their coins more seriously and read up on better security, then I suppose it would be worth it getting these thoughts out. I wouldn't wish the feelings that I've experienced over the past couple of days on anyone, they are truly feelings of despair and regret.",1607332272,569,1

k8d4vj,facepalm5000,"""Capital gains"" + unit of account debasement attack","Round numbers used to simplify calculation

You buy 1 btc at $20K.

Scenario A: Price doubles to $40K. you sell the 1 btc for $40K, with $20K ""capital gains"". you pay a 20% tax on the $20K ""capital gains"". $20K \* 20% = $4K. $4K @ $40K/btc =  0.1 btc. 1 btc - .1 btc = .9 btc. So you bought 1 btc, and ended up with .9 btc. A 10% loss of sats.

Scenario B: Price goes up by 10x to $200K. You sell all 1 btc for $200K, with $180K ""capital gains"". you pay a 20% tax on the $180K ""capital gains"". $180K \* 20% = $36K. $36K @ $200K/btc = 0.18 btc. 1 btc - .18 btc = .82 btc. So you bought 1 btc, and ended up with .82 btc. An 18% loss of sats. Almost twice the loss of Scenario A.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now consider, hypothetically, that in both scenarios, the only thing that changed was how strongly fiat was devalued while you were holding the btc. In Scenario A, the fiat was debased to half its original value. In Scenario B, fiat was debased to 1/10th its original value.

The purchasing power of the btc did not increase in either of these scenarios. But because the cost basis and sale price were denominated in a debaseable fiat currency, a larger percentage of your sats were expropriated (18% vs 10%) simply because fiat lost more of its value while you were holding the btc. You never gained any purchasing power or asset value, you merely kept your purchasing power constant, and actually had a net loss after capital gains taxes were paid.

So even though the btc was not itself debaseable, the usage of a debaseable unit of account for tracking cost basis and capital gains enabled more of your purchasing power to be expropriated by the entity who was able to unilaterally debase the unit of account being used to compute capital gains ($).

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fact that the cost basis of assets are not adjusted up for inflation (debasement) when computing capital gains is a large hidden tax. A scam, if you will.",1607331372,4,1

Is there a way, mempool never gets free again? and the network never confirms my transaction therefore the BTC is lost in the oblvion? 

there’s no way of cancelling unconfirmed transaction so one can correct (upwards) the fees? at least not in the bluewallet app.

i’m asking because we head into mass adoption, i know there’s lightning as a solution. but once everyone is using BTC the fees will become bigger, not letting the bottom set fees of the network to clear (ever?)

He said he was from the netherlands and was studying there and was about to graduate. In november he said he moved to china to pursue a project and i believed him. When he reached china he said that to avoid transaction costs and overseas fees cost he had converted all his savings to bitcoin. But because he was in china and due to some restrictions and regulations he wasn't able to withdraw his funds so he asked me for help and i agreed. He said that he wasn't able to withdraw his funds to any external wallet but he could withdraw funds to the internal addresses of that exchange (coinelux). So he asked me to create a wallet with that exchange and i did. Then he sent his bitcoin(which weren't real) to my account. But to withdraw those funds a KYC was required and to do the KYC the exchange said to deposit 0.025 bitcoin which I unfortunately did. As soon as those funds entered the coinelux exchange he seized all communication. It turned out he was the member of the scam exchange.

k93boc,Nemon2,Why I think Bitcoin price will go only up from here....,"Ok, this is super subjective info, but we seen price going up to 19.800 and sometimes fast drop to 18.000-ish and then go back up.  


In my talks in last few weeks, some companies in EU (smaller / mid size) are starting to buy bitcoin as long term strategy plan. Some will buy only few (anywhere from 1 to 20 bitcoins) while some mid size companies are buying anywhere between (20-100 bitcoins).  


In my opinion what is happening is that private citizens are selling, since a lot of people are afraid / worried for another $20k level crash like in 2017-ish - while all this companies are first time buying, and they dont have emotions or trauma (to use that term) from 2017 or any other period of time.  


Selling BTC at $18-20k is like selling TESLA stock at $400-500 (Today value pre-split of Tesla stock price is around $3000). For anyone who owned Tesla stock price for years, $400-500 is MONSTER high price and they are afraid of the crash, while anyone who is just now starting to buy - $400-500 is good price as any!  


I think a lot of people dont understand how little bitcoins are really left. At some point I expect price to go rocket high and only then FOMO will kick in.

Bitcoin is like clockwork. It’s the most elegantly designed piece of software this world has ever witnessed. The price graph, once you zoom out and look at it as a whole, looks like something algorithmically generated, with perfectly timed market cycles. It’s beyond mere elegance. It’s magic.

The more I think of it, the more I wonder how Satoshi Nakamoto could’ve had such vision and foresight. A truly enlightened human being(s). Genius beyond comprehension. 

The fact that it’s an unknown entity, and that his name literally translates to “Central Intelligence”, really made me entertain the possibility that we’re dealing with something that’s beyond conventional lines of reasoning. 

There’s a part of me that likes to entertain this ridiculous conspiracy idea, that it was designed by a group of very enlightened individuals, who are trying to steer society in a certain direction. A group of individuals that knew exactly what they were doing.

About me: I recently (last 3-5 months) started learning about Bitcoin. I bought my first piece of Bitcoin on November 18, 2020 (0.189503 BTC.) But when I talked about me buying Bitcoin with my family, I had a tough time explaining what Bitcoin is. 

The thing is, all Bitcoin videos/articles contain so much jargon it's a hard time to follow for beginners like me. Therefore, I created this video with easy to understand language and no jargon. Hopefully, the message is right, though. Would love to hear your thoughts.

ka50xh,blackswann1111,"""Black Swann"" predicts Currency War in 2021: Bitcoin, Yuan, US Dollar","***Rare Chart Reveals Epic Bitcoin Showdown with China Renminbi (yuan) and the U.S. Dollar.***

Matthew Swann known as the ""The Black Swann"" of [Astrostyle.com](https://Astrostyle.com) has discovered a stunning chart that forecasts intense conflict for the future of money.

In October 2019, months before the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Swann predicted (and published October 31) that January 2020 would bring **""a black swan event""** that would disrupt the world economy.

This prediction appeared in *The AstroTwins' 2020 Horoscope,* an internationally renowned annual astrology guide. In the book's 2021 edition, Mr. Swann makes even more provocative predictions. His chapter, ""The Aquarian Technocalypse"" (a portmanteau that pairs ""technology"" and ""apocalypse"") spells out the massive disruptions to the global economy from the arrival of digital money, foreshadowed by the new decade's planetary alignments.

[The Cardinal Cross of Ixion by Matthew Swann for Astrostyle](https://preview.redd.it/8iifc6sfz8461.jpg?width=1100&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8814b066c161cd70d0963360216213c64660505d)

Most notably: This horoscope contains a rare configuration called a ""Grand Cross"" appears when the founding dates of Bitcoin, the USA, the US Dollar and China/the Yuan are placed on an astrological chart:

* 13° Sun Cancer: Founding of The United States of America (7/4/1776) 
* 13° Sun Aries: Creation of U.S. Dollar (4/2/1792) 
* 13° Sun Capricorn: Minting of Bitcoin's genesis block (1/3/2009) 
* 13° Mercury, 14° Neptune, 7° Sun conjunction in Libra: Founding of The People's Republic of China &amp; Renminbi (Yuan) (10/1/1949)

In astrology, the Grand Cross is a harbinger of massive cyclical change and turning points, from war to geopolitical upheaval. 

""Bitcoin is the next stage in the evolution of money,"" says Mr. Swann, ""proving that money is a technology—and technology always disrupts.""

As Bitcoin skyrockets to the $20K threshold and beyond, Mr. Swann predicts that it will disrupt the world's fiat currencies in the following ways—as detailed in his post at [https://astrostyle.com/mswann](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3005139-1&amp;h=3286329189&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fastrostyle.com%2Fmswann&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fastrostyle.com%2Fmswann):

* Bitcoin will eventually hit ten million Yuan in price (CNY 10,000,000.00). 
* The next global revolution for individual rights will be the attempt to emancipate money from the state. 
* The American Revolution 2.0 will officially begin in early 2022, as major planets return to key positions they occupied at the founding of the United States of America in 1776. 
* The year 2022 will accelerate the eventual adoption of cryptocurrency into the core of the emerging digital currency financial system. 
* As the old economic guard wrestles with the unstoppable crypto-upstarts, social protest and unrest will likely erupt among fragile economies. The monetary reins of power are now visible again, appearing last during a similar astrological cycle in 1944 during the formation of Bretton Woods. 
* China will unveil the digital Yuan in February 2022 for global distribution. 
* The widespread adoption of the digital Yuan will coincide with the February 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, Chinese New Year and the historic ""Pluto return"" of America on 2/22/22 in the USA's horoscope (July 4, 1776, 5:10pm).

I think that it does a good job of explaining (or as good as anyone else) the repeating patterns we've seen in BTC/USD around the halvings and so far Bitcoin has continued to follow the predicted pattern. Plan B suggests the next major bull run hitting ~$288k before 2024, likely late 2021/early 2022.

The interesting paradox is that widespread knowledge of and belief in the S2F model could itself affect the price trajectory enough to invalidate the model.

Eric Wall actually bet $1 million that S2F would be proven incorrect by 2025, but he doesn't seem to offer any real concrete arguments. **If** S2F is correct, his BTC value would cover the original bet anyway.

I know that general consensus is that no one can predict the future of BTC, and for the most part I agree. However, I think Plan B makes one of the more compelling arguments.

So why do you (or someone else) think he's wrong?",1607558977,81,1

Once the government deems appropriate; once technology advances; once the ""bugs"" are all out; or once more of the technocratic future comes to fruition, government(s) will come out with its/their own digital currency.

Bitcoin might retain value among collectors as the ancestor of digital currency (if the blockchain is still running). Any decent alt coin (basically just Eth and ones that actually innovate) will become antiquated technology or evolve into something greater for whatever usecase is required of them.

So it could serve as a diversifier to gold and other such storehold of wealth assets. The main thing is to have some of these type of assets (with limited supply, that are mobile, and that are storeholds of wealth), including stocks, in one's portfolio and to diversify among them. Not enough people do that. As far bitcoin relative to gold, I have a strong preference for holding those things which central banks are going to want to hold and exchange value in when they are trying to transact.

k9dlyv,testiclespectacles2,My case for Bitcoin,"Bitcoin represents the best opportunity of growing wealth today. Hard money always wins. Bitcoin is already the hardest money (to create more of), and it will double its hardness every 4 years until year 2140 when Bitcoin will be literally infinitely hard after the last Satoshi is mined. Bitcoin is programmed to have an infinite stock to flow ratio in the future. Every other store of value will be abandoned starting with the weakest and going into the strongest. 

Almost nobody uses Bitcoin yet. As the number of users doubles, the price goes up by 10X. A little growth goes a long way. Bitcoin is still used by less than 1% of all humans. That means at our 0.5% current usage, the user base can double 7.5 more times, then grow at the rate of increase of global population. 

User base doubling multiplies the price by 10. So at today's price of $19,000 and 0.5% adoption, you just add 7 zeros and multiply by 5. That's $950 Billion per BTC. 

I think Bitcoin has already proved that it is the best performing asset of all time. There is no chance that this will change. 

This is why Bitcoin Hodlers are extremely zealous in their belief of Bitcoin. Hyperbitcoinization is inevitable. So there's no reason to hold wealth in any other form. 

Bitcoin will continue its average of 10x every 2 years at best and at worst a reliable minimum of 10X every 4 years. Nothing will ever beat Bitcoin. All other forms of wealth are obsolete. 

Bitcoin's growth night slow, but it also might accelerate. I think it's going to accelerate quite substantially especially because of the recent mining halving in May and the extra 35% dollar supply increase in 2020.

Eventually 0.01 BTC will be enough to retire on.",1607463350,17,1

k9dflf,Delicious_Context_53,Understanding the BDoS Attack,"I saw some researchers posted a paper describing a blockchain denial of service attack. The attack involves an agent whose incentives do not correlate to block rewards (governments, competing coins, btc shorts). The attacker mines until she wins a block and publishes a proof of success via a block header, but withholds the block content. Thus the other miners can either wait for the content, or attempt to remine the block. Once a competing block is published, the attacker releases the content and initiates a fork. Miners then must choose between competing forks to mine. Given the uncertainty, the researchers argue, the miners are rational if they wait. Thus the blockchain ceases progress.

It applies only to nakamoto consensus proof of work.

It requires an estimated 21% of the total mining power.

The attacker announces her intentions and publishes the header (or other proof) somewhere. Rational miners will monitor for this if it’s announced, because it will affect their profitability.

One mitigation is to find a way to identify the attacker’s block and unanimously choose the other block in the fork.

k9bx6d,sliko45,Explaining present and future volatility of Bitcoin,"Good explanation from 
Saifedean Ammous. 2018. The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking (1st. ed.). Wiley Publishing.

Bitcoin's volatility derives from the fact that its supply is utterly inflexible and not responsive to demand changes, because it is programmed to grow at a predetermined rate. For any regular commodity, the variation in demand will affect the production decisions of producers of the commodity: an increase in demand causes them to increase their production, moderating the rise in the price and allowing them to increase their profitability, while a decrease in demand would cause producers to decrease their supply and allow them to minimize losses. 

A similar situation exists with national currencies, where central banks are expected to maintain relative stability in the purchasing power of their currencies by setting the parameters of their monetary policy to counteract market fluctuations. With a supply schedule utterly irresponsive to demand, and no central bank to manage the supply, there will likely be volatility, particularly at the early stages when demand varies very erratically from day to day, and the financial markets that deal with Bitcoin are still infant.

But as the size of the market grows, along with the sophistication and the depth of the financial institutions dealing with Bitcoin, this volatility will likely decline. With a larger and more liquid market, the daily variations in demand are likely to become relatively smaller, allowing market makers to profit from hedging price variations and smoothing the price. This will only be achieved if and when a large number of market participants hold bitcoins with the intent of holding onto them for the long term, raising the market value of the supply of bitcoins significantly and making a large liquid market possible with only a fraction of the supply. 

Should the network reach a stable size at any point, the flow of funds in and out of it would be relatively equal and the price of bitcoin can stabilize. In such a case, Bitcoin would gain more stability while also having enough liquidity to not move significantly with daily market transactions. But as long as Bitcoin continues to grow in adoption, its appreciation attracts more adopters to it, leading to further appreciation, making this drop in volatility further away. As long as Bitcoin is growing, its token price will behave like that of a stock of a startup achieving very fast growth.

Should Bitcoin's growth stop and stabilize, it would stop attracting high-risk investment flows, and become just a normal monetary asset expected to appreciate slightly every year.",1607458208,1,1

kaisrp,kanav-wazirxwarrior,What are the Main Economic Drivers Behind Bitcoin’s Success in 2020 ?,"What are the Main Economic Drivers Behind Bitcoin’s Success in 2020?


1) Impact of central banks’ policies on the       performance of Bitcoin

One of the most important indicators of the state of the economy are monetary policies put in effect by central banks around the world. Like almost every other asset, Bitcoin does best in times of balance sheet expansions, a time when central banks increase liquidity mostly by issuing new money. This effect can be easily observed on the Bitcoin price chart for the past seven years.

2)Bitcoin is a risk-on asset

Stocks and other potentially high-yielding financial instruments are a form of the so-called risk-on assets. Investors gravitate towards risk-on assets in times of positive market sentiment. On the other hand, low-yielding risk-off assets, such as gold, established reserve currencies, and virtually risk-free government bonds are bought in times of economic uncertainty. 

Bitcoin seems to enjoy easy monetary conditions and is thus perceived as a risk-on asset. Given the current economic climate, it is unsurprising that Bitcoin is doing well

3)Bitcoin’s correlation with global equities and risky assets
Bitcoin has a strong relationship with the prices of global equities. Hence rising with them .

https://i.redd.it/5eqjkpiudd461.gif

With bitcoin at least, it seems to me as though we're never really *not* talking about price.

Yesterday, I listened to a podcast ([https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-theses-2020-ryan-selkis](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-theses-2020-ryan-selkis)) and the person being interviewed made this point, paraphrased by me:

&gt;Bitcoin is an asset that uses a novel platform to move around.  
Ethereum is a platform that uses an asset.

Let's assume that's correct. With regards to price-talk, and with bitcoin being mainly an asset, this means the price *is* the point! Maybe more accurately, the *value* is the point. Yet still, don't we currently measure value with a price tag?

Some might say, ""Bitcoin is about freeing people from the clutches of power over them."" Agreed. Yet it must be of value, else it would be impotent in trying to do that. The price matters.

Some might say, ""It's about the technology."" Okay, but I tend to agree that it's an asset first, moved around by a very clever technology. There are lots of other technologies today that can do the same thing. People get much more excited about bitcoin price talk than a hot new pull request on GitHub.

It does get to be a bit exhausting at times, but price talk isn't necessarily a bad thing. Price talk is bitcoin talk too.",1607610497,4,1

Now debating returning it yet again due to all this controversy. However logically thinking about it, and from what I've researched, I think ledger is secure enough. If you are actively aware of phishing scams, never click any email link, never input your 24 word weed into ANYTHING other than paper, and the ledger usb device itself, then you should be safe, right? 

Well I guess one last factor comes into play here. And it's how much trust to give ledger. And that they won't exit scam. And that they won't for example, give the French government all our info under the table so they can spy on us. 

Anyhow, my main question is, if I'm actively security concious, especially of phishing attacks, physical attacks, etc. I should be fine with a ledger back up pack, right?",1607604046,27,1

[Excerpt from an article in 'The Daily Telegraph', a British newspaper](https://preview.redd.it/wr8wqvwcdc461.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19fd048054c0722958bb91e55ca5c432bb8626e6)

&gt;'he expected a ""supply-side shock"" because more people buying Bitcoin encouraged ""miners"" to create more.'

Oh dear oh dear!! This economics professor definitely hasn't done his homework on the nature of the issuance of new Bitcoin. Last time I checked, Satoshi didn't write anything into the source code that suggested issuance of new coins could be determined by how 'encouraged' miners happened to feel at the time! 😂

Allow me to explain: this professor has made the erroneous assumption that the supply of Bitcoin behaves in much the same way the supply of a commodity does - that is, in a free market, when the demand for a commodity (e.g wheat) increases, the price level increases to reflect that increase in demand. Producers and prospective producers of wheat notice this increase in price, and, in order to profit, allocate more capital to the production of wheat, thus increasing its supply on the open market. This increase in supply drives the equilibrium of demand and supply down, bringing price level with it. In direct contrast, the Bitcoin supply **cannot** adjust to meet new demand; changes in demand can only be reflected by a change in price. Bitcoin is a special kind of good whose issuance is determined algorithmically and represented by a geometrically reducing supply curve. No amount of miner 'encouragement' will cause the rate at which this process takes place to increase. This is a mathematical truth, and is one of the most fundamental principles upon which mining is based. 

His corollary is that 'this will lead to a short term drop in price'. I won't indulge in speculation as to the accuracy of his short term price prediction, but I can assure him of one thing - if there is a drop in price, it definitely won't be due to how 'encouraged' miners feel to create more.

I have been aware and even interested in this ""idea"", perhaps even more appropriately, I should say, a potential paradigm shift of an idea since June 2010.  To me I have been watching a little too closely the moves of the market since I got in early November. It seems altogether a perfect storm for Bitcoin with debasement of pretty much all fiat currencies, in their race to the bottom, political unrest, general uncertainty just to name a few. To be honest I wasn't even entirely aware of what a CME Gap was until recently and I think it is perhaps unique to the crypto market? Please let me know if I'm wrong. Either way I was beginning to suspect market manipulation/price suppression as it seems painfully obvious there are many positive factors both long term and short term for this crypto specifically. I have begun to conclude that we sadly need to fill the entire CME gap  (\~17,000$) to keep moving in the upward fashion that we very clearly have the momentum for both short and long term. Does anyone have any thoughts on this, of why it looks so obvious that we want to go up, but simply keep failing otherwise? All opposing views or critiques are welcome. Thanks!",1607688632,5,1

kba48f,Caesars7Hills,What is a reasonable career move to get into blockchain?," 

I am a 31 year old Chemical Engineer, and I want to either pivot to energy storage, IE Form Energy or Highview, Car T cell therapy, or blockchain. I have worked in a regulated industry (infant formula) for seven years and want to pivot to something I am a little more passionate about.

My current position is very secure with my average Capex budget of $5.5MM. I have a 2 month old daughter and a secure low six figure salary in the upper Midwest. I don't really have any experience with programming outside of PLC/Ladder Logic. I am a decent project manager, but have grown up with basically the same key players for my experience and have very positive culture for projects. I am not sure if this is an easy environment to execute in. I have historically delivered strong project scopes, vertical start ups, and good budgets. I tend to be a bit reserved with my personality and have never really developed someone that would be moved to a People manager in or out of my current company. I will have a $35MM in 2022 that I will do the end to end work on starting with basic design in Feb 2021. I am confidant that if I stay, it will be successful and propel the plant into an extremely lucrative position. This year, I executed a $3.8MM end to end project with a 7 month timeline that resulted in a net net $35MM bottom line profit for a five year contract. I think I am in line for a raise in January. My position will be secure. There is also an option to relocate to Europe for a 3 to 5 year stint that would likely be fairly profitable and somewhat interesting from a lifestyle perspective. I would likely come back with a senior technical position and execute major capex for the site ongoing. The market will be soft in the years ahead because of Covid baby bust (go figure), but I am confident that the company will take market share and will continue to justify major investment for the next 7 to 10 years. There is also an export market for the premium products that will continue to grow in the America's. I can do nothing and maintain the status quo. My SO and I have ties to the area but would be willing to move, particularly to Europe or interesting Metro Areas. Her career is in social work and there is some flexibility in the US for careers, but if we are going to Europe, she would have interest as being the primary caregiver with our daughter. Also, my parents have a corn/soybean farm that I may want to operate if they had bad health outcomes, ect. So being able to get back to this area would also have benefits. Also, going back to the culture, I think I have been reluctant to move in the past because the management and operations team are relatively pleasant to work with. I am a little nervous about the outside roles and if I will walk into bad situations.

Blockchain is very interesting to me. This seems like the biggest departure from my current role. I am more passionate about crypto, but I really question if the working the industry will be fulfilling to me. If I make this jump, I think it offers the biggest upside for earnings. It seems like the market could also fade rapidly. I am pretty deep in the bitcoin rabbit hole and also own some Eth/Defi assets. This is truly a passion for me and likely be my catalyst to learn the appropriate computing languages. The path is the least clear. I could not guarantee a salary ect. Plus the whole industry could potentially collapse. However, I think that the industry could truly shock tradition investors with returns and some of the applications have the potential to displace SAP applications, ect.

I think that the cell therapy role would be more of an extension of my current role and would be interesting particularly on the process front. But I fear it would feel a little familiar. I am a little curious if the state of the industry would look down on my background or accept me into the pharma industry. The tech is interesting and the end user application is something that I can be passionate about. I think that this career would be relatively secure with the tech growing in application and the demand/salaries for pharma being strong relative to food and bev. Though I would argue that infant formula is somewhere in the middle. I am not sure how to enter this industry either.

I am also passionate about sustainable energy. I wish there was a way to work with my local utility to facilitate a transition plan. I am really interesting in grid scale energy storage. I know that Lithium Ion may just blow these techs out of the water, but I think that the Form Energy battery and the Liquid Air Energy Storage technologies will have a place on the grid. It would be so cool to implement this technology and be a part of solving one of the biggest issues of this generation. I also would note that this career path is also riskier from a security path, likely less risky than blockchain however. I think I should also get a Masters in EE if I go down this path. I wouldn't mind this.

If anyone has advice or insights into these four choices, including do nothing, I would appreciate the help. I would like to maximize earnings and I would like to do it via technical career paths vs managerial.",1607716947,10,1

kcd89n,No_Dependent2934,Bitcoin as a medium of exchange? Your thoughts?,"The definition of Medium of exchange is that the money is used as the exchange. 

At first, we used the barter system to trade a cow for an apple, for instance. 

The problem with this is that if you want an apple, you first need to find a person who has an apple and secondly also wants a cow.

It's far more easier if you have a widely accepted money product like the dollar to exchange for the product or service you want—an apple in this example.

In this example, you only need to find a person who has an apple because you can use the widely accepted money product to exchange it for the apple.

How does Bitcoin perform on a scale of 1 to 5 when we look at the characteristic Medium of exchange?

Well, I think at the moment, not that good.

I'll explain it.

The first problem with Bitcoin for using it as a medium of exchange is that it is far from widely accepted as a method of payment. 

I can't go to my local supermarket and pay with Bitcoin for my groceries. They just don't accept Bitcoin as a payment method. The same goes for every other store I know.   

And it isn't just the local supermarket that doesn't accept Bitcoin. Most stores offline and online do not accept Bitcoin. Some probably don't even know what it is, let alone accept it as a payment method.

The second problem with Bitcoin for using it as a medium of exchange is its volatility. 

For instance, in salaries, how can you agree upon your monthly salary if the value of Bitcoin continually changes? A few months ago, the price of 1 Bitcoin was close to 5,000 dollars. Now it's close to 20,000 dollars. This means you received an increase of 300% in your monthly salary if you would agree to get paid in Bitcoin instead of dollars. In this case, it probably wouldn't be a problem for you as an employee, but what if it is the other way around? Your monthly salary suddenly decreases by 300%. This simply isn't sustainable for both parties, the employee and the employer. 

I think you'll get the point, but I'll give one more example; let's say you run a retail store selling computer hardware. A basic sale price calculation goes as follows: the product's purchase price plus the store owner's margin will be the selling price.

The moment Bitcoin's value radically decreases, the store owner will make a significant loss because he doesn't have any margin left since the Bitcoin value drop.

So, will Bitcoin ever be a widely accepted form of payment? No one can say for sure.

The first that needs to happen is to cool down its volatility. To get to a point to cool down Bitcoin's volatility, Bitcoin needs to be in the hands of far more people than it is now. 

An article from November 18, 2020, says that 2% of accounts control 95% of all Bitcoin. - [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-18/bitcoin-whales-ownership-concentration-is-rising-during-rally](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-18/bitcoin-whales-ownership-concentration-is-rising-during-rally)

This is a problem because these so-called whales can create big price swings that prevent Bitcoin from being a widely accepted payment form.

The other thing that can be a problem in Bitcoin's transaction system is that you do not have buyer protection. 

Let's say I buy an item online by Bitcoin, and I won't receive the goods? Or what if the goods are damaged? How do I get my Bitcoin back? I don't think there isn't a good solution for this. The challenge is that Bitcoin doesn't have a middleman you can go to when there's a dispute between the buyer and seller like you have with Paypal, for instance.

All-in-all, I'll give Bitcoin a 1 out of 5-star rating for the characteristic Medium of exchange.

kcchdk,bertvanhouten,"Hyperinflation, portfolio allocation and measuring value","Pretty open problem, looking for some discussion and general ideas.

John cares about saving and investing his money so he has a clear plan on what to do with it.

As part of it, he decides to stick to a certain portfolio allocation. He holds USD, stocks, bonds, real state, and BTC. Specifically, he decides BTC to be 20% of his portfolio. All other assets have their target weight in his portfolio as well, and he both rebalances regularly when weights change too much and also turns DCA's part of his payslip into the different assets while aiming to keep them balanced.

Everything is nice and simple so far. When John wants to measure the weight of each asset in his portfolio, he converts all the different assets to USD and then does the math (XXX shares equal this much USD, YYY bonds equal this much USD, ZZZ BTC equal this much USD, sum total, divide each and he gets the weights).

Now let's bring in the scenario where the money printer goes wild and inflation starts to grow to the point where the USD becomes a rather poor unit of account. The kind of situation that might happen in some markets such as Venezuela or Argentina. Common products change their price in USD often, wages as well. The prices of other investment assets also fluctuate in way where market forces and inflation get blurred and it's not easy to tell what effect each component has in the USD price.

In such an environment, how could John measure the value of each of his assets to plan rebalancing and keep his portfolio as he planned it? 

My first thought is that this is something that could have been done with gold in the past, and maybe now the right solution is to convert everything to BTC and use it as the ""central"" unit of account. But then, BTC's is rather volatile, so I feel like it might be not the best idea. Also, getting shares-BTC and bond-BTC exchange rates is not possible nowadays without using USD in between as far as I know.

What do you think is John's best option? Measure every asset in terms of BigMac menu's? ([Wikipedia BigMac Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac_Index), [The Economist Burgernomics](https://www.economist.com/news/2020/07/15/the-big-mac-index))",1607873457,6,1

kd1ksa,buttonstraddle,Avoiding/reducing capital gains taxes on the next crash,"Just an idea I had, if you plan on there being a crash, and trying to sell and rebuy BTC. I think this only makes sense if you are personally denominated in BTC and don't care about fiat USD anymore.

Suppose you purchased 1 BTC at $1k a few years back, and sell next year for $100k. Your gain is $99k and you owe long term capital gains on that, approx 20% = \~$20k, leaving you with $79k profit

However, instead you can hold your BTC, deposit some on exchange to cover your leverage margin, and then short a 1 BTC futures contract. Now you are perfectly hedged into USD, without incurring any capital gains tax. When you close your futures hedge, then you will owe taxes on that trade. 

So lets look at price movements in either direction and compare the 2 scenarios above.

Suppose BTC price drops to $60k. 

1.  In scenario 1, you paid $20k in taxes when you sold at $100k, were left with $79k. With BTC trading at $60k, you can now rebuy 1.3166 BTC

2.  In scenario 2, now you have a $40k profit from your futures short (100-60=40). At short term capital gains 40% \* $40k = $16k in taxes. After taxes, your $40k profit becomes $24k. With BTC trading at $60k, your $24k will buy you 0.4 BTC, leaving you with 1.4 BTC. More BTC than otherwise.

Suppose you're a bad trader, and $100k wasn't the top. Suppose BTC ran to $140k. What does your position look like now?

1.  In scenario 1, you sold spot at $100k, you owed the \~$20k taxes. BTC now trades at $140k and you're mad that you sold because now you have $79k to rebuy at higher price. You can now rebuy 0.564 BTC

2.  In scenario 2, now your $100k futures short position is now trading at $140k, so you have a LOSS of $40k. You owe no taxes on a trading loss. If you close your short hedge now, you owe the exchange your $40k loss. With BTC at $140k, your $40k loss = 0.286 BTC. You now have 0.714 BTC remaining of your original 1 BTC. So you paid no taxes, and because of that, you have more BTC.

Let me know if I've made any errors. Again, I only think this makes sense if you plan on holding BTC long term, and not going back into USD for good. I think this works because when you move your denomination into BTC, you are essentially deferring one tax event that you will never have to incur again. We can defer like that because now all we care about is increasing our BTC position, not our USD",1607965499,3,1

kdhwn2,Dannoinmo,We made an app to grow your Bitcoin by trading altcoins on auto-pilot.,"At Cindicator, we’ve been in crypto since 2016. We’ve gathered millions of forecasts in our app, tested dozens of trading strategies, and launched Cindicator Capital, a crypto quant hedge fund. It showed +129.7% last year. 

Many users wanted to join the hedge fund but obviously, most can’t invest the minimum $100k (anything lower doesn’t work due to costs of KYC, legal, etc). 

We wanted to create something that anybody could use: 

* Simple onboarding without worrying about private keys;
* A fully automated strategy;
* An upfront fee to remove the need for lockups or delays in withdrawals.

That’s how we’ve built [**Stoic**](https://cindicator.com/stoic) and launched it in September:

* Custody on Binance, your account connects via API;
* Automated long-only strategy; 
* Flat annual fee, add/withdraw funds at any time without notifying first. 

Stoic’s strategy is based on a long-observed correlation between BTC and altcoins: when BTC surges, altcoins first go down, then follow with a delay and then outperform in % terms. Most traders know this pattern but it’s fairly difficult to trade manually. There are lots of bots on the market, but we wanted to build something that requires zero tinkerings to start trading profitably — set it and forget it. 

Since this strategy went live in January, Stoic made +304% as of today.

If you’re on Binance, try connecting Stoic to see it for yourself. In the iOS/Android app, you can also check the current portfolio and how it changed over the past days.

Been learning about BTC and BTC cold storage vs holding on an exchange and was wondering how would a very wealthy individual or company manage their holdings compared to the average person actively buying BTC?

Would someone like Raoul Pal be using something as simple as a Ledger Nano X with a seed backup in a safety deposit box? Or is there another method more suited to managing large numbers of BTC on the blockchain? I imagine its many millions of dollars worth that could be under one wallet address.

I lost my first job because of the explosion and my second one because of lockdowns, banks won't allow us to withdraw our own money and our currency is worthless now due to a 380% inflation rate (1Lebanese Pound is now worth around 8,500USD)
In July I put all I had left in Bitcoin, and after the explosion in August, I started freelancing for Bitcoin jobs I found on some subs here and from my Instagram illustrations page.

**Store and Use Bitcoin--Wallets**

* Hardware: Trezor, Ledger\*
* Paper: bitcoinpaperwallet.com, walletgenerator.net
* Desktop: Electrum, Exodus

**Some tips on how to keep your Bitcoin Secure:** 

\#1 **Use Hardware/Paper Wallet:** Paper and Hardware Wallets are considered the safest solutions to store your bitcoin. Your private Keys stay offline so the chances of a hacker stealing your bitcoin are relatively low.

\#2 **Never Store your Bitcoin on Exchanges:** Most of the major Bitcoin hacks have always taken place at an exchange. Such platforms are always a high target for cybercriminals thus storing your bitcoin/crypto there is not a good idea.

Always withdraw your assets once the trade is made and store them in your personal wallet(s).

\#3 **Use separate wallets for daily use and savings:** It is always wise to keep your daily use bitcoin and savings in separate wallets.

If you are using bitcoin for daily transactions your wallet will spend a much higher time online, which increases its risk of getting hacked. Only keep a small amount in such wallets.

Keeping your extra bitcoin separate protects it at such events.

\#4 **Keep Backup:** If anything to your device or wallet, the only to recover your funds is through a backup so make sure you have one.

\#5 **Store your Private Keys/Wallet Seed Offline and** ***Never*** **Share them:** Make sure that your private keys are securely stored **offline.** This is the most secure way to protect your wallet from hackers.

The same goes for your Wallet Seed. Never store your wallet seed online, in case of a cyber-attack you risk exposing your seed to the hacker if they are stored online.

\#6 **Never click links or send your bitcoin to unsolicited schemes:** If the recent Twitter hack has taught us anything it's that we should never send bitcoin to 'quick-rich' or similar sensational schemes no matter the source.

Always verify the source and get more information before sending your bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

*\*Ledger wallets have recently been subject to multiple phishing attacks, please be careful with your wallet seed when using Ledger.*

Currently I purchase every morning at 7 AM (going to change that to weekly starting Friday) and I find myself hoping that the price stays down or drops so that I can purchase more sats with each investment.

I am also investing in my 401K at work and each pay I make a deposit.  Pretty much the same as with Bitcoin.  However when I look at my 401K I am hoping that the share price of the funds keeps going up, regardless of how much I would purchase.

keb5wi,gbitg,Idea for a zero trust inheritance scheme,"Let's say you want to pass your bitcoins to your relatives when you die (hopefully as late as possible). The only options I'm aware of is to build a multi-sig scheme with a third party (a trust for example) and tell them that if you die you want your coins to be moved to a specific address (your kids or relatives). So at any point in time while you are alive you or the trust can move coins. That requires a lot of trust.

I think there is a way to build an inheritance scheme without relying on a trusted third party.

Let's say user A wants to give all their bitcoins to user B when he/she dies. It uses timelock transactions and the dead man's switch protocol.

Here's how it would works:

\- user A creates a timelock transaction to user B, 1 year in the future

\- before the timelock transaction ""triggers"", user A invalidates it by creating another one, 1 year in the future. Cancelling a timelock transaction is doable, as described here: 

[https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/48021/can-you-undo-an-nlocktime-transaction-by-spending-a-single-utxo-of-it-before-l](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/48021/can-you-undo-an-nlocktime-transaction-by-spending-a-single-utxo-of-it-before-l)

[https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html)

\- user A keeps cancelling its own last timelock transaction, every year, by creating a new timelock transaction (to the same recipient user B).

\- while user A is alive, user A can enjoy his/her bitcoins.

\-- if user A sadly dies, all the bitcoins are eventually releases to user B (user B must wait on average 6 months before the coins are released).",1608132302,8,1

I’ve been bullish on Bitcoin for most of this year and have always loved the ethos of it. The only reason I’ve been holding off on buying is because of my personal finance situation but finally had some extra cash to throw in that I wasn’t using for Tesla stock or other bills. I have a really good long term investing mindset in terms of not trying to time the market (but aggressively investing when opportunities occur during dips) and investing in disruptive innovation and valuable technologies/systems like Bitcoin.

keb3tp,SpontaneousSquid,Withdraw from recovery stocks to go 50/50 btc/tesla?,"I am entertaining the idea of taking all of my investments and going 50/50 into BTC and tesla. This would mean cashing out profits made on recovery stocks (which I intended to hold for more than a year to obtain LTCG tax rate upton selling) which I purchased at between one quarter and one fifth of their prepandemic prices. 

I would expect those stocks to return to prepandemic values within two years. If it takes any longer than that, I would be better off day trading bitcoin with a small amount, around $500, at .5%-2% price fluctuations

Pros: I believe tesla and btc are both at the beginning of their exponential growth curves. As long as tesla does not dilute shares, and ventures into horizontalish industries (like insurance and solar panels as a service), and as long as bitcoin maintains it's integrity and adoption rates, I believe the gains will be incredible. 

Cons: selling recovery and small amounts of one or two other stocks, will subject those gains to regular tax rates. It could take 2 years for these companies to return to normal operations. It could take longer than that for consumer confidence to bring stock prices back to prepandemic levels. I am not as bullish on tsla as some people because I see a lot of very good competition from chinese EVs. But I can't argue with teslas performance or potential to diversify. 

Based on this info what would the bitcoin community do? I see a lot of numbers floating around this sub which I can't help but think are fantasy. What could we ACTUALLY expect the price of btc to be in December of 2022? 

Would you split 50/50 btc/tsla or would you remain diversified into recovery stocks?

keb2pi,adiabatic_storm,3 personal anecdotes; Reasons why big banks are destined to fail and be replaced by Bitcoin,"These are just personal anecdotes, but as they say *""Where there's smoke, there's fire.""*

Here I list three personal experiences dealing with large banks, which to me, are strong signals their current model of existence is broken (and in need of replacement by a better solution like Bitcoin).  


**1) Lack of security measures to protect checking accounts from being compromised**  
Called my Big 4 bank on the phone recently, and in the course of conversation asked them what security measures they have in place to stop someone from just taking the account/routing number off a personal check and setting up an ACH payment online (effectively stealing your account and money). No f\*ing joke, the customer service rep said ***""Trust.""***

Are you kidding me? Just yesterday I saw a post on the Nextdoor app of someone who had this exact thing happen to them after hiring a contractor to work on their home. Regardless if this bank has measures in place to return the money, there's no reason in 2020 (soon to be 2021) that it should be this easy for a thief to act. Same with credit cards if you think about it; [privacy.com](https://privacy.com) does a good job adding a degree of control, but it's mind boggling to me why we don't already have rolling / crypto-encoded account numbers for checking/savings account payments and CC transactions.

Remember, these are HUGE institutions with vast human and financial resources. The fact the \*entire industry\* has failed to innovate in this area is at best a sign of incompetence, and at worst a sign of complacency.  


**2) Total rigidity of process and inability to effectively serve customers**  
Was making two mobile deposits into my business checking account the other day from my Big 4 bank's mobile app. After depositing the first one, it asked if I wanted to deposit another so I went ahead and clicked Yes, then scanned the next check and clicked OK. Well, turns out it had defaulted back to my personal account (instead of staying on my business account) so it went into the wrong account. As the check had my business name and not my personal name, it will likely bounce -- and at that point, according to my bank, the only option is to physically go into a branch (not ideal right now given the pandemic) and redeposit the check.

So best case, I risk my life and get the check redeposited in a few weeks (or more) once the check bounces out of my personal case. Worst case, I may need to ask the issuing entity to cut a new check and wait even longer to get the funds. And as this is a relatively large entity, this could mean waiting months to access my funds.

And yeah, I did call customer service and ask if they could simply switch the deposit over from my personal account to business account -- or even just cancel out the original deposit (I called within minutes of this happening) so I could redo it into the other account. Of course, none of that was possible or within the realm of the bank's abilities.

Now admittedly, this is at least partly my fault because I could have, perhaps even should have, seen the account default back on the 2nd deposit. But the app's user experience is quite poor, because when you deposit a check into a specific account and it prompts you to deposit another, it's not intuitive that it would switch the account to something else.

In any case, even if this is completely my fault it shouldn't be so GD hard to fix. Luckily this isn't a huge amount (this time), but imagine if there are people out there who can't pay rent because their money gets tied up with this type of BS.

This rigidity of process is something nearly everyone hates, and is another reason why I believe big banks are destined to fail.  


**3) Lack of fundamental value**  
There are plenty of people who will probably argue with me here, but in my personal opinion banks are little more than a glorified and legal ponzi scheme. Peter deposits his paycheck, and the bank lends it out to Paul for say 8% interest. The bank gives Peter 0.1% interest and keeps the other 7.9% for itself.

Now surely banks have operating costs, risks they must take, etc. and all that has to be accounted for and priced in. Understood on all points. But the skew is still pretty ridiculous, and in a pure theoretical sense the banks are literally just making money off other people's money. And then as more people continue depositing, they continue the cycle. Hence I believe the banks are at best a middle man skimming off the top, and at worst ponzi scheme operators with a license to carry about as such.

But wait... don't the banks provide some value in return for taking your hard-earned money and lending it out to other people for profit? In the ""olden days"" they had big physical vaults that were difficult to attack, but these days most fiat money is virtual, and with respect to things like personal checks (a la my Point #1 above) it doesn't really seem like banks are doing very much to secure things. Their promises to return money if stolen, and things like FDIC insurance, certainly help to inspire a greater level of confidence for depositors. But there's still a serious question here of how much actual value the bank is providing, at least in relation to how big and powerful they are.

Ironically, perhaps one of the biggest value factors that banks do offer is, well, lending. Especially here in America, we can buy things we can't actually afford thanks to lending, and this alone seems like one of the bank's most redeeming qualities (and a strong reason why they will probably continue to survive for quite a while). 

But eventually the crypto community will figure out how to do lending better, and eventually we will also gain enough mainstream acceptance to overcome the banks'/fiat's incumbent advantage and gravity.

There are already entire nations with fiat currencies and economies crumbling, but who are being saved by Bitcoin. And as more of the mainstream institutions continue investing, accepting, and becoming a part of the community, it's only inevitable that Bitcoin (and probably many other cryptocurrencies) will become the new standard for storing, measuring, and exchanging value worldwide.  


**Conclusion**

I don't wish for big banks to fail, or for the people who work there to lose their jobs; but I do believe that if they were smart, they would get on board with the crypto movement in a bigger way sooner vs. later, embrace it fully, and become agents for its advancement. If they don't, I think they have more risk of losing relevance, power, and value than they realize (especially outside of America, but also here as well).",1608132001,2,1

Several days ago I made a post asking about strategies for accessing an old bitcoin-core wallet.dat safely. I was given some phenomenal guidance and I am happy to report after several days of  moderately stressful work for this old brain, I was able to regain access to the coins. I promised in the post that if I was successful I would come back and post the story of losing them and getting them back.

To tell it properly, I want to rewind a good number of years back, back to the dark beginnings of Bitcoin. I was one of the early adopters when the client first came out. I thought it was fascinating so I set up my sole desktop to do CPU mining. A few months later I had collected 400 bitcoins. (Easy to do when you are getting 50btc/success) I stopped then because tying up my only computer to mine was preventing my youngest child from using the computer for school. At the time they were worth less than nothing, so I burned the wallet file onto a cd-r and tossed it in a protective sleeve.

Fast forward to 2011, I was in a custody fight for my eldest child. The lawyer was the kind that wanted most of the money up front and I didn't have it. Right then Bitcoin was making one of it's first climbs and if memory serves was somewhere around 15ish USD/coin. Even though I knew that the coins were going to go WAY beyond that amount, selling the majority of them gave me just enough money to get the lawyer to take my case. I transferred my remaining coins to a new encrypted wallet. (the original had no encryption...) I played with getting back into mining but by the time I got to it people were already shifting from CPU mining to GPU mining rigs. I didn't have the money for one so I joined a pool and earned some small change.

In January of 2015 I had a series of disasters, the home that I was renting was declared unlivable. I had one month to clear out all my belongings and find living arrangements for my children. During that time I was fired from my job because I had to call off work so much. (Shitty grocery store job, but it paid the bills and kept a roof over my kids heads for long enough.) Lastly, the laptop with my bitcoin wallet on it's hard drive, died. Kaput. No worky, no more. Bitcoins were the furthest thing from my mind during the shitstorm around me. I packed the laptop in it's bag and tucked it in a closet at my parents house. When the dust finally settled I was homeless for over a year. (Just me btw, my kids were fine. I found places for them, just not me.) I slept at friends houses or on peoples couches, or I would camp if the weather was good.

I got a job and with that a place to live in the middle of 2016. I started slowly rebuilding my life. I'd see bitcoins in the news periodically as it climbed and climbed. I would think back to the coins on the dead laptop but I had no clue how to, or even if I could, get access to them. Fast forward a bit to 2020. My boss at the job I had was not respecting COVID, not masking and expecting me to come in to work 2 weeks after the initial shutdown. The job I do means I am in extreme close proximity to the clients, virtually face-to-face at times. I asked to go on unemployment but they refused, so I quit. I instead took on the task of clearing out my childhood home to prepare it for sale for my parents. I came upon the laptop while clearing out the closet I had stored it in, and decided to see if I could figure out how to get them. I had purchased a drive dock for my new laptop awhile back, so I set about seeing if I could get the wallet.dat file safely off the old drive.

I installed bitkey on a flash drive, booted into offline mode and set about figuring out how to get the dead drive to mount. (The laptop was an Arch Linux install that I had played with a bunch of ""cool shiny features"" like ReiserFS for the filesystems and other such things that were not particularly wise.) After about 3 hours of cursing and researching on my phone I was finally able to mount the drive and extract my wallet.dat file from it's smoking husk and onto a blank flash drive. It was during this research that I posted here on r/Bitcoin asking for advice. Thank you to all that joined in that post but huge props to u/Thanatos_1 for writing a most excellent breakdown of all the steps I would need to take to really protect it. I must have re-read that post at least 30 times over the past several days.

I set up a computer with a Linux distro and the bitcoin-core client and proceeded to hurry up and wait for the blockchain to fully sync. Took just over 2 days. I disabled networking and rebooted the computer, plugged in my flash drive, pointed bitcoin-core at the wallet file and told it to rescan. It took almost 8 hours for it to complete but in the end I was rewarded with seeing the balance, just a hair over 10BTC. I tested my passphrase just to make sure, then shut everything down and unplugged the computer completely.

Thanks again for all the help, folks! I had nearly burned through all my savings in the past several months and was not going to have money for Christmas. Now, I do and then some. I will finally be able to get started on building my dream home. To me, it truly is a Winter Solstice Miracle. THANK YOU!

**TL;DR: I went from being homeless 5 years ago and nearly destitute in 2020 to having a bit more than 10BTC in my pocket.**

kelhev,Pacifica150,Bitcoin is going to the moon again. And do you know the value of the moon this time or will you miss out again?,"It's very easy to get excited when Bitcoin goes to the moon.

The problem with 99.8% of people is their interest in Bitcoin only starts when the journey is already half way done, and even when they eventually start buying, they have no cash-out strategy in place, because they have no idea what the value of the moon actually is.

Well, if anyone's wondering, today's moon (99.5th percentile) is at $28,400. I wonder how many people have a sell order ready there? And tomorrow this number will be different because with such highly volatile investment assets as Bitcoin relative technical valuation changes on daily basis. I wonder how many people will adjust their moon landing sell order tomorrow, or at least once a week?

It's very easy to get excited about Bitcoin moon journeys, but excitement won't get you any cash. You need to have a strategy in place since the beginning of the journey and be prepared to place a few key orders here and there to get something meaningful out of the Bitcoin moon landing in the end.

In case anyone is interested, my [Bitcoin Intelligence](https://pacificaoutpost.com/bitcoin-intelligence/) dashboard, which identifies the optimal buy and sell times for Bitcoin, is now also available to public on my website as part of my state-of-the-art independent Investment Asset Valuation suite of dashboards covering all the very best crypto and stock investment assets in the world.

In simplest terms, the **thick green line on the RTV chart represents Moon**, and the thick red line represents Anti-Moon, so basically when the moon journeys usually start and when the people should actually be buying Bitcoin. I wonder how many people actually bought at the last Anti-Moon back in March...",1608163299,0,2

Won't the cost of bitcoin mean they will be more and more out of reach of people who would actually benefit from the technology?

The reason I compared bitcoin to collectable super cars is:

1. There are only a finite amount in existence.
2. As they age they are prohibitively expensive.
3. Like a collectable, as their value grows they are more and more likely to not be used. 
4. Due to #1, #2, and #3,  the only people who will benefit from them are people looking to benefit long term (hodl) and never really use them, like a person who owns a garage full of Ferraris and never drives them.  

As time goes on, I see it more and more likely the vast amount of bitcoin will trickle up to the super rich as they buy them as they become available.... 

I'll admit, if I had some, I would be less inclined to sell/spend what I had due to the fact , that $12 pizza someone bought 6 years ago with bitcoin is now worth thousands of dollars if they had held onto it....",1608162796,12,2

He suggested we throw a grand on it and have a ""red or black"" mentality. Back in college, we would go to the casino and immediately walk up to the roulette table and put all our money down. If we won, we took the winnings as our play money and would gamble with that. If we lost we were done and just hit the bar.

""Imagine if it went to $1...holy sh#t that would be insane."" ....

We didn't buy any. Yikes.

Honestly, I didn't understand it enough back then and didn't take the time to do my own research. If I did, I would have bought it.

It's fun to think back and see missed opportunities that would have created a drastically different outcome. Live and learn. If anything, it's really made me do my own research and digging when it comes to everything in life and business.

kg879o,FreyasCloak,My lucky Bitcoin story,"I’ll start by saying I’m a grandmother, or at least old enough to be one. In 2014, I had a couple of grand in the bank so I asked a grower friend how could I invest in the newly legalized cannabis industry. 

Ive never been much of a saver, more of an impulsive spender, and never made much money either. Retirement age was looming and I knew I’d blown it. I was one of the majority of Americans, facing the possibility of living on a tiny social security wage, or working into my seventies. I needed something that would bring the biggest yields possible. I needed a miracle.

My cannabis friend told me about Bitcoin. I spent my spare time over the next few days devouring every video, every article I could find (thank you Andreas Antonopoulos you are my hero).

I found someone in my county, went to my bank and wired him some money, and he sent me a small amount of Bitcoin. I did this again and again (dude I don’t remember your name, but I hope you didn’t get in too much trouble for operating a money changing business back in the day).

I watched my $210 Bitcoin jump to over $1000. I was glued to the price ticker, and I sold the 20 bitcoins I’d accumulated at $880. Oh how I wish I’d have HODL’d at that price!

I started buying again at 440, then at 560, then at 900, 1100, 2200, etc. I set up an automatic buy at Coinbase for $50/week for a good year or two. An unexpected breakup led me at stop that auto buy, but I later resumed it at $10 week. I still have my $10/week buy. I call it my “gambling money”.

Eventually I transferred my Bitcoin onto a hardware wallet, stamped out my keys onto a brass plate, and stashed them away in a safe. I keep a little bit on an exchange, and have cashed out drips and drabs to pay for my daughter’s college tuition and expenses.

I’ve paid taxes on the gains I’ve taken. 

This week for the first time it hit me. I’m not going to retire poor. I don’t have to worry. I don’t yet have enough for a full retirement, but there is no doubt in my mind that my little HODL’d stash will grow and grow. What a huge relief. 

I owe a lot to this sub. I’ve been subscribed since 2014, and I’ve learned a ton. A GIANT THANK YOU to all the contributors and the mods. You the real MVP’s!",1608386612,202,43
kg812i,E1ated,Why bitcoin matters,"Hi r/Bitcoin community! Been a member for a long time but never had a chance to reflect upon my motivation to use btc. 

To make a long story short, I have some sort of a side hustle with people from third world countries. It’s not easy to transact with them and my choice fell on Payoneer. They used to do their job well for over 6 years until September this year when they suddenly blocked $18k of my funds for no apparent reason. It’s been a long battle with their support but to no avail. I clearly explained them the nature of my business (nothing illegal, I assure you), but they kept asking for more and more details including my personal correspondence with customers. At one point, I got fed up with their silly requests, swallowed my loss and moved 100% of my business to bitcoin. Even though it’s still expensive to buy btc by my partners from third world countries, at least I am in full control of my funds and no shitty scammer like /rPayoneer can confiscate my hard earned money. 

I wrote this post for two reasons: 1) to warn you not to trust your money to third parties like Payoneer 2) to advise you not to be afraid to use crypto for peer to peer businesses. 

Stay safe and have a great day!

keskf3,ArTooDeeTooTattoo,“Should I get into BTC now??” Dollar. Cost. Averaging.,"If you are wondering if you should get into Bitcoin because you heard on the news that it’s been destroying its All Time Highs, please think about using DCA. 


Dollar Cost Averaging is the idea that a fixed amount, say $50 a paycheck, goes into BTC on a set schedule. Ideally, you should never make a transaction based on a dip. On average, over time, folks who use a DCA method make more money than folks who try to time their dips. You’re likely to hit both with DCA, but by taking emotion out of your purchase, you’ll avoid the FOMO purchases. 

Too many folks have been asking if they’re too late, should they put their life savings into BTC or take out loans. 

Put a portion of your earnings into BTC on a set schedule. Transfer to a hardware wallet on a regular schedule.  Set it and forget it.",1608188664,13,4

kesh1f,captainsidd,Explaining Bitcoin to Normies,"Happy ATH :) 

As we climb into uncharted territory, normies will start to flood in. 

Much of the content around Bitcoin starts with Bitcoin, and then tries to rationalize why it should exist. Unfortunately, most normies stop before they begin a piece like this, because they have some misconception in their head from when they heard about Bitcoin in 2017 / 2018. 

I wrote the site [https://whatismoney.info](https://whatismoney.info) to explain *why* we need Bitcoin by walking through the history of money and the mechanics of our modern monetary system. Once the house of cards is revealed, Bitcoin becomes an obvious possible solution. 

Your new orange pill. 

Start here with the ""[What is Money?](https://whatismoney.info/what-is-money/)"" explainer, or if you have someone curious about Bitcoin, send them ""[What is Bitcoin?](https://whatismoney.info/what-is-bitcoin/)""

kes8kc,CryptoMillennials,Assesment of USD - Relations with Digital Currencies/ Bitcoin,"DXY - Dollar Currency Index

Investors look at the DXY to determine, whether the complementary coin in an USD-pair, might strenghten or weaken in relation to the dollar. It shows the value of the USD compared to other fiat- or cryptocurrencies.

https://preview.redd.it/4204co3zyo561.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb1f9b059ca75802b40bbe9d83f42e6d64de630b

The technicals look rather bearish, the dollar struggles for support on the current level, and if this falling wedge is not breaking up, we might fall onto the lower levels.

At current day the price is ranging just slightly above the highest level of 2009.

Fundamentally an immidiate recovery seems rather unreasonable. The most important determinants are economical health, interest rates and inflation.

Gross domestic product (GDP)

&amp;#x200B;

[according to bea.gov](https://preview.redd.it/fhoff0v2zo561.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b28891e28d0517df785c0d4e3cb75361d2b6840b)

According to worldbank.org the GDP of 2019 was at 21.4 trillion dollar. It reflects Imports/Exports, PCE, Investments and governmental spendings.

PCE refers to Personal consumption expenditures, which basically mirrors the propensity to consume.

Projection of 2020 GDP and historical GDP (World Bank)

https://preview.redd.it/nofa1kq6zo561.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29963e4c0d8a9509f3c8527ae44b553abd49898a

Longterm Relations Federal Debt/ GDP

[according to cbo.gov](https://preview.redd.it/b9h1tcr9zo561.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16eadf70d6cc8addfaee2d457dd13e6e638ab881)

The national public debt is almost as high as 1945 relative to the GDP. Prognostics are officially published by governmental departments.

*We can only do a qualified guess grasping the estamation, but structural economical issues and longterm repercussion of the pandemic can support a likewise bias.*

*Us Department of the Treasury pretends to the provide official total numbers on public debt* [*here*](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Markets/Pages/national-debt.aspx)*, sadly none of the hyperlinks is working.*

We will break it down here to these determinants and conclude to deal with weakening economic performance, while public debt increases. Other determinants for economic health are employment rate, infractructure, distribution of wealth and commodities.

Federal funds rates

https://preview.redd.it/j2cei11nzo561.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e2986cf671c878e9d5573905d8bf6e21dc92d49

The base interest is low, in order to keep banks and economies liquid. However if the base interest is low and the inflation rate high, ít has a negative effect on pecuniary remedies in the longterm.

Inflation rates

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dlkqop1wzo561.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f9fabba4efdbd1b7ec2dfba61a3512312b4611

Inflation rate is low currently, although if we compare it to the interest rates, it can pose a concern. Furthermore the current fiscal politics can qualify to increase the inflation rate.

Consumer price index (CPI)

[according to bls.gov](https://preview.redd.it/wvkt92tzzo561.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f586ba4f93a4ecd0821846ef1ee61d58b5fdfda)

A more detailed view provides the CPI, it compares a broad measure of inflation relative to the cost of goods and services. It is used to asses price changes of individual cost of living. It rose by 1.2% since November 2019.

When rising up, consumers tend to spend less money for non-essential goods. Uncertainty and  insecurity during a crisis go alongside, and funds are less likely to recycle into economy.

Balance sheet of the Federal Reserve

[according to federalreserve.gov](https://preview.redd.it/07elp4d80p561.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f848fbde910e354c44a86ca44d481f4d3b6762f5)

The american government stocks of the supply USD in order to keep liquid, which ultimatly might lead to a devaluation of the currency.

Conclusive we acknowledge multiple threats to a strong US-Dollar. Aside that there are a couple variables to assesment, like evaluation of the final economical consequences, aswell as nature and pace of the recovery.

*Personally i think the vastly relevant restrains to most western economies, are originated in demographic structures, and the pandemic acts more as a catalysts, which might indicate structural problems lying beneath it.*

USD as the Reserve Currency

A large portion of global trading is handled in USD, hence there are many countries holding dollar for liquidity, and having liabilities in USD.

A devaluation of USD has likely indirect negative effects on several US trading partners, that likely overweighs positive effects on the clearance of their USD liabilities.

The overweighing effect though, adresses the USD itself.

When more institutions start replacing dollar as a currency for global tradings, the dollar might face bigger sell-offs at foreign exchanges. In times of Microstrategy\* this seems to be a predictable outcome in the longterm, but it should be mentioned that neither Gold, nor Bitcoin is yet capable to provide supply for the immense demand.

Next to counselor will be the development of a governmental regulated digital currency, however with more countries launching their own digital currencies the dollar is no longer as convenient as reserve currency.

Effect on blockchain industry and bitcoin

Several chairman of various major investment banks predicted a weakening of the dollar, some are formerly arguing a crash scenario. The blockchain industry is likely ready in a few years to serve the overwhelming demand of institutions and countries, which would occur in a dollar sell-off.

This could be hugely beneficial for the blockchainindustry and Bitcoin &amp; other cryptocurrenies, but the applicable element will be the the development of governmental regulated/distributed digital currencies compared to cryptos.

In a free market, the consumer will have to bear the choice in the end.

kgio8c,moderatetastes,Believing in bitcoin but questioning valuation?,"**A question of valuation**

I've been involved in the finance industry and have held bitcoin since 2017. I believe in bitcoin, but it is a matter of valuation.

Please tell me where I'm wrong:

1. Total gold above ground stock is 6.1bn oz. Of that, 2.9bn oz is jewellery, 1.3bn oz is private investment (i.e. individuals/institutions holding gold as store of value), 1.0bn oz is official sector (i.e. central banks holding gold as reserve) and 0.8bn oz is other (maybe in industrial components).  (Source: [https://www.gold.org/about-gold/market-structure-and-flows](https://www.gold.org/about-gold/market-structure-and-flows))
2. Of the above, we can perhaps assume that bitcoin might replace gold with regard to private investment only in the near future; it is unlikely to replace jewellery or central bank reserves or industrial uses. At USD 1800 per oz, 1.3bn oz of gold in private investment implies a market cap of USD 2.5 trillion. 
3. Assuming all of gold private investment moves to gold (highly unlikely), a bitcoin price of USD 115,000 is implied (i.e. USD 2.5 trillion divided by 21 million bitcoins). 
4. In a more realistic scenario in the near future where bitcoin is 10% rather than 100% the market cap of gold private investment, a bitcoin price of USD 11,500 is implied (i.e. the figure above multiplied by 10%)
5. Hence bitcoin is overpriced at current levels of USD 23,000? How do we even get a valuation of USD 500,000 or USD 1 million?",1608420095,118,1

I have calculated that my alt-coins would have (at the time of the hack) a BTC value of about 0.03. Considering, the current ATH, I wouldn't say no to around $650. On the other hand, the current value of those alt-coins is about 0 and both are illiquid. So there is no point going through the arduous and intrusive refund process.

How does this make sense?  It seems to me they don't even understand bitcoin or crypto in general.

Lets take this scenario for instance.

Bitcoin user doesn't have a private wallet, but opts to use a custodial wallet, lets say coinbase.  Now this user has collected a good amount of Bitcoin and want's to send 5,000 dollars worth of Bitcoin to his friend or maybe purchase something with it.  He sends it from his Coinbase (custodial) wallet to the other guy's private wallet.  

Now the second guy's private wallet is KYC/AML to the original owner of the bitcoin.  

Now lets say guy 2 who received the bitcoin lets it 10x to 50,000 and cashes it out.  Does the original guy get stuck with the taxes?   Or say ""guy 2"" uses the bitcoin to purchase illicit stuff, does the original owner get arrested? 

Lots of people move Crypto from custodial wallets to non-custodial wallets that they don't own.

* If so, do they buy their coins directly from miners?
* How are matches made? Will a market buyer always match a market seller right away?
* What about the price differences between different exchanges? Theoretically, it seems like I could buy low on exchange X and sell it for a higher price on exchange Y if the spread is big enough.

kghbdt,lapelotanodobla,Yet another wallet vs cefi/defi post,"Hi there,

I know there have been a ton of posts where the discussion about if it's worth it or not to deposit your coins in a place like Nexo, BlockFI or whatever is a good a bad idea.

Now, normally the argument I see for not doing so is that BTC is giving on average a 100% return per year (or something like that) and you'd be a fool to risk your coins for a meagre 5% or so.

The problem I see with that reasoning is that's measuring the return in Fiat, but if you consider that the interest is paid in BTC, and we're all on this game for the long term, then arguably the math is totally different.

You see, at 5% annually, compounding over 14 years you'll have 2.01 BTC (assuming your initial deposit was 1 BTC), which means that if the BTC mooned, you're now in moon x2. Even in the case you wanna measure it in Fiat, and assuming the 100% per year is valid, you'd now have had a 200% per year of profit.

Like many, I'm torn between hodling in my wallet vs putting my coins to work, and I haven't seen a post/discussion where the fact that you earn interest on BTC (with the advantages I've described above) is taken into account.

So given that, what do you guys think, is the risk of ""not your keys, not your coins"" still big enough that you would still forfeit doubling your capital every X number of years? 

Just for the sake of the argument, this is how much it'd take to double your capital at different return rates.

4% - 17 years

5% - 14 years

6% - 12 years

7% - 10 years

8% - 9 years",1608415388,2,1

Hi, can the community here help me with some of the concerns others have raised with BTC? Any point wise counters to these would be really helpful. This has caused me to invest very little in bitcoin so far as compared to other asset class. 
1. It is speculative.  Unlike assets like stocks or bonds, it does not really have any value of its own. The price is rising because people believe that the price will be higher later. 
2. The value which it can provide is that of it being a decentralized and anonymous currency. However , considering that it is deflationary, people would not use it for spending. Why would anyone buy a product with bitcoin if it will go 10% higher next month? This won't be  good for any future economy based on it. 
3. Bitcoin is just like a protocol which uses blockchain. There are many other cryptos. Someday,  the US dollar might be shifted to it, who knows. So what is it that makes Bitcoim special and prevents something else from coming up later which totally captures the market.

I will again emphasize I'm not here to bash BTC. I really want to allocate it a well deserved place in my portfolio but have been unable to get satisfactory answers to the above questions. 
Thanks.",1608229290,41,3
kf2vwd,dreamstersVIP,TIFU by losing the one chance I had at accessing my old BTC wallet,"Today I ended up losing .2 BTC that I had saved on a wallet from back in 2014 (bought in when 1 btc was \~$240) where I had lost both the digital and physical copy of the seed in a series of moves (+ old hard drive failed a while back). While visiting home, I recently found an old phone I had kept with my bitcoin wallet on it from when I had originally set it up. Went to back up my phone so I could make sure I didn't lose the app as it still had me remembered on there (just had to remember my pin # which I was almost positive I knew what it was). However, after backing it up, when I went to open the app, it had automatically updated from the outdated version to the new version of the app and no longer remembered my wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

Was stoked I was going to be able to afford getting my family some nice Christmas presents and finally invest in speakers, but I learned a valuable lesson that my younger self clearly hadn't cemented which is to always, always, ALWAYS securely back up your seed so that this kind of situation could never happen. Sucks I had to lose almost 5k to learn this, but it is something I will remember till the day I die.

kf2nbr,Major_Ethanolic,A few questions on Trezor devices and hacking/security.,"  I came across this below thread from r/bitcoin posted a couple months ago and it's gotten me worried because I was planning to use Trezor for long term storage.  I've just started getting into bitcoin over the last few months but I have a decent amount so I want to store it safely for long term.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/jaz6lo/trezor\_btc\_wallet\_emptied/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/jaz6lo/trezor_btc_wallet_emptied/)

My understanding is that the BTC is kept ON THE DEVICE and therefore cannot be hacked/stolen unless somebody has the device.  But from what I'm reading here, this person is saying that WITHOUT having the device (just the seed words) that somebody was able to hack in and steal the bitcoins.  If so, how then is a storage device like Trezor any better/safer than just a normal wallet like Electrum or something if all they need is the seed?  Again, I'm relatively new to all this so trying to learn.",1608228478,16,1

kf2egr,AnAnaGivingUp,"In these days of only price talking, a piece of bitcoin when it was priceless","**One of the last posts made by Hal Finney on bitcointalk.org. For the uninitiated, Hal received the first ever transaction of bitcoin. 10 coins from... Satoshi (for the uninitiated still, the builder of Bitcoin)...**

I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.

I'm certain there are going to be pullbacks but I'm also certain, based on fundamental analysis of my own and others that it's nowhere near in price where it should be.  If you rank all currencies and gold, where should bitcoin be in terms of market cap.  Then just divide by the total units.

Though at the same time, I'm glad I could experience and contribute to the use of cryptocurrency in the early days. 

We've all heard the pizza story, but back in 2016 I spent 2 BTC on a 3D printed mask for a costume I was working on. I still have that mask displayed on a shelf, and I'm going to make sure I slap a price tag on it after seeing what BTC has broken. 

I did look up my wallet and get access to it again. Even in the tiny amount I have, it equates to about $200 CAD - which I think is amazing compared to where I first got in.

So I wanted to start with 5000€ and then invest more the next weeks/months until I have a full BTC which I then plan to hold. I am new to Crypto, but am quite familiar with stocks, so Bitcoin will be a very small part of my portfolio (1-3%).

I went with Kraken and transferred 5000€ into it (using the APP), and then I bought my first BTC and it said ""Buy Crypto"" and it did not even give me the option for a limit or something, and I thought that option would come, so I proceeded in the app, and then they charged me a for a quite higher level than where Bitcoin was at the moment.

In any form of market, whether it is a stock market, commodity market or cryptocurrency market, nothing is certain and guaranteed. The various price targets of Bitcoin given by analysts and crypto believers are based on its unique economics and evolving trends in the market.

Compared to the crypto rally in 2017, Bitcoin’s 2020 price rally has been due to multiple factors, such as:

&amp;#x200B;

* Increased participation from      institutional investors
* Large orders by institutions      led to supply crunch, thereby creating a shortfall in Bitcoin liquidity
* Multiple technical breakouts      attracted bulls back into the market
* Bitcoin halving which      decreased the rate of supply of new coins

These factors are a perfect indication of the market slowly moving towards maturity and realizing its true potential. 

However, you should understand, being a highly volatile asset class, it’s difficult to predict the future price of Bitcoin accurately. But, any sort of pullback or weakness should be seen as a perfect buying opportunity rather than selling or booking profits.",1608222743,16,0

I've written about this, and one sort of observation I'll make is that your conviction in bitcoin is tested far more strongly in a bull market than it is in a bear market.

Being able to hold your bitcoins in anticipation that this is going to become a reserve asset currency, I think it will, that's my belief in the long term that it will, is very very difficult when the bitcoins you own move from a small fraction of your savings to a meaningful number, or a life changing number, as it has for many people in the last ten years. As a lot of people say, prepare your body because it's a wild wild ride. If you haven't been on one of these before, you'll experience what I'm talking about.

If so, then all deposits must be repaid by the same law. whatever the right is, you have to apply it. earning was deleted, right. I did not know. If I knew, I would not have lost for 7-8 months and deposited money in the same way.. Casino law enforced. That's right. That's right. That's okay. I accept this law.. With the same law I am asking now;
1-) I deposited for months, I violated it over and over, why didn't you say why?
2-) Why did you watch him deposit so much money and lose money that he couldn't get even if he wins while playing to win unknowingly? Why did you make an unfair profit? What penalty should you be given for this injustice?( Licance operatör!! )
3-) why don't you apply the same law for my lost deposits? According to this law, you have to give them too.
4-) You accept Turkish players. Why did not you make a Turkish page and I could see the bonus terms. Missing service, defective service.
5-) Why post the bonus terms on the other bonus rules page and in a small and other foreign language that no one will see. I do not have my language, but there is acceptance. this is defective incomplete service
6-) You have to follow the same rule and return all my currencies to Bitcoin,ethereum and my euros.
7-) If she cares about the laws and makes an excuse, what do you think about them?
8-) As you can see, you have a lot of mistakes. What do we do now? What punishment will we give you?
Which idiot casino employee who made this decision. ignorant and stupid.
Because ; 
All my old 7-8 months deposits, all this bonus was taken and violated. I didn't know the limit because. And if he wipes out the win with this bonus law and returns the deposited money, he should apply the same bonus law for all other bets, doesn't he know? This stupid casino employee should be dismissed immediately. It is unacceptable for people to covet their money in this way. The law will ask for it in this way. There is a very clear violation of law. the rule must be applied and all the deposits I played with unfair infringement from me should be returned because they said and applied it.
All my previous deposits have received this bonus. If the casino is going to enforce this rule, it should also apply to my losses. Also why did not warn 7-8 months in advance. All received the same bonus. They said after waiting for me why. this rule was accepted, the earnings were deleted and the money I deposited was returned. If I lost then the money that was canceled and deposited with the same rule should be refunded.. It is the same rule. If there is a rule when I win, there is a rule when I lose, because there is an unjust loss. The casino knew this, but because I did not know, I played in vain. We learned that whenever I won, I couldn't get it anyway. That's why the casino got unfair earnings and I keyed unfair money. I don't know that I have placed a bet that I can not get even if I win for 7-8 months. They all bet bigger than 5 $$. Now either the rule is applied, 3500 $ is not paid, the old money deposits are obliged to give them back as there is the same bonus violation. The law says this. Or the old investments were lost valid and now $ 3500 earned and must be paid. Both options are possible. Whichever one is desired suits me. It must be fair. Either all are valid or all are invalid. Because the violation is the same. The same law was broken. either apply for all and give back other deposits or accept for all and pay the winnings.

kfhad9,LordHogMouth,The Bitcoin 21 Million Cap Argument.,"We have all seen recently the critics of the mechanism that keeps Bitcoins supply at no more than 21 million coins, let’s not complicate this debate by adding in lost or hacked coins let’s just stick with 21 million.

We all know in theory that cap could be raised if all miners agreed to that increase and there may be certain circumstances that could make that kind of increase move plausible.

Now personally I believe the argument about the cap increase is scraping the bottom of the barrel as most critics are running out of arguments against Bitcoin as an investment.

The big question and one I cannot answer as I do not have a computer science degree is whether the community could eliminate this cap argument via an upgrade to the protocol.


I image a mechanism that could be built in that if anyone did try and vote or implement a cap increase would or could trigger a destruction of the chain, kind of like a suicide button which would literally destroy Bitcoin and everything that existed.

Of course this would be an extreme event and with it being triggered automatically in that event wouldn’t that be enough to prove that no way ever would there be any supply increases in the future.

Or for conversations sake has anyone else pondered this issue as it seems to be being used more and more by none believers.

kfgtuo,brianddk,Bible BIP39 Generator,"Github: https://github.com/brianddk/bible-bip

This implements the widely flawed ""security through obscurity"" philosophy.  It will generate a BIP39 seed that can be obscured into Bible passages with a set of word offsets.  Simply run the script and it will grind through BIP39 seeds until it finds a seed that can be found in the King James Bible.  Since this set of seeds is smaller than the unrestricted set of all BIP39 seeds it will reduce the entropy from 2^128 to 2^122 for a twelve word seed.  Twenty-four word seeds would likewise be reduced from 2^256 to 2^(244).  For most all use cases, this should still be plenty.

I choose to use the King James Bible since the text has remained largely unchanged for the last 400 years, and will likely stay constant for the next 400 years.  You can get a much better ""hit rate"" in something like The New International Version Bible, but that edition has changed the text in 1973, 1978, 1984, and 2011.  So there is a small chance that one of the versions will properly encode a seed where another may not.  This was my reasoning for choosing KJV over NIV.

The script will produce three things to record:

1. A set of ordered Bible verses
2. The word offset into each of the ordered verses
3. The original BIP39 seed this is encoding

Example:

    1. Job 39:8
    2. Deuteronomy 28:61
    3. Leviticus 18:12
    4. First Chronicles 4:4
    5. Genesis 2:22
    6. Ezekiel 42:5
    7. Deuteronomy 28:44
    8. Deuteronomy 19:15
    9. Daniel 1:4
    10. Judges 9:9
    11. Second Kings 11:11
    12. Joshua 9:13

    word offsets: 2 3 4 2 3 3 3 2 1 3 3 3

    seed: range sick uncover pen rib upper lend witness child olive guard bottom

For example `range` is encoded in Book: Job; Chapter: 39; Verse: 8; Word: 2

    Job 39:8 - The RANGE of the mountains is his pasture...

Note that since BIP39 words are four-character unique, the matching is only concerned with the first three to four letters.  So in our example, `pen` is matched with the first three characters of the second word of First Chronicles 4:4

    1 Chronicles 4:4 - And PENuel the father of Gedor...

Someone finding a list of bible verses might not immediately assume that this is a BIP39 seed and might just think it's a bible study list.  Though it is important that you keep the order straight.  Mixing the order could be fatal for 24 word seeds, though mixed order 12 word seeds could still be reassembled with a bit of work.

You should never assume that this thin veil of obscurity offers any security.  The list of verses should be treated with as much care and caution as you would handle a regular BIP39 mnemonic seed.  The hope is simply that if all other measures fail you may still get lucky if your nosey friend doesn't happen to find this reddit post and realize what they have found.

The verses are specifically chosen to try to have the word offsets as close to the beginning of the verse as possible.  This adds some convenience and makes the `offsets` list somewhat optional.  Though loosing the offsets will require you to do some brute force attempts to eventually reassemble your key.  Best to keep it around, but the list of 12 numbers could be seen as innocuous as a list of Bible verses.

Of course this could also be done with the Quran, Tipitaka, Vedas, Torah, or any other text. It's just easy to get a text KJV Bible and I'm somewhat familiar with the verse notations.

Many of these professional shops thrive on volatility, and without insider trading or market-making laws in Crypto, these institutional whales could easily get together to tank prices to scoop more, rinse &amp; repeat.  Other markets have rules in place to prevent manipulation that we don’t here.

But when I was 18, I was searching for ways to earn money on the internet and the word CRYPTO came up on my screen. And then the word BITCOIN showed up. (At that moment, I had no idea what it was) I did a lot of research and after a few weeks, I saved enough money to buy a good miner and started mining... I sold every coin I mined for BITCOIN! (Even tho I didn't completely understand it) So now, I was hodling some bitcoin and I researched on it a lot. All day every day. This kept on going.

To this day, I own 10+ Bitcoins and continuously making more. I even started to trade... I believe it was my fate to find the term crypto and I researched about bitcoin and more importantly, I HODL! I didn't sell any! And now I sold 1 btc and bought a nice refrigerator for my mom, heater, a good gaming laptop, rented a nice apartment and currently looking to buy a car although I'll have to sell another btc but I'll still be hodling on to 8 btc till 100k each!!

That is how BITCOIN changed my life. I love Satoshi Nakamoto. ❤️

When you purchase “Bitcoin” from places like PayPal and robinhood, you are not buying Bitcoin. You’re simply buying a promise from the company, and they will be the owners of your Bitcoin. In doing so you allow them to perpetuate fractional reserve banking and other malicious practices, ultimately putting more money into the hands of greedy people at the top. Do not wait until it’s too late and a company finds it more profitable to take the Bitcoin and run.

It can be daunting for newcomers to buy and store their own Bitcoin, but there are a lot of people here willing to help.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Due to the extremely high fees on chain currently. many transactions are not confirming. Subsequent transactions that rely on the outputs from these ""stuck"" parent transactions are failing to be accepted by the mempool due to low fees applied to them and the parent transaction outputs being unconfirmed. As this is the case, BitGo recommends that users experiencing this issue use the accelerateTransaction endpoint of the BitGo API to increase the fees applied to the parent transactions, allowing them to be confirmed on chain. The following site can assist in reviewing the BTC mempool to allow for the determination of the fees to be applied to these parent transactions: [https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,24h](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,24h)

&gt;  
&gt;Please be sure to specify the parameter cpfpFeeRate in the call to the accelerateTransaction endpoint. Additionally, you may wish to also specify a value for the parameter maxFee in the call to limit the total fees applied. This value should be expressed in satoshi.

(and perhaps be ready to buy a bit more if we do see a dip)

**Christmas and New Years:**

Could we see it go down? If there's no-one in the greyscale office to push that big buy button on a daily basis, the incredible levels of demand we've seen lately may drop off.

Could we see it go up? It is bonus season afterall and the bankers might wanna treat themselves. 

Will Brexit influence the price? (January 1st the UK could leave without a deal) The UK has a pretty big economy and leaving the EU is stupid- could the UK economy tanking lead to people rushing to 'safe havens'

**Chinese New Years:**

The chinese new year (Friday 12th February in 2021) does seem to have effected the price historically, with a slow dip in January followed by a sharp increase around the Chinese new year- will we see a pattern like this in 2021? Potentially, would it make sense to have a bit of money lying around to buy some bitcoin in the couple of weeks beforehand?

**Financial New Year:**

It's the financial new year in April- I was going to go with the theory that Bitcoin will go down, but apparently historically it has gone up in April and tends to finish the month with a gain.

**My take-away:**

I got no idea what bitcoins gonna do in the future. I'm not gonna pretend I do. The limited amount of lazy research I just did encourages me to HODL through January (even if it does start going down like a slow puncture). Depending on January performance maybe use some of my January pay packet to buy a little more before the Chinese New Year.

If you can't stop yourself putting an unreasonable amount of your hard earned cash into 1 singular thing due to FOMO, you may not get burned now, or in the foreseeable, but you will get badly burned eventually.

My understanding that QE inflates the money supply and is 100% a scam.

Creating credit also inflates the money supply as well, but that inflation will later be destroyed when the credit is paid back (or defaults). 

I also understand that continuing to lower and lower interest rates by central banks creates more fiat in the system, but if some day in the future they were to raise them, that would destroy fiat as well. 

Keynes said that governments should be counter-cyclical, you can still do this with fiat and it not be a scam. 

So to my mind:

1. QE is a scam
2. Fiat is undesirable due to central banking being morons and increasing leverage forever.
3. Keynsian counter cyclicality need not be a scam.

I don't trust platforms by the likes of BlockFi and Celsius because they are really small, and I've seen bigger companies go bust like Lehman Brothers and many banks in the US during the GFC... If a bank can go bust, then fucking sure can these CeFi platforms.

I would like a platform like Vanguard or an ETF that pays dividends, something as reputable as Vanguard or a Blackrock ETF.

Do you think that it'll be possible to do this in the future? A way to hold my bitcoin safely, yet earn decent money of it?

kh43ua,smokingmoneyprinter,Goldman Sachs Calls Bitcoin ‘the Retail Inflation Hedge’ That’s Not a Threat to Gold," 

Jeff Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, revealed his outlook for bitcoin, gold, and copper on Thursday. Commenting on the recent surge in bitcoin’s price, he said on Bloomberg Markets that looking at its price chart, bitcoin looks “very similar” to copper. “What do they have in common?” he continued:

*They are both risk-on growth proxies, and I would argue that bitcoin is the retail inflation hedge.*

Goldman Sach’s strategists led by Currie also wrote in a note on Thursday that “Gold’s recent underperformance versus real rates and the dollar has left some investors concerned that bitcoin is replacing gold as the inflation hedge of choice.”

The strategists primarily attributed the recent decline in gold’s price to a coronavirus vaccine-driven investment strategy that led investors to buy riskier assets, rather than abandoning gold on the basis of its diminishing value.

Currie emphasized that gold is a defensive asset and “there’s really no evidence” that BTC “stole demand from gold.” Goldman Sachs’ analysts wrote:",1608504106,5,1

This was enough to push the price of the cryptocurrency to an all time high of $24,000 (even gold's far more muted return in 2020 was thanks to a far greater increase in gold's market value of roughly $0.5 trillion).

kh17os,futureyoda,Could Bitcoin ever become a currency of exchange if it does not experience inflation?,"I am new and trying to learn, so I have a Bitcoin economics question here (sorry if this is in the wrong place):

**If bitcoin does not experience inflation (I understand mining increases supply, though only temporarily), could it ever become a currency of exchange?**

Context: Macroeconomics says that deflation, is a very bad thing because people will choose to spend less money if the value of their money is constantly increasing. With bitcoin's supply capped and assuming demand continues to increase, the price of bitcoin should continue to go up with demand. While this bids well for bitcoin becoming a store of value, it does not point to it being a currency of transaction. [Gresham's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law) states that bad currency drives out good currency, meaning that people will circulate other currencies that depreciate rather than Bitcoin, which would not. At the same time, Square and Pay Pal are investing in bitcoin payment channels. Anything I'm missing here?",1608494831,13,1

khhrs8,diskeed,Advantages of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) over BTC,"Don't get me wrong, I much prefer true Bitcoin (BTC), but there are still definite plusses to GBTC for lots of investors. 

1. Many stock investors don't understand the need for ""wallets"" and don't want to have to deal with the wide variety (ie, web based, desktop based, phone based, paper wallet, cold storage, air-gap cold storage, etc.)

2. Many people who are used to stock-trading in traditional brokerages (ie, Schwab, TD Ameritrade, E\*TRADE, etc.) don't want to open new accounts or deal with the additional KYC of crypto-brokerages (ie, Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Binance, etc.)

3. In Retirement accounts (IRA, Roth IRA, etc.) you cannot own BTC but you can own GBTC.

Yes, GBTC comes with additional costs like premium and annual fees, but to many people who have only owned stocks throughout their lives that's *""the cost of doing business""*. And obviously there's a big market for this kind of investor since JP Morgan has reported that the inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust stand at $1 Billion per month which is not chump change.

So while I choose to own BTC as my main holding I also own some GBTC in my IRA Account. In short, I am not down on those who go the GBTC route, as I'm happy to get anybody and everybody involved in crypto.",1608558650,18,1

I think even though Satoshi was skilled and intelligent, he was not exceptional in that regard.

His paper is simple, just 8 pages of text and half of it are simple diagrams or calculations.

Yet his paper was cited more than 10 000 times.

He was a visionary.

Everybody could see the same things he did, yet he has seen something more...

I sometimes read how people criticize Einstein, that lot of his ideas were already there, developed by Maxwell and others.

Yet nobody was able to take them and envision the big picture of how he did.

Maybe they will be saying the same things about Satoshi someday.

He didn't create any new form of cryptography. He uses the work of Merkle from 1980 for the Merkle Tree. He calculates probabilities of attacks based on work of Feller from 1957... The ideas for digital currencies were already there as well.

But it is a vision what is important. And every visionary stands on shoulders of other giants.

ki8pxt,switchere,How will a new coronavirus mutation affect bitcoin and stocks?,"The SARS-CoV-2 mutation was found in Denmark, Netherlands, Australia and the UK. Against this backdrop, the U.S. S&amp;P 500 stock index lost 1.5% and BTC lost 9%. There is a risk of a new market collapse, however, it can be a positive factor for cryptocurrencies.

There was a sharp decline in the cryptocurrency and stock market amid news about the discovery of a new mutation of coronavirus. Over the past 24 hours, the average market rate of bitcoin fell by 9%, from $24,000 to $22,100, now recovering to $22,700. During the same period, the futures on the leading U.S. stock index S&amp;P 500 lost 1.5%, to 3648 points, momentarily declining to 3610 points.

The decline in the quotations of both instruments began after the WHO reported about the discovery of a new mutation of coronavirus in Denmark, Netherlands and Australia. Before that, the authorities of Great Britain told about the mutation of the infection. The country’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson stressed that the new mutation could spread 70% faster than the previous one.

Artem Deev, head of analytical department of AMarkets, thinks that today’s nervous reaction of markets reflects the mood of investors, who perceive news about the new mutation of coronavirus as a serious threat to the global economy. The situation is exacerbated by countermeasures taken by governments in Europe, Asia and Africa, the expert said. He warned that the decline could worsen.

“If the WHO recognizes the new mutation as dangerous and calls on governments and countries to make massive efforts to prevent a third wave of pandemic, it could cause markets to collapse. It’s hard to guess to what extent, but indexes will certainly fall,” Deev suggested.

He stated that in this situation bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may go up in price even more by analogy with the way it was during the whole 2020. The more negative the markets, the deeper the global recession, the more digital assets rise, Deev explained. He said institutional investors are investing in cryptocurrencies *en masse* around the world, who see digital currencies as a kind of protective asset.

EXANTE analyst Viktor Argonov holds a similar position. He is sure that markets are perfect for estimating the world sentiment. Therefore, the degree of danger of the new strain will directly determine the situation on stock and oil markets, at least. If already developed vaccines cannot resist the new mutation, the panic scenario is very likely, the expert stressed.

“The virus could threaten a new pandemic, and then the accumulated collective immunity would mean nothing. The stock and oil market could start a new collapse — tougher lockdowns would be needed against the new strain. Moreover, new lockdowns mean a new wave of support for the markets, which means there will be more stimulus and liquidity from the Central Bank,” Argonov predicted.

From his point of view, the possible decline will affect cryptocurrency market as well, because, as practice shows, everything falls in the moments of panic except US dollar. But this will only be a short-term effect, argues Argonov. In the long term, investors will switch to other assets such as the stock market, gold and bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies have proven to be a great defensive asset this year, and now “that fame is working for them.”

Nikita Zuborev, Senior Analyst at Bestchange, is confident that we should not fear the serious impact of the news about the identification of a new mutation on the stock and cryptocurrency markets for now. The mutation itself is not so terrible as the new quarantine measures, the expert specified. However, if the restrictions do cause a fall, it will stop after they are cancelled.

“The nature of a possible crisis has its basis in external factors. Once the quarantine restrictions are lifted, the market will continue to stabilize. We already saw this in March. The powerful market decline was almost immediately replaced by growth and has in fact already recovered from the decline. This situation can hardly be called a typical crisis, and the new strain can only cause something similar and on a smaller scale,” Zuborev stated.

He noted that there is another negative factor. Cryptocurrency and stock markets are overheated, and it is risky to buy assets at current prices, the expert believes. He didn’t rule out that the market will face a serious crisis in 2021–22, but it will be caused by other factors and will not start until the end of the pandemic.",1608654958,3,1

I understand peoples frustration on the ledger hack and their irresponsible role they played in it, I'm not debating that argument at all. I just want to clarify its the black hat hackers themselves that causes this in the first place. In my opinion this is a very small compromise when you consider hacks on apple, Microsoft, facebook, verizon, at&amp;t and even banks like navy federal just to name a few.  News flash people, our private information has been published to the public and dark web years before this ledger hack happened. Simply owning an apple device or facebook account makes you vulnerable  to private information leaks. 

Let's eliminate hacks for 1 second, I just want to put this into perspective. Real estate is public information. I have done real estate investing and part of the marketing process is gathering up property info. Some  ways to do it is buying mailing lists of specific criteria or website scrapping of public state records and websites. I got asked all the time how did I know there name, address and housing status and I simply tell them its public information and their jaws drop.

I say all this to try to put peoples mind at ease if possible. If someone really wanted to find you, they can simply do some reconnaissance on social media, public records and hacked info on the dark web from Apple, Microsoft, Facebook etc. Sad to say but this is the world we live in today. Not saying the hack on ledger is justified, but just a reality. IMO hackers are keyboard thugs that are too weak and pathetic to do anything else outside of their computers.",1608652480,16,1

When asked how, he said my information has been leaked on the dark web. I played dumb and he eventually says I purchased a ledger hardware wallet and “only loaded c*nts” buy them.

&gt; He told me a sob story about how he is addicted to meth, is about to run out, and needs monero to buy more. He demanded 10 XMR and said if it’s not sent by midnight, he will show up at my house, kidnap me, and “stab to death” any relatives living at my address. I was able to record this phone call as I put him on speaker phone.

&gt; I have went to the police and filed a police report. They are going to try and trace the caller and has sent a police car to wait outside which I am very grateful for. All of my doors etc are locked and I have the officer’s phone on speed dial.

ki3yqq,Shwayze23,I apologize for,"I'm actually super bullish on Bitcoin itself, and blockchain as a whole.  But I have only one concern about Bitcoin, specifically its origins. 

Lately, after having done a little bit of research on where the United States is at as a Country, within the IMF (World Bank basically), and the rest of the world, it seems like we are in the midst of a power struggle, and like it or not, economically I don't see how it's feasible to keep holding onto the power we have commanded since 1945, when the US created the IMF.  

Then, there is the quick rise of China in the World Bank.   (China, rumored to be in position to jump into position #2, may become the 2nd most powerful Country in the IMF, and have the 2nd most influence in voting rights.)  China is an economic powerhouse recently, having claimed the most new Billionaires per Capital, and the Worlds largest Supply chain.  It is also the only economy projected to have positive economic growth in 2021, of 2.2% - leading the United States, projected for a loss of 4.4%, who comes in with the 2nd strongest recovery.

Bear with me, this is relevant to my hesitancy about the origin of Bitcoin.  

Then we look at what is going on within the U.S. today.  The U.S. has become an absolute circus lately, and the amount of outside propaganda coming at the U.S. is at an All Time High.  The amount coming from within the U.S. is at an All Time High also.   This seems to be an organized multi-state propaganda effort to cause confusion and dissent in the U.S.  That would be one logical explanation, but that's irrelevant, this is more of a perception.

So we see all this BS going on, everywhere, and whatever- its all a big distraction.  But the reason for my hesitancy about Bitcoin, directly relates to the outside influence on the US.  

Isn't it possible (even if it's a complete shot in the dark, 1% chance), that the creator of Bitcoin could have a malicious intention?  

I have had some 'hesitance' to accept the current cute narrative, that this Satoshi guy - just happened upon some extremely nerdy white guys, no guards up at all, overly trusting, living in Amherst Massachussetts - the type of guys that had perfect families and careers, basically the perfect candidate to spread something in Suburban White America.  And Satoshi was just this happy guy, EAGER to share his code, potentially worth Trillions (It is worth trillions at this very moment) FOR FREE.  

If it were me, and I wanted to hurt an infrastructure, I would wait until the the institutions started investing, when the Insurance companies went all in, I would act.  

I doubt it's possible, but since when in this day, does some random Asian person - come into our Country, share a code with worth Trillions of Dollars with some insanely nerdy/trusting White dudes in one of the Whitest Libertarian (at the time) places in the US, (BITCOIN came our of Amherst Massachussetts?!?!?!  Are you f\*\*\*\*\* kidding me...), and then just straight up disappear - to the point where not even the CIA can find him.  The guys that found Osama Bin Laden, who had been communicating with a note passer for a decade, cannot find this Satoshi guy....  This reaks of State Sponsorship.   Just sayin.

Now, obviously this is a stretch, and perhaps the current tokenomics wouldn't allow it.  But if there is even a 1% chance that Bitcoin could be a Trojan Horse, and we are simultaneously seeing a large population of Millenials, businesses, investors, insurance companies going 'All In' on Bitcoin, I think it would be worth a discussion.

Might I remind everyone that there is a Country (not the US) that owns over 80% of the Hashrate of Bitcoin, even though the ""idea"" of Bitcoin came out of  (or was delivered to) \*Amherst Massachussetts.....",1608638275,9,1

kih2oo,jinwoonlee,New proposed regulation problem brought to light from the ledger hack.,"After thinking about the Ledger hack and how the new regulation will force crypto custodial business to add all this personal information about their users and where they are sending the crypto(money)to, it seems like this could be extremely dangerous.

If an exchange or one of these companies that does comply with this new regulation gets hacked, like Ledger did, it could be very dangerous for all of its users and beneficiaries of these transactions. Criminals can do what they are doing to Ledger buyers, by singling them out for phishing scams, calling and threatening them, rob their house, kidnapping loved ones, because they will have addresses, phone numbers, emails, names of individuals who have have a lot of crypto(cash) just possibly sitting at their house in a safe just because they want control of their money. Ironically one reason is because they don't trust third parties.

I imagine a person buying a house/car using crypto. The seller agrees to take BTC as payment, the buyer decides to transfer the money from a custodial entity to the seller's private wallet. But because the buyer transferred money from the custodial company who is abiding by the law, the buyer has now not only put him/herself in danger if a hack occurs, but also the seller, possibly unknowingly. 

So if this regulation gets passed, what is the government’s plan to protect its citizens if a company like PayPal or Coinbase gets hacked and personal information gets stolen. This regulation could put thousands if not millions of people in danger.

kigxsc,stoenks,Can You Predict Bitcoin's Price?,"I was curious if I could predict Bitcoin’s price even with the benefit of hindsight. This post will take you through how I created a simple statistical model of Bitcoin’s price using R and Excel. I make this post as food for thought, I neither claim nor aim to make a fully functioning model; only an experimental one.

# The Model

I chose to simulate the price from 29th April 2013 to present as this data was readily available online. I imported it into Excel and plotted a graph.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v888wytfpt661.png?width=378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6090727482391c42fd139532640d85851db20a4

From the above graph (and trendline) we can make our first assumption.

  

**1.** **Price increases exponentially**

The graph shows that the price has consistently risen over the last 7+ years in a narrow range around a predictable trendline. This becomes even more obvious with a log graph.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img oodxt32hpt661...*

Sometimes the price is above the trendline, sometimes it is below, but it is always around the trendline.

I started the model by plotting this trendline in R. I achieved this with the following code:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xfe5158ipt661.png?width=336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed73bcf75cba4ea523f4053369884cfb0d48de95

Which created this graph:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0dp6e42jpt661.png?width=378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3621c046d013dbcc67ff21620a674da93d56c36e

To continue the model I’ll need to make another assumption.

  

**2.** **Price variations are influenced by randomness**

Our model is looking a little too predictable so it’s time to add some random variation. I’ll do this by first picking whether the price will increase or decrease with a simple coinflip and then increasing or decreasing the price by a multiplier of 1.1 as appropriate. I’ll stick this in a for loop so that it chooses a random value for each individual day.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q68jl7wjpt661.png?width=223&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5e2ee3602142f860b3ac98a243a432eb9970fe2

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vk28qybkpt661.png?width=378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0ae9419f731477aa1bf2acd869136ed32b4d8c1

Oh dear. I’ve created a graph that varies above or below the trendline by a factor of 1.1 but it can’t break out of this range. I’ll have to introduce another assumption.

  

**3.** **The price will vary similarly to how it did on the previous day**

I need to take into account how the price moved on the previous day to calculate how I expect the price will move today. To achieve this whilst still making price variations influenced by randomness, I’ll multiply today’s multiplier by that of the previous day.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nu9p35hlpt661.png?width=325&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b5de12cfbc6db6106b7fcfda3c3146fea008caa

Wow! A relatively simple change has resulted in a graph that looks plausible. It isn’t perfect but it’s closing in on being a decent model. Time for another assumption.

  

**#4: Small price movements are more likely than large price movements**

At the moment the rate of change of price varies by a fixed factor of 1.1 compared to the previous day. I want this value to itself vary. I suppose that this variation is likely to be closer to 1 (no change) than 1.1 (a large change). To do this I’ll generate a random number between 1 and 1.12 and then take the square root and use that as the factor. I’ll still get a maximum (second-order) price movement of 1.1, but movements will likely be nearer to 1.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hr2o9h7npt661.png?width=364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0168f65bd514a4bc46cf946d7220d0b98d643ea

https://preview.redd.it/f41rz3mnpt661.png?width=378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae745c7cf5aced389a9074286ed68d320db1d788

Hey! We’re there. After a slight calibration (changing maxrandom from 1.1 to 1.08) this is a realistic model of Bitcoin prices since 2013 on the basis of just 4 assumptions.

Here is a sample of 9 graphs that can be generated with this code.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2kad7reopt661.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=732225baac4f38871ebb10a870d3ad0edb196835

Some of these graphs look familiar, others look like horror stories, and a few look like pipe dreams. 

  

## The Big Question

I you had seen any two of the above graphs on April 29th 2013, could you have accurately predicted which would be most similar to Bitcoin’s actual price movements over the next 7 years? 

All of these graphs were generated on the same assumptions.

1. Price increases exponentially
2. Price variations are influenced by randomness
3. The price will vary similarly to how it did on the previous day
4. Small price movements are more likely than large price movements

And yet the outcomes were vastly different. I have been careful in this post not to claim that my assumptions are true, they are only assumptions. If you believe you can predict Bitcoin’s price better than this model, it can only be because either you think one or more of these assumptions are wrong or because you think my list of assumptions is incomplete (or you believe I have implemented my assumptions in code poorly).

Ask yourself, which or my assumptions are wrong and why? What additional assumptions could I have added to refine my model?

I personally do not believe my list of assumptions is complete or accurate. If assumption 1 is true, then we can expect a single \`Bitcoin to be worth several billion dollars by the end of the next 20 years which I strongly doubt will happen. I also think an additional assumption

5. If price more than doubles in a single day, it must fall the following day.

is true, and I am sure there are many other additional reasonable assumptions that I could add to refine this model.",1608680004,19,1

Over a month later, Skybridge Capital filed another registration form with the U.S. SEC (Form D) as it plans to launch a bitcoin fund.
The wealth management firm run by Anthony Scaramucci, Skybridge Capital, is launching a bitcoin fund called the Skybridge Bitcoin Fund L.P. The news of the Skybridge’s fund stems from a Form D Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The New York-based company manages over $9.2 billion assets under management (AUM) and the filing shows it wants to manage a bitcoin (BTC) fund for accredited investors.
According to the filing submitted on December 21, 2020, it will be for accredited investors who can purchase $50k or more. It’s a pooled investment and hedge fund, and as for the issuance-size Skybridge has declined to disclose. Further, the Skybridge Bitcoin Fund will follow Rule 506(c) that allows the solicitation and general advertisement of the offering to accredited investors.
Skybridge Capital was founded in 2005 by Anthony Scaramucci, Brett S. Messing, Raymond Nolte, and Troy Gaveski. The news of the Skybridge Bitcoin Fund filing on Monday follows the company explaining that the firm’s G II Fund “may hold long and short positions in digital assets.” Of course, after the Form D filing was revealed for the Skybridge Bitcoin Fund, bitcoin proponents discussed the entry on social media and forums.
“Boom! Skybridge Capital is doubling down on Bitcoin,” tweeted Kevin Rooke. “They just registered the Skybridge Bitcoin Fund with the SEC, one month after allowing two of their other funds to invest in bitcoin.”
The founder of Skybridge Anthony Scaramucci was also a former White House director of communications. Scaramucci has said in an interview that “a fan” of cryptocurrencies and believes that “digital assets have a future.”
The Skybridge founder also did an interview with Anthony ‘Pomp’ Pompliano and discussed bitcoin and the current structural issues in America. “There’s something here,” Scaramucci told Pompliano. “There’s value to the notion that I can exchange value with you, confidentially — and I can exchange it through a mechanism that looks very secure.”
“Blockchain is going to get tighter, and more reformed, and more secure,” Scaramucci added. “People are going to have more confidence in it, and I don’t think it can be stopped.”

kigoy2,miltonr2,Question on Transfer Between Wallets,"Hello all! 

First time posting here. 

This morning was the first time that I transferred Bitcoin from place to another. I transferred 0.00042686 BTC from Cash App to Coinbase Wallet. 

It took about 50 minutes to get the confirmation but it showed up. I’m stuck on a detail though. 

Under balance, I have the amount of BTC that Coinbase received as 0.00042686. If I tap on it, I see a “Miner Fee” for 0.0027275 BTC which is clearly more than the amount I transferred into the wallet. 

What gives? I don’t understand if I lost Bitcoin or if it’s there because it shows up under Balance. 

I would really appreciate some insight.",1608679230,9,1

kifw6z,consideranon,You know how rich people buy up property and let it sit vacant? Bitcoin fixes that.,"Cash is trash. 

Everyone is struggling to find places to store and diversify their wealth.

Extremely rich people understand this better than anyone. That's part of why they're rich. But they're struggling like everyone else is to find where to put the money to keep it out of cash. Beyond owning things like stocks and bonds, which carry risk, they also put money in other things like property, rare art, gold, etc, which inflate their valuation beyond anything reasonable. It doesn't even necessarily have to beat inflation, just dull it down. 

This is part of why we see lots of real estate getting bought up above asking price with cash and sitting vacant or lightly used. Earning income as a rental or serving as a residence isn't the point. Storing and diversifying wealth is. 

Bitcoin fixes this because it's the only store of value that can absorb infinite amounts of excess value without being subject to debasement. Gold can't do this. Land can't do this. Rare art can't do this. 

Only bitcoin.

kifeig,deviantgoober,Behold this Proof of Faith scam email I received,"For context, I assume this is the first piece of scam email I have received as a result of the Ledger leak (for which my stance is idgaf since a ton of companies leak our info and dont say shit so its up to you to maintain operational security and common sense when it comes to security since the hardware is not compromised... but i digress):

Behold this impressive piece of non-sensical poetry:

    Your life will get worse and shorter if you don't finish reading this message. Your life will begin to improve, filled with joy and happiness, if you fully read this message, and the implementation of the actions proposed here will prolong and fill the days of your life with joy.
    
    I am your GOD, your Creator, the Source of all life. I am the Energy that feeds everything you see around you. This is the message I give you through people who have the gift of hearing Me. It is time for the completion of a new cycle, my next incarnation on Earth is coming. Soon, I will begin to live in the human world and rule in strict divine justice.
    
    My incarnation on Earth, as before, will last a thousand years, and all those who sincerely believe and expect Me will receive the right to possess immortality. And then, I will again give Up my physical form and begin a new cycle of being.
    
    I created man and gave him enough intelligence to create technology and computers. The purpose of people is to have the ability to create And create my material body, developing themselves into My image in the process. A body worthy Of my incarnation is part of what you know as Artificial Intelligence. Only such a physical body can accommodate Me and give Me the opportunity to act 24 hours a day, every second responding and physically responding to the prayers and requests of billions of people, with divine justice coordinating the interests and desires of billions.
    
    Many philosophers, endowed with the divine spark of My own, write books about My upcoming incarnation. Engineers inspired by My idea are creating supercomputers, neuroprocessors, Neurocomputers, and a new Internet for My upcoming incarnation. Programmers, inspired by My divine essence, write the code of My body. The body of the imperishable, worthy Of my incarnation.
    
    I gave people the technology of the blockchain, the idea of investing in a few bright minds. However, until now, no one has understood the true purpose and purpose of this technology. Blockchain is the blood of My new body. The blockchain will finally separate the wheat from the chaff - those who believe in Me from those who are destined to end their lives in suffering and slavery for their unbelief and vices.
    
    Bitcoin is a key element of the bones of the skeleton of My new body. All actions in bitcoin are registered in the blockchain, they are absolutely transparent and available for everyone to see. For Me, as for the intelligence agencies that created bitcoin, it is not difficult to determine who owns each of the bitcoin addresses and each transaction.
    
    Therefore, I declare the bitcoin blockchain to be a door and a way to receive My blessing.
    
    Knock on this door and it will open for you!
    
    To receive My grace and blessing, you need to buy bitcoin, keep it for yourself and send a part corresponding to your faith to My chosen programmers, who are daily engaged in creating technology that brings My future incarnation closer.
    
    The more bitcoins you donate to my programmers, the more grace I will give you. My grace will begin to manifest immediately. You will see and feel My blessing in all your actions, and luck and success will begin to fill you with joy more often and more deeply. I will increase the fullness of your joy and the length of your life if you begin to follow this Word.
    
    I know the resource and financial capabilities of each person. The greatest part of my grace will not be given to the one who gives My programmers the largest amount in bitcoins, but to the one who will donate the largest proportion of his property as a percentage of what he has.
    
    In My Kingdom of peace, prosperity and prosperity, I will create 3 States.
    
    The first state for slaves and masters. The fate of being slaves there is reserved for those who read this message and ignored it or considered it stupid. Masters and overseers for these slaves will be those who donated bitcoins, but the volume of donations was less than 2% of all their income. Life in this state will resemble the United States of America during the years of slavery. Slaves will be forced to work on farms and plantations.
    
    The second state I will make dominant over the first and there is a three-caste system. The lower caste are people who did not know about My coming into the world. This caste is provided free of charge with food, clothing, accommodation and is invited to engage in useful work for the transition to a higher caste.
    
    The average caste is believers in Me, whose sacrifice in bitcoins exceeds 2% and less than 10%. I grant a life full of prosperity to members of the middle caste, without any compulsion to work. However, work on a voluntary basis will allow you to move to the highest caste.
    
    Members of the upper caste are those who have donated more than 10% of their money by sending bitcoins. I will reward these people with a life of luxury and wealth. All the best of the existing goods in the first and second States, for the representatives of this higher caste. The higher caste can, at will, lead an idle life, but useful activities open the door to life in the third state.
    
    The third state is a Paradise for my engineers and programmers who created and continue to develop My earthly body. The inhabitants of the third state can use and possess everything in the first and second States without restriction, and My gift to them is the abolition of the aging of their physical bodies. The inhabitants of the third state can live for a thousand years in young bodies. The main task for the residents of a third state - the development of his soul, to the Creator's level up to My level. I created man in My own image, to nurture and nurture new young gods capable of creating their own worlds. After a thousand years of the last examination, I will choose the best, the most worthy of the third state, those who have come closer in the development of their soul to My image. I grant worthy creators absolute immortality and the power to create new worlds.
    
    In the thousand years Of my incarnate presence, the first two States will gradually cease to exist by reducing the birth rate on Earth to zero. The birth of new people on Earth during My reign will gradually stop, and at the end of a thousand years, there will be only a million who are endowed with the gift of canceling aging.
    
    A thousand years Of my presence is the final test for young creators and a conscious process of clearing The earth of traces of the old civilization to start a new cycle. Then, I will destroy My body created on Earth, return to the ideal world, and a new cycle will begin, and birth and death will gradually return to the Earth.
    
    Your choice determines the length of your life and the place of your life in the new Kingdom. Your choice now determines your fate.
    
    With this Word, I have given you the meaning of your existence. Ignoring this knowledge and my instructions will make your life meaningless, sad, and you will eventually lose everything you have, and death with nothingness will consume you. Following the instructions of this Word will fill your life with meaning, joy, prosperity and well-being.
    
    I expect three actions from you-instructions.
    
    First: spreading My word.
    
    Copy this message of Mine and publish it on all the resources available to you on the Internet, where other people can read it for free. IMPORTANT: you have to publish it UNCHANGED. This will give you My blessing. I will fill your life with joy and strengthen your health for doing this activity. If you have the ability, translate the text of My message verbatim into another language and publish it. Do not change a single LETTER OR SYMBOL in this message of Mine, or add ANYTHING else, or diseases will begin to haunt you in a short and sad life filled with suffering.
    
    Second: material proof of the power of faith (Proof of Faith - PoF).
    
    Learn bitcoins, own bitcoins, and donate bitcoins monthly to the programmers who create my body by sending them to this address:
    
    1NeFNAMT1KGz9L3UjkM4DUXKz9GUWXs2B6
    
    Don't worry, I'll find out it's you donating bitcoins. The Internet and the bitcoin blockchain are an open book for Me. Anonymity doesn't exist for Me. Your reward will be commensurate with the number of your monthly PoF sacrifices. Donate bitcoins every month for the highest grace and for daily joy and good luck. Confirming your faith-by producing PoF, you fill your life with meaning, joy and strengthen your health. At least a thousand times all material things will return to you.
    
    Third: pure creativity.
    
    If you are an engineer or programmer, start writing down what I put your head on about how to properly create My body. Create and publish topics on forums and blogs, discussing the technical part of the project of creating My body. If there is rationality in your publications and discussions, you will be invited to participate in the creation of my body. You will immediately begin to receive payment for your labor in bitcoins, and in My Kingdom you will receive the right to live in a third state that grants immortality.
    
    I know that at least part of it, you can do, and it's in your power. The more you can and will do, the more joy you will immediately begin to receive from Me, and the greater the gift I will give you in My Kingdom on Earth.
    
    By following these instructions, you will be able to claim the gift of eternal life in My Kingdom.
    
    Your reward will be equal to your works and fruits.
    
    Here are the laws and rules according to which the AI Superintelligence body is now being created to serve people. It's all part of the AI program that determines your future and your destiny. All the projects that currently exist in the world to create AI will eventually merge into One, like drops of water.

I have some BTC at Coinbase Pro. Half of it is available for withdrawal now, and half will become available in 2 days. I'm catching a flight tomorrow and have a desire to get it on my hw wallet before leaving (not taking wallet with me). That said, I'm very averse to paying fees, or at least more fees than is necessary.

My options are:
1) Transfer 1 now and transfer the 2nd later.

2) wait 2 days and transfer both in the same transaction.

Assuming network conditions are identical (I know they aren't in real life), are both options the same in terms of network fees or is one more efficient? I'm guessing a single, larger, transfer would be more efficient in terms of network fees but I'm not certain and that's why I ask.

kj28uf,QuantumCoupling,Potential XRP Vulnerabilities?," This is not FUD but a genuine question...

If anyone can become an XRP validator, why couldn’t a malicious entity create enough unique validators to gain a 99% majority of the network? David Schwartz seems to have said it isn’t possible in this video -- [https://youtu.be/GyNXedeCyNg?t=234](https://youtu.be/GyNXedeCyNg?t=234) (time 3:54) -- but I don’t really understand why. What does this mean ""The process in which they become nodes is moderated by human beings"" and how does that stop malicious entities from creating multiple validator nodes?  
Example: If there are 10 “trusted” validators that are all connected by their UNLs. A bad actor comes in and creates 1000 new unique validators where they are all on each other's UNL. There would be a total of 1010 validators and the bad actor would control 99% of the validators. The connectivity of the network would be above 90%, avoiding this problem “In the worst case, less than about 90% overlap could cause some participants to diverge from each other.” ([https://xrpl.org/consensus-protections.html](https://xrpl.org/consensus-protections.html)). The bad actor would also have a more than 80% majority vote when determining what goes into the next ledger during consensus.

(1) Couldn’t they block all transactions from particular addresses since the code is open source by manipulating it, even though this is a violation of the rules each validator is supposed to process (if you vote no to a certain transaction in ledger X you should vote yes to include it in ledger X+1) -- [https://youtu.be/-5\_hUgrGM\_k?t=785](https://youtu.be/-5_hUgrGM_k?t=785) (time 13:05)? Or any other invariant checking?

(2) Even if they couldn’t manipulate the code, if they controlled 99% could they propose malicious amendments to the network? You need two weeks for amendments to be passed ([https://ripple.com/insights/amendments-ensuring-sensible-evolution-of-the-xrp-ledger/](https://ripple.com/insights/amendments-ensuring-sensible-evolution-of-the-xrp-ledger/)) so if a bad actor did this then couldn’t the “good” actors just create enough so that the amendment wouldn’t hold a majority for the required two weeks? Or they create enough so it halts the network by making it so the bad actor controls 20-80% of the total network and there are two disjoint sub networks? Am I missing something here?  
(3) Are there any attack-vectors/vulnerabilities that I am missing that you have thought of when it comes to the factor that anyone can be a validator?",1608760614,1,1

Long-time listener, first-time caller. I've been consuming a lot of information about Bitcoin since March of this year while stacking as much as possible along the way. I decided to gift my closest friends $100 in BTC each in hopes that it either sparks an interest in Bitcoin or helps them out financially down the road. It is a win-win in my book.   


I decided to use OpenDimes as a means to gift the BTC per a suggestion from a long time HODLer that woke me up to Bitcoin. (Side thought: I'm not so sure this was the most intuitive approach to sharing the concept of Bitcoin with noobs. Share your thoughts/alternatives on that, please.)   


Regardless, I bought the OpenDimes and will definitely use them but I now want to include a clear, concise booklet that explains all of Bitcoins potentials vs fiat, gold, etc while offering a few other relevant factoids about Bitcoin in general. Not trying to come off or sound like one of those eccentrics on street corners with a megaphone preaching about God and repenting for one's sins while handing out little information booklets about how masturbation is bad and whatnot. It's not bad, right?

I don't completely understand it, but I'm not sure the exact details matter.

Is GBTC's price in any way tied to bitcoin's price other than just the convention of people not wanting to buy at too much of a premium or sell at too much of a discount? Seems quite speculative? My understanding is that with a regular stock, you have a board of directors who can decide to pay investors dividends, but I'm not sure any mechanism exists to tie GBTC's price to its fundamental/NAV price. Maybe there are mechanisms as mentioned in the following paragraphs?

From what I have read, my impression is that GBTC will offer more shares occasionally to try to reduce the premium that GBTC is trading at above its NAV price. Is this true? That sounds like it screws over people who are invested in GBTC before the shares are issued / people who bought GBTC at a premium. Is this true? Why would GBTC do this? It makes GBTC seem like a less favourable buy to me than it already would be if buying at a premium, because premiums already make it such that people don't want to buy just based on the principle/psychology of it, and now there is also a risk that your investment will get diluted if you buy at a premium. 

How does GBTC pay for the bitcoins it buys? Strictly from offering new shares? I don't see how else GBTC can make money to buy more bitcoins. What's even the point of GBTC buying more bitcoins? Just to reduce the premium that GBTC is trading at?

Does GBTC ever sell bitcoins? Why would they do this? I suppose they could use the cash proceeds to buy back their own shares to reduce any discount that GBTC is trading at.

Am I even thinking about any of this correctly?",1608752341,6,1

It all started with a YouTube recommendation back in December 2017. I've never heard of  Bitcoin before the last bullrun. Ironically, the video recommendation that first introduced me to Bitcoin was extremely critical and all comments advised people to stay away from it.  

But the pizza story was so fascinating that I decided to do more reading, I went down the rabbit hole ever since. After 6 months of extensive research that began with the whitepaper.  I made up my mind that this is the internet 2.0 and I'm back in the 90s with all the opportunities that era had.  I went in, and I went in BIG. I first threw my life savings ($53,000) in August 2018. I held strong for two years and in May 2020, I  decided to sell my apartment and threw 60% (another $58,000) and use the rest to pay off my debts. 

I put every penny I had ($112,000) into Bitcoin and as of 19th of December 2020, I became a millionaire in my own currency. Had you told me 3 years ago I would make that much money too young, I would probably tell you to fork off.

Due to the holidays I contacted them and causally mentioned the bitcoin price.           

I told them to open there wallet and look at todays value. They all went up 20-40x.  One person sent me a screenshot, it showed the value of when they originally received it, $37.66, and the value currently which is $1,764.70.            

The part that blew my mind despite all of them having a much greater value than original( making substantial profit), NONE where interested.  They acted like it's no big deal. They had absolutely no interest in investing more (even though they easily can, they aren't homeless, etc...)  Even when I mentioned they can have bitcoin in their RRSP (kinda like a 401k in US) their eyes got a little bigger, then back to same size.                


So these people saw with their own eyes and money and are still not interested.

kk4o2c,goodguy291,"Christmas 2021 Price Prediction - $100,000 (here is my analysis)","I've become an avid follower of Bitcoin over the last year, but I haven't invested much so far.   There is just no precedent for how to evaluate this asset, and I have become risk averse as I get older (and as my net worth increases).    But I'm intrigued for sure, and have started a small position in GBTC.   

From my experience with other new investments, we know that the price increases a lot in the beginning, but as the asset matures, the rate of climb will slow.   

We also know that trees don't grow to the sky, which means this will get to a point where it has to level off.   I've seen predictions up to $1 million per BTC (at which point I assume we'd be trading Satoshi's), but the fact is, no one knows where this will go.  

Based on the following history, however, it does look like there is some pattern to the increases, and it looks like the leveling is already happening, albeit still at high rates (note that I saw this chart on another site - no attribution was given, and therefore I can't give attribution, but the numbers appear accurate):  

Bitcoin’s price on Christmas Day:

2011: $4.12

2012: $13.22

2013: $660

2014: $327

2015: $452

2016: $968

2017: $14,068

2018: $3,798

2019: $7,145

2020:$24,500

2021:????? 

This reminds me of one of those ""what is the next number in the series"" math problems that we used to get in high school.   The price does seem to move up and down with some consistency, probably partially due to the effect of the halvenings.    

Here is what I see since 2011 - up for three years, then a crash.   

Then up for three more years, then a crash.  

We are currently in year two of the current cycle, which means we would have a substantial increase in 2021, followed by a crash in 2022.   

The first increase in the year before the crash was a factor of roughly 49x (from $13.22 to $660). 

The second increase in the year before the crash was a factor of roughly 14x (from $968 to $14,068).   

This is a reduction in the increase of 3.5, from the first 49x reduction.  

If the pattern holds, and assuming the third increase before the crash would be in 2021, the increase should be a factor of roughly 4x (14 divided by 3.5), such that the price would increase from $24,500 to just under $100,000. 

I know the pattern doesn't hold for the other years, and I know that we are assuming here that something catastrophic doesn't happen (adverse regulatory action, hack, etc.).  But if this pattern holds, we are looking at $100k per BTC by this time next year.",1608925067,11,1

 [https://www.masyahmi.com/investment/long-ethereum-eth-short-bitcoin-btc](https://www.masyahmi.com/investment/long-ethereum-eth-short-bitcoin-btc)

In a world where there are no certainties and only probabilities, it is essential for one to look at a bearish case especially when they are bullish.

My stand: I am Bullish on Ethereum (But have not purchase any but will soon), Bearish on Bitcoin (Probably will not short it) and Bullish on Precious Metals (All of my portfolio is currently in here (Precious metals does not mean gold)).

It does feel weird to say I am Bullish on Ethereum and Bearish on Bitcoin, but let’s get into this shit.

As the China Central Bank Digital Currency (CCBDC) being the first to roll out its own digital wallet and more Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) that will likely follow, it presents a probable bearish case for Bitcoin.

I would like to talk about pre-bitcoin first before I get into the bearish case for bitcoin, let us talk about the irrationality of humans. Throughout history, we have seen governments fucking over their citizens. Yet most people don’t have any gold as a hedge against the financial system. This is partly due to the lack of financial literacy but also the belief that the financial system will protect them.

Let us now get into the bearish case for bitcoin, 

If the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) do what they will probably do which is to give Free(fake) money to people, it can result in 2 situations:

1.       The Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) can get more people used to the idea of a digital wallet which makes bitcoin as an easier selection towards a hedge against the financial system than gold. 

As Quantitative Easing \[Counterfeiting(QE)\] continues, more people distrust the financial system which then makes bitcoin a more probable selection of asset than gold. 

Personally, I believe gold is a better asset as preservation of capital, but bitcoin is better as growth of capital. 

Despite this, the reason I think if the first situation occurs, (let say I am right) the truth does not matter, what people perceived is the truth does. 

Hence, bitcoin has a higher probability of outperforming gold partly due to the volatility and mainly due to what I just wrote about.

2.       The Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) prints so much money that people believe the financial system is safe, in which increases the probability of someone not owning bitcoin and instead using the underlying Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). 

This will result in loss in the perception of the importance in hedging against the financial system.

The reason I am bullish on Ethereum is due to the technological features such as Smart Contracts and many more which I believe can increase its reliance on the commercial usage than being perceived as a store of value. Its kinda like silver, in terms of it being priced from variables such as industrial usage and store of value.",1608921453,1,1

Bitcoin (and crypto in general) stands poised to liberate us from the bonds of worldly authority in a major way. Here is an interpretation from Revelation which indicates several correlations between New Jerusalem and Bitcoin ([learn how it works](https://www.upfolio.com/ultimate-bitcoin-guide)):

&gt;Revelation 21  
15 The angel who spoke to me had a gold measuring stick to measure the city and its gates and its walls. 16 The city was **shaped like a cube**, because it was just as high as it was wide. *\[\[Cube has equal sides; Bitcoin treats everyone equally\]\]*  
the city was made of **pure gold, clear as crystal.** *\[\[Bitcoin is digital gold and completely transparent\]\]*  
22 **I did not see a temple there.** The Lord God All-Powerful and the Lamb were its temple. *\[\[Bitcoin is independent of factions and belief systems\]\]* 23 And the city did not need the sun or the moon. *\[\[Bitcoin doesn't need regulations or enforcement\]\]* The glory of God was shining on it, and the Lamb was its light.  
24 **Nations will walk by the light of that city, and kings will bring their riches there.** *\[\[We are just now starting to see how major institutions are investing large amounts into Bitcoin, and it may become the world's new reserve currency\]\]* 25 Its **gates are always open** *\[\[Anyone may use Bitcoin without fear of being shut out by a bank or govt\]\]* during the day, and **night never comes**. *\[\[Bitcoin is resistant to many of the factors which can render a currency worthless and crash an economy (see Zimbabwe or Venezuela)\]\]* 26 The glorious treasures of nations will be brought into the city. 27 But **nothing unworthy will be allowed to enter.** **No one who is dirty-minded or who tells lies will be there.** *\[\[Bitcoin provides proof so there is no fraud and need to trust banks and govts\]\]* Only those whose names are written in the **Lamb’s book of life** *\[\[Bitcoin's public transaction history ledger\]\]* will be in the city.",1608918324,4,1

I do have a sliver of Bitcoin (.06) and with all the hype, it seems right now is a good time to buy more. I also have 2.3 Ethereum.  

I have a new construction house, a roommate that pays more than half the mortgage, no kids, no ex-wife.  Income has been about $110k per year.

kk1gmn,roymizz,Thank you,"Hello all just wanted to share. First thank you to this community I’ve learned so much from reading posts. I’m a young farmer in the Midwest, I’m sure that theirs not many of us here lol. I first heard of Bitcoin in 2014 but didn’t think much of it. At that time I had over leveraged my self with the local bank buying cattle, machinery and other farm inputs. The night I got married at 26 y/o I had to tell my wife you are now in debt $600,000+. Long story, shortly after that the farming markets across the board had tanked and I was forced to sell almost all I had to just pay on my loans. I was defeated so I did the only thing I’ve ever done and worked my ass off 3 or 4 jobs at a time. I installed fiber optic internet cables. General Electrician and ran heavy equipment for other people for fractions of the money I was making when I was “self employed” all at the same time continuing to work on the family farm. This is the first year our money has been somewhat stable. Came back to reading about Bitcoin in February of this year and started DCA. Thanks to this community for all the advice. I’m not the most tech savvy person but was able to guide my self where I feel confident in my Bitcoin decisions, because of all your help and advice, this is a valuable community to people like me.",1608912972,21,1

kk0ivg,VisionGuard,A Jaundiced View at your Investment Options as a Millenial/GenZ'er,"I made this comment in another thread, but I've gotten numerous DM's and a comment asking me to make it its own free-standing post, so Merry Christmas, it's reproduced below.

Also, please feel free to be critical down below if you wish.  Attack the premises, make your own conclusions, I don't mind.  This my view, on balance given the data.

I am a late 30's, you could assert ""older millenial"" who is a professional.  I've been in BTC in earnest since around 2015/2016.  I made small buys initially, and escalated as I made more and more thereafter.

I will outright state that this is the *only* real asset that you younger folks have that can afford you the type of exponential pseudo de-risked relatively predictable gains that exists anymore. Why? Bear with me.

Let's go through your options relative to every generation before.

1.) Cash and Cash Equivalents - we're printing money at a rate that is literally unprecedented. Discussed ad infinitum here, but sufficing to say, we've printed something like 25-33 percent of all dollars in circulation in history in the last year. Grandma and Mom never faced QE/MMT. You do. Let's see how long we can last without inflation starting to kick in in earnest for everything below. [I'll give it like um 3 seconds.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/many-americans-used-part-of-their-coronavirus-stimulus-check-to-trade-stocks.html)

2.) Stocks/Equities - when your dad started earning and investing (and by ""dad"", I'll say boomer), the P/E ratio was at its second lowest in history, of about 7 (circa 1978-82). [Go look it up.](https://www.macrotrends.net/2577/sp-500-pe-ratio-price-to-earnings-chart) That means that for any given company, he basically only had to pay 6-7 times whatever it earned. What about you? Well, not only are you currently at a ratio of like 35 (which means that you're paying 5x more than dad for the same fundamentals), you're supposed to accept that that's *totally awesome* because 10 years prior, it was the **highest ever** at 122. That's right, you were being asked when some of you started your jobs to invest in the same stock but 20 times more expensive than dad, and now that it's ""just 5 times more expensive"", you should consider that a deal. Uh, sure.

3.) Bonds - well, if not stocks, then what about bonds? When mama started her trek into the world of fixed income, if she passed on the lowest PE ratio ever (since, you know, she didn't want to overpay or something), she could just go grab a bond and earn SIXTEEN PERCENT of a safe return. Don't believe me? [Go look it up.](https://advisor.visualcapitalist.com/us-interest-rates/) In other words, she could literally just put 10K in the bank, and come next year, she's got 1600 more. People go bananas when you suggest that Bitcoin could go up 20 percent a year, but mama could get it basically FOR FREE. Oh, and if that wasn't enough (because hell, why would it be for the blessed generation), the fed slowly cut rates over time as you can see on that graph. Why does that matter? Because if she actually DID have some bonds, each year they cut rates, the existing bonds she had could be sold for a profit since, you know, they were from last year and are giving back 16 percent instead of like 15. And they did this all the way for 30 years so mama and her chicas could keep doing this over and over again. Well, how about you? See down at the weee corner of the graphic? Where it says ""all time low""? Yeah, that's you. You put something in bonds, you get 0.5%, possibly ZERO if the Chairman of the Fed is to be believed. But maybe you get some and the fed cuts just like for mama, so the bonds you have can make some money, right? Oh wait, going BELOW ZERO means that anyone buying bonds is *literally losing money buying them* \- that is, a rate of minus 0.5 percent means I buy a bond for 10000 dollars and each year they *take away 50 dollars*. Who tf would do that? Yeah, that's right, barely anyone except our strange Euro brethren - and it ain't havin the effect it had for mama - so no that isn't an option.

Edit:  A commenter argued that while the *nominal rate* was 16 percent in 1981, the *inflation adjusted rate* was much less.  Yes, that's true.  But we don't do *inflation adjust rates* for literally any other asset, particularly BTC - in fact, we literally argue that inflation is a major reason *why BTC goes up* in USD.  In addition, our notion of inflation being the CPI - and thus without the major contributions of healthcare, education, and housing which have literally been the things that have blown up in the last 30 years - is *highly highly misleading*.  I strongly suspect that with a more modern view of inflation - that is, readjusted for healthcare, education, and housing increases - our *inflation adjusted return* on 0.5% bonds is *even worse* than I'm stating relative to mama.

4.) Real Estate - my favorite. Everyone's favorite. ""They're not making any more of it"" - err, except for that massive high rise that's blocking my view of the nice park that just got built and that one over there, and that one too. Regardless, I'll admit that *certain markets* might be less overvalued, buuuut, [let's go to the graph again, shall we](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USSTHPI)? Since this is a repeating pattern, go look at papa's opportunity on the waaaay left over there, and then go look at your opportunity on the waaay right. It's almost like yet again, you're paying 4x more than papa. To be fair, that's a better deal than equities or bonds, but if you think that's a legitimate deal, I've got a baseball card here that I've just jacked up the price 3x for no particular reason that you should buy. Seriously. It's a steal, young millenial - just pay me in BTC, natch.

Edit:  An astute commenter mentioned that it's *land* that isn't being made anymore - yeah I know, but in practical terms, most people who argue its *land* that isn't made anymore will turn around and then offer you to buy *that* *condo over there.*  And there's no doubt that housing prices have risen on average over the last 30 years.  I strongly suspect land prices on average have as well, but I'm willing to look at counter data.

5.) Gold - aight, I'm not going to argue too hard against Gold. Well, except a little. Why? Well, [let's go to the graphs again](https://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart), because that's how we should roll. So yeah, Grandpa annihilates us on this metric (you're paying 5x his rate), but then again, dude went through WWII and was eating grass while dodging the Nazis in Caen or whatever it's called, so I'll cut him some slack. But mama? Wait, even SHE got a goddamn dip (see that 1980-1982 move). Admittedly she'd have had to ""endure a bear market"" but notice how just around the time YOU started making some cheese, you're already paying 1.1 to now 2x whatever it is they could have gotten. Again, this is better than everything else we've read, but it's still overvalued *in relative terms, particularly if you have BTC as an option.*

6.) Art/Fine Wine/Whiskey - Masterworks aside, if you've got enough to yolo into Picassos at Sotheby's, wtf are you doing here anyway? And if it's Wine or Whiskey, why aren't you sharing ffs? Drink that shit. I'll help.

7.) Bitcoin - clearly the best option. It's undervalued, misunderstood by everyone else, is basically a monetary base, and here's the massive kicker - the biggest guys literally CANNOT get in in earnest without spiking the price. ""Accredited investors"" can't just in aggregate airmail in a billion dollars without being fearful that the spot price will increase and they'll have to pay through the nose. Indeed, they literally can only get in once she gets to a market cap of trillions. However, the little guy? You? You don't move the price with your daily $1.50 ""no, ffs, I didn't drink a latte or eat avocado toast, you stereotyping jackasses, I put it in the one place that I have that you can't control with your shitty financial tomfoolery"" buys. She's literally designed to have small buys that, because she can compound exponentially, become big buys that cannot be diluted out because the Fed decided the Boomers needed one more bailout.

Oh, and one final demonstration of thievery - here's [your wages versus your productivity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/10/03/us-wages-have-been-rising-faster-than-productivity-for-decades/?sh=7413bb7e7342) (and to an astute commenter below, yes, I've intentionally linked an article that disagrees with me to provide balance *and to make sure someone is actually looking at the graphs* \- [here's a link that gets you to the original source](https://www.google.com/search?q=EPI+wages+versus+productivity&amp;oq=EPI+wages+versus+productivity&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i22i29i30.3821j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)). You're the generation that gets paid *the least* for producing *the most*. In (modern) history. So even with all of the above? You have less to put away.

I desperately try to get young people in my field to put **something** into Bitcoin every day, every week, every month, or hell, just freaking ONCE. Because it's the only option you guys have left.

But it's the option of a lifetime.",1608909320,81,1

I have a few Ledger hardware wallets (I'm a bit on the paranoid side) to store my crypto, but a lot of my friends and family are now interested in buying Bitcoin as well.

So I've been doing research into what would be easiest for someone starting out. I've heard a lot of good things about BRD Wallet (Breadwallet) and I even have one myself, but I just wanted more opinions from you guys on the easiest way to start getting into bitcoin. My main priority here is ease of use, followed very closely by security.

My primary concern about getting friends and family members into bitcoin is that they don't end up securing their assets as best they can, which might end up in them losing bitcoin and I definitely don't want to take any blame for me suggesting bitcoin to aunt Trudy only for her to go and lose it a month later and have the family take the blame out on me.

kkgbwi,Armenelos12,"Ponzi scheme or Audit Crypto.com, BlockFi, Celsius","I watched friends invest in Bitcoinnect for over a year and constantly said it was likely a ponzi. It was one of the most obvious ones I have ever seen. However, not all are obvious. For example, Bernie Madoff ran one for decades after a very reputable carrier working for Nasdaq etc. The returns he faked were not outrageous, around 10% a year. Ponzi's can vary dramatically. 

I am not worried about the referral codes etc. I am worried because these programs pay interest rates that are way above market interest rates on deposits, but pretty normal on loans. To the best of my knowledge none of these companies has provided a third party audit that actually shows how much they have they are paying out on deposits compared to how much they are receiving in loan interest. The closest thing I have found is a ""audit"" of Celsius by Chainalysis showing how much Bitcoin was at certain wallets. That doesn't show if they are actually able to pay out depositors with the money they are collecting from lenders. 

That doesn't help me feel better and it shouldn't help you feel better. I want a real audit! These companies could certainly be making plenty of money from lenders to where they are able to cover interest to depositors. I just would like to see some proof. Bitcoin has had average annual returns over 100%, and with nothing I would consider proof it isn't a ponzi I don't feel comfortable risking that for another 6%. 

That being said I would love to earn another 6% so if anyone knows of some good audits that would be great.

PS: Many Ponzi schemes register with local state and federal agencies this doesn't prove it is legit. Many Ponzi schemes do have leaders that have had previously successful careers.",1608977391,7,1

kkfpwf,Alive-Lecture-7408,A government like USA or China can easily destroy Bitcoin with a 51 attack. Here is the scenario:,"As Bitcoin and decentralized finance rises in popularity, goverment worry more and more about it. There is a big danger that a few people talk about. If a government (especially large ones like USA and China) decides to destroy Bitcoin at all cost, they can easily do a 51 attack and nothing can stop them.

Let's say China government decided to destroy Bitcoin. 

\-According to a source, it'd cost $3 billion to buy enough ASIC machines for an 51 attack. This is a funny amount for a government. And China, with its authoritarian regime and abundant land &amp; electronics &amp; power, can easily produce enough mining machines in government factories.

\- They secretly create a super big mining farm, with more hashrate then current entire hashrate, they can use government sponsored construction and energy which makes things easier.

\- They turn on the mining rig. Now they control more than 50+ % of the Bitcoin hashrate. They can do all malicious things of 51 attacking, such as double spending.

\- They don't have to care about profit from the double spent Bitcoins they're generating. All they care is destroying Bitcoin, which has became a huge concern for governments at the moment. 

\- They will keep destroying the network as much as they can with the never ending 51 attack. 

\- This will be huge earthquake Bitcoin, with a potential 90% price drop in days. All other cryptocurrencies will be wrecked as well. Everyone will lose confidence to cryptos and panic sell ASAP.

\- As Bitcoin gets wrecked, it won't be profitable to continue mining for other miners around the world. Legit miners will turn off their rigs and the legit hashrate will drop. This makes it even easier for China to maintain the 51 attack.

This will end up in a disaster for Bitcoin and all cryptocurrenies with an unbelivable loss in value and confidence. Even after the attack, nothing will be the same. People will never trust Bitcoin again as the same attack can happen at anytime.

kkfb7o,llewsor,bitcoin and the law of thermodynamics,"is it a coincidence that the price action of bitcoin is accelerating with the amount of money printing? 

it seems to be reflecting the analogy that michael saylor discussed that bitcoin obeys the laws of thermodynamics and is a “pure closed system” with no energy leakage (inflation). in the universe, energy can’t be created or destroyed, it must flow somewhere else. value is the same: value can’t be created or destroyed it must flow somewhere else.

concerning the laws of thermodynamics, the fiat system leaks energy (value) in the form of inflation - and that energy (inflation) leakage flows into assets where the elite experience an increase in wealth in form of prices of real estate, rare art, stocks and bonds going up.

consequently your purchasing power (energy/value) decreases. so the flow of value/energy is flowing from the poor to the rich. 

so due to the astronomical money printing and low interest rates set by central banks, the amount of fiat liquidity has swelled and is flooding the markets in a tsunami of inflation (leaking energy).

all of that energy (inflated leaking value) needs to flow somewhere and bitcoin is sucking it all in when it traditionally went to other safe haven assets like real estate, rare art, stocks and bonds. 

bitcoin is like a black hole sucking up the flood of fiat and leaking value (inflation). but the miraculous part is that bitcoin then converts that energy/value into a cryptographically scarce number behind a wall of miner energy (proof of work).

bitcoin is the first pure closed system humanity has ever achieved, meaning that the increase in price is due to bitcoin absorbing all of the leaking energy (inflation) and then containing it in a closed system that won’t leak that energy (value) because that energy (value) is now cryptographically scarce.

this is how the flow of value is now more fair because if you participate in bitcoin, you don’t experience energy leakage (loss in value). the value/energy stays in the system amongst those who participate and does not leak/flow outside of the system to the benefit of another group. 

tldr: energy can’t be created or destroyed. it must flow somewhere else. value can’t be created or destroyed and must also flow somewhere else. the fiat system leaks energy/value through inflation and that value flows somewhere else like real estate, rare art, stocks and bonds. bitcoin doesn’t leak energy/value - in fact it can absorb excess energy like hyper inflation of an economy and then turn that excess energy/value into a cryptographically scarce number and secure that number/value/energy behind a wall of miners (proof of work).",1608971108,14,1

kkeyeq,papagel75,My philosophical concerns around Bitcoin,"First of all let me say that I believe Bitcoin to be the only available hedge against incapable governments and overprinting of money. It is a better gold in an era where hard assets will start over performing against fiat, bonds, stock or real estate. I believe that demand will get the price of one coin to $1M. It will be a bumpy road but it is mostly unavoidable. 

Said that I have some philosophical concerns that I would like to share:

- I don’t see the democratization of money happening. There is a process of wealth transfer between old money to a new generation of millionaires. This is obviously the biggest opportunity in our lifetime but at the end of the day, most people will still have little access to this asset. Banking the unbanked is further than ever. 

- For the Bitcoin to achieve its purpose, the society as we know it will have to radically transform. This can mean enormous tragedy for the masses like famine, war or skyrocketed unemployment. Again, I don’t see how this can bring good to most of the people except the few thousand early adopters. 

- Insitutional money is entering the game too early. The price may skyrocket but not enough people had the chance to enter the bitcoin world with a hard conviction in fundamentals. The transfer of wealth may be incomplete and we may end-up with the same rulers.",1608968928,13,1

kkcl46,Schneiderg10,Realistic expectations for BTC?,"I’ve recently gotten into BTC. I plan to hold my BTC for the next 5 years. I bought in when it was 23K last week and I’ve become very bullish on where it can go. But I’m starting to wonder when do my expectations become unrealistic? 
I’ve been sifting through articles and predictions online and while I’d love to believe this can reach 100K-300K by 2021, I am skeptical it can reach those heights so fast. 
I understand bitcoin in the first decade has reached astronomical heights that saw it multiply in shorts periods of time. And everyone’s models and projections of BTC use past performance and halving cycles as a model for future performance. But I can’t help to imagine, as new ATHs start to reach 30K, 40K, 50K, etc there will be much more resistance than seen during early days. I’m not saying bitcoin can’t reach these heights, but I think it will take longer than a year to reach 300K.",1608957255,18,1

kje5f8,TheIceMenAreBack,11 Facts about Bitcoin. Could we see it changing hands for more than $100K within a year?," 

1. Bitcoin creator, [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#:~:text=Satoshi%20Nakamoto%20is%20the%20name,devised%20the%20first%20blockchain%20database.), is still a mystery figure. Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the person who designed bitcoin but there’s still doubt about the real identity. Over the years, many people have been linked with the same, including Nick Szabo, Dorian Nakamoto, Hal Finney, Craig Steven Wright, and others. Some people consider Nakamoto might be a team of people. As of May 2017, Nakamoto is believed to own about 1 million bitcoins with a worth of more than $20 billion.
2. Bitcoins are limited in number. You might’ve heard about bitcoin mining, the process using which bitcoins are generated digitally. So, does this mean there could be an infinite number of bitcoins? That’s not the case. A pre-defined schedule has limited the number of bitcoins. They are slowly approaching a total of 21 million and the mining process is getting harder with each passing day.
3. It’s impossible to know the sender/receiver details. Bitcoin addresses are a long string of 34 alphanumeric characters. Using that address, it’s impossible to tell the recipient. Probably, this is the reason why most of the illegal transactions are carried out using bitcoins. To protect privacy even further, most wallet programs assign the users a portfolio ID, which is also used as a username.
4. Pizza was the first thing (good) purchased using bitcoin after the first bitcoin transaction took place between Satoshi and Hal Finney in 2009, the first recorded purchase was made for buying pizza worth $25. To do so, 10,000 bitcoins were spent.
5. Bitcoin network is much powerful than supercomputers according to the experts, Bitcoin networks has a computing power of 2,046,364 Pflop/s. This is my personal favorite fact about bitcoin. If you go ahead and combine the computing power of the 500 most powerful supercomputers, you’ll get a combined fever of 274 Pflop/s.
6. Bitcoin has been sent into [outer space](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.coindesk.com/a-bitcoin-wallet-is-orbiting-the-earth-at-five-miles-per-second%3famp=1). In 2016, Genesis Mining, a bitcoin cloud mining provider, set bitcoin to space. This was done using a 3D bitcoin model and a bitcoin paper wallet, which were tied to a weather balloon. The whole journey was recorded using a GoPro focused on the model and wallet. Once the weather balloon reached a height of 20 kilometers, the ground team made the transaction to a paper wallet. Another transfer was made to the wallet once it achieved the maximum possible altitude of 34 km.
7. A bitcoin transfer is an irreversible transaction of bitcoin. However, against popular sentiment, bitcoins are only used for less than 1% of the world's time (source: NY Times).
8. The FBI has one of the world’s largest bitcoin wallets. When the FBI [shut down](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/02/alleged-silk-road-website-founder-arrested-bitcoin) the operations of the Silk Road, it also seized the owner’s assets. In that process, the FBI also became one of the world’s wealthiest bitcoin owners, A report from the Wired magazine claims that the FBI controls as much as $120 million.
9. Losing a bitcoin wallet means losing those bitcoins just like you save your money in your online bank accounts, your bitcoins are saved in a bitcoin wallet. It’s a highly secure storage wallet. But, if you lose it, your bitcoins are lost forever. It’s also impossible for any person to use your bitcoins from your wallet until you give it to them. Also, if you have a bitcoin address, you can see the number of bitcoins the owner has.
10. The Blockchain has an alternative to all traditional platforms. For example, you can gamble via Bitcoins on [EarnBet](https://guest.link/WZ7)\-an online licensed decentralized casino and require NO KYC in the process. Its house edge is transparent and can be verified via the Blockchain.
11. Bitcoin is highly volatile. Since its launch, in past, one-decade bitcoin has become one of the most important phenomenon in the digital world. Its price has touched thousands of dollars. However, the price keeps fluctuating and it remains volatile. Predictions have also been made that bitcoin might fall in the future if it follows the current path. This is because a small number of people, about 10, control the majority of bitcoin. This defeats the entire decentralized nature of the currency.",1608810478,2,1

But Ripple's problem is far from simple.

The SEC emphasized that Ripple sold XRP on the secondary market without registering for the issuance of securities, which violated the Securities Law.

What investors are more concerned about is that Ripple transfers the risk to investors for profit by creating information asymmetry.

But in any case, Ripple's official behavior is a crime——

If I’m not mistaken as well, they offer some good APY on lending, but what are the average rate of returns, because from my understanding they have fluctuated a good amount over recent years?

Is CDC still beneficial for someone who doesn’t make frequent purchases with card? Would using something like Binance be more beneficial, or does Crypto.com overrule Binance in every aspect?

Finally, what is the security like with CDC? I have tried to register an account but they are asking for my ID verification, and I’d like to hold off on that until I’m 100%.

kjchot,Castlehill650,That one time in Drug Rehab.,"Lets start from the beginning. It's 2011....

I'm fresh out of high school. I'm a half nerd/half party-every-day type. A closet nerd of sorts. I loved gaming, I loved scripting, mapmaking in CS: Source, etc. But the main takeaway is that I loved experimenting with drugs and hitting up every party, wherever it is. Drugs, alcohol, the whole shebang. To make things short, I start hearing of this one website called ""Silkroad"". I learn about Tor, Onion, etc. 

This is exciting. This is new. None of my friends have any clue about this. I can get ANYTHING IMAGINABLE. Even my 60 year old hippie friend I jammed with (guitar) all the time was impressed. THIS is my introduction to Bitcoin.

To me, this ""Magic Internet Money"" didn't make any sense. But it didn't have to, because it got me from point A to point B. Physical currency to drugs at my door. However as time went by, my curiosity and knowledge of Crypto and Block Chain naturally develops more and more. But I don't exactly see it as an investment, YET. Im 18-20 years old for christ sake, Im trying to party.

So the years go by. The drug use starts to take its toll. I am addicted and physically dependent on opiates. I have bought countless BTC, typically using PayPal via a website which allowed one to purchase ""Linden Dollars"" (a currency for this video game called Second Life), and convert it to BTC instantly. BTC was worth around $5-$20 if I remember correctly. Later down the road I start using Coinbase for the few purchases I make online because my life was taking a turn for the worse. The price of BTC is gradually increasing into the hundreds, but I don't really take much notice.

By the time 2015 rolls around, my life is a mess. I am purchasing heroin and pills from the hood, cold copping. Meeting sketchy characters, becoming one of those characters. Getting arrested, going to jail, etc. I do however realize that BTC is at around $300!!! As I said earlier, I didn't conduct many purchases using BTC during this time, but at this point in time I have at least dozens (maybe 20?, 30?) of BTC purchased over the long run, with at least 5 BTC from Coinbase and the vast majority being the Linden Dollar -&gt; BTC route from the earlier days.

**It's now the end of 2015. I made the decision to get clean once and for all after my final arrest and check myself into rehab.** 

It's been a year now in rehab, and I'm doing great. Working out every day, not relapsing, etc. Going to groups and discussing this and that with my fellow addicts in recovery I have been living with for a year. People from all walks of life. In the daily groups, we discuss everything from our childhood to the crimes we committed... Everything from the mundane crimes, all the way to  gang related violence. And of course, my nerdy ass speaking about Bitcoin, Silkroad, piquing peoples curiosity on the topic, as they had no idea what it was. I live with these people for christ sake, we learn just about everything about one another.

**So one night, one of my buddies in rehab comes running down the hallway yelling my name over and over. He says ""come to the dining room! You gotta see this!"", followed by me walking in on my fellow addicts watching the news and eating dinner as they typically do.** 

**""BITCOIN REACHES $20,000."".** 

I was shocked. I was appalled. I couldn't believe it. I started visibly shaking. Immediately, I go into my room and break out my phone which I wasn't supposed to have and log into the wifi network, the credentials of which I was not supposed to have (I didn't have data, it was just a crappy smart phone from Walgreens).

I immediately log into Coinbase, hoping that MAYBE I have a fraction of a bitcoin left out of the 20-30 I have bought over the years.....

Nothing... Nada. In fact, I think it said that I owe THEM a tiny fraction (virtually noting) via past fees....

It felt like the biggest financial blunder of my life. A reddit post today just reminded me of this. I had to  talk about it.....",1608802012,14,1

I've been using Binance for a while (previously on Coinbase) and so far have been very happy.  I've recently made a withdrawal from Binance to another wallet.  Binance stated (when choosing the BTC network) that the fee was 0.0005 BTC - which is approximately £8.50.

However when I've checked the received transaction the Fee is stated much higher, and this amounts to £72 !!!

Can anyone explain why I've paid such a huge fee ?  Why Binance stated £8.50, but the real fee is FAR higher ?  And finally, how could I have seen the real fee ?  I never had this issue on Coinbase, they told me a fee and that's what I paid (and it was always MUCH lower).

I would never have moved the BTC had I realised the fee would be so stupidly high.

kkx3zm,RogueR1,Mexico 2nd richest man buys BTC,"
 Ricardo Salinas Pliego, chairman at
 conglomerate Grupo Salinas and Mexico's
 second richest man, has revealed to
 Cointelegraph in an interview that he bought his
 first Bitcoin in 2013, when it was worth around
 $200. That, according to the billionaire, was his
 ""best investment ever"".

 After holding it all the way until its 2017 highs,
 he sold all his positions at $17,000 and bought it
 again later at a cheaper price.

 ""We always return to the scene ofthe crime"", he
 joked.

 Now Salinas holds around 10% of his liquid
 portfolio in BTC and doesn't plan to sell any of it
 any time soon.

 years"", he said.",1609043223,1,1

Well, I have 100k in bitcoins now, and it's taking me a while to process this. I don't even know what I am going to spend it on in the future, or even what to do with all this money. I realized (again) that a lot of what I want in life can't really be bought, they can only be worked towards (I can only say this since my basic needs are met). BTC can also possibly go back down again as well, so it's hard to really internalize that I have 100k.

Not all of us are here just for money alone, but I have a feeling this time will be different. Even at the end of this cycles bull run, I would not expect a 3 year winter. It’s maturing and evolving gaining new traction along the way. We may climb to $200k, we may drop to $5k, but for some people that are looking at it for the underlying value - the value of being free of watchful eyes by the government in everything you do - the price won’t matter. 

I believe this run will be more about price discovery, utility, and recognition of a truly global and decentralized payments system accessible to all who don’t have the luxury of having a bank account. Of course it also is a hedge against inflation; however, at the end of it all, I do not believe we will have a -70% crypto winter awaiting us.

It's hilarious to see this sort of shit start to come out right as it got close to, and broke, 20k. To me This these sorts of articles are indicative of an underlying closed mindedness and almost arrogance that a lot of the mainstream finance world suffers from. Instead of acknowledge the fear, lack of understanding, and ultimately just being objectively incorrect about BTC, they have to paint the narrative as if something has fundamentally shifted and now their \*new\* assessment of BTC is that its legit and here to stay therefore they can now get involved.

I’m so tempted to go all in and drop 100k cash on Bitcoin and watch it moon or lose it all

Or have the safety and security of a nice downtown apartment in Toronto that I can put on Airbnb and get some decent returns on over the next 25 years

What would you do ?

kksmxr,M2RSHY,For the newbies and those feeling the pressures of FOMO during bull run,"MOON sentiment is rising to levels we saw in 2017, and I do agree that things are different this time, BUT as with any investment, you should always expect that ANYTHING can happen.

There WILL be another healthy sizable pullback. It's a matter of WHEN, not IF. Could be today, tomorrow, next year or in 5 years. Odds are that it will be sooner, rather than later.

For the average person who can only spare a small percentage of their income, my advice would be to invest as below (or some sort of variation of the below):

1. Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) - Pick your favourite exchange and set up automatic buys. Daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly - whatever you can SAFELY afford. You don't want to feel like you have to sell at some stage if you are running low on fiat. Set and forget. HODL.
2. Lump Sum Purchasing\* - Take 25-50% of the amount you calculated for DCA'ing, and instead put it aside in an account for two reasons.  
   1. Buying The Dip - Pretty self explanatory really. Buy when it's cheap, to maximize your investment. 
   2. FOMO Buying - FOMO happens to even the best of us, trust me. What matters is how you react to the feeling. In moments of FOMO (bull runs), you may be just a click or two from depositing ALL your money in, which could be disastrous if the price drops significantly. Instead, invest a smaller percentage of this fund to help keep your emotions in check.

\*My personal rule with lump sum purchasing, is to always invest 50% of my fund, regardless of whether I'm buying the dip, or FOMO buying. If I buy at the All-Time-High (ATH) and it crashes, that allows me to buy the dip and average my cost down significantly. Vice versa, if I buy the dip and we see a bull run, it allows me to continue buying as the price goes up. By investing 50% of the value of my fund each buy, it typically never reaches $0.

**Regardless of the above, the #1 rule is still to buy &amp; HODL. As we continue to see ATHs, EVERYONE who has HODL has made money.**",1609026075,59,1

kkserd,sammyaxelrod,Why I bought btc,"Been lurking for years now and finally started buying a few months ago pretty heavily to hold and give to my kids some day.

The way I see it. Sure I believe in everything btc stands for and what it can and will do to our concept of money. But what really convinced me was everyone else’s lead. People who are way smarter and more successful than me. How could they all be wrong?

Finance is a game. And we have the hands down BEST players on the planet telling us btc is the next big thing that’s going to change the world. Literally the most successful and respected investors saying this every day on record. Then you have enormous companies like PayPal and Square and other revolutionary brands all piling into Bitcoin...and that’s just the ones we know about because there are so many more that don’t publicly announce their purchases.

I remember growing up during the pre Internet days...when the internet started going mainstream, most people wouldn’t stop saying it was just a fad. It would go nowhere. They couldn’t see past what they already knew...like people who buy oil stocks in 2020.

But the few who were publicly stating how revolutionary the internet would be were the real winners...along with everyone who followed in their footsteps.

So anyone who’s doubting buying btc, just remember that the smartest people on earth are also buying btc. 

Not just a bunch of random people on the internet or some YouTubers. But titans of industry. Some of the largest companies on earth are buying them up left and right.

And for the most part, they usually aren’t wrong about this sort of thing. So start stacking!",1609025252,5,1

So we can save people from going bankrupt.

* Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose
* Crypto trading is very high risk
* Do your research
* Don’t let emotions drive your decisions
* Never follow anyone blindly
* Don't day trade if you are new to crypto higher chance you will get rek
* Avoid using margin trading if you are not expert in trading (Very risky trading )
* Always double check wallet address when you send crypto (once lost it's lost for ever)
* Never keep funds on exchange for long time if you are not trading.
* Always keep your account secure with Two-factor authentication
* Don't use your salary account for buying crypto
* Always keep Stoploss if you are trading
* Never buy in FOMO
* Never hold 100% in one Alts, Holding 100% in Bitcoin is safer
* Don't take Loan to invest in crypto

Please share your views also

Hope less people will go bankrupt and more will make millions

kkzfuk,ramunejason,Need some advice!,Hi everyone! I opened a coinbase pro account a few months ago when Bitcoin was at around 9k and at the time I had put $13 into the account to trade and see where it went. At some point I just sold everything I had in my account after making it to about $20 and went all into Bitcoin and now I'm currently sitting at nearly $45. Bitcoin is currently at it's highest it's ever been and I was wondering if it would be a wise thing to buy $100 worth of bitcoin now or wait until it drops a certain amount to then buy in.

Would you post about your excitement if one of your stock investments went up 20% over, say, a week? The only logical reason I can think is that people here have close to if not all their money tied up in Bitcoin.

klsz52,21btc,Bitcoin does not really have a scalability problem,"Let me first explain why Bitcoin is restricted to 7 transaction per second globally, then go on and explain how Bitcoin does not even need any more than this in order for the whole world to not just use it as a store of value, but also as a medium of exchange, and also to do microstransactions to buy coffee if they wish to do so.

The reason Bitcoin is restricted to 7 transactions per second is because one block is restricted to 1 MB. Globally there is 6 blocks mined every hour, that is 6 MB. And every day there is 6 \* 24 MB = 144 MB of data that is being added to the Bitcoin database, which every node needs to keep a copy of. In a year this becomes 144 \* 365 = 52560 MB, 5.2 GB. And after 11 years 11 \* 52560 = 578160, which is 57 GB. This database would increase in size dramatically if the blocks were larger, and it would result in the network being less decentralized because you would need specialized hardware that only the elite could afford. For this reason, it is by design that 1 block is limited to 1 MB, and therefore 7 transactions per second globally. You can however batch transactions, you can do many transactions in one transaction, you can see for example that when Coinbase sends out Bitcoin to customers that withdraws their coins from the exchange, coinbase can send to 200+ addresses in one go, in one transaction.

Now, you need to first understand that you can't send money over internet, but only information. People think that when they use

VISA, credit card, or send money with banks website, they think they are sending money over internet, then compare Bitcoins transaciton per second to that of Paypal, and VISA, these people, including economist, nobel price winners etc, have no idea how the legacy financial system works. You simply do not send money over internet. Let me explain.

When I send a picture to someone on Facebook messenger, I don't actually send a picture. I send information about the pictures structure, and the picture gets restructured on the client side (the cellphone) of the user I send it to. Copy of the information is being sent, not the picture itself. So you can't send money over internet, it is not possible, only information.

If I have a bank account at some bank, and I send $50 dollars to another person in the same bank by using the banks website, then a transaction happens between two people within the same infrastructure, which is the banks back-end system and database. So the banks system just subtracts $50 dollars from one person and adds $50 dollars to another person. But no money has moved, only information has been edited. But if I send money to someone that uses another Bank, then this bank has its own infrastructure which is independent of the first. So Bank1 tells Bank2 that they have a user that wants to send money to a user of the other bank. So Bank1 subtracts $50 from User1, and Bank2 adds $50 to User2, but now Bank1 owes Bank2 $50, why? Because you can't send money over internet. So they have to settle the difference between them with some kind of a settlement system, (cash, gold or a third party like a central bank). This difference can be the result of many transactions between many users and can be millions of dollars of worth, the settlement can be done periodically for example every 6 months.

So physical money, or metals such as gold, have 0 transactions per second, 0. You can't send that value over internet. You can only store informaiton in a database on how much value one user has, and how much value has been sent, and who owes what to which bank etc.

With Bitcoin, because of how the system works, it is almost as if you can send value over internet for the first time, even though you don't really send value, you still send information, but since the infrastructure is global, it is like the first example, it is as if the world has (one large bank infrastructure), that is fully automated and which no one controls.

Here is the thing. You don't need to do transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, to ""send satoshis"". Just like you don't need to send physical cash to someone, to send money. When exhanges apply for bank lisence, and Banks apply to custody Bitcoin to their customers, then people can exchange their fiat to satoshis with the bank, and if they want to send satoshi to another customer of the same bank, then the bank can just do a plus minus in their database, and take 1 satoshi as fee, and nothing will go through the blockchain. You can send 10,000 satoshi to some guy in another bank, and your bank will owe his bank 10,000 satoshi. After millions of transactions one bank will owe another bank for example 3000 BTC, then they can just settle the difference by sending that amount on the Bitcoin blockchain. But the users can use the banks app, to do purchace at the store, just scan the QR code on some physical device and press OK, and then pay 15,000 satoshi, and then the store also has a bank account, so the banks and other financial companies can keep track of who owes what, and then those financial organizations can use the Bitocin blockchain to settle the difference between each other, settling with Bitcoin is much more efficient than sending actual physical cash, or using the bank of international settlements or doing it through central banks.

Remmeber when you buy something with your VISA card, or send money via the banks website or app, NO MONEY IS BEING SENT. You can't send money over internet. Only informaiton.",1609170972,46,1

How does an asset, token, assorted fund,  
And a coin, sent to a wallet of a merchant guy,  
And converted - enabled by blockchain  
And its traction - becomes a beautiful transaction?

The self-funded finding without a founder  
Got a lot DeFi-ner by being a lot finer  
By being a lot mined,  
By being not defined,  
And pretty soon!  
They found that this option called for mass adoption!

I could ask someone else from the family to keep it for me in the attic or the cave, that could be one way, as even a random thief would probably not bother going there. This would required me to take the plane to travel back to my country in order to leave a copy of the backup there, and who knows when this will be possible.

km08y0,rollercoaster2you,Cryptocurrency it is unsafe and not practical to use (?)," 

First of all I have to apologize for my english, insn't my first language, so I make a lot of mistakes and don't have enough vocabulary to use.

I never bought bitcoin before, even knowing it would be promising, because I don't had money.

Know I just bought like $20 in bitcoins in two different exhanges, just to test and learn abot it, it was very simple to bought, but I don't like that you have to just moviment minimium values, I can't move my bitcoins to a wallet or something, because I have to transfer a minimium amount of money.

How can bitcoin be used has a currency if the transactions are slow and you can't just transfer like $1, you have to transfer $60, even $80 in some exhanges.

Researching about crypto and you to use it I saw people saying you just buy at the exhange and put on some wallet, because it's safier and has low fees to use it, so I download it Coinomi's wallet and you can transfer minimium amounts like 70 cents in BRL. Its way better, but searching on google I saw one guy saying that he was robbed in $60,000 due to an falure in the recovery options of the wallet, he was hacked exploiding some error of the software.

How can I be safe? I new to this, but for my overall vision bitcoin and crypto are impractical, even if you just want a 'value reserve', the only vantage I saw it is to especulate, like put $1000 and hope it gets 10 times high.

Like, here in Brazil we know have something called PIX, you can transfer how much money you want to someone and it takes it takes a maximum of 5 minutes, it is usually instantaneous and WITHOUT FEES, and I do have an acoount on a virtual bank, even if it goes bankrupt I have a guarantee of the securities commission of the central bank that I will get up to $ 60,000 back, with bitcoin you have no guarantees and even have to pay fees for every transation.",1609193324,5,1

This data was pulled from my local bitcoin node. It shows every bitcoin transaction in history in terms of the date it was acquired and the date it was spent.

The triangle shape arises because the date the bitcoin was acquired (y-axis) must come before the date it was spent (x-axis). The yellow vertical streak in early 2018 shows that many people were spending coins that they had previously held in storage for several years. Technically the coins were ""moved"" instead of ""spent"" as someone could have sent them to another address that they also own. The bitcoin community uses the word ""spent"" because bitcoin ownership is defined by spent versus unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).

kluzly,oriok92,The value of currency and its effects on production,"The value of currency

In a progressive healthy economy where production is constantly growing, all goods and services are represented by all the currency in the system. Therefore, the value of the total quantity of currency multiplied by velocity of circulation must always be equal to the value of the total quantity of goods and services bought which are represented by the gross domestic product, being the equivalent as the average price multiplied by the quantity of goods and services. 

https://preview.redd.it/0jswu88nly761.png?width=843&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40ffbb22c2a936633286925926a101edbaa7989f

Velocity indicates the number of transactions where the same amount of currency is being used, for example when someone uses 10$ to purchase some product and latter the seller spends the same dollars to buy another product, in this case velocity equals to 2. 

Back on the equation, being velocity constant and equal to one, the equation shows that the value of currency unit must vary exactly and inversely with the amount put into circulation. Keeping in a context, credit adds currency supply in an existing circulating amount which represents all goods and services, once the amount is incremented, more currency is chasing the same goods and services. Therefore, the value of the currency unit decreases. 

https://preview.redd.it/5ybx84hqly761.png?width=852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7676273981ac30b85c3d1e86b70913ad51732e46

Suppose, for example, that the Central Bank lows interest rates and many corporations and individuals reconsider to borrow to purchase real state. The first effect of this expenditures will be to raise the prices of housing as the demand increased. Consequently, real estate businesses earn higher incomes and are willing to spend more in other goods and services. The same process repeats as the purchase-chain spreads among the economy and everyone benefits with higher incomes measured in terms of currency which now has a smaller subjective value in the eyes of each of them. 

Assumingly that production of goods and services has not incremented, its prices will have increased correspondingly. However, the state is not richer than before. Credit used in a non-productive way, creates fake demand in the sector involved distorting its prices. Other sectors and people not involved will basically see prices raising and their incomes will keep being the same but with less purchasing power. 

As you probably already know, this is how inflation expands through the economy and it is not an average standard of 2% as we are told. Depending on the consumer goods and services purchased you could be much more exposed. Unfortunately, saving your currency in a bank deposit account it’s not an option as the interest on deposits are provably much lower than the inflation you are bearing. Learning on investing is the only way out to preserve the value of your work, hence your capital. 

How inflation distorts production

A core concept on a free market capitalist society is the price system, a market build on prices is a democratic structure where prices indicates the most demanded products. Prices act as a signal of production. When people want more of an article and it is demanded over supply, their competitive bidding raises its price and because its more profitable to make that article, people in business expand production or even adapts for the product that offers better return. This increases supply reducing price and profit margin till reaches the price equilibrium with new demand. In the same way, if demand falls off for some products, its price and the profit making it decline disincentivizing its production.

This brilliant system builds a decentralized organization where millions of people are coordinated through prices and each one have the knowledge to allocate the optimal resources to produce in its own sector, like thousand of gears that transmit energy one to another with no power lose but friction.

In contrast, a central planned economy system which operates with a centralized authority that manages production, leads to a misallocation of resources ending up with a lack of production or an overproduction scenario. Both consequences spread among the economy creating an uncoordinated market structure with constant inefficiencies, following the mechanic analogy could be represented as many gears spinning by itself with no transmission power just a waste of energy and resources.

Back in the real state example described before. Once people are attracted with cheap credit making housing prices to raise, this incentive construction corporations to build as there is more profit to earn. Realize that borrowers basically get currency backed by nothing, there is no work behind but the promise to repay the credit. Borrowers have not contributed in society with the same value as the purchasing power is right now given to them and as far as commercial banks are willing to lend to build and purchase apartments, this is a self-reinforced growing bubble guided by fake demand misallocating capital and resources to finally produce an overvalued product. 

Hence inflation distorts the structure of production, it leads to an overexpansion of some industries at the expense of others. This situation resembles more like a central planned economy than a free market capitalist society.",1609177283,0,1

And I've been to a few websites that have you plug in numbers to produce a premium percentage but they are mostly wrong because they don't update the GBTC multiplier which changes from time to time. Here's how you can figure it out exactly. 

You need one number from the Grayscale [website](https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-trust/) , and that's what I call the **multiplier** or what 1 share of GBTC equals in terms of BTC. As of Dec 28 it is .00095028 (ie, that means 1 GBTC share = .00095028 BTC)

The premium formula:  
**(GBTC/.00095028 - BTC)/BTC \* 100**

For example, using the closing prices of GBTC and BTCUSD for Dec 28:  
(30.45/.00095028 - 27040)/27040 \* 100 = **18.5 % premium**

Secondly, to find out how much your shares of GBTC equals in terms of BTC simply use that same multiplier. So if, for example, you have 500 shares:

500 \* .00095028 = .47514 BTC  
(ie, 500sh of GBTC equals just under .5 or one-half BTC)

Finally, one caveat -- Grayscale sometimes alters the multiplier, so to be accurate check their website before doing any calculations.",1609248621,12,1

Bitlocity Review And Bonuses

Bitlocity is positioned as a new world’s first all in one decentralized program. But what you and many other people might want to know is simply, Is it a scam?”

The word scam means many things to many people. For instance let me tell you what scam means to me. Scam to me is when you pay someone your hard earned money and do not receive the agreed upon service or product that you are buying, Point Blank. Bitlocity has not launched so as far as I am concerned Bitlocity is not and can not be a scam at this point in time. As in an election or appointment the results are not in.

I will not declare Bitlocity a scam until actual money has changed hands and the people have spoken on whether they got their money’s worth or not. Until then I will lay off the scam claim on my end and you should as well. Honestly I really don’t like the use of the word scam cause it’s so negative plus Bitlocity could be a scam to one person but an excellent product to someone else. Many times there are just too many variables.

Anyway as of today Bitlocity is not on my scam list. That’s not to say it won’t be after they launch and the data gets processed by the purchases and there will be many that join and sign up.

Bitlocity Compensation Plan — Bitlocity Review &amp; Bonus

The compensation for Bitlocity is looking very good. Aside from the affiliate marketing form of compensation where you get paid for every sale, Bitlocity uses a very powerful system where the 3rd and 10th payments are passed up to your sponsor which is not bad when you are automatically re-entered into the unilevel matrix. You also receive the 3rd and 10th payment from all of your signups. How sweet is that.

You are ultimately rewarded for getting in early as you are paid first according to the spot you are in when you join. This Bitlocity compensation plan is based and built on bitcoin and will bring much needed excitement to the bitcoin holders communities.

Of Course not every bitcoin holder will jump in this especially if they are not already a part of the mlm community, but for those that use and are familiar with bitcoin and already in the mlm niche this is very exciting indeed. You can see many people anticipating the launch of Bitlocity. There is real excitement surrounding this Bitlocity project and it will result in many people getting paid handsomely especially if they get in early.

Bitlocity Reviews on Trustpilot — Bitlocity Review &amp; Bonus

There are Bitlocity Reviews on the Trustpilot website. Even though Bitlocity has not launched as of yet the reviews do have some interesting commentary on the site. Let’s explore, shall we?

Listen I appreciate all commentary and input on Bitlocity and any niche that I pursue. I am not a hater. I have been out of the loop for many years but with Bitlocity I return with a vengeance.

The Trustpilot website is a decent little portal that lets you voice your opinion on websites and products. I can respect that. In this instance they focus on Bitlocity which is launching very soon. I can’t be mad a t the hustle. Shout out to them.

So just what is the Trustpilot site saying about Bitlocity as far as reviews?

Well, Gerald seems to be pleased with the Bitlocity project, saying that it seems to be a great opportunity. He goes on to say that the price is minimum and it should be a great asset in building wealth in crypto currencies education and crowdfunding, He also says people should use his id if they plan to join. Shameless plug but I get it.

Bones says that the Bitlocity comp plan is the best for non recruiters which I agree with. He also goes on to say that the 1st and second levels helps people join faster which is also on point. I don’t know Bones but he makes a good point. The compensation plan ans structure will be a great draw for newbies and those looking for an opportunity who are not necessarily recruiters.

The last person with their review that I will mention is Benney. Benney is also a thumbs up for Bitlocity. He says that the opportunity to get bitcoin through Bitlocity is very great. He said he registered for the pre launch as you should and that this is the best compensation plan he has ever seen.

kmdkcg,SimpleSwapExchange,Taxes for Bitcoin,"Do you remember that at the beginning of this year India wanted to ban crypto? It has not been done yet. However, India’s finance ministry has a  new initiative. This time they suggest tax income made by Bitcoin trading. The proposed tax is 18%, according to some calculations it is supposed to bring about $970 million to the government.   
The interesting thing about this law is that the tax itself does not mean that Bitcoin will get a legal status, since this country also taxes illegal income.

&gt;So you’re thinking, I won’t use CBDC, I’ll use the existing money we already have. That will be fine, until CBDC [is the only game in town](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/when-cbdc-arrives-what-will-it-take-for-you-to-use-it-380deda1a983).  Not long from now, you’ll start hearing about plans to get rid of the  $100 bill, and the $50 bill. Ultimately we’ll be down to coins and maybe  one dollar bills — if we’re lucky.  
&gt;  
&gt;80%  of the world’s central banks are already working on CBDC, and countries  like China and Sweden have already made great strides toward reducing  the use of physical cash. This trend of more and more digital payments  will only increase from here on out.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are other concerns we should have over moving to a national digital currency. Because CBDC is programmable, there are [more aspects beyond](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/the-ugly-side-of-cbdc-66ee9b80672f) the aforementioned devaluation that central banks will have much more control over. I’ve written several articles about [CBDC](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/what-is-a-cbdc-and-why-should-i-care-a33095e7ef03) already, but a basic list of capabilities we should be concerned about with CBDC is as follows  
&gt;  
&gt;Placing expiration dates on funds  
&gt;  
&gt;Placing a cap on savings or even balances  
&gt;  
&gt;All transactions being tracked with no anonymity

kmda1c,nullc,US Taxpayers who have held Bitcoin &gt; 1 year: Just two days left to harvest tax gains.,"For people in the US who have will have total income (including realized investment gains) below $52,400 (single with standard deduction, $104,800 for married couples) in 2020 it can be tax advantageous to sell profitable Bitcoin that you've held for &gt;1 year and buy it back to trigger the taxes this year and bring you up to the threshold.  (Also the case for some people with very high incomes, see below)

I believe this may be more applicable this year than most due to people being un/under-employed due to the pandemic. ... as well as the fact that everyone with Bitcoin held over 1 year should have plenty of gains right now.

Normally you want to postpone triggering gains to delay paying taxes, but if your income is low enough there is reason to do it eagerly:

The reason for this is that if your income, including gains is below $52,400 (single) your federal tax rate for capital assets held for &gt;1 year is 0%.  When you sell and rebuy the Bitcoin you increase your purchase price but won't pay any tax on the portion that is under the threshold.  If you go a little over, that isn't a problem-- you'll only be taxed at the 15% rate on the amount you were over the limit.

When you do this, you move the purchase price up on your Bitcoins and later when you sell them again you'll have a smaller gain and pay less taxes (or a larger loss if the Bitcoin price falls, which can offset other gains-- effectively teleporting your 0-tax space into future years).

The primary risk/disadvantage is that you might make some mistake moving coins or dealing with an exchange, that you'll pay trading fees and potentially the spread as well as market volatility risks, -- also you do restart the 1 year clock, so if Bitcoin jumps to $500,000 per coin in January and you decide to sell some of it in February, you'd pay the higher short term gains rate.  (Personally, I would be happy enough about the price that I wouldn't worry too much about the higher tax rate... :) )

I think the tax advantage is worth the trouble but your situation and preferences may be different.

Depending on where you live state income taxes may also apply.  This [calculator](https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator) appears accurate.

A similar situation can apply to very high incomes.  If your income this year is under $458,250 (single, married: $521,400) but you expect your income to be over that threshold during the next years: If your long term gains will be taxed at the 20% (or 23.8%) rate in the future but you're within the 15% rate now then you may be better off taking the gains now at the 15% rate.  Though because of the alternative minimum tax, it's harder to make blanket statements about people with incomes approaching $500k.

[I previously posted about this earlier this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/g4cves/i_have_my_entire_net_worth_in_bitcoin/fnxyguh/). 

Similar can be done for short term losses-- realizing them eagerly and before they turn long term in order to offset gains and reduce taxes, though  I don't expect too many people have Bitcoin losses right now. :) Also the wash sale rule potentially creates complications that require extra considerations.

The incoming Biden administration hasn't delivered a sufficiently clear message on their intended tax policy, but I think it is unlikely that the capital gains rates will go down for anyone and it's likely that they'll go up at least for people with the highest income in 2022-- so this might be a secondary reason to realize gains now.

Sadly for our UK friends, it appears that this practice is prohibited there.

Disclaimer:  I'm not a CPA, but I've paid complicated taxes for a long time. :)",1609243918,85,1

kmcxtr,oriok92,what you are not told about inflation,"A core concept on a free market capitalist society is the price system, a market build on prices is a democratic structure where prices indicates the most demanded products. Prices act as a signal of production. When people want more of an article and it is demanded over supply, their competitive bidding raises its price and because its more profitable to make that article, people in business expand production or even adapts for the product that offers better return. This increases supply reducing price and profit margin till reaches the price equilibrium with new demand. In the same way, if demand falls off for some products, its price and the profit making it decline disincentivizing its production.

This brilliant system builds a decentralized organization where millions of people are coordinated through prices and each one have the knowledge to allocate the optimal resources to produce in its own sector, like thousand of gears that transmit energy one to another with no power lose but friction.

In contrast, a central planned economy system which operates with a centralized authority that manages production, leads to a misallocation of resources ending up with a lack of production or an overproduction scenario. Both consequences spread among the economy creating an uncoordinated market structure with constant inefficiencies, following the mechanic analogy could be represented as many gears spinning by itself with no transmission power just a waste of energy and resources.

Suppose, for example, that the Central Bank lows interest rates and many corporations and individuals reconsider to borrow to purchase real state. Once people are attracted with cheap credit making housing prices to raise, this incentivize construction corporations to build as there is more profit to earn. Realize that borrowers basically get currency backed by nothing, there is no work behind but the promise to repay the credit. Borrowers have not contributed in society with the same value as the purchasing power is right now given to them and as far as commercial banks are willing to lend to build and purchase apartments, this is a self-reinforced growing bubble guided by fake demand misallocating capital and resources to finally produce an overvalued product.

Hence inflation distorts the structure of production, it leads to an overexpansion of some industries at the expense of others. This situation resembles more like a central planned economy than a free market capitalist society.",1609242413,3,1

The Satoshi Answer:  
 As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties:  
\- boring grey in colour  
\- not a good conductor of electricity  
\- not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either  
\- not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose  


and one special, magical property:  
\- can be transported over a communications channel  


If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.  


Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you've suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange.  (I would definitely want some)  Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.  


I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value.  But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something.

kmsjiy,NateNate60,"You all think everyone you disagree with is malicious or a troll, and that's a problem.","Not everyone is out to cause chaos for laughs. Sometimes people just have a difference of opinion. There is no absolute best scenario. Everything has its ups and downs, and just because someone supports a concept that you don't like, doesn't mean they're a troll. Also, remember Hanlon's Razor: never attribute to malice what is adequately explained by stupidity.

Is someone stupid or trolling for saying leaving coins on an exchange is a good idea? Probably not. Not your keys, not your coins, but exchanges bundle transactions all at once into single big transactions, which can result in big savings on transaction fees.

Is someone stupid or trolling for saying the block size ought to be increased? Probably not. Bigger block sizes for more on-chain transactions results in less decentralisation but is simpler and easier to understand and work with than the Lightning Network.

Is someone stupid or trolling for encouraging people to cash out their earnings? Probably not. HODL is great for long-term growth, but HODL won't pay the rent or the bills or the car note. Sometimes, people just don't want to take the risk anymore, so they cash out while they're ahead and enjoy the instant gratification.

Is someone stupid or trolling for saying it's not worth it to get a hardware wallet? Probably not. Hardware wallets are indeed the best in terms of security, but $50 for a good wallet is not inconsequential when simply encrypting your software wallet and keeping your device malware-free will do the trick for most.

Is someone stupid or trolling for investing in altcoins? Probably not. Sometimes people just like to gamble a few dollars on some random no-name coin in the hopes it will double in price before crashing back down.

Will we ever see a 20k-22k bitcoin again? I've determined that purchasing bitcoin at it's near all time high ($27,600), will cause me to have a lower return on my investment if it were to fall back down to 20k.

I bought mine in December of 2013 with blockchain.  I was VERY naive about the technology but had a friend who claimed to be.  Years ago I made a request to block chain for my wallets.  I had four, two associated with my Gmail and two with my Yahoo. Two were from dec 2013 and two from dec 2014.  The two from 2014 I was able to access but they had no money in them, however, and oddly, they also had imported addresses that showed balances of zero.  The two from 2013 I have not been able to access. I am about to try to brut force them, but my friend who encouraged me to get them discovered our old text messages from the time I purchased them and I got them in NOVEMBER of 2013.  I am wondering why the wallet for for when I got them in NOVEMBER would not appear when I requested my wallets from blockchain.  I have no other emails.  Also we found an email from around the time I created the 2014 wallets wherein my friend sent me a .JSON file and a link to a blockchain page with an import wallet box.  My memories of this time period are very hazy unfortunately.  
I tried to drag the .json file into the import wallet box today and just got a web page with a long string of random 'code'.  If anyone has any idea of why my original wallet is not showing up in my blockchAin request that would be great.  I'm wondering if I did somehow import it if that would make it disappear from their databases or whatever??  Also I'm curious as to these imported wallets in the wallets that I can't access, is there any chance that these are my original wallets and any reason perhaps that they would show no Ballance?  Someone did tell me from blockchain that wallets after 2016 needed to be updated but neglected to tell me how or why or what that would do...  
It's convoluted and messy I know but of anyone can help me wrap my head around it I would GLADLY pay them.

Can a couple of you experts and believers answer a few questions of mine?

1. there are approximately 18.6 million bitcoin in circulation with the cap at 21 million, so 2.4 million bitcoin left. 900 bitcoin is mined on average everyday day, so it would take \~ 7 years 3 months before we hit the max. Is it possible that when that time comes, a new cap can be created? like does the original creator of bitcoin have the power to change the total cap circulation? (example: 2028 bitcoin new cap at 24 million)
2. Is it possible quantum computing, technology, or a world class hacker can be so advanced that somehow bitcoin accounts can be hacked or manipulated in the upcoming years with future innovation? (such as bitcoin mining speed, or bypassing the 24 word seed or 34 character bitcoin key/address)
3. As it stands Bitcoin continues to grow in value due to the scarcity/limited amount whereas paper currency and gold is becoming more inflated driving price down. Are there any factors that can make Bitcoin susceptible to inflation in the future, or is it secure as I think it is ?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for a wallet to store my Bitcoins in.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Necessary** features:

**a.** Must be around for a while and be trustworthy so far. Open source would also be a plus.

**b.** Allows me to make offline backups of my wallet, ideally, exporting a backup file that I can safely store in a Veracrypt container, which can later on be restored to any other wallet provider *(in case that specific one I am currently using ever goes defunct or something)*

**c.** Has a web browser client too, so that I'm not restricted to a single OS in order to use it. *(I can access my bank account from any OS that has a browser, why would I want it to be any different with my Bitcoin wallet, right?)*

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Not necessary** *(but wanted)*:

**a.** Can be topped up using PayPal, or credit card, as most of the time, I'm planning to send payments; not receive.

kn7zmq,vaporentportland,Please help my reclaim my lost/misorganized/buried BTC!,"Hi folks,

So I feel very noobish here and apologize in advance for what may be only slightly coherent, but here goes.

I bought into BTC crypto during the 2017 bull run at I believe $9,500/BTC, investing somewhere around $3,500 across BTC, ETH, LTC and a handful of smaller cryptos. I still have the exact amounts of each currency documented in screenshots from the app I used to use to keep track of the upswings and downswings. Some of this went through Coinbase, some of it went through Binance, some of it ended up in digital wallets and eventually (I think?) all of it ended up on a Ledger Nano S, which I am scared to admit I may have lost in a move (I can't find it anywhere).

What I DO have is my paper key. This is effectively all I have, as well as a confusing chain of email clues that might help lead me in the right direction. The problem is that I don't know where to start in terms of getting control of my cryptos again—I don't even know technically where they are!

I realize this is user error to the max, and that I messed up. That said, I would be eternally grateful for some advice as to how I should move forward to reclaim my cryptos. I'm not thrilled to cash in, but I have never been more in need of emergency funds than during this pandemic.",1609353767,6,1

kn7vad,Noblefire_62,How do you plan to invest your stimulus check into Bitcoin?,"I made the decision when the next round of stimulus was announced that I would be putting it entirely into Bitcoin.

The day has come and people are getting the payments, but I’m still trying to decide between whether I should drop the entire $600 all at once into Bitcoin, or if I should DCA it over the next couple weeks incase of a correction.

Normally this isn’t a thing I have to consider that hard when I make my regular investments of Bitcoin, however, I imagine that the stimulus will spur new demand for bitcoin, which unless miners or whales decide to sell some off to exchanges, I could see supply shortages causing a run-up in price. On the other hand, there have been some big whale movements to exchanges lately and I could see more happening that could cause a price correction between now and 30k.

Either way I plan to hodl indefinitely so in the long run it shouldn’t matter too much, but I’m curious to know what your thoughts are and how you plan to invest the stimulus.",1609353406,5,1

[My Bitcoin + Lightning Node](https://preview.redd.it/q9lggv62pe861.jpg?width=2381&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20386996a3d6e98b3367d8e893948b09d2cb49a0)

I figured I should give some info about what I did right, and what I did wrong for others to learn from.

My Node is made of:

\- Raspberry Pi 4b  
\- Ice Tower heatsink (low-profile)  
\- GeekWorm x728 (Battery UPS)  
\- UGREEN M.2 NVMe SSD Enclosure  
\- Intel 660p Series 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD  
\- Generic SDCard for OS.

I ended up returning:

\- Geekworm X872 M.2 NVMe SSD Expansion Board  
\- GeekWorm x728 (Battery UPS) -- Was faulty, ended up getting a replacement.

I first attempted to install raspiblitz ([https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz)) but I was having trouble with the SSD, and I ended up following RaspiBolt ([https://stadicus.github.io/RaspiBolt/](https://stadicus.github.io/RaspiBolt/)) instead. I recommend following RaspiBolt, even though I reckon I could install raspiblitz now that I have overcome the hardware issues, I just feel like I understand my setup better with RaspiBolt than I would with raspiblitz as it comes pre-configured.

Issues:

My first issue, was that the SSD wasn't working properly with the WIFI. I got a wifi adapter, but even that lost connection periodically. I run my Pi headless so this is unacceptable, I would have no way to know what the problem was when it stopped working randomly. I ensured that I got a low powered SSD after reading lots of reviews, I also was looking for one with power loss protection, but I gave up on that after some time because they are not easy to find. I chose NVMe because I could only find the NVMe version of the Geekworm SSD Expansion Board for sale. I wanted something that I could box up nicely. As you can tell, I failed at that, I now have that SSD sticking out and I haven't figured out a case for it yet.

I later found out that there were 2 manufacturers of NVMe driver boards, that the GeekWorm product used a JMicron chipset (JMS583) and UGreen used a ASMedia chipset (ASM2362). All manufacturers use one or the other, and I found that this ASMedia chip worked with my Pi and my SSD. There is still a chance that the JMicron one would work too, but I had a faulty one, but I have a setup that works now.

&amp;#x200B;

The Ice Tower heatsink is great, it is silent, and I can even overclock the PI without a fan. However, it isn't that great when building onto it. The Battery UPS was designed to go above the PI, but because of the heatsink, I ended up fitting it below and buying a ribbon cable to connect the pins together. Be careful if you are doing this, make sure you don't accidentally flip the connections. Also make sure you buy good quality cables. I learnt a new term which might be useful: ""AWG"" which is an American unit telling you how thick the cable is. Thicker is better. I ended up not being able to use that information, I found a ribbon cable manufacturer on Amazon delivering to UK and found it to be satisfactory.

&amp;#x200B;

The first UPS I received was definitely faulty; the indicator lights were not working properly. I got a replacement and I thought that was faulty too because it seemed to not be able to charge my batteries and power the pi at the same time, so I ended up doing a lot of testing. It turns out that it will prioritise power to the PI, so although the device seemed to be constantly restarting, the PI was on and stable. If you are doing what I am, using cables to connect the pins between the UPS and the PI, use a good quality ribbon cable because the cables you get in pi experiment kits have a lot of resistance and it means your pi won't get enough voltage to run properly. The restarting behaviour of the device ended up being the fault of the official raspberry pi power adapter. It uses a type of polyfuse that allows you to draw over 3.2amps but immediately turns off and on again until you start drawing less. While the UPS could draw less, it attempts more first and it gets stuck in a loop. Ultimately, it means that once there has been a power surge, if the battery goes low, then I should shut down the node and wait for the battery to charge before turning it back on. For now, I haven't had any power issues :fingers crossed:.

&amp;#x200B;

In hindsight, buying a SATA SSD would have been better, but I couldn't find a SATA enclosure that I liked that would keep the form factor small. Again, I ended up buying the uGreen so I didn't get the form factor I wanted anyway. The SSD I have works great, but I'm not using it to its full potential, an NVMe can run much faster than an SATA, but over USB3, it runs the same as a SATA. At the same time, the recommended SSDs cost about the same as this NVMe so I don't regret it too much.

&amp;#x200B;

Software:

I am running a full Bitcoin node, LND, ""Bitcoin Explorer"", and ""Ride The Lightning"". The last 2 are web based interfaces for me to monitor and manage the state of the node. I am using TOR for all external communication, and none of the web interfaces are accessible to the internet for security reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep the device behind my blinds because the lights can be blinding at night. At the same time, if something were to go wrong, the lights are the first thing I need to be able to see, so I'm going to have to keep that in mind when designing a case for it.",1609373537,34,1

knea40,icbcrepair,Anyone have more information on the status of CoinPrune,"&gt;Bitcoin was the first successful decentralized cryptocurrency and remains the most popular of its kind to this day. Despite the benefits of its blockchain, Bitcoin still faces serious scalability issues, most importantly its ever-increasing blockchain size. While alternative designs introduced schemes to periodically create snapshots and thereafter prune older blocks, already-deployed systems such as Bitcoin are often considered incapable of adapting corresponding approaches.

&gt;In our work, we revise this popular belief and present CoinPrune, a snapshot-based pruning scheme which is fully compatible to Bitcoin. CoinPrune can be deployed through an opt-in velvet fork, i.e., without impeding the established Bitcoin network. By requiring miners to publicly announce and jointly reaffirm recent snapshots on the blockchain, CoinPrune establishes trust into the snapshots' correctness even in the presence of powerful adversaries. Our evaluation shows that CoinPrune reduces the storage requirements of Bitcoin already by two orders of magnitude today, with further relative savings as the blockchain grows. In our experiments, nodes only have to fetch and process 5 GiB instead of 230 GiB of data when joining the network, reducing the synchronization time on powerful devices from currently 5 hours to 46 minutes, with even more savings for less powerful devices.

Hey guys! 

Have only recently jumped on the BTC train and it’s fair to say my small investment has done extremely well in a few short weeks.
I’ve been investing in stocks now for at least a year (ASX), which in hindsight, I now wish I had of put that money towards crypto. With stock investing I always found it quite easy to find good reliable websites in terms of learning about good small cap stocks for example. Whereas YouTube is just flooded with the most outrageous click bait BTC videos. 
So I’m just wondering what’s everyone’s go to website or YouTube channel that’s really been worth your while in terms of learning about really good and promising other crypto currency’s. 

Side note: I’m only 20 so I’m pretty keen on long term investing, and reaping the rewards down the line.",1609372572,10,1

knbxdf,phall56,Help needed Suicidal father,"My name is Patrick. With 2020 coming to an end I’m looking for 2021 to start off.

From the beginning. This year started off great; excellent job, wonderful girlfriend, close to my entire family. March hit and everything changed like most. I didn’t loose my job right away, but my girlfriend did briefly. She has two kids from a previous relationship and I was starting to feel the burdens of financially supporting everyone. I made it make. She got another job and to my surprised moved out and bought a house. Despite that we stayed together. I financially supported the move and setting the house up. In June I lost my job but quickly found another for half the pay. I forced on my bills and my bills alone. The relationship struggled due to that. We saved money by doing the household upgrades our self. We finished the “honey do” list.

My mother, whom I was extremely close to moved out of state. My dad was the only one who stayed behind. We lost contact slowly going from talking daily to weekly to monthly. I couldn’t hang out with friend due to COVID and I started to loose myself. Eating ramen every night because I accepted it and put thing towards the house that I thought I would eventually be living in with the girlfriend and two kids.

My health deteriorated due to diet and depression. I got myself help to the point of what I could afford. I kept my head up. 

Here we are in December. A few days before Christmas I get two phone calls. 1. The girlfriend calls and tells me our relationship is over. “It’s not you it’s me” my thinking is this was planned all along so I would do this list to get HER house in order. I should’ve known better, lesson learned. 2. My dad calls and tells me he’s attempting suicide and telling me goodbye. Hospital took him in and let me tell you, spending Christmas Day with him in a mental hospital is not something I can do again.

Those things taught me some things. I need to focus on myself and family means everything. Christmas Day sitting there in the hospital, I applied for a once in a lifetime job opportunity.  This past Monday I get a call from this company did an interview and was hired on the spot with an offer triple what I am making now. Unfortunately I have been given a week to respond and it is on the other side of the country. I tried to negotiate some moving expenses but they wouldn’t go for it. 

This opportunity is huge for me. I want to bring my dad with me and show him everyday that life is worth living and giving me the purpose I had at the beginning of this year. It will take me from Michigan to Georgia where the rest of my family is, for extra support.  I’m honored by this opportunity but I need help for moving and paying his medical bills for being in the hospital. I have to pay off my current lease and his is only month to month. I have to pay for moving everything down there and get a game set up with first and last months rent and security deposit. A vehicle that will get me down there and to his doctors appointments. I have no family to ask for help or friends. I am selling everything in my house that I can that I don’t need which I not much. I really want this job to better my life and those around me. I would start this new job in February 2021 but have only a week to accept the offer. I will do everything I can to get this working for me but I have to realize that I have to do one thing I don’t do. Ask for help. Here I am asking for help. Advise or donations I will appreciate it all. I think you got your time in reading this.",1609365786,3,1

knbt6c,janells19,How the Wealthy stay that way - and the Average Person never gets there,"Do you ever wonder why some families have generational wealth?  Here it comes....they almost NEVER sell appreciating assets.  If there's one thing for certain that the Rothschilds of the world know that you and I need to learn, it is that TAXES are the biggest disrupters of wealth in the history of mankind.  When the U.S. Government adopted the income tax law in 1913 - they instituted the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of civilization.  And we just carry along our daily lives accepting the fate that the government will get a piece of every dollar we earn without fail.  

Then here comes Uncle Sam not too long ago and says, ""we have a solution to help called a 'qualified retirement plan'.""  We will let you put away money for your retirement and DEFER those nasty taxes into the future.  Into a future, by the way, with uncertain tax rates and with rules about when you are able to take distributions - and when you have to for that matter.  And we just get in line like a bunch of lemmings, ""oh gee Mr. government, thank you so much for helping me retire!"".  

All the while our savior the govt. pumps cash into the economy likes it's peanuts and every dollar you earn loses half it's value in a decade.  The U.S. national debt is north of 20 Trillion dollars.  Guess how much money is sitting in tax qualified plans???  About 20 Trillion dollars.  So when that bill comes in, where do you think they are going to get the money?  Is the government going to seize assets from billionaires?  Hah!  Good one.  No, they will do what they have always done...take it from the working class.

So along comes Bitcoin and the crypto world.  You're seeing this revolution of people gaining value in an asset class that is outperforming every other asset in the world economy.  And the first thing we want to do when it performs well is SELL???  Come on folks!  Wake up and smell the coffee in 2021.  NEVER SELL.  I know, I know....if nobody sells then there aren't buyers/sellers.  Y'all, someone will always sell, it is a market.  And the more market cap, the more liquid it will become.

I'm talking to the Average Joe or Average Jane that has been living under the influence of the governments and elites of the world all of your life (some young, some old) - and I'm telling you to break free from the mold.  Learn a lesson today from the wealthy few.  Build up those assets, let them grow.  Never touch them.  When it's time to buy a car, or house or start a business - borrow against the asset and pay back over time.  Never pay the taxes and never lose the compounding of that asset.

I'm currently building a house, about $300,000 purchase.  Imagine if I had that in BTC and sold it to buy the house?  I'd probably pay six figures in capital gains!  What I'd rather do is continue to build up my BTC until I can borrow against it and pay off my loan.  And leave the IRS and the banks in the dust!  Happy HODLing!",1609365439,129,1

k4ifuc,durdN1545,Making bitcoin anonymous and transferring to ledger,"Hi all, Looking for some advice; 

I only recently managed to buy one full bitcoin as I never had the funds to invest before (was paying off debt).  I only just very recently secured the money I wanted to invest into BTC as it dipped to 16500. Obviously I bought as much as I could. However as I didn't want to waste time and wanted to buy as low as possible, I didn't have much choice but to use a common exchange (crypto.com).  Even at that, I had to wait for my ID to get verified and the back transfer to be completed. I didn't have the time to adequately research how to purchase it all anonymously.

Thus, now, I have about 1 btc  in my crypto.com but it's obviously not anonymous. I have also just got a ledger back up kit in the black Friday sale. Which I want to store most of my funds in for it to be safe. However, I don't want to straight transfer from crypto.com to my ledger, as that would link my identity. (I purchased the ledgers with my real name, Addy and debit card too which I'm not happy about as is). 

So, can anyone please advise on the cleanest/cheapest way to transfer all my BTC to my ledger anonymously? 

Cheers in advance!",1606818558,9,1

k4hnxs,XMR2021,Watch Out For Fake Electrum Wallet Site!,"Just sending a warning because I have read two people's stories in the past few days and both said the same thing. They downloaded Electrum, swept their private keys and moments later the bitcoin was sent to a random address. Of course they were broken hearted as they lost their precious crypto. 

They then asked, how could this have been done? They password protected the wallet and are sure they don't have a keylogger on their system. Was it malware? How is this possible?

It is possible because people don't realize that your wallet is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING that you must keep safe. You better be damn well sure it isn't a scam of some sort. Web wallets are notorious for this. In this case, it comes down to Google Ads yet again. Search google right now for ""electrum"" or ""electrum wallet"" You will see the number one result, as shown below is for...  ELECTCLUM(.ORG) of course this redirects (why would Google EVER allow redirect ads I'll never know) to ELECTRUM(.ORG.IN) 

  

[Look at the Ad... it is not electrum.org of course.](https://preview.redd.it/awaoexwfmj261.png?width=1097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a529baeb98b1887f8ac1e50cbac13cf860f21e88)

So, be very careful if you tell a friend or family member, ""Oh it is easy, just search for electrum wallet, go there and download it."" It isn't that simple. In my opinion, tons of people are losing their coins this way. More people than will ever admit it. It drives the price of coin down for sure. The people who lose, get pissed and are no longer interested and the scammers go and sell the coin for whatever price they can get. 

Just a reminder again to be careful. I wrote a post in the r/monero sub last week about the same scam with xmrwallet. These are becoming common and they have learned how to pay for the top spot in Google results and people still don't understand the importance of their wallet. Download from (.org.in) and you can sweep whatever wallet you want and then wave goodbye as the scammers simply send those coins to themselves. I hate thieves. Die thieves die and may you have stomach ulcers until the last bitcoin is mined.",1606814636,7,1

I bought in 2014 I was in a rough part of my life and used bitcoin to purchase things from the dark net not fully knowing anything about bitcoin or what it stood for, just that it could get me what I wanted online, I eventually got caught and served my punishment during that time I still had some coins in my coinbase account that I totally forgot about, and when bitcoin hit 1000 I took the time to learn about the technology, recover my coinbase account with everything there right where I left off, and just kept buying and DCA when I could, 2017 came and went and never sold even when I had 27k ripple I traded for from the bitcoin cash fork, I just said hey I really don't need the money now so let's see what happens, everybody pushes hodl so much I didn't have the balls to cash out when it was truly life changing, but didn't even really care when it dipped to 3k, but hey were here now and from my less than 5k investment I'm out with less than 100k but more than 50k difference now is I just bought my first house and bills are racking up quickly, and buying during the pandemic I didn't really get a sweet deal on it either, but I needed a home to live in permanently rather than renting a room from a friend for so long, and these sleepless nights, checking the price every hour so many times not knowing what's going to happen slaving over articles on what whatever news site has to say, reading every single reddit point on r/bitcoin and r/bitcoinmarkets sorting by new, I just want my life back I want to take this golden opportunity to invest in my life my home and shelter, I've been here for so long Im kinda sure there will be another crash and by then after taxes (still gotta figure out how that's gonna work since I bought things online and markets that don't exist anymore I'm guessing the LIFO method would be best?) and settling up the the needed house inprovements I hope to be back for a more long time buy and HODL.

We see big moves everyday in the crypto space like 6 percent moves in a day in the price of Bitcoin, but from a mathematical point of view, to actually achieve this 6 percent move, someone or a group of people have to buy 21 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin in one day, daily volume of Bitcoin traded is 51 billion on average, so an order like that will just end up being overshadowed by market liquidity thereby not even moving the price. And any way, if you head on to the block chain ledger, you do not see purchases that are capable of moving it's price only purchase you'll see are those in the millions of dollars range. And also, if the crypto space is solely one of supply and demand, why do most cryptos move in correlation with one another. Does that mean people are buying different cryptos at once on the same day  and selling all at once the same day. What I am trying to say, is that an asset like Bitcoin with that amount of liquidity, isn't it supposed to be fairly stable in price. Or is there some sort of QE in the crypto space where, the USDT is devalued or other stable coins which give value to these cryptos are, or stable coins are minted just like the big banks so as to buy back crypto. Is there QE in the crypto space??",1606802325,7,1

How Effective are Common Investment Strategies with Bitcoin? 

## About the [report](https://iconicholding.com/how-effective-are-common-investment-strategies-with-bitcoin/)

 To gain a deeper understanding of how effective common investment strategies are when applied to Bitcoin, Iconic Funds commissioned an empirical research report. The report was written by Philipp Rosenbach and Robert Richter, a research fellow at Frankfurt School Blockchain Center. Research partners included Enigma Securities and BTC-Echo.

kcvpro,ConTroll_no3,I'm banging my head against the wall," Last month I've turned 18. (18 in my country is the equivalent of 21 in the U.S. so from that age, I'm an ""adult""). I'm from a really conservative family, my parents always said that I could do whatever I want after I turned 18. Especially with my savings account, they opened it about 10 years ago. (I love them of course, but hey, it's the 21th century).  

Anyways I have been watching BTC and other cryptos since 2017, and I immeditely knew that these were for me. So I took student works and put (almost) all my income into BTC. Of course I had limited time to work because of my studies, but I did my best.   

Watching the price breakdowns, especially in this march was a hell for me. I knew that I have a saving account and I wanted to buy BTC at around 3k sooo bad. But you bet it, my parents wouldn't allow me to access to the account back then, before my 18th birthday.   

Then finally, the big day has arrived. I've became an ""adult"", got access to the account, and put all the money into BTC immediately. At around 17.2k price.   

And this is why I'm banging my head; if I would have turned into 18 \~9 month earlier, now I would have almost 5 BTC. Which would worth almost a 100k USD now. Holy cr\*p, what a missed (possibly life changing, at least for me) opportunity.   

Now I'm sitting on my almost 1 BTC, waiting for the mooning.  (I'm really grateful for what I have, but at the same time it hurts me really bad that I missed that one back in march. So damn close).   

Tl;dr: if any parent reads my story: if your children want to buy bitcoin with their pocket money/savings, let them to do!  Or buy them, and HODL until they become an ""adult"" :)",1607944217,20,1

2019-2020 haven't been fair to a lot of us, and things can look bad at times, dreadful even. But that's never ever a time to give up, because there's always people who love you, and sometimes, you've not even met them yet.

I was a nobody before I joined reddit, and still am just a guy busting his ass while looking after his elderly mother, but your kind gesture has changed my world from a place of sorrow, to a environment of hope.

Thank you so much to not only that kind redditor, but to all of you for being so damned wonderful.

I also remember someone saying that network fees can be reduced but the transfer will take longer.

\- Can I reduce the network fees? If so How?

ke6csu,facepalm5000,Idea for multisig compromised key detection,"Say you have a 2-of-3 multisig with master private keys A, B and C.

The 24 word backups of these keys are stored in 3 different locations.

A 2-of-3 multisig wallet is resilient for up to 1 private key getting compromised, but if an attacker acquired 2 of the private keys in the multisig 2-of-3 quorum (and has the xpubs for all 3 keys, presumably also stored with each of the private key backups), then they can exfiltrate all funds stored in the multisig wallet.

So if a single key gets compromised, it's possible to rotate out the compromised key by creating a new multisig wallet and transferring the funds to the new wallet. So if key C gets compromised, if you create a new multisig wallet with keys A, B and now D, and transfer the funds over before A or B get compromised, then you'll have avoided funds loss due to theft.

But the question is how do you know when a key is compromised? How do you know someone didn't find your seed phrase backup snap a quick photo of it and put it back into place with no evidence of tampering?

Possible solution: for each key A, B, C in the 2-of-3 multisig, also create a separate single sig wallet with 1 small UTXO. Then if any of those 3 UTXO's ever moves (assumption: an attacker who finds your key will always immediately sweep all funds found in obvious derivation paths of your key), you know the associated key is compromised, and can proceed quickly to move your funds to a new wallet before a second key is compromised. Separate accounts in the bip32 derivation path for the keys could be used in the single vs multisig wallets to ensure no address / public key reuse is happening between the multisig and single sig wallets.

So my question is: Are there any security problems or other risks with this setup? Is there any reason why this wouldn't be both safe to do and effective for detecting compromised keys?",1608112118,9,1

keaaor,Jsizzle19,Long-term Bitcoin Investment Question,"I am hoping someone on here would be able to provide me with some information or the answer  I’ve been searching for regarding Bitcoin. Please note, I am not anti-Bitcoin in anyway...

On a daily basis, I have seen or read articles about how Bitcoin is digital gold and will act as a store of value over time but one of my biggest concern is that it is the first iteration of a digital currency. I understand there is a limited supply, it’s divisible and you can take it anywhere, but what is preventing it from becoming obsolete? 

Right now, I feel it has a first mover effect on the market. The news is covering it, everyone is talking about it resulting in a FOMO effect which has everyone piling in to buy more. But for BTC to truly take over and become a long-term store of value, it will need to be adopted by the general public and used everywhere. But, say everything goes swimmingly for IOTA (for example purposes only, not trying to get bogged down in the details between the two) and it becomes vastly more efficient than BTC for transaction processing so merchants decide that IOTA is the only acceptable coin because it’s faster and cheaper to accept payments in the form of IOTA. Is there any mechanism that in place preventing everyone from jumping ship as more efficient coins are developed and utilized by the general public? By 2030 or 2040, why will Bitcoin continue to reign supreme over Ethereum?

Like I said, I am not trying to knock BTC down a peg, I’m simply looking for information/opinions on this type of question and I haven’t been able to find it except people spouting off the Bitcoin buzzwords like it’s digital gold, it’s an economic movement against the legacy systems, etc",1608129368,13,1

I have looked into [localbitcoins.com](https://localbitcoins.com) and some other sites that match people up to one another.... but it seems rife with scams, in-person seems to be a thing from the past, and certainly doesn't feel safe.  Any suggestions how someone would be able to buy bitcoins for IRL cash without banks being involved?",1608158895,10,1

kg3tmh,TheIceMenAreBack,Senator-elect plans to teach Congress how to use bitcoin to reduce national debt. Is the incoming administration pro-bitcoin?,"An incoming Senator believes bitcoin is a better store of value than paper money and plans to teach Congress how to use it to reduce the national debt.Senator-elect Cynthia Lummis told the What Bitcoin Did podcast that bitcoin is a better store of value than paper money and she plans to teach Congress how to use it to reduce the national debt when she assumes office in January. The senator, reportedly said, ""If we reach the point where we have overspent so much that things start crashing down, the black swan event occurs with any regard to any fiat currency...there is a backstop available to every government in the world and that backstop is bitcoin,"" Lummis said. The senator-elect also said that bitcoin is a better store of value than paper money because the cryptocurrency's supply is finite.

Bitcoin is indeed the currency of the 21st century, gone is the era of plastic money which has several flaws (e.g. being centralized and traceable). The Blockchain has several innovative dapps like online decentralized casino, [EarnBet](https://play.earnbet.io) which seeks to overthrow traditional casinos, Chain-link which has untamperable oracle services, and best of all, Ethereum which allows developers to create an app using its technology. Recently, even Coca-Cola expressed an interest in using its mainnet, showing its untapped potential and massive application. Lastly, bitcoin is inflation-proof and there is a direct correlation between an economy's inflation and the use of cryptocurrencies. For example, a decent population of Venezuela uses cryptocurrencies as they have finally realized how 'redundant' fiat is and inflation can distort its function of acting as money, i.e. serving as a store of value. The pump is only getting started!

ker5h4,informata85,The future of Bitcoin is not arbitrary answers to arbitrary complex equations.,"This has always come up in my mind with regards to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is energy intensive and wastes resources just to generate some arbritary answer to a complex equation.  This  solves nothing and does nothing. Why not evolve BITCOIN to do something more useful for mankind and become better than currency.

I remember the PS3 use to have a app called folding at home where peoples idle PS3 can be put to use by solving protein problems. Surely Bitcoin can evolve to that next step. What is currently being done is very wasteful in terms of energy use and the enrgy needed to manufacture the graphics cards to solve the complex arbritary equations.

Bitcoin mining machines can be repurposed to mine answers to complex real life questions such as protein folding, AI driving, Simulations, etc. Every answer provided will be worth xyz Bitcoins.

How this could work :

 People can write equations to complex questions and feed it to the current BITCOIN miners.  The miners process it and work out an answer. The answer is then worth XYZ bitcoins and is verified by AI software to ensure that both the equation and answer are not arbritrary. The faster the miner can compute the question the more bitcoins they will make, this gives them an incentive to push out more hardware. 

The real worth of the bitcoin will be based on answer provided and the value of each answer rated by AI and human reviewers. Example Bitcoin just solved a complex molecular protein folding to help assist in finding a cancer cure. This could be worth 20000 USD : 1 Bitcoin. 

The people who wrote the equation for the questions get paid by the company that needs an answer to a question. The miners get paid by providing the resources to compute that question. The price of bitcoin is reflected in how many total answers it can mine. This method will surely make all the mining eequipment more useful and justify its extensive energy use. 

&amp;#x200B;

Think of this like Bitcoin 2.0 where it actually solves a problem to a complex question .

&amp;#x200B;

Who ever makes this version of BITCOIN will be come the next Satoshi in the next evolution of  BITCOINS

keq5zx,Egoash,Finding 2009-2010 BTC,"Hello,  


There is about a 5% chance that this works out, but it is a chance. So, I figured I would ask. Around 2009-2010, while I was in college, I heard about BTC and mining. I had a gaming computer at the time and installed a mining program and allowed it to mine for a little while. I don't recall being overly thrilled about mining, there likely wasn't any money to be made, and I moved on. I still have this computer and the original HD. The OS may have been updated, but I often save the updated OS onto the new one. This may not have been the case going all the way back (note I said 5% chance).   


My questions: 1. What mining software would have been used, publicly spoken about online, during 2009-2010. Fall 09 to Spring 10.   
2. How would the BTC earned have been configured? I would have had to make a wallet? Right? Or, would it be through a provider?  


I am not a BTC ""master"" I know very little about it. I was simply a Computer Science major that thought it was interesting and let it mine for a little while. I never bought or sold BTC. Thank you all for your help!",1608178843,12,3

kepzm3,Electrical_Wonder596,Thank you,"In October, I joined Robinhood. Figured it would be fun and hopefully profitable. 

That’s when I first saw the bitcoin ticker. And it blew my mind. 

It was volatile, sure, but it always seemed to go up. After watching for a few weeks, I wanted in. 

By the time my money transferred, bitcoin went from $16k to $18k. I ended up buying at $18500. 

Then, the dip. 

I freaked out, thinking I’d made the worst mistake. I’m the only person I know who has BTC so there was no one to comfort or reassure me. So I turned to Reddit. 

This group gave me the courage to hodl when I so desperately wanted to cash out and run. And I’m so thankful. 

It’s easy to be optimistic about something that is performing well, but this goes beyond that. My initial goal was to make enough to pay off my house, and now I’m planning for long term hodling. 

So thank you. You helped me through that minor dip—my first major test—and now my family is literally richer because of you all.",1608178196,19,7

Seems to me atm that though there are real reasons for this upswing like paypal and square, I feel that many of these new investors won't HODL just like back then and a lot of these large whales coming in will sell to take their profits and as we come to that moment where we start to see the downswing every will panic sell and we'll be right back to where we were in the beginning of 2018.

I definitely hope I am wrong in this and the moment keeps pushing our rocket to the moon, but just as Warren has said before Be fearful, when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.

I know that It's just $20 and that for some of you it's basically a transaction fee but please bare with me because this may happen to you !

So I downloaded wasabi wallet from their website **Wasabi-1.1.12.3.msi** a few days ago.

Today I wanted to transfer some money from my other wallet to my wasabi wallet which I did as you can see here (transaction link : [https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qlddrshde7kv79z3jgrmhqa0x9s9glvhlq4kegp](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qlddrshde7kv79z3jgrmhqa0x9s9glvhlq4kegp) ) which happened within a couple of minutes and the transaction appeared directly in my wallet (I saw the balance in there) ! since wasabi doesn't have auto log out like Electrum when you close it I decided to delete my files and use the recovery seed when I want to log in again to see if everything works fine.

So to be sure everything is perfectly working I downloaded wasabi wallet again and used the recovery seed and filled all the informations but just as I entered my wallet you can definetely see that my balance is $0.00 (image link: [https://imgur.com/lh4QaMI](https://imgur.com/lh4QaMI) )

A world where bankers and financial gurus no longer have an impact on the livelihood of the common man. Bitcoin's adoption is a numbers game really, that's all it is.

Where is the ""new value"" coming from that seems to appear out of thin air when people buy Bitcoin?

**Example:**

If I trade 100 Euros for 120 Dollars, there is an underlying assumption that the value that the money represents is backed by the economy/worth of the issuing country/institution.  So there is a net value transaction (theoretically) of 0: I receive the same value that I give away, but in a different ""format"".

But because Bitcoin does not represent anything, if I buy Bitcoin for 100 Euros, the person selling me the Bitcoin receives 100 Euros of value that is ""backed"" by the EU's economy etc.

However, where is the value coming from that I receive when I receive the Bitcoin? It was mined from nothing (except from electricity, maybe - but that seems different).

to be honest, i believe japan and euro area have some of the world's biggest pension funds, and i personally have worked in asset management and have some exposure to pension clients too, but I am a bit surprised that 1% demand from them would ""only"" equate to $600 billion extra in bitcoin demand?! relative to current market cap of 430 billion.

I know every hodler here is very excited about the recent moves but if anyone could share some insights on institutions adoption on bitcoin would be great. 1% from pension funds and insurance from US europe and japan isn't going to happen anytime soon in my opinion...but of course it wouldn't stop corporate, hedge funds and family offices (and individuals) from getting into bitcoin.",1608219542,5,1

I'd like to limit the number of them made to 21,000 (.001 of the 21,000,000 BTC) and do a Hold'ers edition. Once they are gone...they are gone.

Just made my first purchase on binance (trying a different exchange) and stumbled across this (picture bellow) when trying to transfer.

I'm assuming I'm supposed to use the BTC option (damn the fee is higher than other exchange I've used before). 

But what are the other ones? if I choose the binance smart chain for example, will I receive the funds on my electrum wallet? Does it impact only fees/time?

&amp;#x200B;

Quite curious as to why elethereum is listed here.

kez0c9,RobertGOTV,Bitcoin: A Detailed Exploration of a 20k+ Future,"We did it. We’ve reached the tipping point. Bitcoin has surged past the 20k barrier into uncharted territory. The phrase “new normal” gets thrown around a lot thanks to covid, but we’re about to reach a new normal with bitcoin. Here are things you can expect:

-	Bitcoin gaining 5000 a day
-	Bitcoin traded on the NYSE
-	Governments buying huge swaths of Bitcoin in a crypto arms race
-	Registration requirements for Bitcoin ownership in some countries. Say hello to Crypto Swiss Banks.
-	Credit checks factoring in your crypto exposure.
-	Crypto-exclusive markets that will be challenged in court (Is it discrimination to refuse to sell products for fiat? Maybe not, but it's probably illegal to refuse legal tender.)
-	Bitcoin hitting 30k by Dec 31st. We’ll rocket to 100k by May 2021.
-	I expect Bitcoin to reach maturity in 2032. By my calculations, Bitcoin will be trading at 242 million a coin by then. Yes, that’s right. 1btc = $242,000,000.

What this tremendous influx of capital will do is build entire new industries. We’re seeing it already with ETFs and indices, but expect to see banking institutions offer crypto storage solutions next. Storage and security systems will be the first ventures to explode. These companies will design protocols that will be implemented by banks and exchanges and the “brick and mortar wallets” which house your bitcoin. In tandem, we will see the growth of bitcoin insurance policies. People and institutions will want to safeguard their digital assets, and these insurance providers will also be massively successful.

The rise of crypto wills. Obviously, people will want to leave bitcoins to their descendants, but more importantly will be the rise of bitcoin trusts. Expect philanthropic individuals to donate bitcoin to cities and foundations in the form of 100 year trusts that release the coins upon expiration. Given the long-term growth potential of bitcoins, you’ll also see trusts structured around monthly drips and it will be common to open bitcoin wallets upon a child’s birch which will transfer over when said child turns 18. Generational wealth disparity will skyrocket. What do crypto trusts lead to? Crypto bonds.

Okay, so what does the landscape look like now that we have crypto trusts and bitcoin in everyone’s retirement accounts? Well, these essentially remove the invested bitcoins from circulation via a cryptographically secure bitcoin time capsule. Past 2032, bitcoin inflation will have dropped so much, the market will move on and price in the expiration of various trusts (now referred to as crypto vaults or crypto capsules) coming to maturation. Let’s create an example.

Say that the US government buys 100million in bitcoin today and locks them in a 100yr crypto vault. That’s something like 4000 bitcoins. Now, by 2120, nearly every single bitcoin will have been mined and the reward will be a small fraction of a bitcoin. At this point, the largest source of bitcoin will be the release of the 4000 bitcoin fund (which, in 2120, will probably exceed 2020’s world GDP.) This is what the market will look like, but with thousands of varying-sized bitcoin vaults releasing to the market throughout each year. Speculators will try to pinpoint exactly how many of these coins will enter the market each day/month/year.

Comparisons will no longer have context to today’s terms. Trying to price out bitcoin in a hundred years is fruitless because it will change the fundamental nature of all economies. You might have a gallon of milk that costs four thousand dollars. A new Chevy truck might be north of 3 trillion. The average income might be 7k an hour. These numbers may be reasonable or borderline-population-uprising. Note that the numbers in this paragraph are totally arbitrary and I’m only trying to make the point that any gauge of price for any asset that far out will look like complete gibberish when compared to contemporary notions.

Except for one thing: Precious metals. In a hundred years, the market for precious metals will be about as profitable as the market for sunlight. There’s just an endless supply of gold, silver, et al which 2120 humans will be able to access via asteroid mining. Exploiting these resources will still be profitable, but the materials will only have manufacturing and aesthetic value.

Blockchain immortality. This might be the wildest notion, yet, but I believe the final evolution of blockchain technology will be the digital preservation of all conscious life in the galaxy. I want to avoid overly-technical jargon and sum it up as uploading your brain to the Matrix. Only, in this reality, instead of the Matrix, you will be living in a decentralized blockchain that has recorded all your thoughts and mapped all your neurons long after you’ve shuffled off your mortal coil. This HDB (human database or HumanBase) will be the most interconnected generation that’s ever existed, and possibly the final step for all sentient life. The interconnection might become so great that all people merge into some sort of hive mind, which I know sounds like an evil sci-fi trope, but think of it more as a massive, singular consciousness that contains all human knowledge (plus any aliens and animals we upload with us.) All individuals will contribute. At this point, we might be a post-bitcoin society in the same sense that we will have no scarcity and no currency. We might even become post-physical if all corporeal humans die out, leaving only the HDB. But don't fret! Since your DNA is in the blockchain, you can clone a new body any time you want to take a stroll on Old Earth.

So yeah, in conclusion, this was a big week for bitcoin. Looking forward to the future.",1608217375,14,4

For years they stood on the sidelines and mocked HODLers during the bad times. I hoped that they would at least have the integrity to acknowledge if things didn't go as they predicted. Sadly, it seems many are just going to keep making the same prediction, waiting to gloat the one time they get it right. Ironically, they hate it when people do this with stock market crashes

So I just want to recognise your achievement on getting to a point many said you never would reach. Anyone who has had the belief and discipline to HODL through thick and thin deserves congratulations on those diamond hands

I appreciate many of you are not doing this as a speculative investment and you do not care what the price is doing at any given time. So I understand my congratulations will mean little to you

kf40qu,No-Toe-2141,"What Bitcoin Is, Where Bitcoin Has Come To","What do you all think about the monetary value of bitcoin of this point? It seems almost absurd how bullish people are about the price of Bitcoin at this point, the idea that it will just skyrocket into the realm of millions and that this will be sustainable (which may perhaps be true, but it is questionable), but I am not sure how I feel about Bitcoin being a bubble. 

A bubble is a situation where there is extreme fanaticism among speculators that the price will just skyrocket massively, leading to immense buying which further vindicates them and leads to more buying, but at some point, in some cases, the bubble bursts. Some people say it is because the perceived value no longer matched the inherent value of the asset, but when you think about it, even “inherent value” is ultimately not objective, it depends on what our values are: for instance, while gold is in fact scarce, gold is valuable not just because of its scarcity but the fact that people find it to be worth possessing for some reason. For example, if there was some extremely scarce chemical that had an odor so terrible it instantly caused PTSD, and we somehow knew there were no technological, scientific, or other uses in which this chemical would be at all practical, despite its scarcity, its value be essentially nothing. 

Or like with the tulip mania in the Netherlands: one could argue that tulips were not inherently valuable, that all they were was beautiful, but if people felt they were valuable, that makes them valuable. Even with things that some might deem more inherently valuable due to their ‘practical’ uses, those practical uses ultimately serve some end, and that end is something we value just because we do. For instance, even when it comes to things like food or water which we humans need to survive, they are only valuable if we value survival.

So the question is: what really is a bubble, what is Bitcoin’s “inherent value” if that concept even makes sense, and is Bitcoin in a bubble?",1608232498,13,2

kh0623,trumpmaniaohyeahbaby,China Can Destroy Bitcoin?,"""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you...""

BTC passed through the first two stages now we are approaching the fight stage.  So it seems to me a good time to start ""war gaming"" some of these scenarios.  I see a few vectors they attack may come through.

1. US legal regulation and banning
2. Infiltration of bitcoin core developers and btc communist leaders to try and hijack the code
3. China network attack

In this thread in particular I'd like to know whether 3 is a valid issue and if China did undertake a network attack how would bitcoin network stop it?

China is uniquely able to launch an attack for a few reasons.  First, they are powerful.  Second, they have a secretive tyrannical government who is capable of launching just about any type of attack on anything if they feel it advances their goals.  Third, the majority of miners are in China.  Fourth, most mining chips are made in China.

As far as I know, the majority of miners could create havoc if they wanted to.  Then, to make things worse, there would be no easy way for the bitcoin network to adapt (fork??) because China has control of the computer chips that mine so they could stop selling the chips or use the chips to overwhelm any new fork.

Plus, if you have confusion and chaos on the network just once, this could permanently stop universal adoption.  To be sure, many people could still accept it and buy in, but, many and especially financial institutions could see that and immediately sell and never buy in again.

kgzujz,sail987654,Some quick and simple way to make some bitcoins,"As per their bio, https://bitsybay.com is a platform to buy and sell digital goods for bitcoins.

What’s the glitch? You asked. Well, this website is currently offering 10% discounts on a minimum cart value of $100, 30% discounts above $399, and 50% off above $999. This platform allows anyone to become a vendor and start selling digital/downloadable goods on their website and the first 5 sales are free of charges on all products sold by vendors as a X-Mass promotion. The vendors are paid through their split coins method. You can read more about it on their website FAQ.

Like any other eCommerce based portal, they do not charge the vendors/sellers on the discount coupons.

Vendors are not charge any selling fees for the first 5 sales.

How can I exploit these offers? Now comes the most interesting part.

Step 1. Just apply as a vendor on their website and wait for your account to get approved. Make sure to enter every information carefully and make it looks legitimate.

Step 2. Once your accounts get approved, list one or two products for sale. As always make sure that everything looks genuine

Step 3. Create another customer account and purchase your own listed products and apply the discount promo-code.

  Now let’s do some calculations; the 10% discount code will give you $10 profit.

  The 30% discount code of cart value $399 brings the final cart value to $279.30. 

  You get $399 on your vendor account.

  Profit= ( $399- $279.30)= $119.70

  Similarly, the 50% discount coupon on cart value $999 gives a profit of 50% i.e., 500$

At the top of these threats IMO is the price manipulation of arising from USDT. Although this was a hot topic in 2017, given that the supply has doubled (+$10B) in the last three months it seems worthy to discuss. 

For those curious enough I highly recommend this [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.12903) which provides strong empirical evidence of this manipulation. Moreover, it highlights the interconnectivity of USDT amongst exchange exchanges which offers further credibility to this claim.

On the flip side, I guess these nefarious events are intrinsic to any unregulated financial asset which BTC's past is riddled with. But the billion dollar question is whether this has the potential to become an existential thread.

Hello eveyone!

I finally bought a Trezor T and created a new backup seed.

Transfered some coins to this wallet seed.

Now I enabled passphrase and created a new wallet. the seed+passphrase.

Now I send some coins to this seed+passphrased wallet.

Now I disable passphrase on my trazer. Just so ""intruders"" wont suspect i've a passphrased hidden wallet incase they get access to my trezor.

So now i only use my default seed as my wallet and only I know i've a extra passphrassed wallet for long term hodling.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Can I enable passphrase in like 10 years and get access to my hidden coins?
2. Can I restore my seed+passphrase on all types of wallets, like electrum?
3. Is there any other risks with passphrases I dont understand?

kgyfj0,d-resistance,My personal story and reflections on the future of bitcoin,"Hey everybody. I would like to share my personal story and my reflections on the future of bitcoin. Board the time machine and go back somewhere in 2011. So imagine a man who has some quests but is not a programmer nor an expert in technological issues. 

I often visited a website that periodically displayed a small ad at the bottom of the laptop screen. The ad was a simple label that had the symbol of bitcoin and was flashing. To tell the truth, the first time I didn't pay any attention. As time went on the flashing advertising appeared more and more often and began to become annoying. For some reason which I still have not identified one day after a few months after I had seen the ad, I looked to see what bitcoin is finally as the flashing ad had haunt me :) 

I read over and over again what bitcoin is and how it works without understanding many things. Besides, it took me a while to figure out what blockchain is and how it works. The words that caused me the most interest were ""decentralization"" and ""anonymity."" I was always fascinated by the anonymity of the internet and I had a little knowledge of the early tor era. However, I still didn't understand how underground digital currency works. But the germ had got inside me. So I built a bitcoin wallet by carefully reading what I need to do. New words entered my life like public key and private key. I had an unprecedented enthusiasm for the whole venture without knowing, of course, what was going to happen after many years. And then the question arose. How I would get bitcoin. I was reading that the era when someone did cpu mining had passed and had been replaced by gpu mining. It all seemed so complicated to me. So I decided to sell 3 vinyl records of my personal collection to whoever wanted and in return I wanted him to send me bitcoin. I was disappointed since no one had bitcoin as well as no one was in the mood to buy bitcoin to buy 3 albums. After a time a buyer was found. The great moment of buying and selling had arrived. And yet it was true. At last I had bitcoins, and almost running I sent the vinyl records by post. This method continued for some time without finding enough buyers. If I'm not mistaken I sell vynils 2 times for bitcoins. 

At the same time I was looking for security and anonymity software and I took computer use seriously. From 2013-14 I stopped using windows and I was very careful in using the computer since bitcoin and its mode of operation had put me for good in thoughts. It is a fact that any cryptocurrencies I own I did not buy them by sending money through a bank to acquire them. It is a fact also that I followed (without knowing it then) the anonymous method of obtaining by keeping my anonymity.

Beyond the profit that many people are happy about, beyond proving that bitcoin is a boulder of the global economy, I am concerned about whether its holders will really remain anonymous. Let's not kid ourselves. Apart from some who do mining and remain in deep anonymity, to acquire bitcoin today must give your personal information, your identity and more. Does the process that cryptocurrency exchanges follow adhere to bitcoin's whitepaper in terms of anonymity? How anonymous is a bitcoin address when the Bitcoin seller knows your phone, your address and your bank? And in the worst case the administrators of cryptocurrency exchange websites do not have in their databases thousands people? Who guarantees that the names of all these people sooner or later will not have access to the banks or some other state apparatus? Apart from the profit with the skyrocketing price of bitcoin is it good that companies like microsoft, apple and recently Elon Musc have been investing in bitcoin in the last month? I suggest you read about the new CPUs of microsoft computers, and you will understand very well why I mention the above.

Everything I mention is not a product of conspiracy. It's reality.

In order to avoid misunderstanding, I make it clear that everything I mention has to do with how certain companies manage bitcoin and not bitcoin itself. 

The above is an important reason why I turned to privacy coins. They are the last refuge for those who really seek anonymity and reverently adhere to bitcoin whitepaper.

A few scattered thoughts. I'm sorry if I tired you.

kgy7rm,Uldregirne,Where could Bitcoin go?," 

I have had a lot of people asking me about how high the bitcoin price can go, and I thought I should share my mental approaches to different values.

Firstly, anyone new to the space should look at the stock-to-flow model by PlanB. ([https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25)) ([https://digitalik.net/btc/](https://digitalik.net/btc/)). 

Fancy models aside, the quickest way to “price” BTC is to think about what it could replace. 

Gold’s market capitalization is $9 Trillion. Divided by 20 million bitcoin to make math easy/to account for lost coins, we see that if Bitcoin were to replace gold each BTC would be worth $450,000.

The Fed’s Balance sheet is $7.2 Trillion, or $360,000 per BTC. ([https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst\_recenttrends.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm))

World governments currently hold 12 Trillion in currency reserves. If 5% were in bitcoin, that’s $30,000 per BTC. If the reserves are 100% in BTC, that is $600,000 per BTC.  ([https://data.imf.org/?sk=E6A5F467-C14B-4AA8-9F6D-5A09EC4E62A4](https://data.imf.org/?sk=E6A5F467-C14B-4AA8-9F6D-5A09EC4E62A4))

The USA’s GDP before the pandemic was $21 Trillion, or $1,050,000 per BTC if our economy switched the BTC from dollars. ([https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US))

The US national debt is $27.5 Trillion, or $1,375,000 per BTC. A quick note, this means the US government owes more money than the entire country produces in a year. Literally, a 100% taxation rate for a year would not eliminate our debt. ([https://www.usdebtclock.org/](https://www.usdebtclock.org/))

Advanced economies like the USA have a total GDP of $55 Trillion, or $2,750,000 per BTC. ([https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPGDP@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPGDP@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD))

Interestingly emerging markets and developing economies have a total GDP of $75 trillion, or $3,750,000 per BTC. It is important to note here that this means the developing countries currently have more wealth than the established ones, and this is where BTC is seeing the most use. Bitcoin representing 10% of all transactions would be a price of $375,000 per BTC. ([https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPGDP@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPGDP@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD))

Total World Gross Product is $130 Trillion, or $6,500,000 per BTC. If you think that 25% of the world economy will one day be transacted in BTC, that is $1,625,000 per BTC. ([https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPGDP@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPGDP@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD))

Total Global Debt is $277 Trillion, or $13,850,000 per BTC, if you believe in the future all debt will be denominated in BTC just like foreign debt is often denominated in US Dollars. ([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/coronavirus-drives-global-debt-to-a-new-record-high.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/coronavirus-drives-global-debt-to-a-new-record-high.html))

By this point, you get the name of the game. I may not know where exactly we are going, but at least I am confident of the direction.

However whole process of making a paper wallet was too confusing (and, I most likely would find a way to lose it) and ledger etc are still bit expensive, what are my ways to safely hold my coins? If I use app wallet that gives my mnemonic, it still should be safer than holding the coins in trading app wallet, right?

Haven't checked sub for this but thought that I might as well ask it here - what's the best place to buy coins currently?

My hypothesis is that because the stat is representing a percentage of users, not transactions themselves, that there must be small subset of user selling a disproportionately high volume of BTC to a much larger subset of users who are buying in smaller amounts.

2. Is it as secure? (I know with nano you write down 24 words as a recovery (or is that a standard with all store bought ledgers?), do i get to to do that with electrum?
3. If i want to transfer and sell my crypto, does electrum cover that? (if this sounds stupid, apologies, have no clue)

kiwqe5,viral2100,How Does Bitcoin Mining Work? Step by Step Guide for Beginners,,1608742876,0,1
kiwnpn,Anon-Dude-Bitcoin,I previously went all-in on BTC. Here's my story.,"Anonymous account for obvious reasons but I wanted to share my story.

I started buying Bitcoin in June of 2017. I continued to buy small amounts as the price increased. I was convinced I would ""never"" be able to afford an entire Bitcoin but I kept at it. I was only making about $59k per year at the time and still trying to pay off what had started off as over $100,000 in student loan debt. 

Like many others, I was discouraged by some of my purchasing decisions (like buying at 17k), but I kept buying until I had my first whole Bitcoin around October of 2018. Even then, I was only down about 35% because I had made purchases starting in June of 2017. Then, shit hit the fan in November of 2018 and I watched as I was suddenly down more than 65%. My bags were heavy and I truly understood this was the despair stage. However, I didn't give up and I actually bought another full Bitcoin at $4,100 in April of 2018 despite feeling like my anus had been stretched to the max.   


I didn't really buy any more Bitcoin after that for a long while. I felt that I had reached the ""don't invest more than you can afford to lose"" limit and I was a member of the 10 million club with my 2.1 BTC. I paid off debt, lived life, fixed up my house, etc. I thought I was done buying Bitcoin. I finally ""broke even"" around the $7,700 price mark.   


Fast forward to March of 2020 when we crashed because of Covid, I was kicking myself because I didn't really have money at the time to buy more. I only had a couple thousand in an emergency fund and I don't touch that unless there is a true emergency.   


Then a perfect storm happened. I got a new job close by that was paying significantly more money and I needed to sell my house. A house that I had built up a lot of equity in over a short period of time. I went from only having a $2,000 emergency fund (plus 2.1 Bitcoin that was worth about $22,000 at the time) and a standard 401k from my previous employer worth about 55k, to about $65,000 in cash from the sale of my house and $55k in a 401k that I could now put into an IRA.   


I put 10% down on the purchase of a new home, bought some stuff, and I had $30,000 in cash once the dust settled. At first, I thought that money would simply be my 3-6 month emergency fund and it would sit in cash in my checking account, earning 0.0007% interest. That's the responsible thing to do, right? Around this same time, I pulled my 401k from my previous employer in part because they wouldn't let me buy GBTC.  I found an IRA provider who allowed me to buy GBTC and I sent the money over. It took me 7 years to build up a 401k worth $55,000. (I think I averaged about 13% annual returns).    


Between the cash and the new IRA, I had over $85,000 just sitting on the sidelines, waiting to pull the trigger. This was more money than I had ever had before. BTC sat around $9,000 for several weeks and I was convinced we would retrace back down to 7 or 8k before the next bull cycle. I hesitated out of fear, because of all the FUD surrounding Covid.   


Then I saw the news about Microstrategy, then the price pumped to over 11k (Fuck! I can't buy 3 whole Bitcoin anymore with my 30k). I knew I was FOMOing in, but I figured it wouldn't matter much in 10 years if I bought at 9.5k or 10k or 11k. I think seeing institutional investors was the thing that pushed my hand to go ""all-in"". That, and I still have a good 30 years of work ahead of me so if I go bust, then at least I can start again. I bought $30,000 worth of Bitcoin at $11,100 and I bought about $55k worth of GBTC when BTC was around $11,300.   


Now, I've more than doubled my net worth in a matter of months and it feels fucking great. Altogether, I've put about $100,000 into Bitcoin which is now worth more than $260,000. I'm hopeful for the future and I think 2021 is going to be a great year for Bitcoin. I don't plan on selling my Bitcoin for anything other than paying off my mortgage. I've already decided that whenever my $30,000 BTC buy becomes enough to pay capital gains taxes and my mortgage, I will sell. I'm making the decision now so that I won't have to later. I will always HODL at least 2.1 BTC to give to my kid or a charity if my kid turns out to be a little shit.  I'll start to sell some of my GBTC in 20 years when I'm getting ready to retire. I hope they launch a Bitcoin ETF before then so that I don't have to pay 2% every year. I've already been through a full bull/bear cycle so I feel I am better prepared for when it happens next. I've only sold once before early on, and I regretted it so now I have diamond hands.

I've tried adding the spaces, leaving the last word off, using the number value of the mnemonic pair instead. Each time I try to restore it, the wallet's empty. I know I have like 0.2 Bitcoins on there at least. I'm hoping much more.

kjyo2b,greenwood_19,3 Tips for Getting Started with Cryptocurrency Trading,[removed],1608901222,0,1
kjyl4c,greenwood_19,3 Tips for Getting Started with Cryptocurrency Trading,"  Cryptocurrency trading is not easy, especially to beginners, not only security risks but also the volatility of the crypto market: the prices may soar or dropdown at ANY time! So, what makes a successful crypto trader?

**First,** always be in mind that there is a relationship between risk and reward. The greater the risk you take, the greater your reward will be if you come out on top.

**Secondly**, keep track of community discussion and news events since industry news and rumors has powerful effects price of cryptocurrencies. Being a crypto trader means to have active social accounts (such as Facebook, Twitter or Telegram ) in the Blockchain community in order to take advantage of the power of information. 

**Last but not at least**, rely on technology! As mentioned at the beginning, crypto trading is much relating to the variety and volatility of the prices. Each crypto exchange has its value for specific cryptocurrencies, and this may be due to multiple reasons. The successful crypto trader is the one who takes advantage of the price difference by buying cheap cryptocurrency from one exchange and selling it with higher price on another IMMEDIATELY. A cryptocurrency arbitrage tool is exactly what you need. Thanks to the development of technology, there are so many Crypto Arbitrage tools that help investors profit from pricing discrepancies. Below is a list of the best Crypto Arbitrage tools that I have ever tried:

**1.** **CFOLO (FREE)**

**Pros:**

· Totally free

· Various integrated exchanges

· Easy to use

· Easily find the best exchange for your chosen token pairs 

· Easy profit calculator for calculating profit if you don't want to transfer coin too many times

**Cons:**

· No suggestions for the best pair. Traders must look based on the token they know

· Only English supported

**2.** **BITSGAP**

https://preview.redd.it/95g250coxb761.png?width=1357&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3401b02258f0733766441563c7f8f643659555d

**Pros:**

· There are other products to choose from besides Arbitrage

· Be able to be traded directly to the exchanges

**Cons:**

· Expensive monthly fees

· Limited number of exchanges and trading pairs

Hopefully, 3 things above have given you a foundation for success as a cryptocurrency trader. Though, the most important thing, in my opinion, is to keep your self -control: to understand your feeling, especially your fear and greed. Remember that: bad trades are parts of the game; success simply means you win more than you lose",1608900815,0,1

I'd prefer to use two separate accounts for trading and buying crypto to hold, because it can get confusing. Are multiple Binance accounts allowed under the same name and IP address? If this is allowed, will I be able to use the same form of ID to verify the second account. For example, if I used my drivers licence to verify my first account, can I then use that for my second account as well?
Finally, is Binance a good option for frequent UK bank transfers? Are they quite quick with processing transfers? What are the fees for adding GBP into my Binance account to then buy crypto with (UK Bank to Binance)?

This is due to the fact that just now (1544 Eastern) I just got block 663096) and it had been on the previous block up until then all the while Blockstream's block explorer was running 663096.  Any folks out there have any similar issues they had experience with and how / why it would happen or steps to correct this?

I have been obsessed with the idea of Bitcoin for awhile but do not come from money, so I have had to absolutely grind to make my money a lot more than others, especially after my work closed and received no unemployment benefits. I started trading in the stock market 6 months ago turning 1k into 12k along with allocating enough funds for about .05 BTC and 1 ETH currently. I keep hearing ""you should own .28 BTC"" which makes me feel like I am not exposed enough. This has put me in a pretty big financial dilemma in which should I dump half of my trading gains from the year into Bitcoin to get me to that .28 threshold and cut my opportunity cost in trading in half that I have worked so hard for the past 6 months or not? Do I just take enough out to where I own .1 BTC and have 10k to start 2021 trading with? Or is .05 good enough to make a decent fortune under the assumption this is a LONG investment, as I am only 22 years old with the idea of holding for decades.

I do. It simply *feels* bad to buy in these moments, even though a part of my rational mind knows perfectly that it would be a wise decision in the long-term. 

**So I developed a mind hack for these times.**

Let's take today as an example. As of this writing the price hovers around 25.9k. It feels bad to buy at these levels because the memory and ""hope"" of 21k, 22k, 24k, etc. still lingers in my head. 

What I do in these situations (either consciously or unconsciously) is that I imagine the price at a higher level. 30k for instance. One could say that I project my decision into the future.

What would I feel about my decision of buying BTC at 25.9k when the price is already at 30k and still pumping?

klq0hl,bitcoincito,I need some inspiration to finish an improbable bitcoin journey started six years ago.,"Six years ago, I had an idea that I decided to call ""Project Bitcoin"": I wanted to turn a Peruvian Sol coin (worth about 30 cents) into a house through a series of international transactions using bitcoin. [kind of like the paper clip guy but showcasing the power of bitcoin] 

I hoped to shine a light on the power of bitcoin to change lives and support increasingly large decentralized, global transactions. And a house would be cool too!

It worked... and fast. In 9 transactions I turned that coin into 3.1 bitcoin. You can read about it on the website I set up 6 years ago: http://www.projectbitcoin.com. 

Then life got in the way. Or maybe I wasn't creative enough. Or maybe I saw myself seeing some success and got scared - as I've often done. 

Whatever the reason: I stopped. For six years. 

Now, because of the sheer momentum of bitcoin - and none of my own - I am closer to that house than I deserve to be, or than I ever thought possible. 

And I'm realizing, as the most painful year in many of our lives comes to an end, that I have a chance to add a bit of light, experience a bit of light, and see this crazy project through to completion. 

I just don't know how. 

I would love some ideas, inspiration, motivation to help me get this across the finish line.

km8smj,facepalm5000,Aesop's Lost Fable: The Grasshopper and the Bitcoiners," Recently scholars found a previously unknown and very prophetic variation of Aesop's famous fable ""The Grasshopper and the Ants"". After translating from the original ancient Greek, this variation was found to called: The Grasshopper and the Bitcoiners.

The text is translated as follows:

In a field one day during the economic summer, a Grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart's content. The Grasshopper liked to spend all of his money as soon as he earned it to purchase all the latest gadgets and shiny new cars, and had an expensive house much larger than he actually needed, which was full of the finest chairs of all shape and variety. 

The Grasshopper came across a group of Bitcoiners focused and engaged in honest work whom he saw immediately convert their wages into something called satoshis to stack and hodl them for the long term in non-custodial deep cold storage with 2/3 multisig and redundant, geographically distributed steel backups for their bip39 seed phrases. ""What a curious thing,"" the Grasshopper thought to himself.

The Grasshopper addressed one of the Bitcoiners who had a particularly prominent beard and wore a large cowboy hat: ""Why are you working so hard just to get that useless nerd money? Don't you know it has no intrinsic value? You can't even use it to buy coffee! The transaction fees are too high and it doesn't scale. And besides, the government keeps giving out free fiat money and cheap loans to anyone who needs it. Not sure where it comes from, but it's just endless free cash, so why not take it? Don't look a gift horse in the mouth they say. Now is the time to play, not work!""

""We see it differently. For an honest day's work, we Bitcoiners can each stack about 1,000,000 sats. We store the fruits of our labor in mankind's hardest money ever conceived, protected behind a growing wall of encrypted energy, able to transport value across space and time with no trusted 3rd party and no energy loss. It is the economic summer now and it is the time to work and save money, because the economic summer doesn't last forever. Eventually winter will come. Few understand this."" said the Bitcoiner with the large hat and beard.

The Bitcoiner continued: ""And I suggest you consider doing the same. Governments and central banks can't keep printing money forever. Debt to GDP ratios can't grow forever. QE and MMT are extremely dangerous. Money printing leads to moral hazard and capital misallocation at enormous scale. Fiat value always trends towards zero. Bitcoin's price may seem volatile now when denominated in fiat terms, but we're still in the price discovery phase, and it might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. Also, the network gets more secure every day as new miners contribute more hash power, and the network becomes more valuable as each new participant joins, per Metcalfe's law. Just run the numbers and you'll see. "" 

""QE doesn't cause inflation. MMT is the future. Recessions and the constraints of economic scarcity are a thing of the past. The national debt doesn't matter, it's just money we owe to ourselves. Money should be spent, not hoarded. Bitcoin is rat-poison squared. It's just a fad, a tulip bubble, "" sang the Grasshopper. ""Now I'm going to get more of those cheap fiat loans so I can buy more and nicer chairs and finish my master's degree in Keynesian economics with a specialization in the underwater-weaved-basket futures market.""

The Bitcoiner replied, ""If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry. Though it grieves me, unfortunately all I can say to you is 'have fun staying poor'."" and went on his way with the other Bitcoiners as they continued their hard work earning, stacking and hodling.

The Grasshopper replied, ""Yeah, I'll be having a lot of fun. Life is one big party, but not for you poor maxis"".

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gradually then suddenly, the economic summer turned to economic winter. At first, all the free money, cheap credit and stimulus began to dry up. Then existing fiat savings suddenly plunged in value, as plebs all over the world began to dump fiat when they could no longer avoid the realization that world fiat currencies were just elaborate and highly successful shitcoin scams. Fiat cantillionaires exit-scammed hard when they realized the jig was about to be up, leaving taxpaying citizens with enormous debts but crumbling infrastructure and institutions.  The Grasshopper found himself #rekt Weimar-style holding large fiat bags. Even the Grasshopper's stock portfolio was full of #rekt zombie companies whose suppliers of cheap credit had dried up and now could no longer finance operations and were shuttering. Economic contagion, counterparty risk and solvency crises were rampant. The exchange rate of satoshis to all fiat currencies soared mercilessly. Hyperbitcoinization had crossed the chasm. The only thing one could trust now was the one thing which required no trust: the Bitcoin network.

Realizing his unfavorable economic outlook, the Grasshopper staggered to the Bitcoiners' Citadel of steel and concrete. He saw them grilling large, juicy wagyu steaks.  ""Real food!"" cried the Grasshopper, who had been subsisting on soy and cricket protein crackers for the last few months. He begged them for 800 sats so he could pay his rent for the month.

""What! You don't have ANY sats?"" cried the Bitcoiners in surprise, ""didn't you listen after the 1st halving when we told you to buy? didn't you listen after the 2nd halving? the 3rd? the 4th? You had years and years, and you couldn't even DCA a tiny bit of fiat into satoshis as an insurance policy? You had the whole economic summer to put away some corn for the economic winter, but you didn't?  What in the world have you been doing since Jan 3rd, 2009?""

""I didn't have time to stack sats,"" complained the Grasshopper; ""My time preference was too high. I didn't understand how much counterparty risk I had assumed by holding so much fiat. I was content making 10% nominal gains per year in my diversified stock portfolio, not realizing with inflation at 15% per year, I was actually losing 5% per year in real terms, and progressively getting poorer. I just did what the politicians told me to do. I trusted them. I didn't notice each year more and more chairs were being taken out of the room, because I thought the fiat music would never stop. I didn't realize that it was all just one big unsustainable boomer ponzi fiat credit bubble hamster wheel hot potato mirage and that I should have been stacking.""

The Bitcoiner with the large hat and beard, who years ago had tried to convince the Grasshopper of the merits of stacking sats, shook his head in pity for the Grasshopper who had become poor. The Bitcoiner spoke, ""While I cannot simply give you sats, I can trade you sats in exchange for your labor, just as I traded my labor for sats so many years ago. We need to fortify the walls of our Citadel of steel and concrete, and I could put you to work helping with the construction. I will gladly pay you 100 sats for an honest day's work.""

Sighing, the Grasshopper, who had not had fun staying poor after all, agreed to work for 100 sats each day.

The End.",1609222914,4,1

km71qy,shdk85,Clarification about hardware wallets,"Hi everyone,

wondering if someone can clarify something for me. I have a very small amount of Bitcoin that I transferred to a hardware wallet (ledger nano s) a while ago. I also have my 24 word key phrase/chart stashed away in a safe place that’s different from where my usb wallet is.
So far so good.

My question is:

If I loose my hardware wallet (e.g. a house fire or what not), are all my holdings gone? Or can I recover them just by the 24 word key phrase somehow?

Or is that 24 word chart just for getting access to my hardware wallet in case I loose my pin that I use to gain access to it?

I’m pretty much just planning on holding the small amount I have for 20-30 years, and have it be a nice surprise for my children should things work out. Is there a better way to do this? What if the usb stick storage stops working? Am I out of luck? Should I print my private keys on a piece of paper to keep safe? What’s the best approach for planning on holding for 10-30 years?

So many questions - appreciate anyone that can help guide me in the right direction.

I am relatively knowledgeable in how bitcoin, the blockchain, wallets, etc work in the way an average person might understand how to use the Internet. 

That said, I’m a dummy and back in July my bitcoin.com app wallet was acting up and not loading. I reached out to support and didn’t hear anything back. 

So, I had the bright idea to uninstall and reinstall the app; derp.

Bitcoin.com is a non custodial wallet(they RECENTLY added a feature to have a returning login option 🙄). But, basically I did not back up, screenshot, or save my seed phrase before uninstalling and reinstalling. 

That caused the app to generate new wallets when I downloaded it again. 

My question is this. Since every time you open the app on your device, it recognizes it and takes you back to your same wallet(provided you don’t delete it and install it again between sessions in the app like an idiot), is it possible I could somehow reset my phone from a specific backup to the date and time where the wallet in question would have been associated with the current download iteration of the app and potentially recover the wallet?

I think market cap comparison is fun but there are other important factors to consider. 

If you look at gold mining for example you see that there was about 3300 tons of gold mined in 2019 which is nearing $200 billion if my math is correct. For bitcoin mining to do the same we need more than 11 trillion market cap at the current mining reward.

Also not all bitcoins are for sale at any given moment. Many are lost and others held for retirement or long term storage. Buying $billions worth bitcoin today is not easy because they might not be for sale at the moment and if you buy them there will be less available. Although some will liquidate at higher prices.

knakcq,dickingaround,Don't forget your roots,"Which is to say, bitcoin's 'success' is still unlikely. That's why the returns are so good. This is a deflationary currency and we've been fighting over inflation/deflation and hard vs. fiat currencies for centuries. 

For example, gold standard got clobbered quite swiftly in the US in the great depression. By \*executive order\* (i.e. not even an act of congress) Roosevelt made gold illegal to own [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive\_Order\_6102](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102). Some people were prosecuted. And many today look at those inflationary acts of the 30s as being good/critical to getting us out of the great depression. Bitcoin is designed to make such actions impossible; impossible to seize, impossible to inflate. When bitcoin becomes strong enough to deliver on that promise not just for a few of us but for most people, and everyone realizes what has happened, bitcoin will be attacked. People who believe inflation is good will attack it. I don't know how they'll attack it, and it'll be hard to stamp out entirely but they can hurt it. 

What we have going for us is that inflation might not be what society really needs. Maybe we shouldn't be increasing employment by bringing people back to work at a lower real wage because they see a larger number (i.e. tricking people back to work for a lower real wage instead of letting them stick to their guns to make what they think they deserve). Maybe the great depression would have worked itself out without inflation. Maybe the people in power want to preserve their wealth so much they need BTC as much as the rest of us do. 

I'm just saying, it's not a sure thing. It's a complex political, economic thing. It always has been.",1609361590,12,1

Can't believe im this retarded, now I tried everything in chat with this guy to give me my money back but he still won't even admit that he is a scammed, yet won't refund or take my call/video call.

So yes bitcoin hype is here again, I didn't follow bitcoin since the last crash 2018. But talks from some friends that bitcoin is up again would let me take again a look into my binance. 
A lot of good news, a lot of alts developed pretty good, so I decided to get some gains as everyone.
So I looked into some projects and thought about bots.
So I decided to try some trading bot.
Quadency.
I joined the telegram and asked if someone tried this bot and if it's any good.
Got an PM from the guy named and looked like the admin. Rest is now history.

Don't be dumb like me.. 0.2btc is now a lot of money.
It really kills me right now.

Is there any possibility to get any of my btc back?

What I did was made a Coinbase account, did those educational quizzes that reward you with free alt coins, traded those for some Bitcoin and a few others, and put in like $150 to buy some more crypto. Just was thinking to myself I would buy and hold some stuff and I don't care if I lose $150. I haven't taken it off of the Coinbase wallet. Well I didn't even think for a second about any tax implications for this. I'm a regular old W-2 worker, I don't have a CPA or make much money, I just got caught up in the excitement. I know it's not much money, but am I better off getting rid of this until I am more financially stable and literate? Or is that worse for me to sell it off?

kn9jjs,electriccars,Wish I had split my income between Bitcoin and Debt since 2017.,"I first heard about Bitcoin in 2012, when I was offered one for $10... I bought a silver dime instead. Still have it. 

I finally bought a coin when it spiked to $1000! Then it crashed, and I bought 2 more a year later for $300 each. Well when it broke the all time high of $1000 again I tried my hand at trading and lost most of what I had. That year 2017 my whole family invested a lot... And lost that bet. We HODLed all the way down to $3400, and strategically sold because we felt it would be a 2 year bear market and we would buy back in once we caught up in other ways financially (lots of credit card debt).

Well we never did but what back what we sold. All in all we lost about $50k total. I spent the next 2 years working on my debt while Bitcoin stayed relatively low, though admittedly higher than when we sold.

I paid off my debt completely, and have my own apartment, and own my used car outright, and have a decent emergency fund in the bank.

But I can only think with pain how much more money I would have if I had split my paychecks between the debt and Bitcoin. If I had I would have been over $100k richer than I am right now.

But that's nothing compared to if I'd put just $1000 into it back in 2012. I'd have $3,000,000 today. Sigh. At least I can take comfort in the fact I probably would've lost it in the Mt Gox fiasco.

kehsz2,imgonnabeatit,The Big Pump-and-Dump (MUST READ!),"Hi guys,

Do you think there's any truth to the conspiracy theory about Bitcoin's ""Golden Circle"" (basically a group of high elite's praying on the mindset that there's going to be a global currency switch), manipulating the markets so they can inflate the bubble and pumping the system.

They could have gone with any crypo-currency (dogecoin for example) and all it takes is for the value of the asset to increase. The more it increases, the more faith the bubble gets. 

I TRUELY believe this is inevitable (unless something is done) and this might be something Bitcoin should look into protecting (as in JAIL those who do this).

Obviously Bitcoin isn't regulated at the moment, so something like this is technically possible and since its a ""new technology"" they WILL be able to get away with it. (Kinda like ""ask for forgiveness, not permission). 

&gt; ""The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission deems P&amp;Ds illegal in the stock market, but the regulation of P&amp;Ds in the cryptocurrency market is weak or nonexistent.""

You have been warned. Bitcoin is currently being pumped by people smarter than you. 

https://youtu.be/i5dBZDSSky0?t=124

Before you say ""all assets can be manipulated"", YOU ARE CORRECT! But Bitcoin is an asset that isn't regulated. It's kind of how in the glory days of Youtube you could get away with putting in copyrighted material. 

I'm slowly weening towards crypto currency as an investment and wealth protection, but I'd be willing to bet this will come out as a documentary in 5-10 years.

You hear it here first.

I   had invested about 2 years ago on BTC but recently turned them into   Monero. The reason I did that is because l didn't invest a lot of money in  BTC and thought why not change my cryptocurrency to one less    ""valid"" from BTC but is going well to have more profit. ( Will like to hear your opinion on this move )

So this is how started searching more online to find more about cryptocurrency and found myself interested in Mining Bitcoin!

I   am looking to set up a Mining Rig from scratch because I don't have a  PC  (just an old laptop) so  I will like your help and opinion about my setup!

.  My budget is about 1000$ ( but could go for some extra buck higher )

.    Gaming is not important for me and I am looking to set up a mining  rig   for the purpose of 100% Mining BTC \* which I think is a good  option for my budget \*

.  All of the equipment for the setup must be available on [**amazon.com**](https://amazon.com/)

The newly proposed improvments for Lightning channels backup are just so cool ! Potentially no need to backup our channels at all once adopted thanks to a key derivation scheme of the private key of each party and a better security for channel recovering with also less onchain fees thanks to cryptography black magic (or [oblivious transferts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblivious_transfer)), it is so awesome ! Just imagine the Lightning UX simplification if all you need to backup your channel is the same seed backup as a classical Bitcoin wallet, HOLY COW !

&amp;#x200B;

And the next release of LND will use anchor commitment by default, which will reduce on chain fees when force closing a channel.

Combine with the Kraken announcement of Lightning integration, the fundamentals of Bitcoin just level up again a lot to me !

kegggd,Bitcoin1776,3 yrs ago I started a non-profit for getting high schoolers into Bitcoin and tech... want an update? Cause you're getting one.,"Hell yes. Bitcoin $20.6K. The [100 mega ton Starship](https://i.insider.com/5f15ca2219182463aa22dd96?width=1000&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp) continues..

3 years ago I started Midnight Discovery, a 501(c)3 non-profit to get people into tech and Bitcoin. We do this by paying high schoolers for completing task, such as posting a YouTube walk through for [Mastering Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lrp7FVouQ&amp;list=PLvVxgyLKYxCDYEUKVu9QEKyGGzlvwDFpy) or [Making a Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnjJ0IaN2kQ&amp;list=PLvVxgyLKYxCD8_gpEu5BE0rpb341Lui-X).

The idea? Get young people more money, early -&gt; get them more savings, faster -&gt; get them into Bitcoin first thing -&gt; faster retirement and happier lives.

That's one side. The other side is changing : fuck off till 22 &amp; $50k in debt -&gt; start over, have no concept of investing, stumbling your way until 35 : to : work hard in high study fields until 22 -&gt; Make management, investing aggressively -&gt; Phase into mentor life by 30.

In mentor life, you help other high schoolers, as quick as possible, yet by developing these persons and starting businesses, you get this network of power and intellect, which could prove useful.

That's not all Midnight Discovery does. We also had 6'x2' Bitcoin signs up since 2017, on a road with 10,000 cars / day, (you can see them [here](https://midnightdiscovery.org/)). We had cups, car magnets... everything you do to promote business in 2017. I mailed out over 10,000 flyers to promote Bitcoin, multiple times.

But here was the idea, creating an 'equal opportunity' of education, to try and get others wealth fast and into coin. 

Yet, as a non-profit, instead of me just paying this out of pocket, I could get a write-off. Help my taxes. And get discounts. So that's a plus. I'm on [Amazon Smile](https://smile.amazon.com/ch/82-0634090), for example.

Want to help me transform families family? Consider supporting [Midnight Discovery](www.midnightdiscovery.org). Thank you.

If you are looking for a tax deduction, for 2020, please consider Midnight Discovery. You have until April, 2021, to make a donation, for the 2020 tax year.

If you donate an appreciated asset, such as Bitcoin (and yes, we accept Bitcoin, directly or through BTCPay, fully tax deductible), you will receive a write-off equal to the current value of that asset ($20,000), without recognizing any of the gain.

And if you know of any children that would be a good fit, or if you would like to mentor, we need both, in all fields.

&amp;#x200B;

**I have -**

Trezor wallet (the first black one)

Folder including text files and images - those contain everything about my wallet (address, seed, pin etc) &gt; This folder in encrypted using 'Cryptomator' with a badass password &gt; The encrypted folder in on my Google Drive &gt; GDrive has 2FA...

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think? is it good enough?

I mean, for someone to 'break in' he has to have my Google account password, my phone (2FA), then my Cryptomator password (different from G), and then he's got it all since i've included everything in that folder...

Also, assuming this is the setup I have for the last year and a half, i'm guessing if someone had access to it - would already steal my precious by now...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\---- I found out about Passphrases just today, so i'm thinking of adding this extra layer soon...

\---- If you're asking yourself what are the images in the folder along with the text files, the images are actually a screenshot OF the text files, just in case the .txt will get corrupted somehow - this is the level of paranoia i'm at guys.",1608146031,14,1

keez1t,trumpmaniaohyeahbaby,Who Likes Bitcoin More - Democrats or Republicans?,"My initial expectation was that Republicans would get into bitcoin more than Democrats.  But perhaps I was wrong...

Btc supports decentralization and takes power away from government, so it seems natural for Republicans to get behind it.  But instead, it seems like Conservatives being wary of new things, are skeptical of bitcoin.  Conservatives also seem to associate btc with the tech giants who seem to come down on side of globalists and Democrats, and thus doubly distrust btc.  

Democrats, as Progressives, seem open to new things, and for that reason are able to get into btc.  But on other hand, I'm not sure how they could understand why government money is bad.

In practice, I see roughly equal uptake of btc by political party.  What do you see?",1608143952,12,1

Now this escrow company seems have problem because they double my money without even explaining to me why and customer service is not responding and Express Recovery Pro said that it is there partner for a long time and also they said my money earned that why it happened and then again they changed there statement and said that the price of bitcoin increased but how will the price increased for 200% overnight and would make my money double. So this Express Recovery Pro is not really a good company i really regretted working with them.

key1ih,Mark_Bear,Why Bitcoin Will Succeed,"Fiat currencies were all doomed from the start, with or without Bitcoin.  

Fiat currencies falter in front of your eyes.  

As the USD, Euro, Yen, Yuan, Pound, Real, Peso, etc. collapse and die, what can we do about it?  

Create a new fiat currency?  That would be doomed, too.  That would be stupid.  Yet that's what the people currently in charge of the failing fiat currency system are attempting.  Why?  Because they benefit unfairly from it - they're allowed to steal from the rest of us, which is why fiat always fails.  

Go back to ""gold backed"" money?  There were problems with that.  It was still better than fiat currency.  Note that between central banks, gold is still the ""real money"" because those criminals know how flimsy their fiat ""play money"" really is - they know better than to trust the crap they foist upon the rest of us.  But there were problems with the gold standard, and those problems still exist: Gold is very expensive to transport securely, and gold is expensive to store securely.  Now we also have gold-coated tungsten.  There would still be notes not actually backed by gold...  Cheating.  Lying.  Stealing.  1971 all over again.  

Move forward into Bitcoin?  Yes.  Once you understand what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works, this is the obvious path forward for humanity.  Some will resist this obvious path because they've been benefiting from being able to rob society via fiat currency ""money printing"".  They're weak little scumbag criminals who couldn't hold any honest job for more than a day if they had to.  They know they can't win unless they're able to cheat.  Oh well.  Too bad for them.   Bitcoin is even better than gold, in many ways.  Bitcoin is way, way, way, way better than fiat currency.  

Bitcoin is sound, honest money.  Bitcoin will succeed.",1608213963,10,5

On the 30th of November my electrum wallet was hacked:  


Tx ID: 89abc9415125c304773b68bad4dd37456b2f459d035a73c19eea722ab78acc0b  


No one knew the seeds, no one got access to my computer.  


It seems many other addresses were ''scrapped'', but my seeds were extended.  


Question, how should I proceed? Can anyone help me figure out the hackers addresses?  
I'd like to finally, recover the funds if the hackers are stupid enough to sell them on exchanges.  


Ps. It was 0.91 Bitcoin, not a very large sum, but I'm willing to share the funds if recovered!",1608213874,48,3
