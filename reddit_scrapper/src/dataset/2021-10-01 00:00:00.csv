q2rw5x,DoodleRoodle,Realising thicc btc profits through the company: bank and tax residency advice,"Hi everyone,
I've been a hodler and buyer since early 2017, and want to realise some profits during this bull run (I expect 240k per coin in December/January). I'm a dolfin hodler - not much, but all my income except expenses went to btc during the last years.

But being a tax resident in EU is not an easy thing: if I sell my btc as a person, I'll get 40%+ tax on the whole transaction (i bought it for peanuts). At the same time, I enjoy zero tax on dividends, as a non-domiciled resident. That's why all my coins I own were purchased from my personal company account: the idea was to pay only the corp tax, that is half of personal income tax, and distribute myself some cheesy dividends at zero rate.

Now, when I think that I'm going to pay 4-5 mil as taxes I cannot sit. You know.

So, my question is, what tax residency for another company can you recommend together with the bank that is really friendly, to cash out my coins? I was looking at dubai freezone ltds, but have no idea what is the position of bankers about crypto there.

It's not few thousands, I cannot do it with atm, and I need the income to be declared (at least as dividends with 0%).
Please, share your thoughts.",1633549404,15,0

q2qhyo,olli_ita,Yesterday i got a call from my Bank,"My bank‚Äôs Director called me yesterday (never talked or met him before).
He told me they were doing some security checks and some ‚Äúanomalies‚Äùpopped up on my account. They noticed I was regularly moving my monthly income into exchanges and the director wanted to warn me about the risks and volatility or cryptos which btw i‚Äôm fully aware of.
He wanted to make sure that I wasn‚Äôt investing debt in crypto which of course i‚Äôm not (I‚Äôm not that dumb) I only invest my hard earned money and what I‚Äôm willing to lose. Im totally debt free and i owe nothing to my bank.
So I asked him what he knew about cryptocurrencies in general. He said : ‚ÄúI heard Elon mask bought a lot of it‚Äù.

I‚Äôm from a small city in Italy (so please apologize my english) and I was not expecting to the Director of my bank to know much about crypto but also not that little.
He kindly asked me not to bring back the money all at once and I simply told him that i have no intention to do so and that i‚Äôm crypto for the long run and not for speculation. I also told him that I was aware of the capital gain tax in case of withdrawals.
He asked some fairly personal financial questions and even though we didn‚Äôt speak about numbers I knew he knew because he told me that he could see my money transfers to exchanges which I didn‚Äôt really like. On the other hand, i had the opportunity to ask him some questions and discovered that I am the only one in that particular bank that is involved with cryptocurrencies

I‚Äôm sharing this story with you because I found very interesting that my bank noticed me. I am your average 28 yo guy with an average job and an average salary.
I think in the future banks and governments will do their best to make it harder for the average Joe to get involved in crypto.",1633545197,410,61

Unfortunately, my exchange does not allow for transferring coins to a wallet (very lame). I'm wondering what's the cheapest way to get crypto in a wallet and what should I be expecting to pay? From what I have found so far, it would actually cost much more to get coins to my wallet than just paying the 1.5% on my exchange. Doesn't seem like a wallet is worth the extra costs when the risk of losing my coins on an exchange is relatively low. Thoughts?

This evening is great for EVERY Bitcoin HODLER. Bitcoin cared for once to decouple from the traditional and corrupt financial market. It did it in style.

Here are a few key points, but I am always interested in other thoughts if you would like to share.

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** **Institutional Investments already making a large impact, but have not reached traditional powerhouses** 

  a. None of the top 15 companies on the Forbes 500 list accept or store Bitcoin. 

i. Rumors alone that Walmart/Amazon have looked into purchasing or accepting Bitcoin have ignited recent bull runs.

  b. Tesla will accept Bitcoin once there is confirmation of reasonable clean energy usage by miners.

i. According to Bitcoin Mining Council, Global BTC Mining mix has a 56% Renewable Energy mix as of August 2021. US Mining sitting at 30.5% Renewable Energy mix but improving their mix rapidly.

ii. Tesla‚Äôs reversal set off the last bear run. Tesla accepting will help with retailer perception.

  c. Corporations using Bitcoin as a store of wealth have retained the majority of their investments.  

i. Volatility with buying and selling large scale Crypto quantities creates shareholder doubt. Once approved by BoD, companies historically retain all or most BTC.

  d. Institutional investments decrease the likelihood of Crypto restrictions.

i. Money spent on Lobbying will continue to increase as institutional adoption increases.

ii. Government protects their largest companies. Restrictions would hurt companies who adopt crypto by limiting the customer base domestically and internationally.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.** **Global Adoption increasing while Global FUD is decreasing**

  a. Countries like Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Argentina can allocate earnings to BTC to avoid impact of inflation

i. Already happening in Africa where inflation is regularly one of the highest in the world ‚Äì highest adoption rate globally.

  b. Global P2P transfer removes remittance costs 

i. Nayib Bukele listed this a primary reason for Bitcoin as legal Tender and Jack Mallers showed the ease recently by transferring through Twitter

  c. China FUD disappearing after complete ban. India reversed course with earlier rumors of banning Crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.** **Bitcoin has established itself as the primary store of value Cryptocurrency**

  a. Bitcoin is the primary Store of Value cryptocurrency due to its market dominance, security, and first-to-market ownership.

i. Institutional and Global adoption have secured BTC as the primary store of value option. 

ii. Cap of 21MM with already 18.8MM mined. Halvening every 4 years limits new supply to the market making BTC more appealing to institutional investors

iii. Lightning and Taproot integration increase security and scalability.

  b. Utilitarian Cryptocurrency value is dictated by its functionality. 

i. New projects are coming out daily which improve on existing technology. This creates a need for a store of value to transfer between upcoming technologies.",1633538971,0,0

q2nwyo,oneoldfarmer,Volatility as an obstacle to adoption for transactions,"This week I made a large purchase and was pleasantly surprised when paying by bitcoin was a checkout option.  The transaction went smoothly and after the purchase I immediately exchanged some fiat to replace my spent btc, but this was my first time experiencing volatility fear.  There has been a lot of price movement over the past week which amplified my fear.

What if BTC price goes up and I effectively overpaid for my thing?What if BTC price goes down and the vendor tells me that I haven't sufficiently paid my bill (which was denominated in $$)?

This gave me a good chance to think about the issue and here's what I've got so far:BTC price volatility only matters during the time window between my spending of BTC and my replacing with new BTC.  If I were to use BTC for all transactions then I would probably replace (or DCA buy BTC) daily.  It also matters to the vendor during the time window between when they accepted the purchase and when they convert to fiat (if they feel inclined to do something foolish like that) which could also happen daily.  This leads me to believe that the weekly price swings don't matter; really only the price swings over the course of a business day matter.

One more factor.  The default payment option was paypal which would have charged a 3% fee as opposed to my on chain fee of less than 0.05%.  Let's pretend in a perfect world the 3% savings was split evenly between me and the vendor.  That discount gives me and the vendor each a 1.5% buffer to cover volatility.

My conclusion:Once BTC/$ exchange rate smoothes out to a point where the normal price swing is less than 1.5% per day then BTC can be safely used (without my silly fears) for every transaction.  We're not there yet, but I predict that this smoothing of volatility will come with increased adoption and volume, and now I have a metric to judge how close we are to ""smooth enough"".

q0l9cb,IcyEffective5407,Bitcoin Recovery Service,"Realizing you've been scammed is a horrible feeling. These criminals have developed sophisticated ways to steal your money. It can be difficult to recover lost cryptocurrency cash, but here are some steps you can take:

Call your bank or cryptocurrency exchange. If you explain that the transaction was fraudulent, you might be able to reverse it, especially if you paid with a debit or credit card.

Protect your identity. If you shared any personal information, you may need to take steps to prevent further fraudulent activity. Go to [IdentityTheft.gov](https://IdentityTheft.gov) to report what happened and find out, for example, how to freeze your credit and stop the scammers from opening accounts in your name.

Contact a cyber investigator. Companies like [Primedefenders.org](https://Primedefenders.org) can help you to track down the stolen funds, and in some cases, they'll give you free assistance. You'll need to provide transaction IDs and other information about the scam.

Make sure the scammers don't get any more money from anyone else by reporting the fraud to the Prime Defenders You can also get advice about what other options you have.

As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, we can expect to see an increase in consumer protections and hopefully a reduction in scams. In the meantime, remember that there are people out there trying to trick you out of your hard-earned cash, so do your best to stay current on how to protect yourself and your investments.",1633278658,3,1

q0l0l4,spinbarkit,"hi, my modest input to this (amazing) community","I wanted to share some insight based on a research I made. Of course I must clearly state here that I am firm BTC believer, I agree with all basic BTC ideas presented in most mainstream BTC papers preached by BTC community (freaks, lets be honest). BTW, it's not supposed to be treated as financial advice or in any way perceived as such - just my own, personal opinion. I lost all my BTC in boating accident. BUY &amp; HODL for life. I am nobody's dog (except my wife wouldn't agree).

Now, there is some unsolved dispute that I encountered here and there on different BTC forums. It pops from time to time depending on the market current status. It is ""**mine vs hold**"". It's buy your own miners and mine your own BTC at home vs buy BTC (from exchanges or DEX or whatever or from a guy in the black hood in the light of full moon in the dark alley paying with your body) then transfer to cold wallet, HODL and never sell, thats it.

Depending on multiple factors like: home vs flat, budget, tech skill, knowledge, perseverance, local electricity price etc., a person (possessed by Bitcoin) with pile of cash but limited resources may also consider ""buy and host"" option. Of course, what one can often read: ""all hosting service are scam"", or ""why would anyone let you mine BTC from his miner and take profit from it, if he could just profit himself"", or ""even if you dont get scammed, ""buy and hold"" is a bit smaller profit but its 100% safe, and moreover ""mining is far from costeffective and its never worth your while"", ""let the pro do it for the security of the network as they are gifted by God with free electricty, there is no money in it"".

Well, the only thing I can agree is that buy and hold is safe option, whereas I cant agree with all the rest quakery bullshit. Why? How do I know that? What entitles me to say such a thing? ""He's with them! Shill! GTFO scammer!""- NO. Chill Winston, I am with nobody, I am on nobodys payroll, I dont advertise anything here. In my opinion large companies may find themselves in a situation forcing them to cut risks (transfering them to clients) or increase their cash flow (money upfront). All I want to say is this - what is repeated in many BTC books - don't trust, verify. So? I simply ran some numbers in a financial model I created. I am about to share the results. Free gratis. Just to contribute. To ease your own judgement.

\# **assumptions:** 

\- 10 year period (5 years in banking models  is tops I know but I wanted to show more)

**-** initial investment - 50k$ (1BTC for HODL)

\- BTC increases 30% in value per annum starting point is 09.21 - 43k$

\- electricity price 0,063$ per KWH, power consumption 3,3 KW

\- mining efficiency daily - 0,0006, 0,0005, 0,0004 BTC (3 scenarios) including 5% drop per each   
ASIC per annum. I also took into account 10% availability factor (power outages, delayed   
restarts, software failures etc.)

\- ASIC life expectancy is 24 months (assumed warranty), price 10k$ per unit (we buy 5 units)

\- we don't reinvest profits, once we buy - we hodl, once one ASIC dies - its finito. BUT we still   
profit from mined BTC price increase

\- of course I can change all variables at will, recalculating whole model in seconds

**# methods:** 

excel vba, data input taken arbitrarily from google (you can input anything you want, it's live   
model)

**# results:** 

1) trying out many scenarios I gathered that what influences our profits the most is 3 things: 

\- how long ASICs live (strong factor)

\- mining efficiency (should be considered important but not crucial for mining outcome)

\- BTC price (very strong factor)

2) what doesn't really matter is price of ASIC (profits outweigh investment), electricity price

**# conclusions:** 

\- holding is nice &amp;safe but nowhere near profitable as mining, provided BTC rises and we use   
top tier machines

\- reinvesting profits in new ASICS only exponentialy rises our profits, temporarily decreasing   
money flow which after 5 years is strictly residual and can be successfully discounted as noise

I expect a lot of critique as it's very productive in discovering new things. I don't post often so be gentle please. NOTE- I may be wrong - if so I appologise. I did my best though.... OR you all folks already know mining is the way... have fun good luck. May the BTC CAT watch over you guys!",1633277931,30,1
q0kvsd,greatgoogelymoogely,Tether is HOLDING us Back. #CUTTHETETHER,"Cryptocurrency is going to be in our futures. Do you want Tether in that future?

Tether has been involved in malpractice since the beginning. It's value was never backed 1-1, its always been opaque to the industry- and at this point in time its treasury is filled with not-zero risk assets.

It does not make sense that USDT continues to be utilized while we have other viable stable coins. Its a ticking time bomb and its existence devalues the crypto-space.

Cutting out Tether is going to hurt, but it will hurt a lot less if we cut it out now. We do not want a future where an unethical actor is able to hold this amount of power. If cryptocurrency is the silent revolution, we must continually act to keep these players out. We must ACT

I made a petition to ""CUT THE TETHER"". The goal is to have developers and other community members notice the desire to rid itself of a ""stablecoin"" whos practice is opaque and not backed with USD.

This stablecoin is not worth $1, if Tether were to get knocked off its peg even marginally, a cascade effect would take place leading to news coverage and a negative feedback-loop regarding worth. It would only take a fraction of signatures to get the ball rolling. If the community demonstrated its power in this regard it would be indicative of the value of the space long-term.

This will not be without short term pain but it is a necessary step to our Crypto Future.

Tether is holding us back, the first goal is 100 signatories.

Sign the petition and #CUTTHETETHER!

For example, last time I checked BitStamp was charging equivalent of $23 for a BTC withdrawal, but multiple output transactions regularly clear for a tenth of that. Kraken is better at around $7 but still not good enough.

Why can't we set a fee when we withdraw and take responsibility ourselves for how long it takes to get confirmed ?

q0ik4w,fomoFace,Will scams increase exponentially when BTC becomes the main currency?,"Shower thought: The 'scammability' of Bitcoin will not increase **linearly** with adoption increase rather **exponentially** since the early adopters (who joined voluntarily) are harder to scam than the later tech-ignorant ones (who would be forced to join due to Bitcoin becoming a standard).

Elaboration (if needed): At this point in time, I would assume that the vast majority of BTC holders are also BTC savvy to some extent. Since BTC at this point is not obligatory, the individuals opting in are the individuals who know about Bitcoin and (hopefully) how not to get scammed or phished.

However, if Bitcoin becomes the main currency, it will pretty much need to be adopted by everyone, including the very old, very young, and tech-ignorant people.

For example: If Mr. Bad Guy has an 80-year old tech-ignorant neighbor, chances are at this point that he can't steal BTC from the old guy because the old guy doesn't have any. However, if Bitcoin becomes the currency for everyone, he can be sure that his 80-year-old tech-ignorant neighbor has BTC and with very little effort (""Hey, can I borrow your phone?"") the old man will loose all his fortune.

This, of course, would not be an issue if Bitcoin would be traceable. I know I'm veering a bit from my own topic, but do you agree that if the world will run on a single unified currency, it should be a traceable one? (Sure, a non-traceable currency has its benefits, but for majority of the world population, there are more benefits than loses to tracabillity having tracabillity on their hard-earned life savings.)",1633270438,39,1

q0hxj3,KruseTheKing,Thoughts on Bitcoin fee problem?,"from [https://elonbachman.substack.com/p/why-bitcoin-is-doomed](https://elonbachman.substack.com/p/why-bitcoin-is-doomed)

&gt; Under an inflationary regime, miners mostly play nice with each other. Although fees vary a little, any transaction submitted to the network is about the same as any other, so miners mostly ignore the specifics of transactions and just focus on mining blocks. That may not be the case in an all-fee regime. When fees are everything, the very notion of consensus begins to fray. Recall that at any time, there are as many different versions of the blockchain in existence as there are miners working on it, and it is only by announcing the discovery of a new block that a miner causes all other miners to abandon their chains and begin mining on top of the new, longest chain (technically ‚Äúheaviest‚Äù chain, but whatever). **Now consider a miner who has just found out that he is working on the second longest chain. Rather than abandon it for the longer chain, he can leave some high fee transactions up for grabs in the transaction queue as inducement to other miners to come work on his chain. Consensus is fractured, hashpower is fragmented across competing versions of the chain, the security budget falls, and throughput suffers.** I am far from competent to speak on the general class of consensus attacks possible under a fee regime, but it is worth noting that there are attacks hypothesized to be possible with far less than 51% hashpower, possibly even less than 10%.",1633268367,15,1

When testing both devices, they both showed the promised 85TH. After a while, results got worse which I contributed to my basement being to warm. Set up a two-room-system (ASICS getting cold air and blowing into another room), improved my internet connection, set up special ports for the ASICs, etc. - I also had an Electrician come and set everything up safely and with enough electricity. 

Still, one of them is shutting down and both are running maximally at 70TH instead of 85TH (or lets say at least 80 would be nice). 

What confuses me: 

\- after changing the pool, both ran at 85+ for 2-3 hours and then dropped down (I did NOT have them off for a long time before that) 

\- temperatures are looking great 

\- Log shows a ""bad pool"" although I tried three different ones and all with the correct European server

\- no matter if I run the ASIC on high or normal, it gets to exactly 70TH in both instances

q0fe6z,ItsSomethingNot,Coinbase Address Whitelisting Security Concerns," Coinbase has an option to enable address whitelisting. While this sounds a great idea to have an additional layer of security, I do not understand why it works in this ""flawed"" manner.

Why Coinbase cannot have this function like other exchanges have, where every new address needs to be approved via email?

q0fbga,PrognosticalSon,"Unpopular opinion: Collateralized loans will move BTC from retail to institutions, who will get even richer.","LTV of loans of 50% (or other %) make it so you can only ever get half (or a partial) of the BTC you loaned out back. 
 
Meaning, many people plan on buying more BTC with the loan money, and while in theory it seems like it will work, it will just end up enriching institutions.
 
The reason is this: *The only thing anyone  does with your lent Bitcoin is sell/short it.* That's it, there is no other use case for lenders wanting your BTC.

When loaning bitcoin you are essentially selling half of your coin into the market, putting downward pressure on it. Maybe some shorts gets rekt, and they pay the coin back, but gess what? The institutions loan out your coins to be sold *again*. As long as your coins are loaned, they are adding to sell pressure.

Why will institutions get richer? Because if even only a percentage of people have bought bitcoin with their collateral, and the price is able to be dropped, folks will be liquidating their bitcoin they bought with the loan to pay it back, adding to sell pressure already in the market. Sure some may have other sources of funds to top up the loan but this is an exception, rather than the rule.

If the price keeps dropping, this is where the institutions lick their lips as they watch our LTV dip below 50%. The loan is now under collateralized, either making us give them *even more* BTC to cover the gap, which they they then of course short, or we liquidate our BTC collateral to cover the loan, giving our coins to the institutions, one way or another.

Volatility needs to be much lower, and market cap needs to be much higher for this to work in our favor. But guess what? By the time this happens, institutions will be lending *us* bitcoin which we will hold dearly, because we hope it beats inflation and the loan interest rate. And by us I mean only those who can afford to post the collateral for bitcoin.

TLDR;
They wont have to court you for your coins, you will give them up willingly for a fiat loan. Price drops will be engineered to call your loans. Much later they will loan BTC back to you, and then you will hodl it. Don't lend out your BTC, you will miss it.",1633257424,43,1

Would funds like this be enough to build infrastructure to create hash rate higher than what the current BTC miners combined deliver? It's all theoretical, I know.

Again, let's leave politics aside, I'm just curious about your guesses of how much fiat it would take to become the 51% miner and if for example 2trn would do the trick.

Would love to hear this communities insight and arguments for what will happen.

q4v6dq,cidadefalcao,"The average millionaire today can have at most 0.375 BTC, and this number gets lower by the day","Credit Suisse Research Institute puts the number of millionaires worldwide at 56 million total, of which 40% are in the United States. (Source: [https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/10/22/millions-of-millionaires](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/10/22/millions-of-millionaires))

There are many, many things that all millionaires can have and buy. A full bitcoin is not one of them. This number is likely even lower due to several additional factors: 

* Institutions and individuals buying it, holding, and not selling anytime soon
* Satoshi's stash plus lost coins
* Coins in the hands of non-millionaires

among others. This 0.375 BTC number however gets lower and lower over time because:

* More fiat is issued, creating more fiat millionaires
* BTC is lost
* BTC is bought and held by everyone else

If you have this amount, there are only two possibilities for you in the next 10 or so years: I. BTC fails. II. BTC wins (I actually believe like many that it has already won), and you will be a fiat millionaire (in today's purchasing power, let alone future years purchasing power). In this case, you should celebrate not because you have one million dollars, which might as well be less useful than toilet paper in ten years, but because you can buy and have whatever it buys today.

An important point mentioned in this research is that "" The total net worth of all millionaires stood at US$158,261 trillion. "" That's the lower bound for BTC's total addressable market (TAM). No other shitcoin has that, because they are trying to be something else than money: bitcoin is the soundest money, and there is no close competitor (like Michael Saylor would say ""this story about 60% dominance is bs. It's like 95 or 96 percent dominance""). Hence it's pointless to compare whatever market cap they have with bitcoin. The important conclusion from that is that bitcoin has the highest risk-adjusted upside potential: we are talking about a 150x from here **at least**. Whatever shitcoin you can think of that has surpassed, let's say, 20 billion market cap, is competing with some 10 others on a single digits trillion dollar addressable market (other than money) at best. Money printing helps us more than it helps them (i.e. our TAM increases at least as much as theirs). So there is really no point in holding any other coin other than bitcoin **if you believe that ""crypto"" is the future: either bitcoin alone succeeds, and it offers you the best return, or bitcoin and others succeed, and bitcoin offers the best return.** The only reason to hold other coins is if you wanna gamble. In that case, your fate is a nice -99.99% either in fiat terms or in bitcoin terms sooner or later.

Now an also important fact on **billionaires**:

This has been said repeatedly and I believe it is worth repeating once again: **we are seeing the biggest wealth transfer in the history of the world**. If you read the mainstream media you might have read multiple times that ""billionaires have never been richer"", ""billionaires wealth are growing faster during the pandemic"", etc. These are half-truths (or lies). Their wealth is shrinking and it is shrinking fast in BTC terms. I'd be surprised if there was one single billionaire whose wealth decreased by less than 95% in the last five years.

For those willing to do the math, here's the historical billionaires list:

q4u0w6,teflonjon321,Best Day to DCA (past 6 months),"I was bored this morning so I decided to look at the last six months of daily price ‚Äòcloses‚Äô for BTC. After a lot of unnecessary stress over which day is best to DCA (dollar cost average for the uninitiated), I had narrowed it down to 3 days in particular based on numerous sources: Sundays, Mondays, and Wednesdays. Why those days in particular, I am not entirely sure and I don‚Äôt believe anyone really is but they are historically the lowest priced days on average. I am overly obsessive and realize that over time, especially with the petty sized buys I make, the difference will be minuscule, BUT, I find it interesting and fun so sue me. The data is from May 1st to October 3rd and the prices are in USD. 

Results
Talk about splitting hairs! The closing prices vary by a little over 1% on average. 

Closing prices for the last 6 months:
Sunday $42,560
Monday $42,082
Wednesday $42,021

When I did this 6 months ago for the first time, Sundays were a pretty good winner (nearly 2.5% lower on average) so I had been making that my weekly buying day. While the results may have felt like a big nothing, I feel like it shows the power of dollar cost averaging in general. Timing the market is not possible and spending emotional energy worrying about pulling it off is unnecessary and counterproductive. Of course, my foolish nature will have me buying on Wednesdays, but the long and short is that it doesn‚Äôt matter.

q4tr8e,pcvcolin,"Bitcoin people, Inc. - where to go on Earth and outer space ""where you are treated best"" and how to do that (a summary analysis, post-OECD/G20 2021), &amp; some tech thoughts","**Who is this post for?**

You are a bitcoin user - and you are trying to determine where and how to incorporate for your new bitcoin based business (or maybe just to set up a corporate / business exchange account).  What do you do?  Where do you go?  There have been a lot of changes recently and there are more on the horizon.  The purpose of this post is to try and see if there is a pathway that can help you reduce and simplify the process for those who are interested specifically in finding a pathway to incorporation that makes sense for you.  (It's also got a ""where do we go from here"" at the end that covers purely technological solutions unrelated to legal incorporation.)

**Why?**

\- Asset protection and legal liability issues

\- Protection from censorship due to activities of increasingly hostile regimes

\- Redundancy of your system protections to ensure that you do not end up subject to malicious hacking and critical losses

**what does this post cover?**

1. The recent  OECD/G20 ""Framework on BEPS,"" by around 140 countries,
2. The remaining ability of cryptocurrency users to migrate assets to different jurisdictions, effectively without tax,
3. the importance of developing technological systems to counter increasingly hostile state actions from different parts of the globe.

&amp;#x200B;

1) In the first part, the recent OECD/G20 ""Framework on BEPS"" by around 140 countries basically means that many countries have signed onto a global minimum tax.  For some countries this really means nothing because they had already that minimum (of 15% or more), but for other countries they didn't, and now will be implementing 15%.  This then means that there are a more limited range of countries that are in fact zero tax, which I cover here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/q4k8y5/jurisdictional\_arbitrage\_is\_alive\_and\_well/](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/q4k8y5/jurisdictional_arbitrage_is_alive_and_well/)

**Current countries** [that do not have general corporate income tax](https://taxfoundation.org/publications/corporate-tax-rates-around-the-world/) and are not part of the 140 country [OECD/G20 Framework on BEPS](https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/) (Note: The below list does not include countries which signed onto the OECD/G20 framework but retained low or no-tax zones in special areas of those countries. Such countries, like Georgia, are not described below as this list is intended only to describe completely no-tax countries that are not part of the OECD framework.) Essentially - these countries are global winners as people send assets away from the most hostile jurisdictions ([source](https://incorporations.io/)):

\- [Anguilla](https://incorporations.io/anguilla)

\- [Cayman Islands](https://incorporations.io/cayman-islands) (LLC or Exempted) (Note: Heightened scrutiny has been placed on Cayman Islands over the past year.)

\- Saint Barthelemy

\- Tokelau

\- Vanuatu (IC) -- (Note: Vanuatu has a [citizenship by investment program](https://www.globalcitizensolutions.com/vanuatu-citizenship-by-investment/) which historically has accepted bitcoin, since around 2017. [Some non-FATCA banks](http://non-fatca-banks.com/vu.html) may still be a possibility there. However, US persons looking for domestic financial accounts may wish to bank in Wyoming.

\- Wallis and Futuna

&amp;#x200B;

2) In this second part, I will explain here what it means to ""choose your jurisdiction"" for your assets in this day and age via incorporation.   When a person incorporates somewhere, they effectively are choosing their jurisdiction for any business bank account - or any other form of account, or address, [even if you wish to assign cryptocurrency XPUB or YPUB](https://help.coinpanda.io/en/articles/5512014-how-to-export-xpub-ypub-zpub-addresses-from-hd-wallets) (for example), that corresponds to that incorporated entity (LLC or other), as part of the business account.  But completely apart from this, it's important to realize that while there was an individual or individuals who created the corporation, **if the corporate entity itself (and the paperwork or online filings pertaining to it) are used to open an exchange account (corporate / business account) or financial account elsewhere,** ***the client (of the exchange or financial institution) is not the individual, but rather the corporate person which is represented by an entity in the jurisdiction where that entity was incorporated (the client is the corporate person)!***

There is nothing unlawful about using a corporation (such as a Vanuatu corp - for example) to open an exchange account somewhere.  **The corporate entity - the Vanuatu corp - then becomes the client of the exchange, and the legal jurisdiction that is operative is Vanuatu - not the place where the director / originator of the corp resides.  (This is also true of Wyoming LLCs or of any other corp formation anywhere else in the world, but I used Vanuatu here to drill the point home, because anyone in the world can establish a zero tax corporate setup if they want to.)** That assumes, of course, that it's a wholly new corporate entity unconnected to a corp in some high-tax area (for example, if some corp in Germany wanted to later have its directors and the German corporation incorporate in the Cayman Islands, this wouldn't be a good strategy because it's already linked back to the German company).  I've also commented on special considerations for people in California, USA who are looking for legal options to move their assets away from California-incorporated financial institutions after [AB 1402 was signed into law in California](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pzqc3t/the_sneak_bans_cometh_as_people_focused_on_us/) \- for those of you who fall into that category, [link here for some particular things you may need to consider](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ntmzwu/there_are_potentially_huge_us_tax_and_reporting/h0u1gq7/). For those of you who live anywhere in the USA, [I also recommend you read Dan Held's post on crypto IRAs, here](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/how-to-pay-0-taxes-on-your-bitcoin). If choosing that route, a traditional IRA does offer a simple pathway to zero tax accumulation - assuming Congress doesn't screw that up, too, [which it could in the future as I point out here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q41zkn/comment/hfwf1f9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), so be forewarned, *everything has a risk*.

**So you understand, it doesn't matter if you are in Germany, or California, or wherever. If you incorporate in Vanuatu (as an example), and didn't start with an incorporation in some other more restrictive jurisdiction, there's no ""top up tax"" that Germany or any other country can apply.** The jurisdictions I mentioned above are in fact not part of the 140 country OECD/G20 Framework on BEPS, and don't have general income tax (Vanuatu, to my knowledge, does not even have a hard-line income tax treaty with the United States, though it does have a certain amount of FATCA banks inside the country -  Vanuatu has signed tax information exchange agreements with Australia, Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Greenland, Grenada, Iceland, Ireland, Korea (Republic of), New Zealand, Norway, San Marino and Sweden.  Along with other offshore jurisdictions, and in response to OECD and FATF pressure, Vanuatu has taken measures to control money laundering.  Vanuatu does not have an embassy in Washington, DC, but has a mission to the United Nations in New York.)

3) In this third and final part of this post, I'll reiterate what I've said before.  **We really as a community need to focus on the technological solution**.  States / jurisdictions are becoming more desperate, their grasp on reality and monetary systems (and everything for that matter) is weakening - not strengthening.  So - legal solutions such as those I mentioned in points one and two above are helpful, but we really need to refocus and redouble the technological.  The ""why"" is the same as mentioned above:  - Asset protection and legal liability issues, Protection from censorship due to activities of increasingly hostile regimes, and Redundancy of system protections to ensure that you do not end up subject to malicious hacking and critical losses.  Basically, enhancing protection of people around the globe.  Did I also mention, basic privacy protections?  That's another.

Areas where we need to improve / do better:

\- Considering where we can support open source developers who are pushing the envelope, no matter where they are in the world

\- More systems (no matter what they are, exchanges, wallets, whatever) incorporating multisignature and making it dead simple for people to utilize in the UI/UX.  [Example of some multisignature services that have been around](https://multisigtools.com/multisignature/easy-and-secure-multisignature-setups/).

\- Transitioning to [blockchain services that rely in part or wholly on Low Earth Orbit based systems](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/paixdr/blockchain_in_space_whats_going_on_4_years_after/) (departure from earth based / terrene jurisdictions)

\- Performing further development of decentralized exchange interfaces, systems, or markets (akin to Bisq / Bisq DAO, OpenBazaar / HavenPrivacy (deprecated/discontinued), or similar) - I really enjoyed thee\_wolf's design (if he's reading)

\- DeFi being translated to mobile apps allowing people to create multiple listings similar to eBay (and at their option spin up drop shipping services)

\- Interoperability everywhere: [Cross-chain atomic swaps](https://articles.whalesheaven.com/what-are-cross-chain-atomic-swaps/) on more or most wallets as a standard

\- Lightning (L2) option everywhere in-wallet where bitcoin is an option

These technological options will certainly help the progress of crypto, moving it further into the hands of more mobile users across the globe and will reduce the likelihood that a growing number of users can be hindered from its use by increasingly hostile governments.

Existing Space based systems that we need to support and start helping as part of our business processes:

\- Biteeu exchange [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p1hznv/did\_you\_know\_there\_are\_over\_5000\_satellites\_in/](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p1hznv/did_you_know_there_are_over_5000_satellites_in/)  (It's an exchange, that backs up its data in low earth orbit!)

\- SpaceBelt [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/paixdr/blockchain\_in\_space\_whats\_going\_on\_4\_years\_after/ha9f7lf/](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/paixdr/blockchain_in_space_whats_going_on_4_years_after/ha9f7lf/)  (This is very cool, I'll leave it to you to read about it.)

\-SpaceChain [https://spacechain.com/](https://spacechain.com/) (It's certainly possible to put a bitcoin node up or back up assets in space using this system.)

\- Spire / SpaceChain [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pz2nl7/spire\_spacechain\_team\_up\_space\_is\_the\_next/](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pz2nl7/spire_spacechain_team_up_space_is_the_next/)

***‚ÄúSpace is the next frontier for businesses, and through Spire‚Äôs satellite infrastructure we are taking global collaboration to the ultimate vantage point,‚Äù said SpaceChain Co-founder and CEO Zee Zheng. ‚ÄúThis partnership will help us leverage satellite-based computing to remove barriers and create a more open, collaborative and global economy.‚Äù***

\- SpiderOak / Orbitsecure [https://spideroak.com/orbitsecure/](https://spideroak.com/orbitsecure/)  (It's possible to put a bitcoin node up or back up assets up in low earth orbit, I would think, using this.)

\- Blockstream [https://blockstream.com/satellite/](https://blockstream.com/satellite/)  **(This does already involve bitcoin!!)**

Even check out this (many here won't like it, but it's worth mentioning in the context of the whole backdrop of space ventures):

At that point in time why would a bitcoin miner use all the resources that are required to mine bitcoin if the rewards are so low.

And if they stop mining, won't that mean there won't be any more transactions on bitcoin?

q4ryo7,SmartAileen,"Bitcoin (BTC)-$100,000 by the end of 2021?","Bitcoin's main goal is to be a global peer-to-peer digital cash, unrelated to any form of cash. Provisions are thus completely decentralized. Almost every other cryptocurrency has tried to replicate an idea. Bitcoin was also the first cryptocurrency and there are still many people who believe it will be the last cryptocurrency. Besides that, the reason you should put bitcoin on your investment radar is that it has the highest liquidity in the cryptocurrency space, which also makes it the best cryptocurrency to buy if you are a beginner. Ultimately, you will have absolutely no trouble buying and selling bitcoins. People are constantly buying and selling bitcoins. There will always be someone on the other end ready to match your order. Not only that, but Bitcoin is also known to be one of the most stable cryptocurrencies despite its high volatility. Bitcoin's influence, demand, and mass adoption is expected to continue to grow in the coming years (perhaps more than any of its competitors). As demand increases, the price of bitcoin is expected to increase significantly, as there will only ever be 21 million coins. Tesla has invested $1.5B in Bitcoin and may start accepting the cryptocurrency as payment in the future. Immediately after the news broke, the price of Bitcoin rose by about 14% to over $44,000 per token. But it didn't stop there! February 2021 Bitcoin surpasses $50,000 for the first time as big companies leap into crypto and manage to reach $58,000. many experts agree that Bitcoin's price could exceed $100,000 by the end of 2021 and follow the latest trends; Bitcoin seems to be on track to meet or even exceed these expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

Bloomberg writes that after years of waiting by the crypto community, four bitcoin ETFs are expected to be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the end of this month, including related products from ProShares and Valkyrie Investments. This month, the SEC must again decide whether to approve, deny or delay listing applications for such ETFs. The SEC and its chairman Gensler have no reason to make the opposite decision less than a month after commenting positively on a bitcoin futures ETF based on the 1940 law in late September, said Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.

&amp;#x200B;

In late September, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler reiterated his support for a small class of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that would invest in futures contracts rather than in bitcoin itself. Gensler previously made a similar point in August.

&amp;#x200B;

While SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has expressed a preference for approving ETFs backed by bitcoin futures contracts, digital asset manager Grayscale says it will continue to seek regulatory approval for bitcoin ETFs (bitcoin spot ETFs) backed by cryptocurrency entities. Some analysts predict that Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which currently plans to convert its $30 billion trust into a cryptocurrency-backed ETF, is unlikely to receive approval in the near term. grayscale is still banking on the possibility that the U.S. SEC will accept a bitcoin spot ETF. head of Grayscale ETF David LaValle said in an interview Gensler's comments have not changed our business strategy, and we will use the ETF wrapper (Wrapper) to bring other products to market, such as traditional equity-based ETFs. ""But some analysts say that opportunity may be more distant, saying they believe bitcoin futures ETFs will be approved by the SEC before spot ETFs.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, U.S. securities regulators have been considering whether to approve their first bitcoin ETF for years. on Sept. 29, the SEC announced it was delaying the announcement of its decision on four bitcoin ETFs for 45 days, placing Global X Bitcoin Trust, Valkyrie XBTO Bitcoin Futures Fund, WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust and Kryptoin Bitcoin ETFs to December 21, December 8, December 11 and December 24. on September 8, the SEC released a statement announcing that it had extended its decision to approve the VanEck Bitcoin Trust by 60 days to November 14. A total of nine bitcoin futures ETFs are reportedly awaiting SEC release as of early October.

&amp;#x200B;

In an incomplete compilation by Golden Finance, in addition to the five previously mentioned bitcoin ETFs that have been delayed, there are currently BlockFi Bitcoin Strategy ETF (bitcoin futures ETF), Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy ETF (bitcoin futures ETF), Galaxy Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( Bitcoin Futures ETF), Invesco Bitcoin Strategy ETF (Bitcoin Futures ETF), Ark21Shares ETF, Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, Teucrium Bitcoin Futures ETF, etc. pending SEC approval.

&amp;#x200B;

It is worth waiting for the SEC to approve the Volt Crypto Revolution and Technology ETF, which allows investors to easily invest in Bitcoin-centric companies including Tesla, Square, Coinbase, PayPal, and Twitter, among others. Volt is currently the closest thing to a Bitcoin ETF, which has added to the anticipation of the SEC passing a pure Bitcoin ETF.",1633798246,0,1

q4myku,LinLo99,Grateful to meet cryptocurrency,"My name is Luo Lin, and my English name is Nora, and I come from a wealthy business family in Hong Kong. I currently live in the United States most of the time and have heard many of my parents‚Äô business experience since I was a child. I didn't have any deep feelings in the past. My grandfather lived in a war-torn era in China and was able to survive in Hong Kong with the help of the United Nations. Later, he founded a clothing company through his own efforts, but my grandfather is not a very fair person. My grandfather has 6 children. My father is the eldest son of the family. He didn't learn to speak until he was 3 years old. My grandfather prefers my second uncle. The ending is obvious. My second uncle inherited all the assets of my grandfather. Later, Mom and Dad founded a new clothing company through their own efforts. Now my father‚Äôs company has diversified investments involving the production of clothing, real estate and masks. Sometimes life is really important because I have three brothers and I am the youngest daughter in the family. Under the care of the three brothers, I have never felt the hardships of life. It wasn't until 2008 that I lost the $2 million that my father gave me. The 2008 financial crisis brought me to the bottom of my life. Although my parents didn't blame me, I didn't dare to go home during that time. I am afraid that my parents will be sad because of the failure of my stock investment. Later, my eldest brother found me and gave me a sum of money. My brother loves me very much. He asked me to travel to Japan. My family does not want me to be sad because of the failure of stock investment. Later, I followed the advice of my parents. I went to Tokyo, Japan in 2012. When traveling in Tokyo, I heard about Bitcoin among cryptocurrencies. I have been a brave girl since I was a child, always full of curiosity when facing new things, even if I don‚Äôt understand new things, I might get hurt. But I am always fascinated by it. Out of curiosity, I bought 500 bitcoins at a price of $10 each. Later, the price of Bitcoin rose all the way. This is a very crazy investment experience. I sold all my bitcoins in 2017, which made me a huge profit. I'm very lucky. Since then, I have been focusing on various cryptocurrencies. This is my cryptocurrency life. Thank you for bringing me more money. Thanks to cryptocurrency, which allows me to travel around the world. Currently I invest in cryptocurrencies, but many cryptocurrencies are very unstable. Now I am a traveler, philanthropist and investor. I have been engaged in cryptocurrency investment for 9 years not only did not make me feel bored. I am still excited about owning this investment. I hope I will have the same hobbies as everyone else. I hope to have more friends in the field of cryptocurrency. You can share life and cryptocurrency with each other when you have time, and don't bother each other when you don't have time.",1633791501,4,1

I‚Äôve wanted this since 2016 more than anything.  But now I‚Äôm not so sure.

Imagine this scenario:
To shorten this up let‚Äôs call bitcoin holders who control our keys (BHs)

And ETF holders (ETFHs)

Stock market closes up Friday night at a new ATH bitcoin is up 100% in the month of December.  Everyone is happy.  BHs start dumping over the weekend in large quantities fearing for a repeat of 2017.  ETFHs start putting sell orders for Monday morning, but they are watching bitcoin dump half a trillion USD by Sunday night, the media (like they always do) start spreading FUD on epic levels.  Monday morning hits and everyone selling their ETFs gets burned‚Ä¶. Monday evening after the market closes BHs start pumping their money back in to buy back cheap bitcoin that the ETFHs can‚Äôt buy due to the market not being open until Tuesday.  

My concern is that because the BHs can trade bitcoin 24/7 and the ETFHs can only trade for a few hours on weekdays, the SEC will see the BHs having an unfair advantage.  And will need to enforce very strict rules, possibly close to what China is trying to do.

[https://time.com/6106706/bitcoin-black-investors/](https://time.com/6106706/bitcoin-black-investors/)

*Paragraph 2 of the article:*

""This is not simply a gathering for those who would like to ride whatever bumps and shocks, gains and losses come with cryptocurrency. It is a space for discussing the relationship between money and man, the powers that be and what they have done with power. **Online and in person, on the campus of Howard University in Washington, D.C., an estimated 1,500 mostly Black people have gathered to talk about crypto‚Äîdecentralized digital money backed not by governments but by blockchain technology, a secure means of recording transactions‚Äîas a way to make money while disrupting centuries-long patterns of oppression.**""

About **Sinclair Skinner**, the focus of the article:

*Paragraph 13:*

**""So in 2013, he invested ‚Äúprobably less than $3,000,‚Äù mostly in Bitcoin. Encouraged by his friend Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, one of the largest platforms for trading crypto, he grew his stake. In 2014, when Skinner went to a crypto conference in Amsterdam, only about eight Black people were there, five of them caterers, but he felt he had come home ideologically.** He saw he didn‚Äôt need a Rockefeller inheritance to change the world. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to build a bank where they literally used my ancestors to build the capital,‚Äù says Skinner, who today runs a site called I Love Black People, which operates like a global anti-racist Yelp. ‚ÄúI can unseat that thing by not trying to be like them.‚Äù

About **Charlene Fadirepo**, the secondary focus of the article:

*Paragraph 16:*

""**Fadirepo, who worked in the Fed‚Äôs inspector general‚Äôs office monitoring Federal Reserve banks and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau**, is not a person who hates central banks or regulation. A Black American, she believes strongly in both, and in their importance for protecting investors and improving the economic position of Black people. **Today she operates Guidefi, a financial education and advising company geared toward helping Black women connect with traditional financial advisers. It just launched, for a fee, direct education in cryptocurrency**.""

*Paragraph 19:*

She knows frauds exists. In May, a federal watchdog revealed that since October 2020, nearly 7,000 people have reported losses of more than $80 million on crypto scams‚Äî12 times more scam reports than the same period the previous year. The median individual loss: $1,900. For Fadirepo, it‚Äôs worrying. **That‚Äôs part of why she helps moderate recurring free learning and discussion options like the Black Bitcoin Billionaires chat room on Clubhouse, which has grown from about 2,000 to 130,000 club members this year.""**",1634335893,10,1

q8yn37,jojothehodler,Why you should NOT use Bitcoin.,"TL;DR : You should not use it, only hodl it.

Now here is my point :

For this ""article"", I assume you (reader) are at least a Bitcoin maximalist. So if you are less convinced about Bitcoin than ""ALL IN"", you will disagree with me quite rapidly. Please ignore this post if that is the case, because I am not here to launch debate or even a discussion about BTC being less than the Mighty perfection"" that it is.

So...

So, the implications are : 

It's far more than money's worth, it's philosophical worth.

It's more than a technology, it's a major all-changing invention. An invention making a new age possible. I mean a new age like [the age en enlightment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment). 
A new age permitted by technology, yes, but like all new ages before.

The invention of drawing, for the cavemen, then writing a little after, were the possibility to extract knowledge from the living to give it to ""all would could see it"". Big big advantage for the then ""all-new"" civilization of humans to be able to ""speak to"" future humans, and ""listen to"" past humans.

The invention of printing launched the biggest spread of this knowledge ever know to mankind. Accessibility was really poor before it, because how hard and expensive it was to even learn how to read...

The invention of telegraph/radio/tv...all other new spreading of information ever discovered quite regularly this last century...each time, big world-wide revolution and each time big change for all mankind about how we see the world and what we know about it.

The internet was...well... of course, a big pivotal point. What would be your life without internet right ? Please remember that there still exists a lot of people alive today who spent the majority of their lives without it.
Even the word ""internet"" only exists since 38 years !!!!!

So when the internet celebrates its 100 birthday, Bitcoin will be 75 !

When the ""world wide web"" celebrates its 100 birthday, Bitcoin will be 83 !

100 birthday of the one billion  users ? BTC is 84 !

The billionth website ? Ho...well...BTC is 106 years old.

It's more than store-of-value. It's more than decentralization of trust. It's more than anything we ever knew, because we are even far from understanding everything a Blockchain with that amount to network-power can achieve for us.

End of war ? It's a decent possibility. New World Order that we can all agree with, that would satisfy every single person on earth ? Why not ? If you want to dream, like a wise man said, don't be afraid of dreaming big :)

So we agree...since BTC is the ""Best thing in mankind history"", all that we want is to protect it, to help it grow, and to be an instrument in its revolution.

My belief (and the point of this post) is that the best way to help BTC is to use it as little as possible. Meaning as wisely as we can...so that it is not overwhelmed by useless usage of its potential.

In fact, the best that could ever happen to help the network is to die holding your coins and take it to the grave, no ?

I believe you can do more.

Find people who have Bitcoin.

Hunt them.

And...

Remove from them their ability to access their coins. (What ? Killing is not the only option, no need to be psychopaths)

If you are not hunting Bitcoiners, you are not doing the best you can to help the network, you are not a real ""maximalist"".

You believe I'm joking ? As a matter of fact, I'm seriously asking this question : why would this reasoning be wrong ?

I'm not telling you to suicide yourself with your coins or to destroy your back-up seed by fire. Just die with it, in a hundred years (I hope for you), after a peaceful life and after setting aside enough for your family and friends needs but with a maximum of your stash ""saved for destruction in death""

If you come across a big corporation private keys, send it all to a ""destruction address"" (with a big fee, because you don't want to wait for confirmation in this case...)

If you have time for this, learn programming and create viruses to infect and destroy every address it encounters in one way or another. You can't get caught when the crime ""doesn't profit you""...

Well...and if you are a psychopath willing to be a hero, take a knife and find the owners of the biggest stash you can find...
( Didclaimer : of course this is not an encouragement to do that...you Freak !! )

But what do you think ? Should Bitcoin ""maxiest maximalist"" aim to destroy as much satoshis as he/she can ? After all, bad press is not working against it so...no downside to this ? Is this really the best we can do ?",1634335562,15,1

q8ycm5,samskiter,Some concerns about fixed supply in the future,"So I've been meaning to put these shower thoughts down for a while, I'm interested in having a civilised chat about some potential downsides of bitcoin's 21million fixed supply. There's probably a little overlap in these points but I think they do warrant writing about each on their own. These are all in the post 21-million world - i.e. when no new bitcoin is being minted and miners are solely relying on tx fees.

In this world there is no more inflation and the only adjustment in total Bitcoin is caused by people losing their keys. In this sense Bitcoin can be considered a deflationary currency.

1. Flat/Deflationary monetary = flat/inflationary uncertainty

Over time the number of 'lost' coins will only increase. However, there is no on-chain proof that coins are lost. I could declare my coins lost today and tomorrow use my private key to send them somewhere.

If satoshis coins were to move, I was imagine bitcoin's value would take a big hit as the market anticipates a flood of tokens. The number of potentially 'active' coins has just increased.

These 'lost' coins are an element of uncertainty in bitcoin. And this uncertainty only grows as more coins are lost. While uncertainty can be priced in, can a market price in ever growing uncertainty?

2. Spend Vs hodl

I'm somewhat concerned that bitcoin becomes a stagnant currency as holding onto it through deflationary events will only increase your share of the pie. I know this is a typical argument for inflationary currencies so don't need to labour this. Are we convinced that inflation doesn't help money move (and that that is a good thing) as most economists seem to agree?

3. Value Vs Hashpower disconnect

Bitcoins security comes from the amount of Hashpower working on the network. And that Hashpower is paid for by mining rewards and transaction fees.

Mining rewards provide an incentive that is directly related to the price of Bitcoin. If bitcoin is worth more, the reward is larger and visa versa.

At 21million there are only transaction fees. The transaction fees are set by the market's demand for transactions - aka the activity of the network. This means miner rewards are not tied to the value of Bitcoin. If bitcoin becomes a digital gold, with an enormous market cap, but relatively low transaction activity, then tx fees fall, mining power falls and it becomes open to attack.

If bitcoin were to continue to mint new coins, miners could be incentivsed proportionally to the value of Bitcoin - this would act as a tax on all holders of bitcoin to ensure its ongoing security. Is that a bad thing?",1634334660,59,1

Does every bitcoin sold through the EFT actually take a real bitcoin off the market?

**If that answer is no**, does anyone worry that this could artificially inflate the supply of traded bitcoin off-chain (like what's going on with silver)? Maybe its wrong to say it's the ""supply"" that's inflating, but if it not backed, then is that new capital being siphoned away from BTCs price since it won't affect on-chain demand?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The adoption of a Bitcoin Standard will do more for workers rights than Unions, Congress and the Senate ever could. Record everything, blackmail your corporate overlords into paying you in BTC, into adopting the Bitcoin standard, into rejecting the lure of Chinese profits and reach arounds.

Record everything. Leak it. Leak it years after you recorded it. Report it. We win.  Do you Collect the evidence. We wont be sacrificed to this commie-corprate alliance. This sick fantasy.

qb0bjm,preadyla,GBTC Discount increasing?,"At close today, the discount for GBTC was at approximately 26%.  In one day, this increased from the recent standing discount of approximately 22%.

This was either due to a lag in GBTC pricing in relation to the dropping price of BTC at the end of trading today or a reaction to the new futures ETF &amp; news regarding the filing of a 1:1 ETF from Greyscale, I think.  Tomorrow morning's pricing should clear this up.

Greyscale told us a long time ago that their plan was to convert to an ETF.

Is a change in discount expected given the recent news?

I know a lot of advice will be to just get BTC directly, which is probably good advice and covered in many other posts.  I'm curious if we know what to expect with the discount moving forward.

This will be my first time upgrading directly with my carrier. I‚Äôm concerned that they‚Äôll end up with my old phone with access to all of the installed apps, emails, etc.  

I‚Äôd like to transfer everything to my new phone without first completely wiping my old phone and restarting from scratch with my new phone.  

I‚Äôm trying to think about this in the crypto sense.  It‚Äôs one thing when there‚Äôs just a bunch of random apps to delete and reload, but I feel like there‚Äôs quite a bit more to keep secure now. 

I‚Äôm not sure what their process is in transferring the phone data or how clean the old phone is once the data transfer is complete.  I‚Äôve always just kept my old phones and factory reset them after I transferred the data over. But hoping to take advantage of the trade in value this time around.

Whether it is confiscating Gold and repricing it.  Using National security legislation to affect the steel or computer chip industry, it appears to be just a matter of time.

Creating a futures based ETF is such a start as now it looks like any other fiat based asset and not truly what BTC was meant to be.

Can you see a time when the US being dominant with miners telling the miners that they MUST perform an action, take a fork etc because it is in the USA national interest.  Of course they would do this under Court applied gag orders.

I'm stuck renting and living with roommates because I don't earn much money at work.  I don't qualify for a home mortgage loan because of my low paying job and subpar credit score.

If you were in my position, would you sell your bitcoin to buy a house right now? Or would you wait 4 more years? 

I believe that the price of bitcoin will be a lot higher in 4 years. So if I wait 4 more years, I believe I will be able to afford a nicer house and still have some bitcoin left over to save, but then I will be 40 years old, and I would also be stuck renting and living with roommates until 2026...

I studied the crypto space over the past few months and I'm leaning towards allocating a majority of my funds into Bitcoin because I think we will begin to see the introduction of government regulations, and CBDC's, or, at the very least, serious considerations of implementing them between the 4th and 5th halving cycle. I'm not saying Eth is going to die, I just think Bitcoin is a safer bet in the next 4-5 years. 

So I've been hearing speculations that Bitcoin will just continuously go up, without a major bear market in Q1 of 2022, like in previous cycles. I personally think this is unlikely because the stock market is almost likely to crash next year with continued tapering + rise in interest rates + the inflated bubble that is our fiat currency.

qdbs3i,MrQ01,Why I find BTC profit taking more difficult than any other asset,"With most other assets including crypto, I find it a relatively straightforward concept of taking profits and being open to potentially re-buy at lower prices. But Bitcoin's limited supply and limited supply on the exchanges make me think differently on this.

Just imagine some universally accepted bullish news came for Bitcoin, which made it all but guaranteed BTC was going to at least 10x in 10 years' time. Out of the 56m people who are millionaires, just 10% were convinced enough by this news to ""take a cheeky punt"" and buy 1 bitcoin. This would cause not only a skyrocket in demand but also completely absorb the supply available for purchasing.

While this sounds obvious in theory, I can't help thinking that this is not as extreme and unrealistic a scenario (that one day a random day a piece of news comes that could trigger 10% of millionaires to buy a bitcoin), and at that prior profit-takers not only have to buy back in a higher price, but are also locked out of the market entirely. Such news can even come tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, am I overestimating the chances of this happening and the impact it has?

But I really feel that this is a terrible argument, because there is a TON of investment in companies like Apple and Microsoft and they have enormous market caps, but I'm doubtful that more than 1% of them understand how a computer works...

As a matter of fact you can apply this to most large cap stocks, people are willing to ape money into Tesla, but do they really know how an electric car works? I don't...

So its become pretty clear that the media has perpetuated lies about cryptocurrency for so long that its made retail investors uneasy, which is unfortunate because I think fixing that narrative to something more truthful takes an extremely long time and longer than many expect.

qd76iv,Elsa897,THE BITCOIN PRICE COULD BE HEADED TOWARD SIX FIGURES," 

As most people who own bitcoin know, price drawdowns that are greater than 50% have been a regular occurrence after each all-time high. What we also know is that bitcoin price has proven to significantly recover from every major drawdown, which has made it the best performing asset over the last decade.

Currently we‚Äôre rebounding from a 56% price drawdown post a 228% recovery. Historically what comes next is yet another massive recovery. This double top pattern playing out is eerily similar to 2013 where price went on to explode over 10 times in just 52 days, starting in early October. As we hover around $66,000, a six-figure bitcoin price is only a 51% price move away. This is a more conserative percentage move during a bitcoin bull cycle recovery based on previous cycles.

History may not repeat itself exactly but all of the on-chain metrics, recent price action and expectations of new entrant demand, during the most bullish holder behavior in bitcoin‚Äôs history, have signaled a major price recovery underway.

At its core, bitcoin price is a function of new demand, through increased adoption, relative to the amount of limited supply available on the market. And right now, there‚Äôs just not that much supply on the market until the current holders of bitcoin find a new, higher price worth selling at. This is the free market, volatile nature of bitcoin that so many criticize playing out. Except this time the volatility is price exploding to the upside just like it has in every previous cycle.",1634869235,34,1

If you see BTC as the natural evolution of internet, it‚Äôs not so difficult..

During the collapse recovery, they could implement more of their political agenda, and spread their own digital currency. (Sounds like China right?)

They owns the most of it probably, they are listed as second biggest holder! 

I repeat that, China (not Chinese) is the second biggest holder of bitcoin, and if they also seized 1M btc mined in the Genesis (or mined themself) they are actually controlling it.

Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúthey banned‚Äù because it means NOTHING.

there is not a single government that will undisclose their plans because they take care of us, and biggest they are the more they act the opposite as they say.

- This is not FUD. 

It is not FUD because Bitcoin is at constantly updating and upgrading itself so there will be surely at least one easy solution to this risk.
Bitcoin is also evolving in multiple layers asset and can be used to lightning network payment / politic community / global government so can potentially take care of everything.
Bitcoin is going to be a global government controlled by the community.
(Elon Musk said in Bitcoin video on Ark Investment that he sees probably in the future planets with bitcoin(or others crypto) mining system that provide energies for AI and robots taking care of keeping the galaxies safe and in a equilibrium with each other).

the only thing we should do maybe is continuously talking about potential risks/ upgrades that is needed and beneficial to the system itself.
I already know that a lot of comments will be hate and offense, but someone has to take those offense and hate to help each other.
Same did Tupac, xxxtentacion, Juice Wrld, Kennedy, Nelson Mandela and many more.

qjmsjm,varignet,Help transfering btc from blockchain.com,"I'm pissed.
I bought a small sum of btc yesterday and realised too late that blockchain.com now imposes a 0.0002 fixed network fee to move btc to anywhere, whether to a private or external wallet. 

It's a paywall imposed to force small users to stick with the trading account. 

In my case this is 10% of the total sum. What's the point of burning a fixed 10% to have funds transferred in 1hour when such fast transfer time is not required?

Question is, is there a third party tool or service that I could use to transfer btc out of that trading wallet address using my own determined fee (and timeframe)?


And don't get me started with how misleading blockchain is:
I spoke with customer support prior purchasing btc, they alluded I could purchase to either private or trade wallet. And failed to communicate that fees were fixed through the trade wallet and that trade wallet is the only option available when first receiving btc. 
I spoke with CS again today pointing them to the ticket above, they denied the above was clear and just apologised for it without offering and resolution.

I managed to open it up and resync in multibit (took a while) and then export the wallet key to an electrum 3.x wallet... from there to a newest version electrum wallet, so it now sits there safely.

My financial situation is such that i really needed this and it came like a miracle, I want to sell it off at least 60% of it right away, but how do I sell it for the least amount of fees to my national fiat currency (Swedish kronor) without the tax authorities accusing me of laundering money or something.

They are doing chain analysis or what it's called and people do get in trouble for it all the time.

I haven't gotten it from anything illegal, but back in 2014 when i bought it from a major swedish btc trading site, i used it as a payment method for some bad personal-medical habits that I have since stopped doing, and i'll rather pay the capital gains tax than get in trouble with the law. But I wonder if there is some way to get around the big fees that the well known user friendly trader platforms have?

qjkn9k,E-renter,Exactly 4 years aka 1 halving cycle in Bitcoin and what I've learned,"On Halloween Day 2017 I purchased my first ever Bitcoin, literally the same day the announcement of CME futures came, which finally convinced my stubborn old brain that Bitcoin was a serious financial instrument. I continued to purchase Bitcoin over the next 3 years or so. My average purchase price was approximately $10,000 Canadian per Bitcoin.¬†

During the last 4 years aka 1 having cycle, I also did a lot of trading of shitcoins as well as attempting some ETH mining. Overall this was not profitable as measured in Bitcoin. When I divide my total 4-year costs in CAD by the average price per Bitcoin I paid, I calculate that I only have 75.3% of the Bitcoin I could have had if I just put all that money on Bitcoin and held it. I do hold one other coin which I'm bullish on long-term, but I'm not going to shill that here. When you account for the current value of that other coin I currently have 80.8% of the Bitcoin value that I would have had if I would have simply put all of the money onto Bitcoin and held it.

I am actually fortunate that I hold 75.3% of my would-be Bitcoin stack, and 80.8% if you account for my only other major crypto holding. It could have been much worse. I'm hopeful over the next 4 years that my other holding will grow vs. BTC to allow me to get back to 100% of my would-be stack, which is all I'm looking for. I have no intention of drawing down any of my remaining Bitcoin to try to accelerate that effort. My remaining Bitcoin is in full hodl mode.

The lesson for me in retrospect is buy Bitcoin, full stop. Attempts to mine or trade shitcoins are very likely going to take away from rather than add to your stack as measured in Bitcoin. Bottom line? People who are new purchasers of Bitcoin this year might consider just buying and hodling. But then again a lot of us have to learn things the hard way.

That's all for now friends, see you in 4 more years, and Happy Halloween!",1635666118,59,1

This could be a long read. Kindly bear with me.

I write this primarily in response to the [TechSpot article](https://www.techspot.com/news/91937-bitcoin-largely-controlled-small-group-investors-miners-study.html) from yesterday (r/technology mods told me they only allow ‚Äú*mainstream articles with* *editorial oversight and fact-checking*‚Äù so I'm sharing this here).

But I‚Äôd also like to take this opportunity to write about Bitcoin more broadly as someone who has been following it for more than a decade and I‚Äôll try to do so without complicating the conversation for anyone unfamiliar with Bitcoin.

The TechSpot article cites a non-peer-reviewed National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) [working paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29396) from Igor Makarov and Antoinette Schoar.

NBER claims to be non-partisan but it is a private NPO funded by the likes of [Bill Gates foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2019/11/inv003527).

The chairman of NBER, Karen Horn, is a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and Head of International Private Banking for Bankers Trust.

The authors of this working paper, Igor Makarov and Antoinette Schoar are no experts in Bitcoin.

Makarov is employed by Financial Markets Group (FMG), which focuses on policy research into financial markets and works alongside [banks and regulators in Europe](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/html/index.en.html).

Schoar is a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management and co-chair of NBER Corporate Finance group, who has [previously made it clear ](https://bcf.princeton.edu/events/antoinette-schoar/)that she is no fan of Bitcoin with some pretty misguided takes on it.

It‚Äôs critical to note that the data regarding miners cited in this study is from when mining was largely concentrated in China. This is [no longer the case](https://cbeci.org/mining_map).

The paper claims the authors have ‚Äúthe ability to trace miners on the blockchain.‚Äù The tracking method shown in the paper is based on subjective, unverified ‚Äúalgorithm to track the distribution of mining rewards from the largest 20 mining pools to the miners that work for them.‚Äù

The validity of this conjectural method of tracking was also subjectively verified before all mining operations migrated out of China to many different parts of the world.

&amp;#x200B;

# Bitcoin distribution is not highly concentrated

The first thing we need to acknowledge with Bitcoin is that it is still very much a nascent monetary system. It has come a long way in a short space of time but it‚Äôs only been around 13 years and only 3% of the world‚Äôs population currently use Bitcoin.

It took the Internet 25 years to get to that point. So while adoption is certainly happening a lot quicker, we still have 97% of the world‚Äôs population to bring on board. Unlike the banking system, which has ostracized nearly half of the world‚Äôs adult population, Bitcoin can actually work for every person in the world, no matter who they are or where they come from.

The top wallet addresses [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html) do not belong to individuals. Almost all active addresses holding greater than 10 basis points of the total supply (greater than 0.1%) are addresses belonging to exchanges and custodial services holding custody of Bitcoin that belong to millions of individual users. Not all exchange addresses have been tagged by bitinfocharts. For instance, the third largest address [very likely belongs to Coinbase](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/block/707013/1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ).

Now **you‚Äôre not supposed to be holding your Bitcoin in exchanges** as that defeats the whole point of Bitcoin, besides enabling rehypothecation, which can artificially inflate the supply, and other security risks, but a lot of people do since they‚Äôre new to Bitcoin, unfamiliar with the concept of self-custody, and inadequately appreciate the purpose and potential of Bitcoin. There are ongoing educational efforts to encourage people to take ownership of their Bitcoin.

**Not your keys. Not your sats.**

The wealth distribution is admittedly far from where it needs to be, but it‚Äôs heading in the right direction. As more and more users adopt Bitcoin, the Gini index improves markedly. The game theory embedded into the protocol ensures that it does over time. The article from TechSpot claims that 10,000 individuals control a third of the supply. This, even if we assume to be accurate at face value, is a vastly improved figure from only 2 years ago, when [less than 5000 wallets](https://imgur.com/aNP9Ew6) were estimated to own half the supply.

On-chain analytics firm, Glassnode, [published](https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-supply-distribution/) a finding earlier this year that ownership of Bitcoin is not highly concentrated and it naturally disperses over time. I‚Äôll explain a little later in this article why that is the case.

&amp;#x200B;

# Beyond the cryptocurrency

Let‚Äôs try to first understand Bitcoin beyond the cryptocurrency, as a software protocol and what it represents for humanity. Sure, price speculation is fun but for me, it‚Äôs the least interesting aspect of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is open-source software collectively hosted by a pure P2P permissionless network of ‚àº 60,000 nodes distributed across the world‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääby far the largest pure P2P network ever. Anyone in the world can propose changes to this software no matter who you are. There‚Äôs no central server or hierarchical structure to this network. You don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs permission to access the network. We don‚Äôt need to know who Satoshi was to trust the system because the code is open for every single human being in the world to read and scrutinize. Satoshi was simply the first, founding contributor to this open software.

This is such a revolutionary egalitarian concept so far removed from all the corruption and iniquities that inhere within our extant hierarchical technology and monetary systems that a lot of people understandably find it difficult to grasp but this could fundamentally fix the world and make money and technology at large work for everyone without privileges.

There‚Äôs a common misunderstanding that Bitcoin has great value because it was the first digital currency. This is untrue. There were several prior attempts‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäB-money, Bit gold and Hashcash the most prominent among them. Satoshi‚Äôs proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm solved a critical flaw in the use of blockchain as a public ledger known as [the Byzantine Generals Problem](https://river.com/learn/what-is-the-byzantine-generals-problem/) (BGP).

Solving for BGP meant that we could have an open ledger network without a central server or middlemen where nobody had to trust anybody else for the system to work. Every node within the Bitcoin network is a server with a live copy of the ledger and each node is able to verify the authenticity of its copy of the ledger without having to trust any of the other nodes.

The concept of blockchain predates Bitcoin by almost two decades. So the value was never in blockchain but the way Bitcoin was able to utilize blockchain as a trustless, permissionless, decentralized public ledger to democratically create, distribute and exchange value.

On the face of it, it‚Äôs easy to mischaracterize Bitcoin as some kind of an investment scheme. It is absolutely not that ([The Newcoiner Dilemma](https://preview.redd.it/kngn40wr20d71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3b134c484734a2b004220711e06767ce4d9aebe)). Who is to benefit from an investment scheme where nobody is in charge?

Bitcoin is a complete revamp of our monetary system to make it work for everyone and more broadly, as a software protocol, Bitcoin has the potential to fix the Internet‚Äôs original sin‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcentralization at the hands of few privileged gatekeepers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand restore it to its originally intended form as a [decentralized P2P network protocol](https://preview.redd.it/5rc5zsks00d71.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=758cbf3af64ea5a1a1d4edcfe7235a9db9231c5c).

A network protocol is only decentralized if any participant within the network is able to access and verify the truth (the state of the ledger) on their own in a very economical manner without requiring permission or trust. We‚Äôve seen many predatory knock-offs since Bitcoin, which are little more than snake-oil marketing gimmicks with fundamentally flawed protocol designs and centralized node architectures. Cynical rent-seeking and exploitation just comes with the territory for any revolutionary technology.

Permissioned, quasi-permissioned, DINO (decentralized in name only) blockchains are a waste of time. Blockchains are comparatively inefficient databases unless truly decentralized. What makes them special is the ability to individually host, validate and audit the ledger.

Throughout Bitcoin‚Äôs history, Bitcoiners have staunchly defended the right of users of the network not to be priced out of running their own node, [most famously 4 years ago](https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WM) when **Bitcoin users stood firm in the face of pressure from miners to prove that it was the users who truly controlled Bitcoin, not miners and not wealthy investors**.

Anyone can host their own [Bitcoin full node on a Raspberry Pi](https://preview.redd.it/1ohgb7ol00d71.png?width=829&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be47cad6110b6147c8d55410b23bca8205cff9ec). This allows them to be an equal rights citizen within the network without delegating trust to a third party. If you cannot self-host a node on your own, you‚Äôre going from trusting bankers to trusting a random person on the internet. That doesn‚Äôt seem so revolutionary, does it?

&amp;#x200B;

# How does such a network¬†scale?

Let‚Äôs take the Internet as an example. The IP suite is a software protocol like Bitcoin. It originally had a monolithic design until we figured out that it could not scale without [layered architecture](https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~ptw/teaching/IWT/transport-layer/tcp-ip-layers.jpg). Bitcoin has undertaken a similar multi-layered approach to scaling in recent years.

Bitcoin‚Äôs base layer is the network layer protocol and the monetary settlement layer. Priorities for this layer are maximizing security and trust-minimization. Built on top of this is a payments layer called Lightning Network.

Lightning Network is a decentralized layer-2 network protocol that uses a native smart contract scripting language to enable instant, almost feeless, global Bitcoin payments.

In Lightning Network, parties to a transaction are required only to have a sufficiently funded open channel active in the network. This is done through a single on-chain transaction.

If there is a direct channel open between the parties, the transaction is routed directly and incurs [no fee](https://preview.redd.it/esqddcdq10d71.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95c4cb49f6d3405594ee84a16c693b558daa0b18). Without a direct channel, the transaction is routed through routing nodes, incurring a small fee, typically no more than a few sats (fraction of a cent), paid to routing nodes hosted by users of the network.

You can find a live node map for Lightning Network [here](https://explorer.acinq.co/). It‚Äôs pretty remarkable how far Lightning Network has come in only 3 years.

With Lightning Network‚Äôs maturation as an infinitely scalable decentralized global payments network, Bitcoin is shifting focus to its next big milestone, Taproot, which is due to go live in mid-November at block height 709632.

Taproot brings [a set of protocols](https://bitcoinops.org/en/preparing-for-taproot/) that enhance Bitcoin‚Äôs privacy, scalability and unlocks the path for seamless integration of application protocols on top of Bitcoin while also ensuring that users are still able to economically run their own Bitcoin full node.

&amp;#x200B;

# Game Theory of¬†Bitcoin

Cypherpunks were pursuing the concept of Bitcoin, a decentralized P2P monetary system, for two decades. Satoshi completed the final, most important, piece of the jigsaw‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsolving the Byzantine Generals Problem to prevent double-spend.

In doing so, Satoshi sought to address two fundamental flaws with fiat money,

1- Centralized, focused issuance and control of money supply and monetary policy

2- Trivial cost of issuance

While issuance entails no cost, the money remains at the mercy of the basest of human qualities, self-seeking greed. All corruptive tendencies of fiat money are a direct consequence of the trivial cost to issue infinite money.

Satoshi‚Äôs proof-of-work algorithm solved for these two flaws by implementing [an ingenious cost of issuance algorithm](https://imgur.com/eFwM54J) that keeps every actor honest and forever scales in proportion to Bitcoin‚Äôs value as a monetary network.

Proof-of-work requires those who acquire the new supply of coins (miners) to continually input real-world work for their rewards and cover recurring operational costs. The work ensures that those who receive the new supply of money cannot keep hoarding it for themselves. Miners are forced by the game theory embedded into the protocol to redistribute Bitcoin into the market.

Any monetary system [where the creation of money entails no work and cost](https://www.amazon.com/Ethics-Money-Production-Guido-H%C3%BClsmann/dp/1933550090) would be fiat 2.0 all over again, a system where wealth equals power, where [the rich forever get richer and the poor get poorer](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/world-s-richest-become-wealthier-during-covid-pandemic-inequality-grows-n1255506).

In proof-of-work, wealth¬†!= power.

Miners input work and recurring costs to find blocks and receive compensation for their work but the blocks are validated by full node users, not miners. Full nodes enforce the rules‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääaccept or reject blocks found by miners‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand hold the power to keep miners honest. Every full node user has one vote. Proof-of-work admits of no corruption or privileges.

A very large portion of the world‚Äôs population is affected by either hyperinflation and/or lack of banking services (c. 4 billion people). Bitcoin allows them to connect to an open, permissionless network to generate, store and exchange value where nobody can stop them. The combination of proof-of-work and economical self-hosted nodes distributed all across the world is what ensures Bitcoin's antifragility, securing the network from state attacks.

# Bitcoin, a global leader in clean energy innovation

20 years ago, [the Internet was boiling the oceans](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0531/6311070a.html?sh=54f838642580). Today, it‚Äôs Bitcoin. In 20 years, the next emerging technology. Energy, in manifold forms, has always been fundamental to human interaction and its impact, an ineluctable consequence of human evolution.

Bitcoin is at once the most fundamentally important technological and monetary evolution for humanity. For the first time in human history, every human on earth can become financially sovereign, set free from the whims of other humans.

Bitcoin is a huge net positive for humanity and [a global leader in renewable energy innovation](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-large-scale-bitcoin-mining-is-driving-clean-energy-innovation-2021-01-06). The renewable energy share of the Bitcoin network is over 4 times that of the average grid. In 2020, renewable energy sources accounted for only about 12% of total U.S. energy consumption. [58% of global Bitcoin mining operations](https://imgur.com/98f7mSM) are powered by renewables.

According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), 66% of the primary energy used to create electricity is wasted by the time the electricity arrives at the customer meter. Bitcoin is able to [harness stranded/wasted energy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-07-01/bitcoin-mining-with-stranded-energy-video), while also mitigating the climate effects of other industries [by capturing flared gas](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-mining-flare-gas-btc-energy-crusoe-energy-coinbase-winklevoss-2021-6) that would otherwise be vented into the atmosphere contributing to climate change. Other industries find the cost of transporting energy prohibitive. With regards to coal, almost all of the coal-powered mining was happening in China. They‚Äôve all [since been shut down](https://cbeci.org/mining_map).

&amp;#x200B;

# The quest for perfect¬†money

What's money? Anything that‚Äôs accepted as representing value by the parties to any transaction. It‚Äôs really that simple. Three thousand years ago, cowrie shells were used to represent value. We‚Äôve had [various forms of money](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/history-money/) since but the quest remains the same. Humans have always sought money that can hold value over time until it was required to purchase other things that hold value to them‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägoods and services.

If we look at money from this perspective, we could argue that money is technology but until now, we never had the technology to come up with a money that was able to fulfill all three functions of money‚Ää‚Äî‚Äästore of value (SoV), medium of exchange (MoE) and unit of account (UoA).

Bitcoin is at once a good SoV (scarce and incorruptible), a good MoE (the payments layer‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLightning Network), and a good UoA (infinite divisibility and instant portability across the world).

I view Bitcoin to be the culmination of humanity‚Äôs 7000-year technological quest to perfect the representation of value by truly democratizing its creation, distribution and exchange. Never before have we had a money with all the necessary properties of sound money. All previous forms of money had compromises.

Scarce money has always been sound money but previous iterations of scarce money lacked the [other properties](https://preview.redd.it/t1azmamjn0u71.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb96dbc2eb0e78bfaaca45fb2da5b10305848f1) required to be viable as MoE and UoA‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfungible, readily portable, infinitely divisible, incorruptible, indestructible, provably finite and objectively verifiable.

Bitcoin ticks all the boxes. It further adds a new dimension to money hitherto unimaginable, obviating the need for trust, eliminating counterparty risk without the burden, cost and attendant inefficiencies of involving trusted middlemen.

&amp;#x200B;

# Triffin paradox

The Triffin paradox explains why any sovereign currency serving as a global reserve currency is unworkable‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe state issuing the reserve currency is required to continually run up a deficit to meet the world‚Äôs demand for its currency. This creates a conflict of interest between domestic and international monetary policies, which becomes untenable in the long run, leading to the collapse of the system. The [average lifespan for reserve currencies](https://preview.redd.it/raj2vtkxn0u71.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bf93b12c22fda167d3108814d0a6b2b3fef5740) is 95 years.

Bitcoin is the only monetary system in history that has the properties to last forever, for, unlike all previous monetary systems, it doesn‚Äôt derive value from the authority or wealth of the issuer, which is fleeting, but a timeless universal constant‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähard-coded mathematics.

&amp;#x200B;

# Fiat money is a pyramid¬†scheme

It would be remiss not to highlight at this time just how unfair our current monetary system is and, something we don‚Äôt often speak of, the jarring impact of inflation-driven compulsive consumerism on climate change.

The current system of credit constantly incentivizes you through a myriad of machinations to keep spending money from tomorrow‚Äôs labor, but the new injection of money from your tomorrow‚Äôs labor ends up being concentrated at the top, with the ultimate consequence of inequitably diminishing your purchasing power and continually enriching those at the top of the pyramid.

In short, money borrowed against your future labor ends up destroying your own purchasing power while the lender profits off your future labor, both in the form of interest and by being closer to the new money. It‚Äôs a double whammy. Fiat money post hoc undercuts the value of our work and time, except for the top 0.01%, some of whom [have seen their wealth grow almost 10-fold](https://inequality.org/great-divide/updates-billionaire-pandemic/) during a once-in-a-hundred-year global pandemic.

In 1971, President Nixon canceled the convertibility of the US dollar to gold. The subsequent collapse of the Bretton Woods system gave central banks absolute monetary authority as the dollar was no longer required to be backed by gold reserves.

Central banks‚Äô newfound ability to continually manipulate supply, interest rates, and velocity of money has led to deleterious consequences. Perpetual expansion to spur illusory ‚Äúeconomic growth‚Äù has sent deficits spiraling out of control and resulted in, inter alia, a vicious cycle of high inflation, recession as a consequence of efforts to mitigate the effects thereof and ever-increasing, now extreme, economic inequality.

I‚Äôll just leave it [***here***](https://imgur.com/a/4LlWaKy) as for the enduring effects of the Nixon shock.

&amp;#x200B;

# Closing thoughts

I‚Äôd like to earnestly urge everyone to read mainstream articles about Bitcoin through a lens of scrutiny as to the interests of those who own these organizations. There‚Äôs an ongoing campaign to poison the well with blatant disinformation while simultaneously accumulating Bitcoin for themselves.

When you really burrow down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, you come to realize that Bitcoin is quite the culture shock, a monetary paradigm shift irreconcilable with the status quo sustained by immoderate expansion normalized through generational indoctrination of the rationally vulnerable to acquiesce to furtive post hoc theft of the value of their work and time, especially in the last 50 years post-Nixon shock.

Mainstream media organizations are owned by the banking establishment and beneficiaries of the fiat pyramid scheme [who stand to lose a lot of power](https://preview.redd.it/r5jquqfi31u71.png?width=1065&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68019bec64e17df45ef3f72c5e7c1d8e3b167e2e) if 8 billion people were to understand [the peaceful revolution](https://ia800609.us.archive.org/28/items/flickr-ows-HenryFordonBanking-6270937493/6270937493_735a880027_b.jpg) that is Bitcoin.

There are no C-suites, marketing/PR teams in Bitcoin to manipulate public opinion or issue any official statements in rebuttal to intellectually dishonest journalism. Bitcoin keeps plowing along honestly, paying no mind to assorted naysayers motivated by self-interest seeking to further various agendas.

Tick.. tock.. next block..

Congratulations to [@LeahWald](https://twitter.com/LeahWald) &amp; our friends [@valkyriefunds](https://twitter.com/ValkyrieFunds) for their **bitcoin futures ETF approval**. In recognition of this milestone, **we helped Valkyrie mine a very unique transaction into Block #706,966**.

A quick summary on putting ASCII pictures into the blockchain üëá

ASCII is a 7-bit character code where each bit represents a unique character. By arranging these bits very specifically, you can create rather intricate artwork. Valkyrie's **transaction contains 43 outputs** **each containing 80 characters**, and **1 line in the ASCII picture.**

https://preview.redd.it/mcdot0gq46w71.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37ce23b4b65bc08b9825bc010c0f83af698bc3d4

The picture data (\~4kB) are placed behind the transaction's OP\_RETURN instruction, making all the outputs provably unspendable. This means that the outputs can be ""forgotten"" by bitcoin nodes and will not be part of the active UTXO set.

For all of you who have said Bitcoin doesn't have much left in it or
that you'd rather invest 100% in alts...just look at the charts and
prices. This is why you always need a large chunk of your portfolio in
BTC.
It's king, and will remain king for the foreseeable future.
The reason most people suggest investing in Bitcoin is because for
the most part it outperforms the entire market year in and year out.
And it won't disappear like most alts will.
50% of my portfolio is in BTC and ETH. I take my profits from all
other alts and pour them into Bitcoin.

ETH fell below the 60 moving average support, after falling in the early low support to undertake, then here you need to shock consolidation to form a new box trend, the opportunity is greater than the risk, like big plate mainstream can consider batch warehouse, but also said ETH is not as good as BNB.

I am planning to make a short video that will be somewhat documentary like.

The video will go over the milestones and will highlight events that led us to where we are now. The documentary will not be serious, nor it will be in great technical and non-technical depth, but it will be much more than memes that we all like to share here from time to time. 

I am asking you all to give ideas here or tell what milestones you think is worth including in the video. As an example some that I have considered are: First ecash ideas, white paper release, launch of bitcoin network, first pizza purchase, first exchanges, crypto community growth, institutional adoption, state adoption. These are not the only ones that I have written down, but I am looking for more ideas. Things that happened prior to Bitcoin might also be worth including, so feel free to share your thoughts.

qfafxt,throw_away298,My experience with those PlAy oUR gAme aNd geT BitCoIns!!!1!1! games.,"Title says a lot from the experience itself.

Some time ago (2 hours from now)i was in bed, seeing some generic animation channel on YouTube and before it, i got a ad for a game that said that, if you played the game, you would gain money.

Now, it is nowhere near my first time seeing ads like this, and way less seeing and in general, but curiosity took my attention.

People in general always tell us to never download this type of app
for it can be virus, ransomware or just a shitty product in general, however i remember some thing, i have a spair cellphone that i didn't use anymore.

Making sure that no important data was on it, i went to play store and searched 'Bitcoin' and downloaded the first shitty game that came to view.

The game it self is a terrible copy of the millions of generic games for kids, and with that i mean the whole package, sounds effects that explode your ear, the saturation on the max and the most GENERIC font kid-friendly.

First thing i noticed was, you needed to pay (with ad viewing) to play!
The average ad revenue is $0.02 on USD and, somewhat $0.1 on the coin that i use(us outsider).
the game itself was the that type of game, where you connect all same-color dots on a line and you try to make the biggest connection possible.

The game that i played gave 1000-2500 points when you completed a level, and the minimum cashout possible is 7500 points. (BTW 900 points=1 satoshi=0.00000001 BTC)
I played 4 games(AKA saw 4 ads) and i got the 7500 points.
Cash Out time baby!
It said that i could receive the payment in 1-2 work days.(but i received in 7 minutes)

So, over all, that is the result?Do i recommend theses?
No. i don't recommend them.
although thruthful, i don't recommend them.
(They got $0.1 USD, and i got 1satoshi)
(BTW, i can't cash out for 7 days now)",1635142439,7,1

qf9cp1,Gandhi70,Risks for Bitcoin,"Right now, I can think of the following possible dangers Bitcoin is facing. If I have forgotten anything, just add to the list.

1) A fatal  and not fixable  flaw in Bitcoins code. Bitcoin has been around for years, so this is very unlikely.

2) Working quantum computers. Should this happen, we face other problems because encryption as we know it would becone obsolete. Including email, banking, ... In my judgement not very likely to happen during the next 10 years. 

3) A concerted effort by major nations to ban Bitcoin. Yes, it is decentral. Neverheless, should Bitcoin become outlawed by such an action, this would massivly hinder its development. Very unlikely, that this scenario will come through.

4) Global breakdown of the Internet. Can only happen during a catastrophic event (global war, giant solar flare with power outage, ...). If this happens, the failure of the  Bitcoin network is the least of our problems.

Conclusion: Yea, there are risks. But the chances outweight the risks by far.",1635137682,21,1

I have made insane gains of SHIB so decided to cash out into the king of crypto: Bitcoin.

This is where it gets bad.

I really like the idea of physical assets, so I looked online (DYOR) for a physical bitcoin. To my delight at the time, I found a seller with a limited edition bitcoin. I sent the $67,000 in USDC to his address and he sent me the physical bitcoin! It arrived yesterday, and unfortunately it is now obvious that I was scammed.

The asshole sent me a physical BITCOIN CASH coin. WTF. This is worth $625 at the most. I tried tweeting to Elon and Saylor but they haven't responded. I am hoping the crypto customer service representatives that have messaged me on reddit are able to help with my refund - I sent them my phrases.

The link above is basically a PSA to all Chinese people that says, ""If you guys have any opinions with regards to allowing crypto being banned, please post them at either of these two websites listed in step 1.""                   

Possibilities:                    
1. This could be a honey trap. Imagine you have 1 million USD in crypto in China. You can't cash that out in China right now.                  
2. You tell the government you want crypto unbanned. Ok, they'll keep you on a tighter leash than the other 97% or 98% of people who don't care about crypto in China.               
3. You might be asking, ""How would they know who holds what viewpoint?"" To lodge an opinion on any of the websites in China where they are asking for people's commentary, you must log in using what's called a hukou number, which is equal to a social security number in America. You don't log in? You can't leave a comment.                 
4. The above 3 points don't mean that government officials in China aren't buying their own crypto. Many of them are literally above the law and any legal persecution in China.

qf7j0s,Elsa897,THE BITCOIN PRICE COULD BE HEADED TOWARD SIX FIGURES," 

As most people who own bitcoin know, price drawdowns that are greater than 50% have been a regular occurrence after each all-time high. What we also know is that bitcoin price has proven to significantly recover from every major drawdown, which has made it the best performing asset over the last decade.

Currently we‚Äôre rebounding from a 56% price drawdown post a 228% recovery. Historically what comes next is yet another massive recovery. This double top pattern playing out is eerily similar to 2013 where price went on to explode over 10 times in just 52 days, starting in early October. As we hover around $66,000, a six-figure bitcoin price is only a 51% price move away. This is a more conserative percentage move during a bitcoin bull cycle recovery based on previous cycles.

History may not repeat itself exactly but all of the on-chain metrics, recent price action and expectations of new entrant demand, during the most bullish holder behavior in bitcoin‚Äôs history, have signaled a major price recovery underway.

At its core, bitcoin price is a function of new demand, through increased adoption, relative to the amount of limited supply available on the market. And right now, there‚Äôs just not that much supply on the market until the current holders of bitcoin find a new, higher price worth selling at. This is the free market, volatile nature of bitcoin that so many criticize playing out. Except this time the volatility is price exploding to the upside just like it has in every previous cycle.",1635130698,41,1

To find this answer, my only historical references that I can understand are the housing top of mid 2008, the ICO/crypto peak of 2017, and the dot com peak of 2000. Let's see some facts:

In the 2008 housing market, you had ""normal people"" owning 5 houses. You had people making 100-200k (the equivalent of 150-300k today) owning 10, and sometimes more. 

In the 2017 crypto boom, you had an enormous amount of everyday people getting into crypto. I was one of them. I was buying greyscale when bitcoin was 8-9k and had ZERO IDEA OF WHAT I WAS DOING. You had entire thanksgivings dominated by these conversations. 

In the nasdaq boom, I don't think we truly understand how manic it was. You had people with zero involvement in the stock market rushing to buy...and it went up for YEARS. Pull a nasdaq chart out and see how steep the angle went from 1997-1998-1999-2000.

My overall point is that if bitcoin goes parabolic, it actually won't be because of anything inherently great about bitcoin. Bitcoin is already great. It will be that buyers on the sidelines come in just like they did in these 3 other instances. I believe that bitcoin is actually under value-why? My circle has a painfully low exposure to bitcoin (crypto in general). There is not 1 person that has net worth above 500k who has 10% of their money in bitcoin...however, I have seen the trend rise over the last few months.

When I see my friend who decides to go from a 1k purchase every 2 months (he makes 17k a month with zero kids and $2k a month rent) to a $50k purchase...then maybe. When I see the people at my coffee shop go from laughing at bitcoin to asking questions...then maybe. When I see it be the topic of conversation...then maybe.

Humans do NOT learn. Bitcoin is a reflection of governments never learning from the mistakes of debasing currency. I continue to stack, hodl, and have an open mind.",1635123594,7,1

pzge84,RegretSlow7464,Why would Joe Sixpack want Bitcoin in 2021?,"Now that it is being corralled, lassoed, taxed and increasingly choked off in a number of countries. An example of this is South Korea. I have a bit of bitcoin which I originally bought there several years back. As I am thinking about leaving where I am and travelling there, I wanted to find a place where I could withdraw a bit of cash. I got the message after a google search ""There are no bitcoin atms in south korea"". A bit of a surprise to me, but some research confirms that the government has been choking off the supply in a number of ways. Banks have blocked their debit cards from being used on exchanges. A number of exchanges will be shut down because they are not able to comply with regulations. Anyone who trades bitcoin will have to pay a 20% tax going forward. So if you made 2,500 usd, you'll have to give the government 500 dollars of that. 

Now if the assumption is that bitcoin once had no  real worth, then bought pizza, then was worth like 20 bucks a coin, then a thousand etc etc and will keep going up is true, a South Korean would still be willing to fill in a ton of forms and pay taxes to get their hands on some. Or even buy in the black market if it becomes too difficult or impossible to do so legally. Apparently there is already a ""kimchi premium"" for bitcoin where it costs 12 to 25% over spot price to buy there. I think America could go a similar way as well.

So my thoughts are that besides the case for bitcoin being essentially ""gold on steroids"" there really isn't a need for it in most developed economies in 2021. I mean there would be if governments weren't trying to protect their turf, but as they are.... Perhaps with laxer regulations in the third world and the population boom  expected there, maybe these first world countries won't matter, or maybe if bitcoin continues to rise they'll open back up, but I just don't see it. I have zero idea what it will be worth in six months, a year, ten years etc. but what I'm saying is for the average consumer who has a limited amount of pocket change to save, I don't see them getting into it, and for wealthy people I think they'll find legal tax avoidance schemes in dollars, pounds, euros etc. What do you think?",1633120029,19,1

&gt;Unfortunately, between **March and May 20, 2021**, you were a victim of a third-party campaign to gain unauthorized access to the accounts of Coinbase customers and move customer funds off the Coinbase platform. At least 6,000 Coinbase customers had funds removed from their accounts, including you.  
&gt;  
&gt;In order to access your Coinbase account, these third parties first needed prior knowledge of the email address, password, and phone number associated with your Coinbase account, as well as access to your personal email inbox. While we are not able to determine conclusively how these third parties gained access to this information, this type of campaign typically involves phishing attacks or other social engineering techniques to trick a victim into unknowingly disclosing login credentials to a bad actor. We have not found any evidence that these third parties obtained this information from Coinbase itself.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even with the information described above, additional authentication is required in order to access your Coinbase account. However, in this incident, for customers who use SMS texts for two-factor authentication, the third party took advantage of a flaw in Coinbase‚Äôs SMS Account Recovery process in order to receive an SMS two-factor authentication token and gain access to your account.  
&gt;  
&gt;Once in your account, the third party was able to transfer your funds to crypto wallets unassociated with Coinbase.

From a shareholder perspective, I think this is very egregious that this was happening around the time of the IPO, but they didn't disclose this until just now.

If you don‚Äôt know what BTC futures trading is, basically it‚Äôs a type of trading where investors can speculate on the price of the coin without having to actually hold it. They have to put forth some minimum collateral, called the ‚Äúmargin,‚Äù in order to participate. Some exchanges like Binance allow cryptocurrencies themselves to be used as margin.

When an investor thinks that the price of the coin will decrease in the future, they bet on it using a futures ‚Äúshort.‚Äù

Those who assume a bullish outlook for Bitcoin go with a ‚Äúlong.‚Äù In both cases, investors make profit if the coin moves in the direction they are betting on.

However, if BTC moves opposite to how they imagined it would, they end up taking the loss, and have to pay it using their margin.

All futures positions require a minimum amount of margin in order to remain open. During a liquidation, an exchange forcibly closes a trader‚Äôs position because of a partial or total loss of the initial margin.

I've been cleaning out the house and selling things on Craigslist, OfferUp, etc. There's an option on Craigslist now that says ""accept crypto"". I really want to get in on this, but am unsure of the smartest way to go about it. How are others going about doing their private sales? Questions:

1. This might be a stupid question, but how do you determine an acceptable crypto price? In a volatile world, do you do a conversion on the day of the sale and figure out the acceptable fiat equivalent? Is this the normal, accepted practice?
2. How do you actually do the transfer? Do you give them your wallet address, have them do the transfer in front of you, then wait the required amount of time for it to show up in your account before you let them have the merchandise? I know some coins are faster than others. I've waited for a transfer from one of my wallets to another (I forget which coin) for a few hours once.
3. Do you typically only accept certain types of crypto, say only BTC?
4. Do you give them your cold-storage wallet address to receive the funds? I think there's a concern that they can see your total holdings that way. So do you give them an address on an exchange instead?

&amp;#x200B;

*The details from my memory below are fuzzy to say the least, but here we go...*

&amp;#x200B;

\- I saw a reddit post and bought one for around \~$100

\- I believe I did it on an old work computer. While that company no longer exist, it is possible that I could potentially access the hard drives, if they have them (from what I recall they backed everything up, and I still know those people well)

\- Guessing it was a hardware wallet based on what I would have done back then

\- I put whatever information I had from that work computer likely in a note or word doc on my home computer. **Good news there, I still have that computer.** I've got it up and even have the old hard drives I routinely backed everything up on. It's an old toshiba laptop from about 2007 with windows, but I haven't found anything there though.

\- I've searched the drive on my old computer with some basic phrases and not a whole lot has popped up

\- I used to have this notecard with a lot of random digits on it that, only until recently I realized/thought of. I remember always thinking wtf is this but for years I saved it. For some reason a couple years back I threw it out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Today I tried to go to the bank of america to get checking statements from that time frame, which then BoA tells me they can't go back more than 7 years. I would ideally get statements between 2011 and 2013 and seriously, I know those statements are somewhere to be accessed.

Whole other deal there but BoA has been a dead end on getting those statements, so even just an idea on BoA and what charges to look for could really help solve this.

This is the situation, any guidance or help would be beyond appreciated, to say the least.",1633111016,11,1
pzd9pb,Richieman77,Satcent proposal. Better alternative to Satcomma standard?,"Hi everybody,

I've come across the Satcomma standard and similar proposals recently. I immediately came up with an alternative that seems easier and simpler to me. Surprisingly I haven't seen anyone else come up with this. I'm just throwing the idea out here, hopefully someone finds it useful.

&amp;#x200B;

So Satcomma represents an amout of BTC as follows: ‚Çø6.15,395,023

I understand, you understand, but it will be confusing to the majority of the population. Guaranteed.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my Satcent proposal.

Let's redefine Sats as follows:

* 1.000.000 SATS = 1 BTC 
* A sat can have 2 decimal places, Satcents.

So 1 BTC = 1.000.000,00 SATS

So if you are SAT millionair you have 1 BTC and a sat can be devided into 100 Satcents.

Most major currencies use cents, and a millionaire is already a well established concept. It makes totally sense to me. What do you think?

Very simple and recognizable for everybody.

Just my 2 SAT cents worth.

# Flag Breakout

Throughout September, the price consolidated in a flag. Similar to 2013 and 2017, retaining support at established resistance 40600 was critically important. Once that was secured, a breakout was imminent, and it materialized earlier today.

pzaaze,falsejaguar,Canadian tax idea/tip,"Have real BTC, but figured out how to help keep some profit from tax man.  Figured out how to help myself.  Going to take some mining income (that is taxable as income at price I received, around $235 a month), sell it, then use my TFSA to buy the ETFs...  So remember I'm keeping most as real BTC, but for the rest this trick.  That way when Plan B proves to be right and I want to sell some, instead of having half the capital gains taxes... None of it taxed.  So for now let's say in a month BTC goes up a few dollars, half of that gain is taxable... So a few dollars beyond the mining income itself.  The rest?  TFSA baby meaning the ETFs only charge like less than 1%.  Sounds like a way better fucking deal to me.  Then before end of Feb, if I have let's say over $2000 extra income from the mining that will be taxed probably 20% (blue collar dude), then oh fuck, I could sell a bit of the tax free ETFs and put $2000 into my trading RRSP and once again buy the same ETFs of BTC.  Hahaha.  So then I defer the tax and have no additional income to pay for the year.

I found to bitcoin in the end of december 2020. first bought on the 25th of december. went in heavy directly. no DCA stuff. eventhough this seems pretty wise. Had a lot of fomo. Found out that this was a good decision. lost some while trading on bybit. fuck that shit. stopped trading after i lost around a good piece of my portfolio cake. but never lost hope it the whole thing. kept educating me about bitcoin. never felt for the altcoin seduction. it got bloody in the crash. but never lost hope. even not in july where i was partly down \~10 % - felt pretty fucked up - imagening the fact that, if never started trading i could have sold at 200% during my first (part)bullrun. but hey, i think i got the message. in math we trust. bought again at 45k in the crash. had no fiat to buy the bottom of the crash at 30k. but i bougt again in may at 45k and again a few days ago at 41k, after selling my remaining stocks. 

Reading all your stories and listening to people like michael saylor (i know...bitcoin doesnt need anyone) ...but never the less... this all made me pretty calm in my inner self concerning all the smoke and flashlights/FUD around BTC. - Still can't believe i eventhough i am irresponibly long on BTC for my league - all in.

to come back to my point...

i have some smart friends. but none of them seem interested in bitcoin. doesnt matter how much i preach them. Bitcoin, its faith and its possible rise seems to be a much too fantastic theme to be true...no one seems to believe it. OR they think its to late XD

I think ignorance of the people. the easyness to get fed by mass media - not using the own brain....thats the real threat to Bitcoin and Mankind. Isnt it?

This is where things get fucky.

They require you to dox your Gmail account.  Then they require you to enter a bunch of your personal information that wasn't required in the first place to buy a Vault (e.g. your phone number).

I messaged them and requested that I provide just the basic details to demonstrate my entitlement to the refund, but they suggested that they did not understand my request.  Then they sent me a separate form, not from Google Forms, and it was written in mandarin.  I used Google Translate to complete the form, providing them with just the information required to demonstrate that I purchased their product and am entitled to a refund, but this was three weeks ago and I haven't heard back.

Oh, and they require you to provide a ""Tron"" address for the refund.

In short, they have stopped communicating with me and have not been responsive to my requests for an update on my refund claim.  

There is something seriously fishy going on with this company and I urge people to be careful in dealing with them.

If anyone's been successful getting a refund, let me know!

They are the second biggest  holders after Grayscale, a company that manages crypto investment funds. 

Bitcoin is a better gold than gold, yeah I know. In our wet dreams we dream of the US government or the SEC coming out and saying that they have secretly bought big chunks of bitcoin. The price would actually skyrocket, and mainstream adoption would come a long long way. However, as we stand now China owns way too many bitcoins, it would give them way too much control. 

It might be worth to keep an eye on whether China auctions off any of their holdings. That would mean the West could get one step ahead, and profit greatly from being the first ones buying in. So basically, I'd argue that adoption would not become mainstream until there are single whales holding this much each.

Or I can wait for a Bitcoin ETF which is also paper bitcoin. 

But I don‚Äôt want to do that shit. I want to own my own bitcoin and have my own keys.

The only option I see right now is not a good one:


I am below the 59.5 age threshold to withdraw the funds from my IRA without penalty. 

- this means that my IRA will be taxed as income if I withdraw the funds 

AND

-There will be an additional 10% penalty 


My question: has anyone else considered this? Would it be better to wait with the cash in GBTC and see IF there are better investing options for 401ks - like direct buys ( not ETFs) or should I take the massive penalties - which would cut my IRAs value to about 50% of its current value and just buy and move that much smaller amount to cold storage?",1633788580,29,1

The privacy and security challenges associated with a hot wallet, the on chain fees and time, the convenience, it never made sense to me for small purchases.

If I rounded, I did an average of 0 bitcoin transactions per month for the last 8 years.

But the last 2 months?  That's changed.  I've lost track of the sub $50 transactions I've made because of lightening.

Lightening is here.  And it has changed the game.  It gives me chills.  Remember the meme ""when you are ready, you won't have to sell""?  We made it boys.  The year was 2021 when that happened.

This post is a call to action for others who might be like me.

Step 1 - download or find a user friendly wallet like wallet of satoshi.  There are basically two types.  Custodial ones that handle channels for you, non-custodial ones where you have to figure it out.  Custodial wallets offer an AMAZING UX.

Step 2 - send some spending money such as 0.0003 to 0.003 BTC to your new wallet via http://boltz.exchange

Step 3 - keep that BTC lightening-hot on your phone ready to go to pay a merchant.  Try it out on stacker.news or foldapp.com or tallyco.in or whatever else people post in the comments

Step 4 - get an email address from coins.io, to give to others to receive LN from friends

Step 5 - show your friends.  Give them 1000 sats to try it out.

I am from the biggest community and political stronghold at the Crypto front known as ""The TenUp community"".  There were many obstacles we faced within the country got orders from the courts to legalize trading, holding and mining setups for cryptocurrencies. Soon we are going to get clean chit from The Court to regulate and recognize cryptocurrencies. It has been a long journey since 2018 and fight to get cryptocurrencies from grey to white and soon clean. We started off in the lead of Crypto and TV media host/Influencer Waqar Zaka, one can say he's is the biggest blockchain ambassador from Pakistan fighting for the blockchain and technology.

 TenUp community launched a great project back in 2018 at [tenup.io](https://tenup.io) .[tenup.io](https://tenup.io) .

\* Started with its own blockchain now tokenized on ETH as TUP.

\* Simplifying and solving the densely formulated code of conduct.

\* ERC20 token based on Ethereum mainnet.

\* Spreading its wings with personalized DeFi projects for instance world‚Äôs first Cricket NFT marketplace.

\* The most celebrated Asian sport is Cricket.

\* LP tokens staking, Tenup Swap (DEX).

\* Bringing VR to Blockchain in ways not possible before.

The Road map is attached in the comments but you can further explore the sub-section of our website [tenup.io](https://tenup.io) i.e. [tenup.io/Introducing-TenupSmart](https://tenup.io/Introducing-TenupSmart). We are building a community of Blockchain Technology believers. Together we enable the Web 3.0. Together we grow. Join the struggle with us, TenUp.

q4hxa1,LinLo99,My 9 years of cryptocurrency experience,"**My 9 years of cryptocurrency experience**

My name is Rowling and I come from a wealthy business family in Hong Kong. I currently live in the United States most of the time, and I have heard a lot of my parents‚Äô business experience since I was a child. I didn't have deep feelings in the past. My grandfather lived in a war-torn era in China and was able to survive in Hong Kong with the help of the United Nations. Later, he founded a clothing company through his own efforts, but my grandfather is not a very fair person. My grandfather has 6 children. My father is the eldest son of the family. He didn't learn to speak until he was 3 years old. My grandfather prefers my second uncle. The ending is obvious. My second uncle inherited all the assets of my grandfather. Later, Mom and Dad founded a new clothing company through their own efforts. Now my father‚Äôs company has diversified investments involving clothing, real estate and mask production. Sometimes life is really important because I have three brothers and I am the youngest daughter in the family. Under the love of the three brothers, I have never felt the hardships of life. It wasn't until 2008 that I lost the $2 million that my father gave me. The financial crisis in 2008 brought me to the bottom of my life. Although my parents didn't blame me, I didn't dare to go home during that time. I am afraid that my parents will be sad because of the failure of my stock investment. Later, my eldest brother found me and gave me a sum of money. My brother loves me very much. He asked me to travel to Japan. My family doesn't want me to feel sad because of the failure of stock investment. Later, I followed the advice of my parents. In 2012 I went to Tokyo, Japan. While traveling in Tokyo, I heard about Bitcoin among cryptocurrencies. I have been a brave girl since I was a child, always full of curiosity in the face of new things, even if I don‚Äôt understand new things, I will get hurt. But I am always fascinated by it. Out of curiosity, I bought 500 bitcoins at a price of $10 each. Later, the price of Bitcoin rose all the way. This is a very crazy investment experience. I sold all my bitcoins for $20,000 in December 2017, which allowed me to make more than $9 million in profits. I'm very lucky. Since then, I have focused on various cryptocurrencies. This is my cryptocurrency life. Thank it for bringing me more money. Thank you for investing in cryptocurrency so that I can travel the world. Currently I invest in cryptocurrencies, but many cryptocurrencies are very unstable. I mainly hold USDT, which is used for liquidity mining, which can bring me rich returns every day. Coinbase will settle ETH for me every day. Its income is more generous than the bank. It exists in my coinbase wallet. Now I am a traveler, philanthropist and investor. I have been engaged in cryptocurrency investment for 9 years not only did not make me feel bored. I am still excited about owning this investment. I hope that I will have the same hobbies as everyone. I hope to have more friends in the field of cryptocurrency. When we have time, we can share life and cryptocurrency with each other, and don't disturb each other when we don't have time.",1633771675,28,1

On September 24, 2021, the Central Bank of China published ‚ÄúThe¬†Notice on Further Preventing and Disposing of the Risk of Speculation in Cryptocurrency Trading‚Äù on¬†its official website, further clarifying the attributes of cryptocurrency and related cryptocurrency activities, and proposing to strengthen the monitoring of the risk of speculation in cryptocurrency trading.

This is not the first time China has banned crypto. According to Cointelegraph, China has banned BTC and crypto 19 times since 2009.

And at this particular time,¬†the policy is stronger than ever.

Many of you may¬†have heard about the China ban news, but news might¬†not be systematic enough, so in this video we are going to take a look at the big issues surrounding China‚Äôs latest ban on crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**1. The Update of the concept description of cryptocurrency**

&amp;#x200B;

In the newly released document, it is clearly pointed out that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDT are¬†being issued by monetary authorities, using cryptography and distributed accounts or similar technologies, and existing in digital form, etc. They are not fiat¬†currencies ,and¬†also cannot be circulated for use in the market.

It is the first time in the document to suggest that cryptocurrencies have key features such as the use of cryptography and distributed accounts or similar technologies, and exist in digital form.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**2. The ten ministries and provincial governments vowed to work together to root out ""illegal"" cryptocurrency activity** 

&amp;#x200B;

Among them, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, the General Administration of Market Supervision and the Foreign Exchange Bureau all appear in such documents for the first time, and propose to build a multi-dimensional risk prevention and disposal system for cryptocurrency trading speculation.

China seems to be taking every measure to enforce these guidelines. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**3. For the first time, the legal risk of participating in cryptocurrency investment and trading activities are presented.**

&amp;#x200B;

The document states that any legal person, unincorporated organization and natural person who invest in cryptocurrency and related derivatives, contrary to public order and morality, the relevant civil legal act is invalid, and the resulting losses shall be borne by them.

Suspected actions of undermining the financial order¬†or endangering financial security¬†will be investigated¬†and dealt¬†with by relevant departments according to the law.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**4. First time proposing to give criminal sanctions**

&amp;#x200B;

The most attention-grabbing point is that for the first time, the criminal liability for cryptocurrency activity will be pursued. The document also clearly points out that cryptocurrency-related business activities are illegal financial activities, and in the latter part of the paragraph also added the expression ""strictly prohibited, resolutely banned according to law"". It also pointed out that if the related illegal financial activities constitute a crime, the criminal responsibility will be investigated according to law.

Meanwhile, the crypto economy was rebounding from its last dip after the great panic, until the¬†news from China¬†dealt another blow.

Just after the notice was issued on the evening of September 24th, crypto markets plunged in response and major cryptocurrency exchanges were¬†cutting off access to Chinese users. Huobi stopped allowing new users from China to sign up for its services, while Binance blocked account registration using Chinese mobile numbers.

Industry media ""Blockchain Daily"" made a count based on public information, which as of press time, 13 institutions announced to the public that they will withdraw from the mainland Chinese market.

The frequent targeted crackdowns caused panic, but some experienced traders say they seem to be used to seeing regulatory signals as ""a brief burst of noise"". A cryptocurrency trader said, ""We've witnessed too many strong or weak regulatory moves since the beginning of the year, and the market has actually been anticipating them for a long time.

With the cryptocurrency regulatory posture becoming more and more severe, how to find a balance on the scale of market innovation and financial stability seems to be a major problem in front of governments.

Looking around, countries around the world have different attitudes towards cryptocurrency regulation: there is strong support, there is wait-and-see tolerance, and of course, there is an explicit ban.

There are reports in foreign media that crypto experts seem to be more worried about U.S. regulation than Chinese regulation.

The United States, as one of the most developed countries in the global financial market and one of the vanes¬†of crypto industry development, has always been ambiguous in its attitude towards cryptocurrencies. But the attitude seems to have shifted recently, as the U.S. regulators have intensified their attention to the crypto industry.

&amp;#x200B;

SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has been calling for regulation of the crypto market, and the SEC has been working overtime to develop a set of rules to do just that. Others, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have also expressed concern about the space.

Larry Summers, former U.S. Treasury Secretary and chief economist at the World Bank, spoke about cryptocurrency regulation in an interview with Bloomberg, saying that strict regulation would benefit cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies would be better regulated in a sound way, rather than being seen as a haven for libertarians.

On the contrary, the attitude of Asian countries towards cryptocurrency has always belonged to an early start and gradually tightened up. For a long time, the crypto industry has been in full swing in Japan, which has now formed a more perfect regulatory system for cryptocurrencies, and its open and accommodating attitude towards cryptocurrencies is now attracting crypto companies and enthusiasts from all over the world.

As a neighboring country, South Korea is well known for its cryptocurrency mania, which has gradually given rise to some shadow transactions. And this year, South Korea has accelerated its pace in terms of regulation of cryptocurrencies. In March, South Korean crypto-asset companies were required to report their transaction data to government agencies and comply with anti-money laundering regulations.

The same goes for Indonesia, where Trade Minister Muhammad Luthfi said on Sept. 26 that Indonesia will not ban cryptocurrencies completely, but will tighten regulations.

And in Latin American markets, where cryptocurrencies are on the rise, there is much rejoicing.

Cryptocurrencies provide a hedge against inflation, an alternative or complement to traditional banking , and a cheaper way for individuals and businesses across the region to make cross-border payments.

El Salvador, which is¬†the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as fiat currency. Mexico, where bitcoin has gained traction as an add-on to traditional financial services. And Cuba's central bank is recognizing and regulating bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well as¬†setting new rules for how to handle digital¬†currencies.

&amp;#x200B;

The advantages of overcoming inflation, cross-border payments, helping the unbankable, access to loans, etc. have triggered a ""domino effect"" in Latin America. Despite the opposition, there is no stopping the boom of crypto in Latin America.

What we can see from the above cryptocurrency regulatory attitudes of various countries is that, for the time being, the international community is unable to reach a unified consensus on cryptocurrency regulation. However, it is undeniable that the numerous regulatory policies have undoubtedly put forward higher requirements for crypto practitioners, who should pay close attention to industry developments, strictly implement the relevant anti-money laundering system, enhance risk control and advance warning, as well as avoid touching the relevant legal red lines in business development in order to ensure healthy and sustainable business development, which is also the way for cryptocurrencies to survive in the future.

What I am curious about action such as: 

- Trolling, for example replying by memes and ad hominem rather than rational counterargument, specially with critics.

- Gate keeping, for example shaming people for questions that may sound reasonable for them but may sound stupid for others.

- Financial advice form unlicensed individuals with emphasis on gains, without mentioning that mentioning the price volatility or taxes or security risk. (There is already a plague of scammers and bots that may take advantage of that indirectly).

- aggressive attitude towards other individuals about other Cryptocurrencies, rather that advancing argument about specific concerns the general attitude is generalized description of a sh*t coin or scam with explaining the specifics, at least for the major Cryptocurrencies.

Thinking of adding a smart contract to show collectors history.  And would preferably like to use BitCoin but doesn't have to be.

Once I get better, I'd like to be able to have a digital version in circulation, with the physical either held with me or the owner ... don't know how to work it yet ...

Figure I can only learn by doing so asking if anyone wants to lend a hand...

These first two will be small coffee tables, with the option to use as wall art.  Can't see it from these pics, but the coins float at different levels, giving a bit of an illusion of them floating in the space of the clear resin.

Will have simple hairpin legs for this version, but ultimately would like to put some big brass or bronze branch legs on em.

Poor guy was working 14 hour shifts, and you could see his exhaustion. I‚Äôm never one to impose my knowledge or views on people, but I saw this guy could benefit from it and already curious, so I decided to explain.

I had to explain it like I was talking to a 5 year old because his financial literacy was low, but when I saw him wrap his head around concepts like fiat debasement his eyes would light up. Eventually half an hour into the conversation he had a lightbulb moment and said he had heard enough. All he wanted to know was how and where he could start stacking ASAP. He was completely sold and finally understood; it was honestly such a beautiful moment.

I showed him the ropes on how to access it, stay clear of scams, protect your keys, lowest fee exchanges etc. I also left him with the ‚Ç¨35 cash I had left in my wallet, but only if he buys bitcoin with it and never sells, otherwise I want it back üòÇ

He would not stop insisting on driving me to the airport. And this was before any of our bitcoin conversations happened. It always blows my mind how the people who have the least are the most giving ‚ù§Ô∏è

This is honestly what it‚Äôs all about. Bitcoin is designed to bring people out of poverty. It feels great catching your own fish, but even better teaching someone else to fish.

q7x1re,We_like_stonks,Questions regarding Bitcoin price action,"I am trying to better understand Bitcoin's price action during high volatility. I have been following crypto since 2018, however since the dump in May, I've been observing some different trends in Bitcoin which leave me slightly confused.

1) On October 11, Bitcoin felt naturally bullish reaching $57,800.  Every dip was bought ferociously by the bulls and it was clear to me that the bulls were in control.  There was steady price action on both sides of the book and very few ""shotguns"" through the choke points.  On October 13, Bitcoin felt to be ""shotgunned"" through every choke point starting from $54,500 when Bitcoin looked like it was going to fall off a cliff. I was watching the aggregated chart and all of a sudden buyers $5B in BTCUSD came out of nowhere in about 2 minutes and OI skyrocketed. Following, each time Bitcoin looked to plateau, about $1B in buyers came, again out of nowhere, to get the price to the next leg up.  With Bitcoins massive market cap, I want to find it hard to believe that the market could be manipulated. However, as you can see, once Bitcoin reached high of $58,500, the ""shotgunning"" stopped and there have been absolutely no buyers to be found. Bitcoin has been in a decline.   When the price went to $53,000 a few weeks back, I observed the same exact ""shotgun"" behavior, which again, was followed by a flash crash after a short period of consolidation.    This leads me to believe another flash crash is very likely coming soon.

2) When the price of Bitcoin is in ""shotgun"" mode, I notice heavy presence of FTX, OKEX, and Bitfinex.  For example, during these periods, FTX has so much activity it honestly looks like they just buy both sides of the book. You'll find them doing hundreds of buy/sell orders for the same amounts, normally 1-2 BTC, spammed over and over within 1-2s apart.  When the heavy selling starts, they buy more Bitcoin, usually $1.5M - $2.5M transactions within a few seconds of each other.  They don't even wait for any dip in price, so it's not a buy low, sell high.  

&amp;#x200B;

q7w0bg,edgarix,Question: cheap way to store Bitcoin for a long time,"Recently, my niece was born and I was thinking about a gift for her, that she could open at her 18th birthday/wedding/whatever. Generally somewhere in 20 years+.

I bought her a bottle of Absinthe, but I was thinking I could give her few Bitcoins (few: ~4$) there as well. It might be worth a lot, or nothing, but hey, there is always a booze!

My requirements:
- should be cheap, I plan to give her just few bucks
- should be able to survive 20+ years locked in the wooden box
- should be usable even after 20 years, not depending on any current website/company/...
- should be fairly secure

My first thought was paper wallet, but there might be better options.

I am a Finnish citizen (dual citizenship) currently living in the UK. Brexit's trading limitation for persons with a UK residency ‚Äì effect 1st of January 2021 meant that I can no longer use online banking to sell my investments.

I called the bank today and learnt that the effective fee for making a sale has increased 210% to an upward of 1000% because sales must now be done manually. The current fee is 2% of total value or a minimum of 168.9 Euros/ transaction.

A 300 Euros investment in Nokia would cost 168.9 Euros to sell, a whooping 56.3%. What the fuck!

As a customer, I was not informed about this in advance. Now I have two choices: Have my investment locked forever in this bank or pay the 20x fee to get out of my investment (close to 1000 EUR fee to make 5 sales). 

To add insult to injury if I had moved my investments into fucking BTC when I moved from Finland to the UK I would have sit on a million worth of BTC now. Of course I'll pay the right amount of UK tax if I decide to cash out, not fucking 56% though.

q7s8rj,No-Toe-2141,BIP39 seed phrases: their flaws and how to use securely,"I am interested in storing bitcoin (and some other cryptocurrencies) for the long term and want to do so securely in every sense of the word. 

When looking into Electrum whilst developing an airgapped cold storage mechanism that worked for me, I noticed that Electrum is actually against the use of BIP39. Developers at Electrum, as well as some at Bitcoin Core, wrote specifically that such seeds are problematic as they lack ‚Äúversioning‚Äù and require a ‚Äúfixed wordlist‚Äù (2048 words). The crux of their argument, I think, is that the seed itself is not enough to be able to recover crypto if they lose access to or forget the specific software that generated addresses from their seed that they sent crypto to. 

So to those who may know something about this topic: I would love to know more about this. I don‚Äôt really understand what they mean exactly with these criticisms of BIP39... what are the flaws of this seed phrase system? Can one still use BIP39 seeds to back up their addresses and keys with some other information besides the seed itself? What alternatives are there to the BIP39 seed system that don‚Äôt have the same flaws? 

If I knew what the flaws were and understood them, then I could either find a way to still use BIP39 and do whatever I need to do to use it in a more secure way, and/or use an alternative system which may be superior.

P.S. Please, I don‚Äôt want comments saying something like ‚Äúoh, you‚Äôre overthinking it‚Äù or ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt matter, just use a BIP39 seed like everyone else‚Äù or something like this. I am actually interested in blockchain technology, security, cryptography, all of this... this is what the true spirit of bitcoin and crypto is. Not just people blindly FOMOing into digital tokens that they have either no understanding of or a very vague understanding of. If that is what you want to do, go ahead, I won‚Äôt judge, but please don‚Äôt judge me when I actually want to use crypto in a secure way, and learn a lot about how the technology works in the process.

# CORE MINING NETWORK THE MOST SECURE INVESTMENT INTO CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING

A new investment strategy that provides a safe and secure opportunity for you to earn Bitcoins without the risks of loosing your investments. 

As any other investment company we build wealth for our investors. Our business model is unique in the sense that by investing in Core Mining Network through purchasing CMNT token‚Äôs, you are a part of the network. You become a voice in the company. It works as a collective, many minds are better than one. No longer do you have to rent miners to earn Bitcoin. No longer do you have to purchase the infamous Ebay mining contracts where they have you pay for a contract to earn Bitcoin to only receive 60% of what you invested. Core Mining Network works in a different manner where you own a percentage of the miners for life as long as you own the CMNT tokens. You will earn an interest on the amount you invested, at time of writing anywhere from 30% to 60% depending on market value of Bitcoin and to top it off, 20% goes back into reinvestment to the company. This means every month we invest in new miners that gets added to the pool and with every new miner comes more profits that automatically gets added to your earnings. The longer you stay, the more earnings you will make and the best part is, you get the payouts in Bitcoin, yes BITCOIN! EVERY month, Not in a no name meme coin.

This is a first in investment strategy. We work for the investors.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Dear Financial Advisor,

We are pleased to announce that IBKR has expanded our Cryptocurrency product offering to Financial Advisors and their clients. Like all of our offerings, you will be able to trade Cryptocurrency related products together with stocks, options, futures, spot currencies, bonds, and funds from a unified IBKR platform. Trade execution and custody are provided by Paxos Trust Company, but you will be able to seamlessly access Cryptocurrency markets through your favorite IBKR trading application.

IBKR wants to make you aware of important considerations before you start trading:

* Markups and allocations are currently unavailable for Crypto trading. However, IBKR is working on this functionality, and it will be provided by the end of the year. Until allocation functionality is in place, only direct allocation to a single account will be supported.
* For your new clients, only fully electronic applications will have the ability to request Cryptocurrency permissions.
* Advisors will need to request the capability to ""Advise in Cryptocurrency"" for their clients within their Advisor Portal. Please [visit our FAQs](https://www.ibkr.com/faq?id=208897797) for specific instructions on requesting the capability. Once you've been approved for that capability, your client subaccounts will be able to see the Cryptocurrency trading permission and request it in Account Management. Each client sub-account must separately request Cryptocurrency permissions, and sign the appropriate agreements, before you can trade cryptocurrencies in that sub-account.
* Advisor clients with conservative investment objectives, such as Preservation of Capital or Income, are limited to 5% of their account value in cryptocurrency (which will be enforced at the time of placing opening orders in crypto).
* Due to the inherent risk in trading Cryptocurrency related products, clients of advisors will be notified directly after the first trade occurs in their account and new clients will be notified if their account is opened with Cryptocurrency capabilities.
* Trading hours for cryptocurrencies are from 3 AM EST Sunday to 4 PM EST Friday. The regular trading session is from 00:00 to 17:00 EST, and the ""late"" trading session is from 17:00:01 to 00:00 EST. Trades occurring in the ""late"" session will appear on the next day's statement.
* There are unique rules that apply to buy orders for cryptocurrency on IBKR platforms. Prices that are too far from the current best offer will not be accepted and Time in force is limited to ""immediate or cancel"" or ""minutes"". Time in force ""minutes"" means orders will be canceled after a set duration, which is currently 5 minutes.
* Cryptocurrency trading is currently limited to U.S. resident clients who have an individual or joint account.

IBKR appreciates your business and is excited to continue to expand the products we offer through you to your clients. Please [review the FAQ](https://ibkr.com/article?id=164273571) on the Cryptocurrency product offering for specific information about how the product will work on the IBKR and PAXOS platforms.

q8umb0,solomonsatoshi,Bitcoin and the Virus from a New Zealand Perspective.,"Covid Delta is now spreading/endemic almost everywhere.

This article by NZ medical specialists suggests that Covid where it is present on a constantly circulating (endemic) basis it has a huge and ongoing crippling impact on peoples health, the health system, supply chains and economy.

[https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/300428045/why-we-must-not-allow-covid-to-become-endemic-in-new-zealand](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/300428045/why-we-must-not-allow-covid-to-become-endemic-in-new-zealand)

Some often speaking for corporate interests/banks have suggested Covid is just a mild flu and we should stop trying to eliminate it and get on with life. In the recent Deltla outbreak here in NZwe were struggling to stop the spread. Then ANZ chairman ex PM John Key who still is popular among many in NZ wrote the following amid the Auckland lockdown effectively ending the popular support and viability of the elimination strategy in NZ. Until then NZ was the last major democracy to still have kept Covid from being constantly in the community.

[www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/300414808/sir-john-key-we-need-to-break-free-of-the-hermit-kingdom-and-stop-ruling-by-fear-on-covid19](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/300414808/sir-john-key-we-need-to-break-free-of-the-hermit-kingdom-and-stop-ruling-by-fear-on-covid19)

Covid Delta now looks like it will spread throughout NZ and the government is trying to get people vaccinated. An opinion piece by a former PM ended the elected governments elimination strategy by breaking down the majority acceptance of and compliance with the lockdown in Auckland showing how vulnerable all democracies are to Covid where to stop Covid you need near 100% compliance.

So now all the major democracies have surrendered to the virus and it will probably be endemic, causing trillions of dollars economic damage for years to come. Someone you know will probably die of it every year and many more will be afflicted with the crippling 'long covid'- major internal organ damage and its consequences including kidneys, liver, heart, lung and brain damage, diabetes etc.

But one nation still successfully resists endemic Covid- China. Their authoritarian autocratic style of government has enabled lockdown compliance and elimination in every outbreak so far. Chinas economy was the only one of the G20 to grow in 2020 and is the only major economy still growing in 2021 while western democracies economies continue to implode or at best stagnate.

Chinas economy will at this rate be the largest in the world much sooner than was previously expected. It will continue to grow while western democracies struggle under the crippling impact of ongoing endemic Covid contagion.

How does this effect Bitcoin? China is likely to further advance its plans for its CBDC digital Yuan DCEP replacing US$ denomination of international settlements/payments. It has already fast tracked Hong Kong assimilation to enable this utilising Hong Kongs extensive connectivity with the global banking system. Extensive use of Yuan/DCEP for international payments  would have a snowball effect on US economic decline. US$ would lose its safe haven status and the vast seigniorage income with it.

But equally many people, funds and nations would not want to use the highly monitored and centralised Chinese CBDC digital currency as a secure store of value/Treasury/Reserve currency even if it was required for trade with China.

This is where Bitcoin becomes an extremely important neutral SoV and MoE.",1634323107,2,1

Key takeaways from this article:

Supporters of the Bitcoin Law may have the last laugh.

46 percent of the population have Chivo Wallet at this time compared to 27% of Salvadorans who have bank accounts as of 2017. The difference is even greater for the low-income Salvadorans.

Salvadorans appear to be converting U.S. dollars into bitcoin and holding onto the digital currency with Bukele tweeted ‚ÄúThe incoming USD quadruples the outflow,‚Äù

Any bitcoin wallet¬†can be used to interact with Salvadoran merchants.¬†

Bitcoin adoption is likely to continue to rise in El Salvador.

The impact of Chivo is likely greater among low-income Salvadorans who have access to smartphones but not banks.

Lummis, who has been [buying bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/01/meet-the-us-senate-candidate-whos-invested-in-bitcoin-since-2013/) since 2013, executed her latest purchase on Aug. 16 via the brokerage platform River Financial. CNBC [first reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/senator-cynthia-lummis-discloses-a-bitcoin-purchase-worth-up-to-100000.html) the news. Under the [Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act](https://www.ethics.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3feffe08-91b6-487f-9074-8e188cb0af62/periodic-transaction-requirements.pdf) of 2012 (STOCK Act) senators and senior staff with earnings above $119,554 are required to disclose certain financial transactions. Part of the requirements means they must report any purchase, sale, or exchange of any stock, bond, commodities future, and other securities on transactions above $1,000.

The senator previously served eight years as Wyoming‚Äôs state treasurer and told CoinDesk last year that during her time as treasurer she had always been looking for ‚Äúsomething that was a good store-of-value.‚Äù Her son-in-law and his friends helped educate the senator about bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a store-of-value, she said, prompting her to jump on the bandwagon when the crypto was trading for around $320.

While a bitcoin advocate, Lummis [slammed stablecoins](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/29/pro-crypto-senator-lummis-thinks-stablecoins-should-face-audits/) during a speech on the Senate floor last week saying they ‚Äúmust be 100 percent backed by cash ... and this should be audited regularly‚Äù expressing her concerns that cryptos pegged 1:1 to other sovereign fiat currencies lacked transparency.",1633657634,0,1

q3msnp,Hurlep63,Crypto will conquer Central Banks!,"The problem with central bankers is that they refuse to look outside the system they abide by. In fact doing so would ostracize them from their stronghold in an elite community that is cult like in ignoring the obvious. The obvious fact is that central banks are running Ponzi schemes with low discount rates that allow them to persist for decades, even centuries, as long as they expand above that rate. QE and immigration is needed as a supplement since advanced nations' populations fail to reproduce themselves, let alone grow. I relate this oversight similar to religious people who continue to believe in the impossible, yet all evidence around them at all times point to the obvious. The system cannot be fixed from within! International, intergenerational Ponzi schemes cannot be unwound or forgiven. Socialism results as the ultimate Ponzi scheme as each generation steals from the next until nothing is left work for and society collapses. Something new must emerge from outside to take it's place and by refusing to look outside of the box that central banks' created will only keep society in a catch 22. That predicament is one of increased state control at the cost of the individual. It is almost like the system of a debt based fiat currency is designed to consolidate wealth in the hands of a few at the expense of the many. Fortunately, new systems are in place that decentralize the power and naturally increase the safety and security of society in the process. Yes, the current financial system will be forced to invest in that system for their short term financial livelihood at the expense of their long term economic freedom. That catch 22 is the exact opposite of the system they created that forces the individual into debt as a short term benefit but long term imprisonment.",1633654227,6,1

These two demographics, separated by an enormous divide of wealth (and often half a planet) have the same fear, and are finding a solution in coin from these two perspectives:

The poor want a route out of inflationary currencies, unstable governments and perpetual poverty

The wealthy want to preserve their wealth against inflation and potential market instability

Bitcoin is a contemporary solution addressing both of these problems, regardless of where you fall between these extremes. Because, I mean, obviously it does. It's just cool to see it actually happening out there in the world.",1633653108,14,1
q3mfv7,AdaZhang1987,BTC,"I once imagined that the process of Bitcoin ""occupying"" the world is likely to be a process of ""small countries encircling large countries"":

Big countries do not need cryptocurrency. They have the ability to control currency issuance, stabilize prices, and fight against the currencies of other big countries.

Some small countries, such as Zimbabwe and Venezuela, have insufficient national power and limited government capabilities to control prices. In fact, most countries in South America and Africa are facing this problem, but to a different degree. Some of these countries‚Äô monetary systems have long since collapsed, and they can only watch the people abandon their national currencies and switch to the US dollar.

This is tantamount to handing over the country's financial power to the United States: during the epidemic, the United States printed $3 trillion in three months, which is equivalent to directly plundering more than 10% of its wealth.

El Salvador is a living example: in 2001, due to the vicious depreciation of the original legal currency, the krona, El Salvador decided to adopt the US dollar as the official currency. Currently, 90% of the circulating currency in the market is US dollars, and the krona is in a state of being completely abandoned.

Think about everything in an empathy. From the standpoint of a country like El Salvador, what would you do? What can you do? QJ by the United States, or by other countries? Or choose a currency that does not belong to any country, and no one can cheat, and get rid of the control of a big country?

Of course, judging from the current situation, the use of Bitcoin cannot completely get rid of the influence of big countries, but at least it will not be left to the mercy of one big country. After all, Bitcoin is not the United States in the final say.

Many people say that the price of Bitcoin is unstable and that it is not reliable to use it as a national legal tender. Do you really know how volatile the currencies of these small countries are? Argentina's inflation rate in 2019 was 53.8%, Zimbabwe was 521%, and Venezuela was 340,000%! In contrast, Bitcoin is simply too gentle and bullish for the long term.

Therefore, for many small countries, it is not only completely possible to use Bitcoin as legal tender, but it is even the best solution under the current situation.

Although El Salvador is small, from 0 to 1 is of great significance. From then on, more small countries will discover the benefits of doing so, and achieve from 1 to N. When more and more countries recognize cryptocurrency, it will always affect larger countries, which is the same as ""rural surrounding cities"".

What's more, people are really not a small country!

The Republic of El Salvador is the most densely populated country in Central America, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã20,720 square kilometers, 14 provinces, and a total population of 6.705 million.

In terms of population ranking, El Salvador ranks 109th out of 233 countries and regions in the world, surpassing Singapore, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and New Zealand. How can it be considered a middle level?

q3lj96,TheCryptoDadd,Against Cryptocurrency: The Ethical Argument for Bitcoin Maximalism,"Approaching a decade now in my study of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, I believe you can cleave its prevailing ideologies into three views (though variations exist in each). 

1. Bitcoin Maximalists ‚Äì 
Those who believe that Bitcoin alone satisfies the definition of a neutral, non-state monetary system and that this definition exists within the domains of economics and computer science. They believe the conditions that led to the launch and bootstrapping of the Bitcoin economy can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt repeat, and that the creation of cryptocurrencies undermines the economic scarcity that made Bitcoin novel in the first place. While some may tolerate the wider market for cryptocurrencies, this is only so long as it validates Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance. (This is where I place myself).

2. Crypto Agnostics ‚Äì 
Members of this group believe Bitcoin has a narrow, major or even no place within a wider ecosystem of cryptocurrencies. Though they may see some as better or worse than others, they believe most cryptocurrencies to be inherently good as they provide an alternative to existing monetary systems. Most notably, they assume that by offering different feature sets or focusing on different use cases, cryptocurrencies are serving as a new kind of programmatic money that competes with Bitcoin. Thus, they believe the crypto market to be providing both evidence to this claim as well as arbitrating the validity of claims made by competing entrants.

3. Bitcoin Deniers ‚Äì 
This group rejects the idea the private market should issue money, or else argues Bitcoin‚Äôs computer science discovery is not an economic invention. Rather, they believe that as governments derive authority from the people, democratic states should maintain a monopoly on money in the public interest (a right that extends to the ability to print, issue or debase money at the state‚Äôs discretion).",1633649794,0,1

I mean, there must be many ways of achieving this, but some of them might create window to a possible attack, something that doesn't endanger your coins while you are alive, and only when you are gone they are allowed to get them.

I think some services that have your wallet must offer this way of designing someone in events like this, I have this option in my app but it is from stocks. However there must be users who don't want to rely on having their credentials/wallet guarded by a third party that might get hacked.

My guess is something like physically carving in something of metal the safe words then putting that in a box and stored in a safe from a bank that has some arrangement to not allow anyone except you, but when you die a family member can gain access only then?. Also don't know how expensive they are, but in case they are not, maybe splitting the safe words in multiple banks or something?.

Any ideas? I am just curious (I don't have this problem but maybe one day, if I decide to invest in crypto this is one concern I would have).",1633646431,19,1

q2m8ha,ComfortableSwimmer92,"To further cement u/PizzaOnTheRoof556's point about the odds of correctly guessing his seed phrase (1 in 2048!), here's a puny 52!, for scale.","From: [https://czep.net/weblog/52cards.html](https://czep.net/weblog/52cards.html)

They seem harmless enough, 52 thin slices of laminated cardboard with  colorful designs printed on their sides.  Yet, as another illustration  of the mantra that complexity begins from the most simple systems, the  number of variations that these 52 cards can produce is virtually  endless.  The richness of most playing card games owes itself to this  fact.

The number of possible permutations of 52 cards is 52!.  I think the  exclamation mark was chosen as the symbol for the factorial operator to  highlight the fact that this function produces surprisingly large  numbers in a very short time.  If you have an old school pocket  calculator, the kind that maxes out at 99,999,999, an attempt to  calculate the factorial of any number greater than 11 results only in  the none too helpful value of ""Error"".  So if 12! will break a typical  calculator, how large is 52!?

52! is the number of different ways you can arrange a single deck of  cards.  You can visualize this by constructing a randomly generated  shuffle of the deck.  Start with all the cards in one pile.  Randomly  select one of the 52 cards to be in position 1.  Next, randomly select  one of the remaining 51 cards for position 2, then one of the remaining  50 for position 3, and so on.  Hence, the total number of ways you could  arrange the cards is 52 \* 51 \* 50 \* ... \* 3 \* 2 \* 1, or 52!.  Here's  what that looks like:

80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000

This number is beyond astronomically large.  I say beyond astronomically  large because most numbers that we already consider to be  astronomically large are mere infinitesmal fractions of this number.   So, just how large is it?  Let's try to wrap our puny human brains  around the magnitude of this number with a fun little theoretical  exercise.  Start a timer that will count down the number of seconds from  52! to 0.  We're going to see how much fun we can have before the timer  counts down all the way.

**Start by picking your favorite spot on the equator.  You're going to  walk around the world along the equator, but take a very leisurely pace  of one step every billion years.  Make sure to pack a deck of playing cards, so you can get in a few  trillion hands of solitaire between steps.  After you complete your  round the world trip, remove one drop of water from the Pacific Ocean.   Now do the same thing again:  walk around the world at one billion years  per step, removing one drop of water from the Pacific Ocean each time  you circle the globe.**

**Continue until the ocean is empty.  When it is, take one sheet of  paper and place it flat on the ground.  Now, fill the ocean back up and  start the entire process all over again, adding a sheet of paper to the  stack each time you‚Äôve emptied the ocean.**

**Do this until the stack of paper reaches from the Earth to the Sun.   Take a glance at the timer, you will see that the three left-most digits  haven‚Äôt even changed.  You still have 8.063e67 more seconds to go.     So, take the stack of papers down and do it all over again.  One  thousand times more.   Unfortunately, that still won‚Äôt do it.  There are  still more than 5.385e67 seconds remaining.  You‚Äôre just about a third  of the way done.**

**To pass the remaining time, start shuffling your deck of cards.  Every  billion years deal yourself a 5-card poker hand.  Each time you get a  royal flush, buy yourself a lottery ticket.  If that ticket wins the jackpot, throw a grain of sand into the Grand  Canyon.  Keep going and when you‚Äôve filled up the canyon with sand,  remove one ounce of rock from Mt. Everest.  Now empty the canyon and  start all over again.  When you‚Äôve levelled Mt. Everest, look at the  timer, you still have 5.364e67 seconds remaining.    You barely made a dent.  If you were to repeat this 255 times, you would  still be looking at 3.024e64 seconds.  The timer would finally reach  zero sometime during your 256th attempt.  Of course, in reality none of this could ever happen.  Sorry to break it  to you.  The truth is, the Pacific Ocean will boil off as the Sun  becomes a red giant before you could even take your fifth step in your  first trek around the world.  Somewhat more of an obstacle, however, is  the fact that all the stars in the universe will eventually burn out  leaving space a dark, ever-expanding void inhabited by a few scattered  elementary particles drifting a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute  zero.  The exact details are still a bit fuzzy, but according to some  reckonings of The Reckoning, all this could happen before you would've  had a chance to reduce the vast Pacific by the amount of a few backyard  swimming pools.**",1633532425,2,11

q2m43w,ChrimsonChin988,Buying and HODLing BTC based only on market sentiment (Chads only),"https://preview.redd.it/b9qz2apoeur71.png?width=1130&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a0729af676dbbf652b0b1aeb9ffdcb18ff2adfe

The top graph (Feb 2018 is as far as it went back) is based on 'market sentiment', meaning: sentiment is high when prices are volatile, high trading volumes, alt coins are making big moves (Bitcoin dominance is low), lots of news coverage etc. When sentiment is high(&gt;75%) you don't do shit. You don't sell, you don't buy, you HODL. You just sit on your giant balls of steel.

On the other hand, when sentiment is low(&lt;30%) you better have saved up a FAT stack of cash (because you were not FOMOing when market sentiment was high) and you BUY.

The other graph is BTC price in USD.

&amp;#x200B;

This method might seem crude/simple and that's because IT IS this simple.

I see a lot of Technical Analysis posts/video's and granted although sometimes a good argument is made, lots of mediocre/borderline shitty advice is given as well. My main issue with a lot of TA is that it doesn't take classic investor traps into account (fear/greed) and is often based on hindsight.

Investing is, for a large part, not 'big brain' stuff.

Just take a look at the macro strategy of Buffett for example: when sentiment is high, he just waits and when prices inevitably adjust (market sentiment declines) he has saved up a lot of $ and buys at a good price.

This is, very simply said, what this old fart has done for 75 yrs (Patience + logic instead of fear/greed).

It's about having your emotions (greed/fear) under control and having a long-term mindset. Stoicism comes to mind.

Granted these graphs are kinda scuffed &amp; lacking detail, that's 1)Because I want even the thickest of heads to get this and 2)it isn't necessary because of how simple this really is.

&amp;#x200B;

These graphs demonstrate my point wonderfully:

When sentiment is low: buy

When sentiment is high: patience.

&amp;#x200B;

What inevitable happens when you try to both buy low &amp; sell high is that you end up selling right at the beginning of a giant bull run (in this case December 2020) and you miss out on the fattest gains.

If, like me, you plan on keeping your BTC for at least another 10 yrs because you believe it's one, if not the, best performing asset at the moment; you don't sell and you buy more when market sentiment is low. (Notice I don't say when prices are low. A 'low' price is relative, 10k per BTC seems cheap now but it wasn't 2 years ago. In contrast, a market sentiment of 25 was low 2 years ago and it's low now.)

Understand that your mind is trying to sabotage your success. People that try to buy low &amp; sell high usually end up doing the exact opposite because of fear/greed.

That's why you don't play that game. You buy and you wait. Then you buy some more and wait some more. 

This also gives you great peace of mind because you are not trying to 'time the market'. You don't plan on selling any, hence you don't care when prices are going up/down/sideways. 

Just occasionally check to see if market sentiment is low, in which case you buy. 

&amp;#x200B;

This approach requires a different mindset and it takes some getting used to but trust me the mental peace &amp; long-term gains are very worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

Another suggestion: 

This approach is also great in combination with cost averaging. 

Meaning: every month you have $500 to put into BTC. Instead of putting all $500 in, you put in $250 regardless of market sentiment

and save the other $250 for when market sentiment is very low. By the time market sentiment drops below 30% you have saved up say $1500 and buy a large chunk in one go.

This approach is great because it offers additional protection against your FOMOing mind that would otherwise go crazy when prices are rising and you're not buying anything making it seems as if you are losing out on a lot of gains. In addition, when prices inevitably go down again, you have saved up some funds to buy at a good price.",1633532073,5,1

q2k4we,oldcasiowatch,Moving to the Netherlands,"Hey everyone. I am a EU citizen. I have been holding BTC for years and plan to move to the Netherlands, where I would like to buy an apartment with it.

My plan is to start off by renting a place, getting the residency paperwork, and opening a bank account. Once this is done, load my BTC onto an exchange, change the BTCs to euros, which I would then transfer to my freshly-opened Dutch bank account. It's with those euros that I would buy the apartment.

If I understand well, I will have no capital gains tax to pay. Is that right? If true, this is a drastic improvement compared to most countries where you have to pay 20% to 30% capital gains tax when you sell your BTC.

I am aware there is a yearly wealth tax in Holland, but that should not be of much concern to me since I will probably have very little BTC left after the apartment purchase, and this would be my main residence, therefore exempt from wealth tax. 

Could someone please confirm that I am not mistaken on anything?

Also, when I cash the BTC, will the Dutch authorities ask for proofs of how I acquired it way back then? (that was 5-6 years ago) It‚Äôs legally acquired BTC, therefore not blacklisted, but I‚Äôm not sure if I keep all the proofs.",1633525788,10,3

As the bitcoin price moves up through the years I believe a lot of money will be spent on hardware and quant computers able to crack these wallets and gain access to ""trillions of dollars"" of so-called ""lost bitcoin"".  


So here's a little fiction story:  


It's the year 2028 and Bitcoin is now worth a couple of million dollars. Digital scavengers have been digging into eBay and dark web forums to buy encrypted hard drives potentially containing thousands of Bitcoin, and John founded his firm specialized in cracking old HDD for the precious digital gold:  


""They've found the wallet!"" yelled the COO of Cryptographic Solutions to his team. ""The bitcoin is ours!""

The room erupted in cheers as they watched on monitors that showed their computers putting together a puzzle which, when solved, would give them access to what was now estimated at over $300 billion worth of bitcoin.

It had taken years and millions of dollars in hardware investments but finally all their efforts were paying off. As the sound of the celebration died down one employee put her hand up, motioning for attention from her co-workers who seemed eager to return back to work. All they need is to crack the seed phrase they somehow managed to discover the 24 words.  


Will they do it? Is it possible? Is this the new ""Bitcoin mining?

The desperate ""Donald Trump of banking"" proves how detached from reality he is.","He said [1]: ""I'll just challenge the group to one other thing. How do you know it ends at 21 million [bitcoins]? **You all read algorithms?** You guys all believe that? **I don't know**, I've always been a sceptic of **stuff like that**.""

Yes Jamie, we all read algorithms, and it is no rocket science. If Jamie himself does not read the algorithm, why doesn't he do so instead of embarrassing himself by proving how retarded he is? Because he is a ""sceptic"" of the computer language C++ and ""stuff like that"". Interesting.

Jamie, the Bitcoin code is open to the public since 12 years, easy to understand and was peer-reviewed AND TESTED(!) 1000s of times by experts, incl. academia and IT experts working for banks or governments all around the world. Not a single reviewer has pointed to any lack of the 21 Million cap in the code. If you cannot trust your own IT experts, you should step back as CEO due to loss of authority.

Jamie has lost his connection to reality and manipulates the masses with evil lies, turns out he is to banking what Donald Trump is to society and politics. An evil clown - someone who should not and could not be taken seriously, if he weren't such an influential public person.

Why is this important?

When Bitcoin was invented, smartphone usage wasn't common, you could have just send it with your laptop or PC near you which wouldn't make it easy to carry. Before Corona, it wasn't easy to spend. (Also lightning, but that's anitjer great story for another time).

Now, common folks are way more comfortable with using QR-Codes thus making Bitcoin more usable because the knowledge of technology use increased.

Even under the gold standard, where a physical gold bar was not able to be duplicated, they still found a way to duplicate them on paper and create money from nothing.

I know that a bitcoin cannot be duplicated, but fractional reserve banking could still exist.

Do you think the public ledger would allow people to more clearly observe when a banks reserves did not match it's total amount lent and so people might eventually ignore banks with fractional reserve?

Or do you think banks will totally vanish? This seems unlikely to me.

The concern here is that all of the divorc√©es‚Äô sats are on exchanges; does that matter? Is this a potential point of traceability?  Even if it was, what‚Äôs the likelihood of the court taking it upon itself to become cyber-sleuths?

I figured that kind of scrutiny would be reserved for a lawyer and his PI. This would be costly. 

Finally; what kind of legal danger is involved here? Is the friend who‚Äôs received and holding the sats a glaring partner in crime (legally)? 

If this is a shit plan, what‚Äôs the better option?

qd40so,m_woodworth,perpetual futures contracts question,"So I frequently hear that high funding rates on perpetual futures are a bearish signal - and while that logic somewhat makes sense to me for the contracts themselves (more incentivized to short, less to long), I don't understand why that would necessarily be the case for the underlying spot. I often read comments like ""perps at \`x.x%\`, time for a leverage flush"".

I would think the only impact on the spot would be indirectly via margin requirements, in particular if someone is 10x long and the price drops 5%, they'll get liquidated and lose their margin which is a much smaller amount than the notional trade ($10 vs $100). If they are margined with the same asset that they are leveraged long on, then yes, this could cause some liquidation cascades although the volume of sale on the spots would be much less than the futures (e.g. 10 vs 100 again).

However, what about contracts that are USD margined? There is an increasingly large number of these and I would expect there to be nil impact to the underlying spot in the event they are liquidated, as the margin being liquidated is on USD not the spot itself.

Am I misunderstanding something fundamental here or does this make sense?",1634858398,8,1

Once they open their accounts to collect the sats, they end up with some Bitcoin to look at in their own wallet appreciating in value over time, that they can move to wherever they want whenever they want, and most importantly, an exchange account to start DCAing more Bitcoin once the gifted Bitcoin does it's job and peaks their curiosity with its appreciation.

Though, when they start asking me how to buy more, I usually direct them to Coinbase Pro so they can get the least amount of fees as possible and actual fair market value, instead of getting charged ridiculously high fees and even crazier upcharges, if they were to buy on Coinbase's normal app.

The longest it has taken one of my gifts to get someone starting to accumulate BTC is two years. They kick themselves now for not starting sooner. The gift was $50 bucks of Bitcoin in feb 2019, by the time they started buying in 2021, the gift was worth $700 bucks of Bitcoin.",1634856768,5,1

Those who were mocked and had to sit and listen to people who didn't have the slightest understanding of Bitcoin, blockchain technology and what they represent.

You don't get to be the Head of the SEC and no know that Futures ETFs leads to much more market manipulation than Spot ETFs. Futures ETFs, over time, tend to have a downward effect on the market.   
Spot ETFs would have a positive effect. So he's either been bribed or blackmailed.  Either way, a fleet of Futures ETFs are good for Wall Street, bad news for Bitcoin. I'll assume he has been compromised, at least until he approves a Spot ETF, to give the market a fair fight. 

Having said all that, Bitcoin is not Oil or Silver. Manipulation by regulators can only slow Bitcoin's progress. It can't stop it. Supply at exchanges is at an all-time low, and there's a whole world out there, outside of the US, that also is buying Bitcoins. You can't keep The King of Coins down.

* Inflation concerns are driving Bitcoin‚Äôs record run, JPMorgan strategists said.
* Gold is failing to perform as an inflation hedge, prompting investors to rotate into BTC.
* ‚ÄúWe believe the perception of Bitcoin as a better inflation hedge than gold is the main reason for the current upswing,‚Äù the strategists said.

Concerns that inflation will keep rising and not be transitory is the main driver for the Bitcoin price pushing to new highs¬†*‚Äî*¬†not the first U.S. bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF)¬†*‚Äî*¬†JPMorgan strategists said, according to a *Bloomberg* report.

‚ÄúBy itself, the launch of BITO is unlikely to trigger a new phase of significantly more fresh capital entering Bitcoin,‚Äù wrote strategists, per the report, referring to the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF. ‚ÄúInstead, we believe the perception of Bitcoin as a better inflation hedge than gold is the main reason for the current upswing, triggering a shift away from gold ETFs into Bitcoin funds since September.‚Äù

As inflation rates have not declined despite the Federal Reserve‚Äôs multiple remarks that it will be ‚Äútransitory,‚Äù investors have sought investment vehicles to protect their purchasing power. Gold has failed to act as such in recent months, contrary to Bitcoin, which has seen significant USD gains.",1634843259,8,1

You replied that ""The Infrastructure Innovation and Jobs Act includes a provision that would impose tax reporting requirements for cryptocurrency brokers,"" which refers to the proposed amendment to IRC s. 6045. I write with regard to another, completely separate provision in the same bill -- the proposed amendment to IRC s. 6050I, which has radical and overlooked consequences: it creates a new felony crime for businesses and individual users who fail to provide, collect, verify, and report others' personal information within 15 days of certain ""digital asset"" transactions using IRS Form 8300.

Due to the Senate's rushed approval of HR 3684, this provision has been overlooked. I'm including links below addressing this ill-considered provision that will harm law-abiding ""digital asset"" users and damage the United States competitiveness.

Sincerely,

Bryan

Even late in 2017 we had a bunch of media outlets, government authorities, and high-net worth individuals telling people to stay away from bitcoin. But that is not what I wanted to highlight. 

In 2017 it seemed like there was so much ""shit show"" about bitcoin, a bunch of posts and articles claiming that bitcoin network is not working properly and is not scalable. Nearly every shitcoin that was coming out was called ""the bitcoin killer"", and people did not seemed to view bitcoin as a means of secure saving. 

At the moment it seems like there are only handful of people that do not think that bitcoin is here to stay. It feels like when people talk crypto, there is Bitcoin and then some other coins, instead of ""bitcoin killer coins"". 

Perhaps this will change once we will be in real FOMO stage, but as for now, it really seems like majority of people see bitcoin as positive project, and understand the value it creates.

There is also some security-through-obscurity, because nobody would recognize 4 random English words as parts of a cryptocurrency passphrase.

I know it's very anti-dogmatic in the cryptocurrency community to even suggest such an idea, but it seems much safer than writing a full passphrase in a single place.

This electronic cash system can be used for daily payment and cash circulation in general. It is believed that the total amount of bitcoin in circulation is 21 million bitcoin that exist.  
Many capitalized on the worth of bitcoin and use it as a store of value. they end up trading their bitcoin, converting it to physical currencies (Fiat) to solve material problems like buying properties. If this action continue like this and people keep selling their bitcoin for material possessions. Wont the amount of bitcoin in circulation depreciate or even vanish?

I've built a lightning wallet because I'm hellbent on fixing remittances to the Philippines. I have a grandiose vision of replacing cash with lightning, and eventually convincing the government to follow El Salvador's footsteps. We've incorporated in the US and registered in PH, but we are blocked by needing capital to meet licensing minimum-net-worth requirements and therefore integrating with banks. My cofounder and I are also building a team in PH who we've been paying out of savings.

We are bitcoin maximalists in that we want to hold bitcoin treasury and believe everyone should self-custody but we're also pragmatists because we realize not everyone has the means to self-custody.

If anyone with deep-pocketed connections would be kind enough to help me get in contact it would be much appreciated. Thank you.

How would you restore the funds?","I want to understand more about deterministic wallets and the answer to this question will help me. I‚Äôve recently learned of the derivation methods, and the starting point for derivations determining which wallets are generated. This also correlates to which wallets funds are visible. I‚Äôve also learned of gap limits whereby wallets that are non consecutive could be missed, and also of the ability to intentionally set a derivation point as something manual, not a wallet standard. 

After learning this and playing around, I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs possible to generate a seed phrase, send funds to a receiving address, restore the seed phrase to another wallet, and lose access to the funds. 


So, I‚Äôll paraphrase my question:

If given a 24 word seed phrase with no other information, how do you know for sure you have found all funds that it controls?

Ideally a step by step workflow would be very helpful, along with a rationale for each step.

Thanks in advance.

Premieres Nov 1, 2021

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rnqst5qCgA


‚ÄúBitcoin Is Generational Wealth‚Äù is a short film exploring the potential Bitcoin has to extend the timeframe of the projects humanity focuses on and actually achieves.

Across recorded history, cycles of rise and fall, both of civilizations themselves and of what they use for money, repeat time and again. We are experiencing another fall now and it is horrifying to observe.

However, for the first time in humanity‚Äôs existence, something unprecedented arrives - a money that is incorruptible, indestructible, and infallible: ‚Äúun-fall-able‚Äù. It is money that can support on its shoulders a civilization that will also be un-fall-able.

With the prospect of preserving capital and being able to reinvest it productively forever, new possibilities can be imagined and their potential made into reality over multiple generations.  

That is what this film aims to impress upon its viewers: That Bitcoin can break the cycles of fallings and replace them with an everlasting, productive peace.

qjchkc,rainresonance,Possible Mining in 2010.,"Hello and sorry if I am in the wrong place. 

I stumbled on bitcoin in 2010 and setup my pc to mine coins. The program ran several days and when I returned I couldn't tell if I had mined coins (I don't remember the screen well). Eventually I just gave-up and walked away from the whole thing.

I thought about this incident several times over the years and tried to be philosophical. But everything changed the other day when I found 22 old hard drives that I used around that time. I have ordered a couple external hard drive bays and intend to find the one involved. Assuming that I DO find it, I'd like to know for sure if I actually mined any coins. Honestly, I am not very hopeful but there is at least a chance.

What would I want to look for? Is there a folder name?

Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

qjb86p,Winter-Divide-8049,"What to watch for this weekend. Monthly close coming, expect volatility!","As the title may elude, we are going more macro scale here.

[Bitcoin Monthly+Weekly](https://www.tradingview.com/x/EYgtPX2p/) Bulls want to see the highest monthly candle close of all time. Additionally, the inlay chart shows the weekly timeframe where the previous all-time high close has been holding as support absolutely flawlessly. If this carries over to the monthly timeframe we are mega-bullish and ready for launch. Only 1 day until we get that answer.

And I'll sprinkle in a little bit of wisdom with this. This weekend is going to be very volatile. Because we are at the highest high so far, a lot of sells will come in between now (Saturday) and Monday morning. But they will all get bought up because the market is ready for take-off. The candle close we need to see is $57,800. which seems like it may be far away. Its possible we touch that for short period of time.

But you will also notice I have the CME Futures line drawn on that chart. NOT ALWAYS, but very frequently, the gaps between CME and the 24/7 BTC charts will get filled. And our active price is below the CME line. If CME opens up we may get another quick run to that CME to get filled. Conversely, if we are above the CME line prior to it opening, then we may get another fast price drop to that level.

I don't trade solely on that CME concept, but between that &gt;$1k gap currently, the monthly close coming, the anticipation of a bullrun, just expect volatility.

My reminder as it has been for the last couple posts, buy the dips. If things take a quick dive, don't get nervous and panic sell. This is one of the very few times where I will solely recommend accumulating and holding.

I was going to post other charts like TOTAL, TOTAL2, and BTC.D but I've decided against it because I feel I've already typed more than people will digest.",1635629922,7,1

qeztf9,GoAheadMMDay,BTC and other cryptos are traps!,"Alrighty then.  Let the scrapping begin.  Fire back at this assault on crypto with all the rounds you got, cause this is war!

Don't you people see what's going on?  The ""Great Reset""?  The ""New World Order""?  These guys want control.  Period.  It's all about control.  They want to control everyone on the planet.  And what's the best way to control people?  Control their finances.

These old foggie puppet-masters and their young proteges are using Bitcoin and other crypto to lour the next generation into slavery.  Think about it... they want us to put all of our wealth into digital coins that can be set to zero any time they want.  They can print money, right?  Well, all they have to do is just keep printing money and use it to keep shorting BTC and other crypto futures until they slam them down to zero.  That's what caused the BTC sell-off in early 2018... it was the appearance of new BTC futures which allowed this puppeteers to short-slam BTC down.  And they will do it again and again and again.

The key tactic they used was to make it appear they hated BTC, with Jamie Diamon and Warren Buffett and his buddy Munger coming out against BTC.  That make young people love crypto.  Hey, if the establishment hates crypto, then the young folks will love it.  It becomes part of their rebellion against the establishment.

But their negative views on crypto were a trick.  If they came out in support of crypto, the young generation would reject it as something the old foggies are trying to trap us with.  So they used reverse psychology to make it appear they hated crypto to get everyone under 30 to love it and put all of their money into it.

They then slowly adopt crypto into the mainstream to get more and more people hooked on it.  They let rise to the moon to build up a frenzie over it.  And what do we hear now?  Now they are actually calling it a ""great store of value"", a safe place to put ""all"" of our wealth.  Yeah, right!  They are just getting the whole world to walk into a trap with smiles on their faces.

In a few years, when more and more people have their entire wealth in crypto, they will slam it all down to zero, and in a flash, ""poof"", the planet is poor.  Everyone.

Now governements are coming out with digital money of their own, which will NOT be available in cash.  We will not be able to stash cash in a bank account and withdraw it at an ATM.  There won't be ATM's anymore.  It's all going digital.  And that means they can shut down anyone they want.  If you talk bad about a government, boom, you're money is locked and you can't touch it.  If you bad-mouth a politician, boom, you're money is locked and you can't access it.  If you don't do what they tell you to do, boom boom bam, they flick the switch and your wealth is gone.

You buy something with it. That thing happens to be illegal in your country and you get caught with it. If the cops also find your hardware wallet, won't they be able to get your public key and see who you bought it from? Also how often you've been buying from that person and who else buys from that person to target? 

Or.. let's say you're a ransomware gang who gets paid in crypto. Your target unbeknownst to you tells the cops after paying you. You have to get that converted somehow right? Won't they just track those bitcoins to see who sells them and where it goes from there?

Hi.  I am new to the crypto world, and I also suck a bit at technology, so  you have to explain to me like to a mo\*on. If I twist something or you  will see that I don't know what I'm talking about, sorry.

So  I recently installed Bitcoin Core on my computer. I deposited some  bitcoins on it \[not a lot, so if it turns out that I lost them for good,  it won't be the end of the world üòâ\]. Unfortunately, the program  crashed or something, and I couldn't do anything about it, even after  searching the internet back and forth hoping for help, I uninstalled it,  hoping that thanks to a saved on paper private key and one address, my  bitcoins would be safe. So I try to get access to them somehow by  installing new wallets on the computer, this time those known as  ""lighter"" versions, ie Exodus and Electrum. Unfortunately, I don't know  how to access these funds. I try to use online tutorials, but every time  it fails. Sometimes I enter the address, sometimes the private key  \[should I enter it at all, or is it dangerous?\], sometimes the name of  the wallet I invented, and sometimes the password for the wallet I  invented. All of this failed. Maybe I just misspelled the private key?  But I remember checking it several times. I kindly ask for help.",1635100710,11,1

2. Is there a way to create a programmed spend that happens once a year, on a schedule, that I can sweep back into the old wallet. Give the owner the free and open keys to the dump wallet, I just keep sweeping it back into the main hardware wallet each year?

qexv9s,mju_crypto,A new twist on old FUD: Energy rationing,"This is a response to Coin Bureau's new video. If you haven't seen it already here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rex-h4vkELs

While the maxi in me doesn't like the fact that he gives other coins attention, Guy makes great videos on Bitcoin and the downfalls of the current system. I highly recommend his channel.

In the video Guy covers the possible attack vector governments could use on Bitcoin. Its similar to the energy FUD we saw earlier this year. They will focus more on the ""waste"" aspect of the FUD rather than the environmental aspect. Energy prices are rising around the world, especially in the northern hemisphere. If the winter is particularly bad, it could lead to energy rationing. Miners could be kicked off the grid in this scenario to prioritize energy to homes, hospitals, etc.. If miners are kicked off the grid, the hashrate could fall and drag the price down with it. If governments keep miners off the grid, Transactions could slow and fees could skyrocket. The network will also be more vulnerable to a 51% attack. 

**SIDENOTE**: This is for the people who want to say that I care more about Bitcoin and gains than human lives. Please note that I'm actually okay with miners moving off the grid as I will explain later. I just don't like the way that it is likely to happen. I don't believe government intervention is necessary or helpful in this situation. Ulterior motives are likely to push governments to overshoot and put in more ""temporary"" policy than necessary. I think the free market would end up with a result that's better than what the government could muster without any party having to be coerced. Either way, I'm fine with grid energy being prioritized to the people rather than miners in times of emergency.

Guy does cover a way the price could survive this. If you want to see his take, watch the video. I'm going to cover an important factor Guy forgot to mention. Miners kicked off the grid could move stranded energy sources. 

Bitcoin mining is already taking advantage of flared natural gas from oil extraction. As a matter of fact, there's enough wasted natural gas in the US alone to power the entire Bitcoin network. So if miners are kicked off the main grid, they can make deals with oil and gas companies to get cheap energy from an otherwise wasted source.

For those of you not in the know: It is not profitable to collect this gas and transport it for use, so its simply released into the atmosphere or burned away. Miners could pay for that natural gas to power their machines. Its a win/win/win scenario. The natural gas is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. The CO2 resulting from the gas being burned for power can be captured. Miners get a very cheap source of energy. Finally, oil and gas companies can make profit from an otherwise wasted resource and reduce their carbon footprint. 

Renewables can play a big role in saving the hashrate from energy rationing as well. Renewable energy projects can be expensive and the power can't be turned off when its being produced at times of low demand. These projects can also be located far from their customers due to the nature of the energy resource being used. The Orkney Islands are a prime example of all these issues in one area: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UmsfXWzvEA

Bitcoin miners can tap into the energy being wasted by renewable projects. In return for saving the hashrate, these projects get a nice little subsidy. Miners could even set up mining farms powered by renewable power in remote areas too far away to be used by anyone else. 

All of this to say that the Bitcoin network is remarkably anti-fragile. The government can throw all it wants at it. If the government fails to completely obliterate the network outright, Bitcoin will simply adapt and overcome. So I wouldn't worry about the upcoming energy rationing FUD, or any other FUD really. Sure it could hurt the price and/or hashrate in the short term. In the long term however, it will simply make the network stronger.",1635099743,6,1

qhby9f,1990humanboy,May have found an old wallet from 2013 - need help - reward offered.,"Hey all,

Bit of a story, bear with me here - in 2013 I had a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 which held several bitcoins that I mined using a single budget spec AMD card over several months, if I recall correctly, bitcoin was barely worth $20ea at the time and there were not many places in which they could be used, I remember at the time you could maybe buy alpaca socks and cheap novelty items from not well-known places online.

The coins were held on my phone using this app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet&amp;hl=en_AU&amp;gl=US

I'm quite sure at the time it may have only been available to download from the developer's site and not in the Google play store(?)

In late 2013 I stupidly wiped my phone as I was doing something for work at the time as my phone was playing up, it was only after the fact that I realized what I had done, I don't ever remember making a backup via the app of my wallet either, not even sure that feature was available then, could be wrong - the app is quite different to what it was back then.

Anyway, yesterday I managed to recover data off an old 2011 macbook which I had at the time using recovery software as it does not pickup when plugged into a computer, its clicks and wines so not a healthy drive, I scoured the entire contents of the drive and came across a folder titled ""phone backup - 2013""

Don't even remember doing this at the time so was amazed to find it, I manically when through each folder looking for any sort of evidence or files indicating my old wallet, tried doing all search terms like ""wallet.dat"" ""backup"" ""coin"" ""cyrpto"" ""phrase"" ""string"" ""key"" ""bitcoin-wallet""... pretty much any and all things related i could think of, though nothing came of it. The only evidence I can find in the folders are old home-screen screenshots of my wallet showing the balance and transactions/public key, so this confirms that my wallet had to be there at some point.

I downloaded the electrum wallet on my current macbook and imported the ""public"" key which still shows the current balance still intact, there are 3.7 bitcoins - (watch only wallet).

Right now, i'm trying to wrap my head around if there is any sort of possibility i can restore the wallet, in my head, I'm thinking there must be a way in which i can have an android emulator where I can replace the core files using the ones i recovered, though I can't seem to find anything like this, I tried bluestacks though i can't seem to replace the emualted folders using my own. - The APK for the bitcoin wallet is amongst the file structure as well.

I tried contacting the devloper in hopes that he can tell me where the core files of the wallet are stored, though have yet to get a response.

Does anyone here know if such a thing is possible? Right now i'm more than willing to give someone a few thou if they are able to help me successfully recover them.

I've looked into bitcoin recovery services online though most state I need a password, I was never given the option to create a password or seed phrase at the time of using the wallet, the features did not exist according to old reviews from the store, i'm hoping that maybe theres a private key hidden away amongst the android app/data folder.

Thanks in advance.

qhag0r,StripetypeRick,Has Bitcoin relieved your financial stress?,"Money (or the lack of it) is not the only source of stress.  But financial stress is insidious as it undermines your confidence in your ability to deal with the challenges of life.  Most ‚Äúmiddle/upper class‚Äù kids have never experienced this. But the vast majority of people the world over do.

I recall similar uncertainty as a new parent about my ability to keep my kids safe.  Choking, falling, banging their heads. Would I know what to do? Well, as it happens I was able through my employment to get weeks of first aid training for the job site. Even an extra course on pediatric CPR. (Thankfully never needed that.) But the resulting peace of mind remains to this day. 

That is how hodling bitcoin feels for me. Financial resilience bolsters your confidence that no matter what else goes to shit there will be food on the table and a roof over your head.  

Everyone deserves the right to store the value of their labor and ensure their basic human needs. I think it‚Äôs easy for us in ‚Äú1st world‚Äù countries to lose sight of just how significant Bitcoin is for most people of the world.",1635380347,28,1

That's right people, I am proposing a full month of only holding and buying.  No Selling Allowed!  If you're up for the challenge, it's pretty simple. Just don't hit that damn sell button.  Market tanking? don't you even think about it.  Market surging, don't even think about it.  Just sit back, hold, and relax.  If you're feeling crazy, throw a few buy orders in or continue your normal DCA.

This isn't meant to pump the market and I have no delusions that this will.  This is just a fun way to celebrate our love for Crypto and come together as a community.

Fortunately, Coinbase has enabled some setting with their Plaid integration that lets you link a bank account manually (it's a bit hidden, but all once you find it all you need to provide is routing and account numbers). It takes longer to verify the bank account and possibly longer for funds to clear for withdrawal, but in my opinion, the inconvenience is worth not giving Plaid access to my entire banking details.

I have looked into other exchanges that have better overall fees.

Thank you for contacting my office regarding cryptocurrency provisions in the Infrastructure Innovation and Jobs Act (H.R. 3684). I appreciate hearing from you.

Cryptocurrencies are currently considered to be a security ‚Äì similar to a stock or bond ‚Äì by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) because they pass the ‚ÄúHowey‚Äù test, which states that to be a security, an item must be an investment of money or assets, profits must be expected, the investment must go into a ‚Äúcommon enterprise‚Äù, and the profit is a result of a third party.

As virtual currency has evolved, there are now a myriad of ways people around the world are using it. I believe that we must stay on top of these changes and evolve our understanding of virtual currency in the tax code, allowing people to use virtual currency in their daily lives. The Infrastructure Innovation and Jobs Act includes a provision that would impose tax reporting requirements for cryptocurrency brokers, similar to how stockbrokers report data on their customers‚Äô sales to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Should this legislation come before the full House of Representatives for a vote, I will be sure to keep your views in mind.",1635368620,4,1

# Michael Burry was right, after a fashion

Credit where it's due. Michael Burry was partially right back in May. Bitcoin did break down from a head and shoulders pattern. But he was wrong with his identification of the pattern.

The neckline of the pattern was not at 30k as he identified it, for a number of technical reasons but let's not get into that now.

The neckline was at 47k (2.618 secular fib level as shown in my previous post from July). A breakout (breakdown) below the neckline occurred in mid-May as charted below and the target of 33k was realized very quickly thereafter.

[TA overview of the first half of 2021](https://preview.redd.it/mtbzqjecnuq71.png?width=1566&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84dcbdb211f751c5bbe2c5b008da31f9c32822e3)

An immediate recovery found rejection at established resistance/support flip at 40600, coinciding with a dreaded death cross, leading to a Wyckoff accumulation phase, springing from 29k (1.618 secular fib level as charted in previous post from July).

# Flag Breakout

Throughout September, the price consolidated in a flag. Similar to 2013 and 2017, retaining support at established resistance 40600 was critically important. Once that was secured, a breakout was imminent, and it materialized earlier today (estimated target 65k).

[Cricical support at 40600 retained. RSI support held on retest. Flag breakout](https://preview.redd.it/x61amfa1quq71.png?width=1546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f91f79f3ac822acd17a97f881123119fdd4fe957)

# Closing thoughts

I'm not going to complicate this post with any on-chain analysis. Suffice to say, what's evident is there's been a great deal of sustained price suppression in the derivatives market for the past 3 months with simultaneously aggressive spot accumulation, which is typical of pre-parabolic phases. If you're of a mind to discourage this practice, ubiquitous in legacy markets, all you must do is take ownership of your keys.

My conservative estimate for this cycle's peak is c. 146k. Looking at log scale Fibonacci levels and factoring for diminishing returns theory, a peak price between 185k and 198k seems likely.

Bitcoin is a more mature asset today, with much more complex market dynamics than previous quadrennial cycles. In addition, there are macro incertitudes that may militate against or delay the realization of this cycle's peak.

That's not to say it's not the most compelling non-correlated risk-off hedge asset but these properties are undermined by Bitcoin continuing to trade on centralized/custodial venues, leading to exposure to certain risks that inhere in legacy markets, and legacy investors, at large, failing to fully appreciate its singular merits. That will come with time.

# The challenge: Over the next 24 hours, try to use as little fiat currency as possible.

Saving is the best thing you can do long term. We can all agree on that.

Though, if we're looking to continue to help Bitcoin on its path to mass adoption; we should to get the Bitcoin economy into circulation.

There are plenty of ways now to use bitcoins in our everyday life. Using the Lightning Network, using on-chain transactions and (if necessary) Prepaid crypto debit cards, direct peer-to-peer exchanges. It couldn't be easier.

**Guidelines to help:**

1. Set a budget.
2. Start small like a coffee or lunch, or paying a small bill (using the Lightning Network if possible).
3. Track your expenses (a spreadsheet or notebook).
4. Try to avoid using products or services (debit cards) that track your activity; try to use crypto as it was intended.
5. Try to talk to local merchants and vendors about accepting Bitcoin to help promote adoption.

The main take away is to help learn how to use Bitcoin.

We live in crazy times. One day, we what you learn might become a necessity.

*Note: Yes, there are capital gains (and losses) to keep in mind, but I believe it's also a deterrent to keep people from using a digital currency.*

Do you have to participate? Of course not.

Tom has acquired 100 bitcoin over the years. Tom is up. Tom wants to buy some fiat for a few life purchases during this bull run. It's starting now; October. Who knows how high it will climb or how many weeks/months it will last. Should Tom...

**A) DCA out a certain amount of Bitcoin every week.** Let's say 0.1 bitcoin per week into fiat, until the price starts to drop again, signalling the end of the run. That could be in 10 weeks in December, 20 weeks in February, who knows... but Tom would be swapping 0.1btc per week to fiat, regardless of price.

**B) DCA out a fiat equivalent every week.** Let's say $10,000 worth of bitcoin per week, regardless of the price, until the price starts to drop again, signalling the end of the run. That could be in 10 weeks in December, 20 weeks in February, who knows... but Tom would be swapping 0.1btc per week to fiat, regardless of price.

There's only a handful, Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin .

This is a bit unexpected IMO, so I click around on all the FAQs and info links. The FAQ starts out hopeful, albeit not perfect:

&gt;Can I use crypto to pay or send money?
You currently can't use crypto to pay or send money on PayPal. However, when you shop with PayPal, you can seamlessly cash out enough to pay the merchant in USD right from checkout..


That seems like a step in the right direction, right? Well as I continue down the FAQ section I noticed a big red flag towards the bottom:

&gt;Can I transfer crypto into and out of PayPal?
Currently, you can only hold the crypto that you buy on PayPal in your account. Additionally, the crypto in your account cannot be transferred to other accounts on or off PayPal.

So that's pretty scary. However, I still am thinking that maybe the net gain here is exposing more people to the familiarity of cryptocurrency and slowly building confidence over time. With PayPal's reach, this could still be a good thing, right? Well, their intentions become less sunshiny as I make my way to the bottom of the FAQ :

&gt;Will I get a private key for the crypto I buy on PayPal?
You own the crypto you buy on PayPal but will not be provided with a private key. In case you're wondering, a private key is a person's secret code to access and manage their crypto. If lost, stolen, or even forgotten they can never get to their crypto again -- pretty risky in its own right. As long as you can log in to your PayPal account, your crypto will always be at your fingertips.

So there it is; PayPal wants you to buy crypto, but won't let you transfer it out of your account, and won't let you have access to your private keys.",1633089087,120,1

pz5n73,Ego_Titan,Bitcoin 20 year treasure hunt for kids: looking for ideas,"Hello Community,

i had an idea for a treasure hunt. I have some bitcoin (and other altcoins) put aside in software wallets, meant to be kept save from my greedy trading hands.  Software wallets are protected with a combination of 20 words. When you have those 20 words, you own the wallet.

Now i got the idea to make a game out of it. Every year a kid can uncover one word, and at the age of 20, they will have the treasure. 

But this comes with some huge question marks:

Will all altcoins be available in 20 years?

Will the wallet provider exist in 20 years? (is this even a problem?)

Is there a hardware wallet that can survive 20 years?

&amp;#x200B;

I am willing to make the bet that bitcoin will exist in 20 years, and that it will be higher in price compared to today.

&amp;#x200B;

How would you do it? What wallet would you use, would it be a hardware wallet or a software wallet?

How do i keep the words safe over 20 years? How can i be safe from forgetting them (in 20 years i am in Alzheimer's territory) but also keeping them a secret from the players (kids)?",1633086124,13,1

Chivo wallet makes it easy to switch between crypto and dollars.

Chivo can be faster than cash or credit cards.

More than 2 million people in the country of 6.5 million are users of Chivo.

Many large chains such as Starbucks, McDonald‚Äôs, supermarkets, and some smaller businesses are accepting the digital currency for purchases.

Bitcoin has unleashed a wave of speculation.

Cryptocurrency tradings are becoming much more popular in El Salvador.

Successful rollout produces tangible benefits for the impoverished Central American economy.

Remittances account for over 20% of the nation's GDP. Reduction in remittance fees is one of the main benefits.

Salvadorians utilizing Bitcoin alongside the U.S. dollar could convince other countries to give cryptocurrency a try too.

pzymip,xxadmxx,Null Point Asset,"Bitcoin is an asset of finite supply. The value of this quality cannot be understated. 

Our economic system is an oscillating system. Anything that oscillates stably, does so around a fixed/strong null point. In fact, it is the only way that intelligible oscillations can be understood. Oscillations that occur around a weak null point or foundation are destined to break down (out of necessity).

By having a finite supply, Bitcoin functions as a null point within the economic system. Bitcoin, by way of its finite supply, is able to perform a valuable function. What bitcoin does for value, is the same thing that a meter stick does for standard measurements in engineering. Assets of finite supply intend to function so that they approximate true value. Just as a meter stick can measure the exact value of a meter, assets of finite supply intend to do this for other assets. In other words, they seek to move the idea of value from a subjective realm to an objective one. Not only does it perform this diagnostic function, but it serves as an anchor for polarized economic schemes. The most apparent of these polarized schemes would be the fiat system.

Fiat currency schemes have no hard limit on the ability to inflate or deflate. Their supply is neither capped nor ensured existence (though the use of violence and strategy has been employed relatively successfully for this aim). Fiat is an amorphous shadow in comparison to true value. It is constantly moving. It gains and recedes as the times do. 

By investing into null point assets, one is in effect harnessing the power of the null point. No longer will people be subject to the whims of a seemingly uncontrollable economic scheme. Inflation and deflation will no longer be dirty words. They will be tools. We will employ those tools to generate untold wealth (on the way up and down). No longer will economics be an esoteric art. BTC brings economics under the wing of science.

pzy2u3,jenny031hopkins,Need to Buy Crypto? This is what to Look for In a Crypto Exchange.,"Kraken, CoinEgg, Gemini, Binance ‚Äî we're not discussing legendary animals or the Internet's most recent popular expression. These are all cryptographic money trades ‚Äî advanced commercial centers where you can purchase and exchange crypto.

You can't simply purchase crypto from your bank or contributing firm. Whenever you've chosen you need to get some Bitcoin, Ethereum, or another cryptocurrency, you'll need to make a record on a crypto exchanging stage to trade your U.S. dollars (or other money) for advanced resources.

A few, as Coinbase, have been around since the beginning of Bitcoin, when there was undeniably less oversight into how crypto was purchased, sold, and exchanged. Others, similar to Robinhood and PayPal, are better-known for different administrations, and have as of late permitted clients to exchange crypto inside their current records.

**What is a Crypto Exchange, and how does it work?**

A cryptocurrency exchange is a website where you may buy and sell digital currencies.

You can use exchanges to trade one cryptocurrency for another ‚Äî for example, changing Bitcoin to Litecoin ‚Äî or to buy cryptocurrency with fiat currency, such as the US dollar.

The pricing of the cryptocurrencies on exchanges are based on current market prices.

You can also use an exchange to convert cryptocurrencies back into US dollars or other currencies, which you can keep as cash in your account (to trade back into crypto later) or withdraw to a regular bank account.

According to Tyrone Ross, a financial advisor and CEO of Onramp Invest, a crypto investing platform for financial advisors, there is no one crypto exchange that is appropriate for everyone.Instead, he recommends evaluating your individual crypto interests and finding an exchange that matches your goals. For example, perhaps you're seeking for a certain coin or want to learn more about cryptocurrency investing.

**What to Look for in an Exchange**

**Accessibility**

Due to state or national rules, you may be unable to buy or sell cryptocurrency on specific exchanges depending on your region.Some countries, like as China, have outright prohibited individuals from using cryptocurrency exchanges.There is a lot of regulatory uncertainty around cryptocurrency in the United States, and several states have established their own legislation.New York, for example, requires exchanges to obtain a BitLicense before operating in the state, and only permits licensed organizations to offer certain approved coins.Most other states do not have as strict rules as New York, although many do regulate in some capacity or are considering doing so.

You can often find information about the geographic limitations of an exchange ‚Äî as well as related accessibility factors, like national currencies accepted ‚Äî on its website or within the terms of service.

**Security**

Cryptocurrency isn't guaranteed by a central institution, and your cryptocurrency holdings aren't insured in the same way that bank deposits or traditional investments are.Some exchanges, such as Coinbase and Gemini, maintain all of your U.S. dollar balances in FDIC-insured bank accounts.

However, cryptocurrency balances are not covered by FDIC insurance.Some exchanges have insurance policies in place to protect the digital currencies that users have on the exchange against hacking or fraud.For example, Coinbase has a $255 million insurance policy.That means that if Coinbase's reserves were hacked and any amount of cryptocurrency valued at up to $255 million was stolen, account holders would be compensated.

Whether you plan to keep your cryptocurrencies in an exchange or just keep them there for a short time before moving them to your own wallet, the security of the exchange should be a priority. Top. For example, see how many assets the exchange keeps offline, in hard storage.   This becomes even more important as the value of cryptocurrencies increases, as more value means more lucrative targets for potential thieves. In 2020, there were a total of 28 attacks on crypto exchanges, the largest of which resulted in over $200 million in crypto assets being stolen from the KuCoin-based crypto exchange. headquarters in Singapore.

Check the amount of assets the exchange keeps offline. While exchanges are essentially required to keep some cryptocurrencies running to facilitate trading, it is sensible to keep the bulk of the holdings in cold storage or offline, where which would be harder for hackers to access. for instance , Coinbase claims that they store 98% of customer funds offline, while only 2% are actively traded. This memory, combined with its $255 million policy , provides more reason to believe your crypto assets are going to be insured within the event of a hack.

you can also search for general online security measures that you simply may already be familiar with on other platforms, like two-factor authentication. this means that additionally to your username and password, you'll need to verify your identity with a further method, like entering a code that you simply receive via text message, whenever you connect. connect. with more popular exchanges with an already large customer base. you may be more at risk doing business with smaller or newer exchanges whose security measures and incentives aren't clearly stated online.

‚ÄúSize matters here,‚Äù said Douglas Boneparth, financial advisor and president of Bone Fide Wealth in   new york. He pointed to Coinbase, which was recently listed on the Nasdaq stock market . ‚ÄúThis has its pros and cons, but now that you simply have public finances, you'll really see the health of the business, and this is often vital once you are considering using an exchange or investing with business or the product or service that they're provided.

https://preview.redd.it/ejo0gyaw92r71.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8066e3ffc5fd6e7e120b4f4be24d0c98ba397cdd

&amp;#x200B;

**Fees**

Fees are another thing to think about , but don‚Äôt necessarily let a high fee structure turn you off an exchange. ‚ÄúThe easier they create it for you to shop for it, the upper the fee that you‚Äôre going to be paying,‚Äù says Spencer Montgomery, founder of Uinta Crypto Consulting, a program for new investors to find out about crypto. Higher fees also can be a worthwhile tradeoff for the added protections and insurance that the larger , more popular exchanges provide.

Exchange fees may be a fixed price, but are often a percentage of your trade. Some exchanges, like Cash App, charge fluctuating fees supported price volatility. Fees are often charged per transaction, and may differ whether you‚Äôre the vendor or the customer . There can also be different fees counting on which currencies you trade. confirm you understand exactly how and when an exchange plans to charge you for your crypto transactions before delivering your cash.

**Liquidity**

If you propose to shop for , sell, or trade your crypto, the exchange you choose should have enough trade volume to make sure your holdings are relatively liquid, meaning you'll sell them when you want. Again, this can be an instance where size matters. Often, the more popular exchanges also are those with the largest trade volumes.

When tons of trades are happening within an exchange at any given time, it means you have a better chance of buying or selling the crypto you hold at the simplest price, Montgomery says. Crypto prices move very quickly, so once you use an exchange that doesn‚Äôt have tons of trade volume, you'll find yourself paying a better price than you'd on more popular exchanges. for instance , say you opt to shop for Bitcoin once its price falls below $32,000. If you‚Äôre on an exchange with a coffee trade volume, you'll find yourself actually paying a special price than you think that , if your purchase doesn‚Äôt actually undergo until the worth has moved copy .

CoinMarketCap, a price-tracking site for cryptocurrencies, continually tracks the trade volume of many exchanges operational . Currently, it lists Binance, Coinbase, and Huobi because the top exchanges by volume worldwide.

**Tax information**

As if taxes weren‚Äôt already complicated  enough, reporting cryptocurrency can add another layer of complexity to  your  income tax return . ‚ÄúAs the tax situation evolves around crypto assets,  it‚Äôs  getting to  be really important for people  to form  sure that their  personal tax situation is up  to hurry   also ,‚Äù Ross says.You need to report any crypto trades  you create  as capital gains on your tax return.  meaning  you‚Äôll  got to   know  the worth  of your crypto  once you   pip out  in U.S. dollars,  also   as  the worth  of it  once you  sell.Because  Robinhood only allows  you to transact on its platform, it provides a  Form 1099-B tracking your  cost basis and gains and losses, but that‚Äôs  not the case on more  traditional exchanges.‚ÄúWhen you use cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Kraken, CoinBase, etc., they don‚Äôt  offer you   that form,‚Äù says Shehan Chandrasekera, CPA,  head of tax strategy at  CoinTracker.io, a crypto tax software company.  That‚Äôs because exchanges  that allow you  to maneuver   your holdings off their  platform can‚Äôt track everything in your  personal wallet or trades you  make on other exchanges. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when it  becomes tricky and when those  users  need to  use a tool to reconcile their entire picture, get the  data,  then  file their taxes.‚Äù

**Bottom Line**

There are additional factors you can consider based on your own preferences, Boneparth adds, like customer support, how well you wish the platform‚Äôs mobile app, and the way easy the exchange is to use overall. But like we hear from experts time and again when it involves crypto, taking the time to find out the maximum amount as you'll before you set money into crypto is one among the foremost useful things you can do.

Think about the fee structures and security measures you‚Äôre comfortable with, what additional steps you‚Äôll fancy store your coins, and your goals.

‚ÄúYou probably should spend longer learning about the space,‚Äù Boneparth says. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre putting risk on your money during a pretty wild environment. It‚Äôs one thing to haphazardly put money into more stable markets, it‚Äôs a completely other thing to throw money into volatile markets. So it‚Äôs important to get educated, especially when you‚Äôre going to affect something that‚Äôs perhaps more volatile than other risky assets.‚Äù",1633191029,1,1

Several already offer credit cards and maybe even a debit card or two.  Willie woo just posted something about LVL.  In my short research I'm not understanding completely what it is or how it works.

&amp;#x200B;

Thise has been a question that I have been struggling with over the last few weeks of study..

**What is the value of a blockchain outside of an application for money?**

Ammous' position on this in the Bitcoin Standard is that there is really no use for a blockchain outside of the context of creating hard money and digital scarcity. Parker Lewis echoes that perspective. Lewis draws the point out a bit more by explaining that: a blockchain is only useful within the application of money because without the native money there is no security and without security the value and integrity of the currency breaks down.

&amp;#x200B;

Does a blockchain not make sense and work in the context of NFTs? Or in decentralized social media platforms? Where the censorship resistant nature is a desirable feature?

My auditor wants a ""hard copy"" document showing the holdings in my trezor wallet on the last day of last financial year (30 June). Hard copy just means a PDF print from a block explorer. 

The problem is I've done transactions since then, all block explorers I use show all transactions. 

Is there a block explorer that will do both:
a) limit the view to a date range; and 
b) show the total BTC balance at the end of that date range (30 Jun) 

Or any other ideas? Next year of course I'll be taking screenshots on the exact date.. I had assumed a transaction report would suffice but auditors prefer a ""holding statement"" type document.

One of the use cases I mentioned is a store of value. 

The first comment I get is this: **‚ÄúBitcoin is the biggest scam in human history. It has not seen a recession. Just wait for interest rate hikes.‚Äù**

I‚Äôve been living in Europe for a long time so it‚Äôs true that interest rates have been very low, I wonder if it could really be so that when interest rate hikes, Bitcoin will be negatively affected.

Out of curiosity, I looked up interest rates in a few countries. I didn‚Äôt expected this: average interest rate in China is 4%, India 6%, Zimbabwe 40% and Venezuela 56% in 2021.

Source:[ https://tradingeconomics.com/venezuela/interest-rate](https://tradingeconomics.com/venezuela/interest-rate)

Digging a bit deeper, I find what‚Äôs even more shocking:

Countries with three-year cumulative inflation rates exceeding 100%:

* Argentina (44.9 million people)
* Iran (82.9 million people) 
* Lebanon (6.85 million people)
* South Sudan (11 million people)
* Sudan (42.81 million people)
* Venezuela (28.52 million people)
* Zimbabwe (14.65 million people)

Countries with projected three-year cumulative inflation rates between 70% and 100% or with a significant (25% or more) increase in inflation during the current period

* Angola (31.83 million people)
* Haiti (11.26 million people)
* Liberia (4.93 million people)
* Yemen (29.16 million people)

Source: [https://www.iasplus.com/en/news/2021/01/hyperinflationary-economies](https://www.iasplus.com/en/news/2021/01/hyperinflationary-economies) 

A total of 308.81 million people - very close to the total population of the whole USA, or four to five times the population of the UK, or Germany is losing upward of 90% of their lives saving every 6-7 years. 

After looking at those numbers, I strongly think that the world needs a solution, if it‚Äôs not Bitcoin, what else do those 308.81 million people have as an alternative to working their whole lives and ending up in poverty at retirement anyway.

I feel like I have been living in a bubble of a first world country for too long and only learn about the reality today. I don't think the news talk a lot about this. What's your thoughts?",1633026741,24,1

This 1500000 BTC coming on exchanges should crash Bitcoin price. 

How come the market is so bullish when we see this crash coming real soon???

I normally have a good crystal ball for Bitcoin, I increased my BTC by 62% this year by soft trading. I have many.

I downloaded the Mt Gox plan that was voted this week. I don't see clearly how they will manage to not crash the BTC market.

Where can I find information on this? Am I missing something?

Please help, I feel like I am blind right now. Everything for Bitcoin is doing great, could go to 80000 by end of year in my opinion if these 150000 BTC were not in play.

So now I have a conservative position since I am missing the knowledge about the repayment plan

I need some help understanding BTC guys, and I‚Äôm hoping one of you here may be able to give me the perspective or insight I have been looking for and failed to find. Now before I get started, please understand, I do own a fairly inconsequential amount of BTC and crypto and I have been in the crypto world since 2017 since around BTC $5000. And no, I‚Äôm not a boomer, I‚Äôm a millennial.

I‚Äôm sure this thread will get a lot of hate, downvotes, HFSP, ‚Äújust read the bitcoin standard‚Äù, ‚Äúyou just don‚Äôt get it‚Äù or ‚ÄúTether FUD‚Äù! But I‚Äôm really hoping there will be one of you here with a view that makes everything click for me. And please don‚Äôt turn me to the likes of like Pomp, Pysh, or Carter, I wouldn‚Äôt turn to Peter Schiff for something like gold, these guys all have their obvious reasons for pushing what they push. The crypto world has many insanely innovative minds but I‚Äôm hoping to also find some educational and kind ones in it, HERE. Where no one is trying to sell me anything, just help others understand. This thread isn‚Äôt meant to bash crypto by any means, just to hopefully clear confusion and expand views. Everything I have ever done in my life has been very analytical with great success and so I thought crypto would be the easy piece to figure out but alas too much just does not click for me. I‚Äôll present my views below, please help me see if there‚Äôs anything else I‚Äôm missing or viewing incorrectly. 

I own hard assets, tangible assets because I do share the view that non-backed FIAT is worthless (outside of its only intrinsic value being creating warmth when burnt and it being currently backed by the US military complex and Gov.). It will continue to be printed out of thin air and at an ever-increasing pace. The race to the bottom between these FIAT currencies is to the bottom. I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt currently subscribe to the MMT view, I‚Äôve read Stephanie Kelton‚Äôs book twice now and I just don‚Äôt see how the entire charade doesn‚Äôt end with inflation/hyperinflation. I‚Äôve also read numerous macro, trend books with one of my favorite being ‚ÄúA short history of financial euphoria‚Äù and many of the similarities to today are actually alarming to me. 

In that aspect, BTC is a go for me because it is limited to 21M coins. However, how are these truly limited? There are no actual, tangible coins (pro or con depending on how you look at it) and there have been multiple forks already. How can something truly scarce and limited be spawned off or created out of thin air? (i.e Bitcoin cash etc‚Ä¶). Now yes, BTC itself remains unchanged and the new fork will either die off or attain whatever its value ultimately will be but what stops future forks from overtaking the original BTC if there is sufficient popularity or network backing? Some have told me ‚ÄúThink of it as a dividend‚Äù. Great but dividends are paid out on a regular basis and an asset that is supposed to yield 0% does not yield you a dividend. I equate this to gold shedding new little metallic offspring every once in a while‚Ä¶. Would never happen. I also personally do not like that any transaction I make will cost me a fraction of my actual asset (sometimes upwards of 5%!). I can purchase other assets and pay a fiat fee. To further add to this particular question, why are these specific 21M so much rarer? Ok, first player moves but more importantly network effect. The network is what give the BTC technology it‚Äôs current valuation. The more people participate, the more buy-in, the larger the network, the higher the price of BTC. Nothing stops new technology from being created (see the other 2100+ coins in existence), the majority of which will be worthless but what happens when a new technology that is more efficient, expeditious, desirable comes on the scene? Yes, I am aware these do already exist but they lack 1 major thing to overtake BTC. Network effect. What happens once-popular sentiment shifts? If I don‚Äôt have a network effect then how is this now worth anything more or less than something like my truck running on idle solving sudoku puzzles that I can send via the internet? (Extreme comparison I know but a valid one).

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a question of if but when. Network effects have been studied for some time and we‚Äôve all seen shifts from MySpace to Facebook, AOL to Google etc‚Ä¶ Technology improves and networks shift. Physics cannot. This is also why I struggle to comprehend why BTC is represented by a gold coin and has mining references. If I wanted gold, I would buy gold. I don‚Äôt believe in the gold 2.0 comparison. Plenty of history books will depict how the 2 are vastly different but I‚Äôm not here as a gold bug or to defend gold. I am here to understand BTC. 

What is its intrinsic value? I know this is a tough question to answer, I am aware but anything I can tangibly hold in my hand can be used from anything as a paperweight, to burn and create warmth or used in electronics, dentistry, construction, etc‚Ä¶If I can‚Äôt hold my asset, where is its intrinsic value? I‚Äôve heard that the Network effect is where its intrinsic value lays. Ok fine, but referring to my previous point, what happens when that shifts? If the network is down, or energy prices continue to explode, what is the intrinsic value of something digital, non-tangible that I cannot re-purpose?

My next question is in regards to stablecoin effects on BTC. I do personally believe Tether is a massive elephant in the room and needs to be addressed. If you disagree then feel free to skip this portion but I do believe it is a massive looming systemic concern. Yes, I know ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no different than Mt. Gox‚Äù, ‚ÄúFUD‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs market cap is so small‚Äù etc‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm familiar with all the counters. You cannot disregard some of the work done depicting its nearly 0% backing, the increasing regulatory risk to it, and the fines that have come out. No innocent party would refuse to do a full audit and no NOT an attestation, a full audit. I do believe it poses a systemic risk. Ok then so what? Let Tether fail, and wait for cheaper BTC entry. Great, but if BTC can be easily manipulated by stable coins, what stops future stable coins from doing the same (CBDCs), and how does that not make this an identical situation to what Fiat currencies are currently doing?

Next, I‚Äôd like to ask about the pseudo-anonymity and ledger. I do not care to have my government track my transactions. There is currently a policy proposal to have any amounts over $600 disclosed to the government. The BTC ledger would reveal any and all transactions ever done for anyone to see. This comes off as a huge negative for me. Yes, the convenience of the ledger is nice and the blockchain is revolutionary -that there is no doubt. But my business and transactions are of no concern to the Government. To make matters more difficult, since there is no tangibility, I cannot even transact behind the scenes (i.e black market) to say hand a bitcoin or couple sats to my neighbor without it being recorded somewhere and with a gas fee. 

I‚Äôm sure to many this post will come across as a critical one but let me state that I have also heard many critiques that I do not contend with such as the high energy costs. I don‚Äôt believe that is a problem, in fact, I believe it is a BENEFIT. Also, for the record, I‚Äôm not a bear. I do believe it will hit $100k sooner than later and likely much higher. But as a value investor, I need to know something is cheap and has value. Please help me comprehend how BTC is where I should be allocating my time and money. Sure there is the cost of not investing and being wrong, opportunity-cost, but I come here for your insights.

qe2dh3,CryptoLatestAnalysis,Bitcoin Price Prediction till 2025," 

Our Bitcoin forecast over the long term is very optimistic. As noted in the section above, Bitcoin does have some influential technical analysis and fundamental factors that go in its favour. The previous all-time highs will naturally draw the Bitcoin projection price to this level, representing an increase of 41% from today‚Äôs price.

Major players in the crypto space, such as Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey, have sung Bitcoin‚Äôs praises recently. The fact that people of this magnitude are talking up Bitcoin indicates the currency‚Äôs value. Furthermore, with huge companies such as Amazon and Apple seemingly adopting Bitcoin, the future looks bright.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qerppcq3g6v71.png?width=1434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe7a5e5aa72d00b18370d31aeaa1648441d5b435

It‚Äôs also worth pointing out potential risks within this Bitcoin stock forecast. For one, the constant regulation from China is always a threat to Bitcoin trading. The Chinese economy looks set to play a significant part on the global stage in the future ‚Äì and if Bitcoin is not adopted widely by China, it could pose significant problems. In addition, the persisting rumours about US regulation of Bitcoin don‚Äôt seem to be going away, which would definitely affect the coin‚Äôs price if they proved to be true.

With these points in mind, our Bitcoin price prediction 2025 could see the digital currency head towards the fabled $100,000 mark. The Bitcoin journey will never be plain sailing, so there will undoubtedly be stumbling blocks along the way. However, $100,000 is certainly a reasonable target given the technical and fundamental factors in play.

A recent Forbes article suggested that the Bitcoin projection could perhaps see over $300,000 per Bitcoin by 2025. Although this is a possibility, we believe Bitcoin‚Äôs upwards trajectory may be a little slower than that.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rnlxw1r4g6v71.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7600af1af709ff44b52d567e86ae18c50d0466b

Following the same trajectory as our Bitcoin price prediction 2025, our Bitcoin price prediction 2030 hints at a much higher valuation for the currency. Over the next nine years, we can foresee a shift towards digital currencies, removing the need for traditional FIAT currencies. Due to Bitcoin being the ‚Äòfirst mover‚Äô in this area, it‚Äôs natural that institutions will gravitate towards this cryptocurrency over other ones.

If this occurs, there is undoubtedly scope for a Bitcoin projection towards the $400,000 mark. As a disclaimer, it‚Äôs hard to determine an exact figure as there are no technical factors to base this on.

I'm by no means a large investor, but I'd rather protect my info and be smart from the beginning if the value of my BTC were to grow significantly (which I of course believe it will). 

I have considered non-KYC exchanges such as Bisq or Hodl Hodl, but are a little scared off by the increase in complexity when buying. I don't want to make expensive mistakes.

Another thing I have considered is opening accounts at multiple exchanges and not buying everything from the same place, so that if one exchange was ever to have its information leaked it would only show a smaller part of what I actually own.

And then I think that maybe I'm just being paranoid and it is fine for me to buy at reputable exchanges like most others.

q476r0,Tux_fan,I'm from El Salvador...UPDATE 3,"**It‚Äôs been a while so I‚Äôll give you an update on how things are going.**

* There haven‚Äôt been anti-btc protest since sept 7th. Sept 15th was Independence Day so there were many reasons to the protest. There have been many protests (not btc) but that‚Äôs common in my country, its weird not having a protest between weeks LoL.

**Do people hate btc?**

* Not at all, some are afraid since they don‚Äôt understand, but the main concern is the law. Due to a large history of government corruption, people don‚Äôt trust government, there‚Äôs always a catch in this type of laws. I repeat, this has nothing to do with btc at all but how government handle things.

**Chivo App (official wallet)**

Chivo app is now available to most devices and it works fine most of the time although there are moments when either it‚Äôs on maintenance mode or simply die. There are some cases where chivo app stop working the moment you want to pay‚Ä¶some ‚Äúkarens‚Äù have made a fuss at supermarkets or fast-food restaurants, LoL.

* Lightning network works fine.
* Layer 1 transactions still shows problems. (my $2 are still on the way since sept 8)
* Minor issues when sending money from chivo app to bank account.
* People are still selling the $30 btc bonus for $25 USD cash. (They even use facebook marketplace for promotion LoL. [Here's a pic altough in spanish](https://twitter.com/BairesQuezada/status/1442182539846684673/photo/1))

**Problems with registration**

*I‚Äôll explain this giving some context*, t*he main identification we Salvadoran have is called DUI which stands for ‚ÄúDocumento √önico de Identidad‚Äù (Unique identity document). This ID shows your photo, name, date and place of birth, if your single or married, parents name, your address and a 9-digit number. This number is unique to every person however it‚Äôs not something you maintain in secret. You usually use your DUI to when making a contract or any other legal procedure‚Ä¶or simply use it to prove your not underage when buying alcohol, LoL.*

*By itself, the DUI number it‚Äôs useless, legal documents will also require you to personally sign aside other stuff. You can use your DUI number in raffles, polls and other stuff like that. People can‚Äôt robe or scam you just because you give them your DUI number, so nobody actually cares about keeping the number in secret.*

Now that I explained that, here‚Äôs the issue. To register in chivo app and get your $30 bonus, first you type your phone number, DUI number, take a photo of your DUI and a photo of yourself, and type a security code (your standard KYC). People found out that, to complete the registration process you only need a phone number and DUI number, there is actually no verification of your ID and face photo, just taking a random photo will let you complete the registration.

Some people take advantage of this and start craving for DUI numbers, there many data bases that have hundreds and thousands of DUI numbers, you can usually buy these things for marketing purposes (SMS - emails campaigns, segmentation, etc.). You can also buy a phone number for $1.

You probably can get the idea of what the problem is‚Ä¶now that chivo app is available to most devices, people start discovering that their DUI number has already been registered, so they can‚Äôt use the app and even less get the $30 bonus.

There haven‚Äôt been any official communication from government about this problem however the director of police department said in an interview that people who are doing these things will get arrested, investigations have started. [Here's an article](https://radioyskl.com/2021/10/07/pnc-detendra-en-las-proximas-horas-a-personas-que-suplantaron-identidades-para-acceder-a-los-3000-de-la-chivo-wallet/), altough in spanish, might have to use google translator.

**Remittances**

There are three main ways to send money from overseas to my country.

1. Buy USD with a credit/debit card in chivo website and send directly to a relative‚Äôs chivo app.This has 0 fees although some banks may charge you like US Bank and Bank of America. Wells Fargo and Chase have 0 fees.
2. If for legal reasons you don‚Äôt have a bank account, you can get paid in btc and send it
3. or continue using businesses like Western-Union.

**Btc mining**

The power of volcanoes! ...(sigh)

I‚Äôll be honest and tell you all that this is marketing‚Ä¶at least for today, 2021.

In my country we need to buy (import) electricity from other countries to meet the demand. So don‚Äôt expect a big mining farm from the get go, maybe in 10 years there will be a really big mining farm sustained with clean energy.

Also, we are taking away this clean energy to direct it exclusively to btc. Good for btc, bad for my country. Anyways, thanks to this there might be mayor investments in geothermal energy.

*Geothermal energy needs to be developed through time; it‚Äôs not just finding a vein of water.*

Here is a [presentation with some data](https://www.esmap.org/sites/esmap.org/files/5-4%20GGDP%20Day2_El%20Salvador.pdf)‚Ä¶although it‚Äôs a decade old, it might give you some insights about geothermal development‚Ä¶it‚Äôs in English btw.

There‚Äôs also the math of the cost of btc mining and the actual gains but since I don¬¥t have any information I¬¥ll skip that for now.

**People‚Äôs behavior**

As I‚Äôve said multiple times, nothing has really changed, we just have a new payment method.

People are starting to know how btc works, the bearish and bullish market, etc. On a daily basis there‚Äôs no difference between USD and btc, people are showing interest in crypto as an investment method and not a currency‚Ä¶most businesses like restaurants and supermarkets accept btc as payment, there are others who only accept USD, either because they‚Äôre against it or don‚Äôt give a shi‚Ä¶ there are others who doesn‚Äôt accept btc because people don‚Äôt show interest in paying with btc.

There was also a big promotion in the price of gas, minus $0.20 for a gallon. However, I don‚Äôt see a big fuss about this‚Ä¶which is weird‚Ä¶ the promotion will end around October 14th so I‚Äôll wait for any data that might come out.

Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt have any data about chivo aside the presidents‚Äô tweets, which I personally don‚Äôt trust as a source. There are some polls out there of how many people uses btc as payment but I still think it‚Äôs to early to get that type of info, consumer behavior wont change in a short period of time.

\----

Truth to be told, foreigners might feel more the hype than Salvadorans LoL.

As always I‚Äôll try to answer your questions and explain things as long as I can.",1633728251,175,1

q7ap9r,TheForgetfulOptimist,Bitcoin Maximalist - ELI5,"Let's start by first prefacing that BTC is indeed king of crypto and the gold standard. I don't think there is any question on this. With that said though, it made me curious from a maximalist point of view what role other cryptos will play moving forward into the future. I've read many posts/comments saying in time every single other crypto will die out and only BTC will survive. 

Just looking at an ecosystem like ETH for example, how does that play out? It appears thousands of companies and individual's are using this to build any number of apps and its being integrated daily into different systems (including payment). It also appears that recent changes have also started it down the path of becoming a deflationary crypto as more is burned daily. There are a number of other cryptos that are also being used to bolster supply chains, improve distribution efficiency, create product tracking, and the list goes on.

From a maximalist standpoint, in 30 years say, what becomes of all other cryptos? Does BTC and its network continue to morph and evolve to fill the niche of an ETH? Do companies forgo the advances available in using blockchain, as that seems like one of the only outcomes possible (from an amateur viewpoint) if only BTC survives in its current form?

q77m1b,Jack1602,Mental exercise and UTXO privacy question,"It's the year 2047. The IRS has a brand new Quantum Computer and it's starting to mess around with it. The Bitcoin community saw this coming and implemented a quantum resistant cryptography address type a while ago. You moved all your funds to this new type of address, they are SAFU. You know your stuff, so instead of batch sending all your UTXOs to a new address type, you waited for the record low 30sat/vbyte fees (we haven't seen 1sat/vbyte since the year 2036 or so...) to make your transactions UTXO by UTXO, each to a different address so you don't link them all to the same owner. You also did it in different times around the clock to break any timezone analysis and used different fees to break any type of possible link between old and new addresses, other than ""the owner of the old UTXO is highly likely the owner of the new UTXO"" because you transferred 100% of the funds.

&amp;#x200B;

Good. You are smart. However, you start to wonder. Your past self wasn't as privacy oriented, and you likely made some mistakes along the way - you've been holding these coins since the year 2023 after all. You were careful enough to mix the coins through the Samousabi implementation, after Samourai and Wasabi became friends in the year 2022 and joined forces to develop the ultimate mixer. You kept your mixed coins in separate UTXOs, but you remember that all these UTXOs belong to the same wallet, meaning you have one seed, one passphrase, and they are allocated to derivation paths M/84‚Äô/0‚Äô/0‚Äô/0/0, M/84‚Äô/0‚Äô/0‚Äô/0/1, M/84‚Äô/0‚Äô/0‚Äô/0/2... or whatever, the main point being they can be derived with the same master private key. You also remember that you purchased a bitrefuel card to pay for Spmusicfy Premium once, and that the email account is linked to your meatspace self in various KYC services (water, electricity, you name it). Important: the UTXO you used to pay for this has nothing to do with the mixed ones, they were never together and never will be, but they belong to the same wallet. If the mixed coins ate in M/84‚Äô/0‚Äô/0‚Äô/0/0-1000, the UTXO used to pay for this was the 1001. Completely different address and history.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the big question. The IRS can't prove you own coins now, because we're quantum resistant. They can't seize the funds either. However, they can know everything inside bitrefuel (because NSA and tinfoil hat) so they can link your meatspace self to that one payment, meaning they can link you to a public address. With their QC, they can bruteforce-get the master private key for that address, from which it is trivial to derive all the public addresses that share that private key. Therefore, they can prove you owned X bitcoin at certain given time, and checking their records they can see you never reported owning them (it became mandatory in the year 2040). Even more, they can link you to the UTXOs in the quantum safe format and know you currently own X bitcoin, and that all of these ""mixed"", ""independent"" and ""unrelated"" quantum safe bitcoin are yours.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore,

TLDR:

1) Is it safer (privacy-wise) to keep your UTXOs not only separate within the same wallet, but belonging to different wallets so in a QC future they won't be linked? The moment you KYC one of the UTXOs, would you be KYCing them all?

2) Would having the UTXOs under one seed and different passphrases mitigate this issue? I am not positive a QC could derive the seed *and* the passphrase from the master private key

3) Would ""hiding"" UTXOs in non-trivial derivation paths mitigate this? Say, instead of M/84‚Äô/0‚Äô/0‚Äô/0/212, using M/84‚Äô/0‚Äô/0‚Äô/0/212568. How much of a difference would that make in a QC space?

1. What is panic selling? 


2. Can you still lose money if you dont sell? 
 - for example, I buy some bitcoin and i know that the price fluctuates overtime etc but if i just buy and dont sell until i can 100% definitely sell for a profit will i still lose money? Its hard for me to explain it sorry if im not making sense i do apologise. 


3. Is there any unwritten rules on buying and selling crypto?


4. So for example if i buy bitcoin and dont sell, ovetime im bound to make a profit right? Because isn't bitcoin rising as a whole? i know by looking at the graphs that some days / months or even years it does take a big drop but like overall isn't it still slowly going to go higher and higher regardless of the drops here and there? 


5. How long should you normally wait until you sell? I know its random as the price can drop and go high whenever bit is there a time when you should sell and when you shouldn't sell?


6. Its not good selling low and buying high right? 

7. What tips would you give beginners who really want to succeed in cryptocurrency. Im not looking to make millions or even thousands from crypto i just want to see if i can make as little profit as possible as im just starting off. 


8. How do i know when to sell and when not to sell? 


9. Does it really matter when i buy if im not planning on selling it anytime soon? If i buy whenever and just keep it and then eventually sell it when i make a profit however little that may be is that okay or is there a better way to do it?


10. Can i make a profit from a ¬£10 investment of bitcoin? 
(Starting small as dont want to spend 100s and lose it because i dont know what im doing) 


Thats about it. Im sure more questions will come up overtime but thats all for right now. If you've read this all then thank you and i do apologise for the rookie questions ü§£ but then again we got to start somewhere right !

qgaz5h,Markhutchinson56,How can one invest in Bitcoin?,"There are a couple of ways one can invest in bitcoin and I'll kindly share below.

Bitcoin has made groundbreaking headlines over the last six months or so due to its ever accelerating growth which doesn't seem to stop.

So buying and holding bitcoin is a great way to invest: but given its volatility, one can never be too sure as to what might happen next.

In my opinion though, I think it's better to use investment sites to get returns on your crypto instead of just holding it in wallets. At least that way, you still make some profit regardless of the rise or fall in crypto.

Caution must be advised in circumstances like these as many people have lost their savings to fake platforms claiming to be crypto investment sites. Most of them offer mouthwatering returns and many people fall for it. Some even promise unbelievable profits in just hours.

Apparently there hasn't, according to Fidelity, been any activity since October 6 of this year, and now I can find very little information about it online, as though this thing just up and vanished.  

Does anyone have any idea what is going on?  Is there anything I or Fidelity can do?  Did I just lose hundreds of thousands of dollars?!? (I know, I know, not your keys not your bitcoin.

qg9ggs,Ok_Ground3302,Third-Largest Bitcoin Whale Bought $37 Million in BTC," After staying on the sidelines for a few weeks, the third-largest Bitcoin whale has purchased another sizeable chunk of BTC.  
One of the largest BTC whales has resumed its accumulation appetite by buying more than $37 million worth of the primary cryptocurrency. This comes after a few weeks of untypical silence.  
CryptoQuant‚Äôs analyst going by the Twitter handle VentureFounder outlined the most recent purchase earlier today.  
As the address associated with this whale shows, they bought 596 bitcoins at an average price of $62,934. This means that they spent just over $37.5 million in total.  
Interestingly, this purchase comes after a lack of serious activity in the past few weeks.Previously, the whale made multiple purchases and sales in accordance with BTC‚Äôs price movements.  
For example, they sold substantial portions when the cryptocurrency surged above $60,000 in They began to reaccumulate when the asset lost half of its USD value in the following months.  
Most recently, they sold some bitcoins at $56,000 earlier this month before repurchasing them a day later at a higher price.  
It‚Äôs worth noting that the current rally, which saw BTC going from $40,000 at the end of September to a new ATH at $67,000 last week, was mainly caused by such whales making large purchases, at least according to on-chain data.",1635263652,2,1

This is not a secret either. He told Peyton Manning and Eli Manning what happened

(It's in a video from the podcast. Scroll down to middle of the page.)

On their morning talk show ""Get Up"" the globalist @ ESPN made sure to list everything Brady gave the fan, except for one thing. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjcFS6pPbmk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjcFS6pPbmk)

I'm sure it was just an oversight. An oversight every other news organization reported.  Just Google ""Tom Brady Bitcoin.""  So it was no secret, and was not an oversight.

The globalist @ ESPN can't admit the fact that America's favorite athlete, Tom Brady, owns Bitcoin, and shares Bitcoin with the fans. That's not good for their ""Great Reset"" business model, is it?  

No.

q8dklb,Neat-Apartment3871,Putin considering using cryptocurrency as a settlement unit? Bitcoin surged in intraday trading,"Since this year, global energy prices have risen, and Russia, as one of the major oil producers, has attracted much attention. Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the International Energy Week event on Wednesday that he would consider using cryptocurrency as a settlement unit. Affected by this news, Bitcoin rose sharply that day.

&amp;#x200B;

At the event, when Putin was asked whether Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies could be used to replace the U.S. dollar for bulk energy transactions, he said that cryptocurrencies have a certain value, but in the short term, cryptocurrencies replace U.S. dollars to settle oil transactions. The probability is not high.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, he also pointed out that the production and trading of cryptocurrency requires a lot of energy, which will be a potential obstacle. Because Bitcoin requires the powerful computing power of a computer to process transactions and produce tokens.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, Russia is also a veritable big Bitcoin player. According to the latest Bitcoin power consumption data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, the United States is the world‚Äôs largest electricity consumer (35.40%), followed by Kazakhstan (18%), Russia (11.23%), Canada (9.6%) and Ireland (4.7%).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

According to relevant media, Russia's move is intended to get rid of its dependence on the US dollar. Russia said in June this year that it would completely remove US dollar assets from its National Wealth Fund (NWF) and plans to start a digital ruble test early next year.

&amp;#x200B;

Russia‚Äôs central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina previously stated that ‚Äúde-dollarization‚Äù is part of a broad policy to manage foreign exchange risk. Relevant professionals pointed out that Russia has been gradually reducing the use of the U.S. dollar to reduce the impact of the U.S. dollar on the country's economy.

I have enough in Bitcoin to cash out and pay for a car in cash. BUT, it wouldn't make sense to do so. I would prefer to take a loan out, and then sell Bitcoin to make the monthly payments. 

If Bitcoin keeps going up, this should make it so that I end up paying the car off while still having a bit of Bitcoin left over. It seems like the smart move.

With all of the individual investors, institutions, hedge funds interest, and with supposedly a third of the supply lost, how is there still a ""float"" when BTC buys are now at a peak?

I get that each transaction is recorded transparently on-chain however I'm more concerned about the non-custodial players/exchanges selling BTC to people looking to buy where they aren't given the physical private key at purchase.

I get the concept of ""stacking sats"" but why do I have a hunch that this non-custodial sales of BTC is the biggest sham and that people are at best being sold an IOU? Why the f@*k isn't EVERYONE asking for their private key?",1634252245,34,1
q8aqaa,DarthTrader357,Antminer vs mining company,"You can buy a lot more hashes per second per dollar (insert your local fiat) with an Antminer than you can with a bitcoin mining company.

So, help a newb understand some pros and cons to the Antminer? I understand stocks well enough - though feel free to share your reasons for investing in a mining company if you want.

But, when it comes to the Antminer series (S19 pro the latest one?), how do you determine the risk that offsets the profit?

For me it looks something like:

* Private keys for owning your coins
* Complexity of set-up or account management
* Customer service ([Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) sucks balls. Sorry don't argue with me about it. I know from a very shady experience that is a felony and will never use them because of it).
* Transferability of coins from exchange to exchange.

Each of those are where I really trip-up on wanting to get into mining in a pool. I don't know where to create a wallet. For instance blockfi sounds good because of the APY - but you don't own your own private keys.

I don't know where to mine coins to so that they are the most liquid, such as Coinbase is a closed loop so can't move coins off their platform? Does that just mean transfer to dollars? What if I want to keep coins on Coinbase but want to mine to Blockfi for the interest rate? How does that all look **IN GENERAL**?

Which exchanges/wallet holders(?what are places like blockfi even called?) have the best customer service, or the best ability to negotiate legally if shjt happens. Because let me tell you, [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) has nothing and can take everything from you and you can't even sue them.

Does it matter to be able to transfer coins? Are some exchanges or wallets less liquid than others?

I found out it was, and it sent excitement down my spine. I had been mining for almost a year, using my GTX1080ti at the time, and stupidly never cashed my earnings out. I liked coming home to watch it tick upwards. Well, December came, and I lost it all due to the hack. I guess I had continued mining afterwards but was defeated, because I found 56$ of Bitcoin on my coin base account. 
Unfortunately, when NiceHash didn‚Äôt recognize my account, even though it was the same email address used, and nothing was on there :-(. 
However, I have in my notes, information regarding my wallet from 2016. However, the phrase I have is only 5 words, and I guess that changed to 12 now. I didn‚Äôt write down the wallet name, but I swore it was Webull. I do have the backup secure code, but I don‚Äôt know what to do with it either. 
Does anyone have any suggestions about how I can proceed? Is there somewhere I can use my 11 digit backup secure code?

I reached out to NiceHash support. Hoping they can locate my account from that one Coinbase transaction, or my prior IPS address I used to mine. I know it‚Äôs a long shot, but I know I have atleast half of a BTC or more on there. Ugh!

A lot of people in this sub understand the unstoppable momentum of this project, and so they understand that Bitcoin's future purchasing power will likely be much stronger than it is today.

But markets are supposed to be efficient, and everybody has access to the same information. I know that members of this sub only represent 0.04% of the global population, but it's not like we're geniuses or have any special insider knowledge or anything like that.

If markets are are efficient, the increase in purchasing power would already be priced in, and the majority of people on this sub would have an understanding that the future purchasing power will remain more or less the same, or maybe slightly increase due to deflation.

So why is Bitcoin currently trading at what it's trading at, versus something that more closely reflects it's obvious future utility? Are markets simply way less efficient than I am expecting them to be?",1634159098,8,1

- People bartered
- People started trading with copper coins, copper mining and coinage were hard work. Some kings managed, some didn‚Äôt, some switched to cheaper and worse quality material, their economy collapsed. Next king went back to use copper for coins.
- One king mandate paper money, kill everyone who has coins and confiscate all coins and gold. People infuriated: ‚ÄúThis is a piece of paper! No intrinsic value‚Äù. 
- Said king printed too much money, hyperinflation, everything collapsed 
- New king came into power, back to copper coin
- Modern government came, kicked said king out, do a paper/coin combination. 
- Hyperinflation, said government cut a few zeros on the bank notes, confiscate all gold from citizens to fund wars.
- Said government got kicked by a new government. Rinse and repeat.

Since 2017, I have been reading a few crypto whitepapers and read some blogs about the same.   
So far, Bitcoin has outshined other projects in its simplicity, security, decentralization, and its philosophy in POW. Kudos to the team.  
I may be wrong, but I believe speed (Visa transaction scale) is not that important in layer1. As the Internet was not built on just a single layer. \*cough lightningNetwork \*cough  
Recently, I have been reading about Solana and how their 'proof of history' (on POS) is something revolutionary in speeding up the transactions. P.S. they require expensive validators and compromises decentralization.   
But I got curious to ask if 'proof of history' is truly innovative, and is it specific to POS?

q8rgra,neeya0323,Is bitcoin an asset or a currency?," I have been in lots of argument lately with close friends who keep dragging this subject matter. A friend of mine was of the opinion that an asset is any commodity that has a unit of symbol with monetary value attached to it while a currency has an exchange value that can be used in exchange for commodities. This very friend was of the opinion that bitcoin isn't a currency that its an asset because its value isn't stable and has volatility  


Another said bitcoin is both an asset and a currency depending how the user chooses to treat it. He was of the opinion that while bitcoin can be used in exchange for goods and services it can also serve as a store of value where you convert your fiat to a digital asset waiting for it to appreciate.  


For me I will go with my other friend who said bitcoin can serve both purposes which depends on two major factors:  


* **Your country**
* **You as an individual**

**Your country:**  
In my opinion you can't use bitcoin as a currency in a country where it is not legalized or a country where bitcoin is banned. Some countries has restricted ezchnagers from carrying out their business within the region so in such places you can't use your coin for commercial purpose you it will only serve as an asset  


**As an individual:**  
This is based on your choice if you are lucky enough to base in a country where bitcoin is legalized or a country where the government decides to remain mute of crypto related issues you can decide either to store yours as an asset or use it as a currency. But in countries with low civilization you will have the challenge of using it as a currency because it hasn't been accepted as a legal tender.  


what is your take on this Ôºü

PS:Reprinted from ""Zilon"" I mainly want to hear your opinions.

The idea would be to create a trust of a certain size, say 1000 BTC and offer shares on public markets for a fixed exchange rate. Hold half of the shares in reserve to arbitrage against the actual BTC price on your own exchange.

If the shares trade more than .1% (or some arbitrary amount) away from their fixed bitcoin price, equilibrium should be established daily, or even hourly. When the trust runs out of shares to sell, it should be instantly dissolved and the bitcoin paid out to shareholders. 

If shares trade above the fixed BTC price, shares are sold to buy BTC, and extra BTC/share is accumulated

If shares trade down below the fixed BTC price, they are repurchased by the trust using BTC, and the extra BTC/share is accumulated again

We are trying to implement a ‚ÄúBitcoin Back‚Äù program where you the consumer receive Bitcoin back for purchasing on LiquorVerse.

q6w5xi,Snichs22,Discounting the Future [OC],"Discounting the Future

The US dollar system is a direct contributor to climate change and severely limits our ability to make proper long-term capital investments needed to secure our future.

A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. This fact incentivizes individuals to spend their money, for if they were to delay their consumption and save those dollars, individuals would then have a claim on fewer assets, goods and services than they would have otherwise.

Due to this inflationary dynamic, whereby dollars lose their purchasing power over time, individuals are also incentivized to accrue debt. Debt increases an individual‚Äôs leverage by pulling forward productive future capital factors to the present in order to finance current consumption. As time passes, these debts must be paid with interest, implying a future strain imposed on economic efficiency.

These debt obligations coupled with the reduction in dollar purchasing power mean that individuals must increasingly discount future cash flows, reflecting a relative reduction in the real value of future capital. The erosion of capital value over time reduces economic incentives for long time-horizon investments, and incentivizes debt accrual.

A debt-based monetary system which inherently devalues future economic activity is incompatible with environmental sustainability. On a basic level, environmental sustainability requires the inverse: we must increasingly value our collective future so that we may invest in and conserve our environment for future use and capital creation.

Returns to Scale

In a deflationary economic system, whereby the value of the currency appreciates over time, individuals are incentivized to forego present consumption with the expectation that if they save their surplus capital, they will be rewarded with a relative increase in purchasing power in the future. This dynamic disincentivizes consumption as well as the accrual of leverage via debt, as debt would only become more costly as value of the currency increases. Rational holders of a deflationary currency would be duly incentivized towards solvency and optionality via savings.

A society wherein people economize for the future while reducing their conspicuous consumption would solve many of the collective action problems that undergird our inability to solve climate change and the paradoxes outlined in the famous Limits to Growth (1972) report by the Club of Rome, which identified the Growth Paradox early on.  

An apt metaphor from physics is that of entropy, or the movement of energetic systems from states or order, to states of disorder. An inflationary (entropic) currency has increasing returns to entropy, whereas a deflationary (anti-entropic) currency has inverse returns. Like the biogeochemical systems that characterize our dire straits with respect to climate change, the monetary entropy of the dollar system, with its asymptotic rise in devaluation post-1971, mirrors the asymptotic rise in climatic entropy, whereby the natural systems that sustain the world become increasingly chaotic and disordered.

Flat out: a currency that devalues future prosperity, incentivizes risk in the form of debt, and necessitates infinite consumption growth on a finite planet does not generate long-term, cooperative game theoretic or collective action dynamics. Our global prisoner‚Äôs dilemma and subsequent race to the bottom accurately reflect our socioeconomic values as they stand.

Petro vs Electro

In addition, the value of the US dollar is directly tied at the margin to the price of oil through what is known as petrodollar recycling. Essentially, the US and Saudi Arabia came to agree to settle all oil transactions in dollars, which was then followed in suit by most oil producing countries around the world. As the military hegemon of the world, the US imposed its currency network on international actors who otherwise would prefer to trade in a more favorable currency, as evidenced by the likes of Saddam Hussein (gold) and Muammar Gaddafi (Euros) and others. 

To enforce this demand for dollars through the global oil trade, the US Department of Defense burns 4.6 billion gallons of gasoline equivalent per-year to enforce its inflationary currency standard. I am still waiting for somebody to describe how a currency predicated on Saudi Aramco‚Äôs long-term viability linked with the use of worldwide military force can in any way be sustainable.

I‚Äôll be waiting, and in the meantime I‚Äôll be stacking Bitcoin. Guaranteed programmatic deflation, a decentralized non-violent security model, and a method to generate reliably forecasted new demand for lowest-cost electricity, which will be provided majority by hydro, nuclear, wind and solar. Bitcoin is how we reduce risk and consumption while financing the immense energy transformation that the world needs. Decentralized information processing coupled with decentralized energy production will eliminate the tail risks inherent to our current mode of centralized economization, ushering in an era of sustainability and cooperative societal dynamics. Bitcoin solves for climate change across micro and macro scales.",1634074181,6,1

If I open my own business I can probably get it a lot cheaper bu withdrawing the taxes and stuff.

So my first question is. Is it worth it? I do have my electricity covered by solar power panels.

Second question is what is the usual life time of such miner? 1-2-3-4-5? Years?

And final question is are the calculators accurate about the miner‚Äôs profit? I know it depends on the current BTC price, electricity and stuff but according to various calculators I should be able to earn ‚Ç¨75-125 per day. What are your thoughts on this one?",1634071551,31,1

I get it and thanks to reddit communities leading me to great reading material I have learned enough to become a responsible crypto owner in the past year. I'd like to hear people's thoughts on the problem of insurance. I do not currently believe bitcoin can become the main currency in wealthy countries without good insurance options. Sure, banks and insurance companies are crooks but that doesn't mean there isn't major value to having insurance for the security of your assets. I fully support the freeing of power from their control. But I don't think most people will ever feel comfortable having their life savings sitting in a relatively easily stolen or lost format without insurance, in their custody. That is not realistic. It sounds pretty damn easy to snap a photo of a seed phrase and then drain a wallet at a later date without any consequences. I would guess most people continue to hold home-owner's insurance after their mortgage is paid off because the risk of losing everything in a fire far outweighs the yearly premium.

q3xexe,M-A-L,Bitcoin-based DeFi in El Salvador,"Yesterday saw the announcement of an interesting collaboration in El Salvador between a national bank (Banco Hipotecario) and Sovryn, an open-source Bitcoin-based DeFi platform. Sovryn allows people to utilize their Bitcoin for such things as lending, facilitating decentralized trading and so on.  

I think it's incredibly massive news for Bitcoin (as well as for the people in El Salvador). Using DeFi services is quite another step to take for the average person, and the bank effectively helps people getting used to the idea that it is safe and secure. It further entrenches the embrace of Bitcoin, undermining any argument for the need to widen adoption to include other cryptocurrencies. No SOV is needed to use Bitcoin on the platform. Sovryn aims to offer the full DeFi suit (including NFTs, stablecoins, mortgages, etc.), all based on the usage and security of Bitcoin. A national bank will effectively teach people to use their Bitcoin (and softens onboarding), using a decentralized platform that is just as available without any bank. These seem to me the realistic steps to the eventual demise of the centralized banking world and a Bitcoin-based financial system.    

The vision of the future that starts to emerge from the adoption in El Salvador is that of a system consisting of Bitcoin + Lightning + RSK + Bitcoin-based DeFi. Little else seems needed.

My question is inspired by a thread from yesterday:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q2d5qm/think\_somebody\_can\_guess\_or\_accidentally\_get\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q2d5qm/think_somebody_can_guess_or_accidentally_get_your/)

So the question is as follows.

With the list of bip 39 [https://coldbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bip-39-wordlist.pdf](https://coldbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bip-39-wordlist.pdf)

can one create their own set of seed words (say 11 out of 12, with the latest one being the checksum word) in a certain alphabetic order of the first letters of each word? In such case one would only need to remember one word (11 lettered) or set of letters in order to reproduce 11 words with the entire mnemonic being exposed?

I might be missing something?

q3uoky,kalejsf,Binance -&gt; FTX/Kraken?? Europe,"
Hello! I am starting to think that I should switch from Binance because I'm scared of all the regulations that are coming for them. At first, I used Kraken for a few months and got pretty used to it, but then wanted to make the switch to Binance because of the lower fees and more available coins. Now with all these regulations I am thinking of switching to a different exchange just in case. Even though both neither FTX and Kraken don't have the altcoins I would own, I feel like I should probably still switch.

FTX as an option:

The fees seem way lower than on any other exchange and they have a few coins I want to hold, but not all of them. The withdrawal fiat fee won't matter to me because I am from Europe and the UI just needs a bit of getting used to. I hate the fact that there aren't many USDT/USDC pairs though

Kraken as an option:

Already got used to it, know what to do and I like the UI a bit better. I've read that they have amazing security, but a lot of ''whicks''too. Fees a bit higher, but I read a post about fees actually being a lot lower than mentioned. 

I had a lot of problems with [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) (customer support, exchange, fees seem high) so I don't want to make them an option (even though I have their ruby steel card) and will use Gemini for those free withdrawals (really doesn't have any coins though).

Bitcoin (BTC) contract technical analysis: the trend line continues to continue the EMA Cross golden cross running upward, the general trend remains unchanged, the downward callback is repaired, the previous high of 52950 becomes a support level, if it breaks, it means that a major callback is about to appear , If you touch the rebound, you will continue to be bullish. At the same time, we need to remind everyone that you should not consider shorting for the time being. Even if there is a big drop, the big drop will only occur after an upward impact. Therefore, today‚Äôs contract trading advice is: still make long orders when the callback is around 53400-53600, the target range is 56000-56400; the downward break through the support level 52950 stop loss;",1633678607,1,1

q3spbt,Ape1108,BITCOIN IS POWER!,"Hi all,

I got into Bitcoin around April of this year. I listened the Robert Breedlove on Lex Fridman's show and he sparked my interest in the subject matter. Now, I am  no one who is just looking for a way to make quick money. Rather than that I was deeply intrigued by his Philosophy and the Austrian Economic Theory behind Bitcoin. I always had slogans like ""Big Banks are evil"" and ""They steal our wealth"" in the back of my mind but I never followed up on these claims. That was until said interview. I went on this very sub-reddit and asked Bitcoiners to point me towards something where I can start to learn about the flaws and fallacies in our economy and our financial system. I was referred to the Hidden Secrets of Money Series with Mike Maloney and Saifedean Ammous The Bitcoin Standard. After that I followed the links, the signs, the mentions, the recommendations, the references, the suggestions and I went down A DEEP RABBIT HOLE!!! Not kidding, I spent roughly 500 to 600 hours over the last 6 month reading every book and every article I found, watching every video and listening to tons of podcasts on the topic. And it changed my entire world view, my approach on financial matters and my strategy for long term investing. I am humble enough to know that I still know nothing at all... but one thing I have taken away from this is that people who are not familiar with Bitcoin must not underestimate the NON-FINANCIAL POSITIVE EFFECT a Bitcoin Deep Dive can have on you as an individual. I feel like my laser eyes are slowly starting to glow and they burnt the veil of bullshit mainstream propaganda right off my face. Bitcoin has led me to Mises, Rothbart, Taleb, Hayek and many more. I have an entire shelf on my reading list, and which each book I feel more empowered. Bitcoin has done this. Thus, the thing I am preaching now to friends and family is the following:

q345xr,-Scott_Trenti,October 7: BTC is expected to reach a high level and will continue to rise during the day.,"BTC contract analysis: Yesterday, the daily line of BTC continued to close in the sun continuously, and the price was as high as expected. However, the sideways correction of the Asia-Europe plate is still time for space, and there is no chance of a big retracement such as long-term. If the price is to go out of the extremely high level, first, the sideways position; Second: 618 position of retreat, which is the explosion point of reference rise. Yesterday, relying on more than 50700-50600 areas, we also successfully reached the target area of 52500 for harvesting.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w2y7auzphzr71.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dc036ba7830680a18270186dc1beb1163c60ed1

For the short-term trading of BTC contract in the day, the daily line rose sharply, breaking the high close in the early morning. Although the daily index has entered the overbought area, it is still necessary to consider the risk of retracement after the emergence of top deviation. Therefore, today's thinking is still more, saying that the short-term trading position of BTC contract in the next day, in the strong closing market, only the revised low point and position 618 in the early morning are considered, while the revised low point in the early morning is near the 54500 area and the position 618 is near the 53700 area, which are all positions with more reference layout arrangements today. It is more radical to have more light positions in the 54500 area, and it is only necessary to add positions to the normal position in the 53700 area. The target is to look at the vicinity of the 56500 area.

q33v86,pretentiousername,Coinfloor's Obi shits on his loyal customers for a quick buck (closes exchange without warning and hands your KYC docs to others unless you act).,"It's not that he's run away with or lost customers' money but Coinfloor and Ledger (I know!) are two crypto-related organisations I have over the years introduced many people to and brought them custom. And Coinfloor doing what they just have, not to the same extent obviously, brings back that shitty feeling for having recommended them to my family and friends.

To do things properly, Coinfloor could have:

1. announced with plenty of notice;
1. closed deposits on a date of which customers had had prior notification;
1. closed trading on a date of which customers had had prior notification;
1. asked express permission to pass sensitive data to another jurisdiction that operates under a different financial regulator;
1. at least given people the option of the form (whether BTC or GBP) of withdrawal;
1. ...and in addition to all the above, given plenty of time to do so.

But if he'd done that - and in particular, if only with explicit permissions was this sensitive data handed over to an off-shore third party - if customers had plenty of time and options, the buyer couldn't bank on so many of us transferring and Obi wouldn't have gotten as high a price for a significantly shorter list of transferred customers!

So in that light, of course, closing the exchange at the same time as making the announcement and allowing only either full withdrawal of funds in the form they're in or accepting (and accepting handover of docs to) the new owners makes a narrow if dishonourable sense.

Screw GDPR, screw respect for customer's privacy, screw acknowledging that without these customers, Coinfloor wouldn't have made him the fortune it has, screw integrity.

Obi's choice was to take the money, make one of the lamest and most blatant BS excuse out there[ '...to further British Bitcoin adoption...'](https://coinfloor.co.uk/hodl/), '...they share our values...' blah blah bullshit blah...

...and with his weighed-down saddle bags, the very next day day, Obi rides off into the sunset [merrily tweeting about the price of Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/obi/status/1445330530254430212)!",1633591844,0,1

q329ua,DavidLee1011,Earn $30-$50 daily with RoyalQ trading bot.,"Hey guys. RoyalQ is robot trading bot which uses system martingale to buy crypto at low price and sell at high price. In this robot you wont be facing any losts unless you manually sell. If your crypto is floating u jz have to wait for the market to go up and it will sell automatically. What I like about royalq is it buy and sells crypto layer by layer that means you can get daily revenue. Your revenue is based on your capital. If you invest 1000$ you can approximately get $5- $10 daily. If you invest $2000 you can get $20-$25 daily. More money you invest more daily revenue you will get. Personally I have been using royalq for around 3 months and my capital is $3000. I almost got 80% of my capital from this robot. By next month I can see some profits. You need to have either huobi or binance account to be able to use royalq. The royalq robot activation is one time pay of 120$. But if you join with my referral I will give back the 30$ to you as a commision. I will also provide best margin call settings if you join with my referral. Let me know if interested. I can guide you fully step by step. Share about this royalq to many people as possible so that they could benefit together with us. You can also try to search royalq in youtube to know more about how it works.  
 I will be giving 30$ to each and everyone joining royalq under my referral. My referral code is QP5ZR. Sign up to Royalq using this registration link [https://raqsy.com/s/QP5ZR](https://raqsy.com/s/QP5ZR?fbclid=IwAR2VXRfoSX1-oaw_2Xgaa5T77EFmlE_S9P9BttG7ve0J8NJZ4o0tIrsBOF4). Extra 20$ will be given if you invite more of your friends to join my referral code. My target is to reach 100 people joining under me for now. Message me once you're done joining under my referral to claim the 30$ and more if you invite more friends. Dont miss this chance! \*\*\*If lets say you invite 5 of your friends and your friend invites 5 more friends to join under my link, you will get 300$. If you invite more people, you will be getting more money in usdt.

Prior to said dip, I first bought BTC like five years ago to save fees on gambling sites and ordering fun stuff on the dark web. FML. Fast forward a few years and I started investing in BTC in small amounts at a time just because I thought it would grow. It did grow, and grow fast. But then dat musk energy fud dip. During that dip I was able to:
 
1) At least double my position, if not more.
 
2) Read and study BTC. This was the biggest eye opener. Just wish I did this back in the 2015-2016 time frame when I first purchased. I would have bought a shit ton. I won‚Äôt elaborate too much but I would encourage any newbies to try and understand the technology. It might be greatest engineering marvel of our lifetime.
 
3) Started to take security seriously. With that I did the following:
-offloaded most to cold storage.
-got metal plate for seed
-diversified online holdings to three different exchanges (prevent loss of too much if they fuck up, such as getting hacked or run with our crypto)
-took extra measures at those exchanges to ensure security on my end by getting a Yubikey and adding 2FA.
-got blockfi credit card and get sats for each purchase.
 
Finally feel like I am in good place and have my ducks in a row for this thing to moon. Now that all this shit is taken care of, I can pack my bags.

His answer was property (land). He said that he should have been investing more into property to hedge against inflation. Technically, he's not wrong. But immediately after hearing his answer I had to say out loud: ""Bitcoin"". Everyone chuckled a little bit because somehow Bitcoin is still considered to be fake internet money by most people. I even added ""Hey, if you bought some Bitcoin 10 years ago you'd be doing great right now"". He even acknowledged that if he had bought bitcoin 10 years ago he would be a billionaire, but they immediately shrugged the topic off and went back to talking about property.

Bitcoin can be a medium of exchange so it seems strange to put rules on it based on treating it as an investment. It is legal tender in El Salvador.

These rules seem like they are stifling usage of Bitcoin out of concern of losing taxes to an asset that is outperforming the dollar. Fiat can't compete so they attack.",1633570570,7,3

q3guey,throwaway29801A,"You're going to lose a lot of friendships and gain others, and that's ok","I've just started having my first real friendship deteriorate over bitcoin. It's okay.

MOST, but not all, humans are jealous, envious, and scared creatures.

While some friends might be happy for you, if your lifestyle changes dramatically, it will cause friction. Imagine you have a group of friends where no one owns a home, and then 3 years later one guy owns a home and has a nice car. It will create friction. Beyond the money, bitcoin is an attack of the normal life. If you are a bitcoiner, you probably do not believe we should accept the status quo. You aren't afraid to have different beliefs. You are okay being the weird one.

What exacerbates these differences is how fast the financial and social changes are happening and why it happens-the person will say ""I bought bitcoin"" and to most people the only acceptable answer is ""I worked for it"". The bitcoiner did work for it -they put time researching and took their savings into bitcoin, and also took risk-but to most they will be viewed as lucky.

What hurt my friendship is the other person likes to be the top dawg and now is scared. His reaction to being scared is to lash out. So, if I could give advice-if you have friends who are not where they want to be financially (I guess this is 99% of us), and they are not going to buy bitcoin (or research no matter what you say), if you want to preserve the friendship, maybe it's better to just smile and nod.

Also, I have met several people who share common beliefs. Important: we disagree on a lot...but with several people I've met in the community, we share a common set of values. And perhaps that's what is happening-bitcoin is exposing that some of my friends and I don't share common values.",1633635532,47,1

I started being afraid that bitcoin value went up so far and did not report that bitcoin use for foreign transactions since then.

q3dwsk,BelongToMeFap,What do you thin if technical analsys ?,"I started to avoid doing any of it, or hoping for it to help tp predict anything..  
I read articles and try to read any news related to crypto ( negative or positive ) and make assumptions that Bitcoin will go up or down, and I feel like it is going up for the moment and it won't stop, more adoption higher price, simple is that..

But the TA is a good tool that can make you think you can predict something and a good tool also that give you easily excuses that justifies why your something hasn't been achieved, just draw more lines, move one a little bit and here you are, that's why the resistance is 54 not 53 :) and Wouaah.. wth !   


TA isn't testable, I see a lot of guys ( claiming experts ) who just says thing like bitcoin will reach 53, if it breaks up then it goes to 60 ( 70% ), if not then it will return to 48 ( 30 % ), so what they do exactly if they give you the only two choices available ( it may go up or down ), how can this help ? aand those numbers are meaningless ( 70% &amp; 30% ) for many reasons   


\- If BTC go up, the ""expert"" will be like "" OKAY, I told you, see ? "", if not ""OKAY, that wasn't expected, but i told you it may go down too "", like eseriously ? how would I take such person as a reference ? 

\- Those numbers ( 70% - 30% ) are exactly the same as ( 65% - 35% ) or ( 50% - 50% ) , a number that shows that you're positive or negative that's all, those numbers aren't based on anything, in a scientific field, a scientist or statistics guy can give you such numbers and he'll show you how many scenarios has been tested and repeated to get those numbers, in Crytpo charts, this isn't the case at all, because every scenario isn't the same as before, every scenario is a different case, so you can't test it ? 

\- I like when a TA guy start giving you prices a crypto may stop up or get tested at, and he start drawing his shitlines based on previous tops or bottoms, and give you prices like 23, 27, 33, and then a major event comes in and the coin drops to 3 or jumps to 40, he becomes just so ridiculous ? or the price for example goes to 25.5 and start getting tested and then again starts drawing new lines to justify why this is the new restiance or support or whataver LOL

I have founded a wallet on my mobile phone a few years ago. The app is called **Ethos**. The wallet is universal. There is a separate address for BTC, ETH etc. The issue is that the wallet has only **one 24-seed** which should recover all the ""daughter"" wallets.

I decided to transfer my BTC (in my case the wallet includes only BTC, not other altcoins) to Binance. I logged into the wallet and surprisingly was not able to send the amount without a PIN code. The issue is that there was not any PIN code before. In order to create a PIN code the users have to insert the **24 word seed phase**. I have found a list with my seed words. The issue is that I have writted down only 24 words.

&amp;#x200B;

I have found this app:

[https://github.com/ZenGo-X/mnemonic-recovery](https://github.com/ZenGo-X/mnemonic-recovery)

The app should be able to generate **possible missing words and existing addresses** when I write the 23 words and a questionmark on 1st, 2nd, 3rd.... 24th place. It has generated approximately 200 possible solutions. approx 8 words for every place. The issue is that none of the addresses generated next to the missing words is my ""daughter"" BTC address. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the Ethos wallet has  a special ""parent"" address for the ""daughter"" wallets. 

Should I try all approx. 200 possible solutions from the app above? I can clearly see that none of the 200 possible addresses is actually my ""daughter"" BTC address. Is it possible that there are some other possible words for a ""parent"" address?

I have tried Googling how to do it, and searched this subreddit however I get totally baffled each time by the different answers given and end up not doing it for fear of losing the contents of the wallet. 

I have search the wallet address and it appears there is some BCH attached to the address too.  Can I remove them both from the paper wallet at the same time? 

What I would like to know is... What is the safest and most secure way of emptying that wallet of the BTC and BCH?  What steps do I need to take to make sure I don't leave any BTC or BCH behind?    How do I avoid the possibility of leaving myself vulnerable to attacks or scams?

q2309f,bbien12,The success of the US dollar will be the reason behind it's downfall.,"It's just a theory, but I was connecting the dots on this for quite a while now. Currently, all debts on the government level are denominated in USD. Want to buy oil? Good luck without having USD. Want to global trade? It won't happen without USD. Examples are endless, and there is one result: HUGE demand for US dollars on a global level.

It's human nature that you don't want to depend on external factors and use something you can't control. The US can print the dollars to infinity and export it as it's product to all other nations (with little to no consequences on its domestic economy). Before 1971 all was fine, as USD was a gold certificate. Nixon temporarily suspended that convertibility, and now, over 50 years from that event, we are still in fiat. What is the impact of this? Countries have to suck it up, deal with it, and use US dollar. Since 1971 this setup always had a negative impact on their economy. Now everything might change.

El Salvador was first, Brazil will follow, and the domino effect soon can't be stopped. Everyone will realize the escape from the US Ponzi system is already here, and the adoption will be driven by the most powerful force on this planet: the human desire to cause damage and change as a result of unfair advantage, this time aimed towards US and USD.

Terabytes of data, 12.9 million documents, all detailing how billionaires and over 300 corrupt politicians have avoided taxes, and Bitcoin was not used a single time by them.

How can it be that exactly the politicians who claim that crypto would be the main accelerator of financial crime and tax evasion have used exclusively the broken old financial system to do that which they blame crypto on supporting.

With Bitcoin every single transaction would be transparent on the blockchain, everyone could see where all the money is going. Wondering why they are so against it? The reason seems more obvious than ever.

Pandora papers showed that people are using loopholes in tax laws to hide their wealth in tax havens to hide their wealth or ill gotten gains. They are not using cryptocurrency to do that, there are plenty of loopholes in tax laws for doing it legally.

The rich are holding properties and investments under a network of offshore companies that are set up in other countries, or ""offshore"".

These offshore countries or territories are where:

\- it's easy to set up companies

\- there are laws that make it difficult to identify owners of companies

\- there is low or no corporation tax.

The best part of it is that using tax havens to dodge taxes is not illegal. Loopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by  moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is  often seen as unethical.

Its estimated that from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion is hidden in tax havens, according to the ICIJ.  The IMF has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year.

To hide money all you need to do set up a shell company in one of the countries or  jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists  in name only, with no staff or office.  It costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell  companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names  of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately  behind the business.

When such a huge amount of money is hidden in offshore havens, the rich still blames cryptocurrency as the culprit for money laundering. This is classic gaslighting. They are projecting and blaming the most vulnerable group, what they do themselves.

This legal way of tax dodging will never end because the people that could end the secrecy offshore are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it.

Its time more people speak up against this and move more towards cryptocurrency where all data is independently verifiable.",1633449305,489,2392

When bitcoin does have mass adoption, it can give the power back to small business and take away from monopolies. People don't invest in amazon or walmart because they like the ceo or company policies they invest to try to obtain more wealth. If people realize bitcoin will save their wealth and potentially create some if they get in now, how many people globally would be taking money out of their fortune 500 investments? Lets say people do take their money out of Amazon. That would limit amazons ability to expand as rapidly as they are wouldn't it? They would have to spend profits on expansion instead of investors money. And people will probably invest money locally into shops of people they actually know. Imagine if your town doesn't have mexican food or chinese food, you could invest a little to help them startup and give your town more options. Thoughts?

It seems like the knee jerk reaction would be the latter - alternative to fiat currency, with the upside of potential appreciation.

I personally started purchasing Bitcoin on the excitement of an alternative to fiat currency and actively seek out merchants accepting it. But I must admit, when you are seeing upward pricing trends it becomes challenging to let it go, and similar emotions on downward trends.

q0z5nt,AllenDo,Michael Saylor's arbitrage plan: borrow against your btc.... what's next?,"1. Michael Saylor has advocated that you should buy BTC with all your money.  If you need money to pay rent, you borrow against your BTC. As long as BTC appreciation rate is higher than the interest rate, you can continue borrow money the next year, using the new borrowed money to pay the loan from preceding year and continue this practice indefinitely. 
2. I think the benefit of this is you don't pay tax and you can use the money for living. But I want to know the second half of the story.  
3. Assuming BTC does appreciate forever at a rate higher than the interest rate as Michael hypothesized(that's a big if).   
**Now my question is** when I die, I could have something like 500k dollars worthy of BTC as my assets and 400K dollars worthy of debt.   
If I want to give the BTC to my child after my death, what about the debt? Will my child also take over the debt? Will the bank subtract my debt from BTC and only give my child the rest (capital gain tax involved?)? If I put the BTC in a trust, will there be any difference? 
4. I am too lazy to figure out the US tax codes etc. And I know anything you say is not a financial or legal advice.

Customers don't see the value in Bitcoin because they can't spend it at their favourite businesses.

Businesses don't see the value in Bitcoin because they can't receive it as payment from all their customers.

Fortunately, it seems that numbers of customers investing in Bitcoin are increasing. In Australia it is currently at around 1 in 11 people owning Bitcoin. I tried to find a graph of this statistic over the last ten years but it seems people have only started doing surveys recently.

Hopefully, due to network effects, this number will keep increasing. When half of all people own some Bitcoin, there will be a strong business case for companies to start accepting it. It's so important to remember that businesses are customer oriented.

It's a slow march, but if adoption numbers keep increasing, eventually utility will be great enough for the late adopters to jump on board.

q0szo3,Vinitowinit,Good Idea or Bad Idea: LN bridge to EVM Compatible /SOL/Terra Blockchains ??,"Hi all this is a genuine question. To preface, I am not an evangelist of Bitcoin nor any other chain. I am interested in learning about different blockchain architectures. This question is genuinely something I am curious about and I would love to understand the community's thoughts on this. 

Question: Why are there no bridges between the Lightning Network and other chains such as Eth/Sol/Terra etc?? 

I ask because the blockchain world is becoming inherently multichain. Solana is connecting to Ethereum. Ethereum projects are launching on Avalanche and so on. Each chain is trying to develop unique projects and inviting other altcoins and communities to engage. This will have a net/net benefit for both chains surrounding exposure and ease of use. Why does LN not have bridges to these worlds to either send or recieve Bitcoin and compatible altcoins. 

From my understanding, the main use cases of LN are 1) global settlement and finality of cash with no fees 2) creation of feeless micropayments.  However unlike other chains, the LN doesn't have robust Smart contract support, correct?  


If so, why not create a bridge between Bitcoin and Avalance for instance to give current LN users exposed to defi and NFT based projects without ever leaving the application?   


Back to the example, if two LN users send funds to each other, why can't they both earn additional yield on their funds sitting on LN? From a user perspective, not only do I get global cash finality but also yield opportunities on that cash. This is huge :)   


The LN community benefits from this integration as now these users/customers have yield generation/borrowing and lending protocols at their disposal. While other chains benefit due to LN instant finality for sending funds and the ability to connect to a major user base.   


Thanks everyone and would love to hear your genuine opinions on whether creating a bridge beween LN and other chains is a good or bad idea :)",1633302245,5,1

I wanted to send btc on my laptop to an address that I had on my phone and also had the qr code. So how to transfer the address to the laptop? Well, since my laptop has a camera, I just googled some online qr code reader and scanned the qr code on my phone, childs play.

Well I'm a little nervous when I had to make on-chain transactions and thank God I am! I double checked every character and it turned out that the online qr code reader messed up one character! Is this a common mistake that qr code readers miss? I never had an issue like this before (altough I did not scan much btc addresses, mostly just websites and the like).

So since then I'm super careful what to use in cases like this. Watch out and be alert!

So usually I just but my BTC from an ATM which automatically goes into my Bitcoin wallet, but as I'm sure you all know, there are fees (some worse than others).

Now that I finally have a checking account again (long story), is there a cheaper way to buy BTC with money from my checking account?

I Google and there was stuff about a BTC exchange... is this the best (cheapest) way to do it? If so, what are your recommendations for what BTC exchange to use?

The day before the proposal was put forward, one of its investors, the venture capital firm Andresen Horowitz, announced how to regulate the next generation of Internet services including blockchain and digital assets. As we all know, a16z executives plan to meet with leaders of various departments of the US government this week. The vision of the Bitcoin base overlaps with that of Anderson Horowitz, but contains some subtle differences and is more focused on digital assets. Although a16z advocates cross-regulatory cooperation, Bitcoin Base stated in its policy report that there should be only one regulator in the digital asset market. In general, the Bitcoin Base stated in its policy report that it hopes to have a ‚Äúclear and comprehensive approach to regulating digital assets and conducting reasonable-purpose supervision. It also stated that regulation needs to recognize how technology can benefit the public, and It warned that the United States has ‚Äúlagged behind‚Äù other countries in creating comprehensive digital asset regulation.

If the reward is that low, then adding the coinbase transaction to the block may not be profitable for the miner, because it will occupy the space of another transaction which pays a higher fee. As so, those Satoshis may never get into circulation.

I assume this will occur way earlier than the last reward era. Whenever the block reward becomes lower than the equivalent in fees for the coinbase transaction, the miner would prefer not to create those new Sats.

Not necessarily a bad thing. Those Sats never put in circulation will very slightly increase scarcity. However, we may reach 0% inflation way earlier than we think.",1634413696,45,1

Last night I watched a video by a successful price predictor of bitcoin (I think PlanB is his name on youtube), who is bullish on bitcoin long term but thinks the price will again crash 80% before taking off again and eventually reaching 100s of thousands of dollars.

I set a stop limit sell order at 60k because I don‚Äôt want to deal with another crash, even if it goes up. It will be tough on my nerves. I do believe in bitcoin long term. If my stop order executes then I would wait until the price goes down further before buying again. Are stop orders like this a good idea, or does someone have another strategy?

""Bitcoin is a scam.""  
""Only idiots invest in Bitcoin.""  
""Bitcoin has no intrinsic  value.""

... so on and so forth.

I'm the founder of a web development agency and I fell into the Bitcoin rabbit hole. I'm still down there and I've got no plans of coming out.

In March 2021 I decided to develop a website with the goal of educating the crypto-curious. What started as a side-project became a full-time job. We launched two weeks ago. I'm just getting started.

I'm battling the bitter and confused boomer army on Seeking Alpha and various other places. I use logic reasoning, facts &amp; nothing else. It's a bitter battle, but one I'm willing to take on.

Bitcoin is life-changing disruption and financial freedom for everyone. It has become THE raison-d'√™tre for me. 

The only thing I want is to open the doors to as many people as possible regarding Bitcoin &amp; crypto in general.

Check out [https://www.temu.land](https://www.temu.land) and tell me what you think. It's a labour of love, completely free &amp; will stay that way.

They have been pictured in numerous articles as a physical representation of Bitcoin, and have withstood the test of time with over $2.7bn of BTC still loaded on them. To this day I have people reach out to me asking how to purchase them and I have always recommended Bitcointalk collectibles section. The problem with this is that it requires the use of different escrows, reliance on the forum trust system, and dealing with shipping and hoping the buyer doesn't dispute receiving it or risking meeting up in person. This has prevented numerous sales and led to this massive market being quite illiquid even though almost every Bitcoin enthusiast I know wanting to own one. For the last six months I've been working with 4K to support Bitcoin collectibles starting with Casascius coins. They started with watches and sneakers but to me it was obvious that Casascius coins were a great fit. Today the Casascius marketplace has launched and I am so excited to bring attention back to these unique pieces of Bitcoin history!

The flippening is ‚Äòinevitable‚Äô

With the emergence of NFTs, along with decentralized finance (DeFi) technology ‚Äî something that ParaFi Capital made a lot of money from ‚Äî Santos is bullish on the underlying platform: Ethereum. And even more so than bitcoin.¬†

‚ÄúFor a long time the narrative has been very bitcoin-centric, that this is a hedge against macro, against inflation and all this stuff,‚Äù Santos says. But he doesn‚Äôt see this as a strong thesis, and doesn‚Äôt agree with the notion that bitcoin has established itself as a store of value. It took gold centuries to do that, he points out.

Santos says that in a lot of his conversations with large allocators of capital, they don‚Äôt talk about bitcoin but ask about Ethereum and the Web3 world. ‚ÄúWhen you invest with that mindset, there‚Äôs way more capital looking to invest in technology rather than hedge macro through bitcoin.‚Äù

As a result, he believes the so-called flippening ‚Äî the moment where ether‚Äôs market cap overtakes bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äî is inevitable. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say, with a 90% probability that it happens within the next three years.‚Äù

Santos says he reached out to a few large funds and asked them how they were positioned. He says they have grown their exposure to Ethereum meaningfully ‚Äî a radically different change from a year ago. He adds that some of them don‚Äôt even hold bitcoin.

‚ÄúIncreasingly it‚Äôs become harder to justify holding bitcoin because it doesn‚Äôt have any utility to me. Whereas I have this piece of ETH or SOL, I could interact and use it for so many different things.‚Äù",1634837961,24,1

qcwifn,Alice_11111,A U.S. public pension fund has invested in bitcoin for the first time.," 

The pension fund for Houston's firefighters, the Houston Firefighters' Relief and Retirement Fund (HFRRF), [announced](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/houston-firefighters-relief-and-retirement-fund-announces-bitcoin-purchase-1030886049) today that it had purchased bitcoin for the defined benefit plan's portfolio, making it the first announced investment in BTC by a public pension fund in the U.S.

""This investment represents a watershed moment for bitcoin and its place in public pensions,"" said Nate Conrad, global head of asset management at NYDIG. ""Fiduciaries are increasingly aware of how even a small allocation to digital assets can make a big impact over time, and they now have a partner in NYDIG who can help them make it happen.""

HFRRF acquired BTC and another cryptocurrency in a $25 million purchase facilitated by the institutional bitcoin services provider NYDIG, who will also provide custody services to the pension fund, *Bloomberg* [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/houston-pension-buys-crypto-an-asset-we-could-not-ignore?srnd=cryptocurrencies). NYDIG has set up a private fund, which it will manage, to acquire and custody the assets on behalf of HFRRF.

‚ÄúI see this as another tool to manage my risk,‚Äù Ajit Singh, the chief investment officer for the fund, told *Bloomberg*. ‚ÄúIt has a positive expected return and it manages my risk. It has a low correlation to every other asset class.‚Äù

HFRRF plans to nourish the partnership with NYDIG going forward to allow its over 6,600 benefactors to leverage the suite of bitcoin-focused services provided by NYDIG's full-stack platform. HFRRF benefactors include active and retired firefighters and survivors of firefighters.

 The purchase marks the first-ever bitcoin investment by a public pension in the U.S., which has the potential to benefit HFRRF members significantly over the long run if BTC continues to appreciate against the dollar as it has for the entirety of its lifetime.",1634836221,45,1

qcviqt,OutrageousBet5586,JPMorgan Chase warns that Bitcoin ETF boom may distort the market and increase investor costs,"Before the first game-changing Bitcoin-linked ETF in the United States, many people on Wall Street warned that, given its cost of holding, such derivatives-driven transactions were not a free lunch.

&amp;#x200B;

Just two days after the Bitcoin ETF went public, JPMorgan Chase‚Äôs strategists warned that the release of pent-up demand for Bitcoin ETFs could distort the futures market and increase the cost of ETF investors.

&amp;#x200B;

This is an urgent issue. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (code: BTIO) is one of the most successful ETF listings in history. In just two days, the purchase amount of investors reached 1.1 billion U.S. dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem, however, is the cost of renewing the contracts held by the fund. JPMorgan Chase strategists Bram Kaplan and Marko Kolanovic pointed out that in October and November Bitcoin futures contracts, BITO alone accounted for a quarter of open positions, but more Bitcoin ETFs will emerge.

&amp;#x200B;

""If these products accumulate a large amount of assets, the holding cost of such futures may be higher,"" Kaplan and Kolanovic wrote in Thursday's report. ""They will further push up the futures curve relative to the spot price and the cost of contract rollover, leading to greater holding costs.""

&amp;#x200B;

Strategists stated that since mid-2019, the average annualized rollover cost between the second month and the first month of Bitcoin futures has been about 9%. The cost between the fourth and second futures is about 8%.

&amp;#x200B;

JPMorgan Chase stated that this means that the holding cost of an ETF based on Bitcoin futures may be several times higher than the management fee for the product. As far as BTO is concerned, the expense ratio is 0.95%.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many other funds in the pipeline. Although they will be actively managed funds that can theoretically be traded at different points on the futures curve, Kaplan and Kolanovic claim that they are similar to volatility exchange-traded products, which have expanded to such an extent that they start to push up their own costs. .

&amp;#x200B;

""The more long positions an investor holds, the higher the cost of holding that position due to the ETP's own influence on the market,"" the two wrote.",1634833393,20,1

Probably not the best time to be questioning crypto however forgetting the latest price action and all the potential profit we have made what‚Äôs the difference between fiat and crypto?
I have owned several different Crypto over the past few years  but lately I‚Äôve been thinking what‚Äôs the real difference?  
It‚Äôs not as if it‚Äôs real like gold or silver. 
Does that mean that technically Crypto is just another form of Fiat currency or investment?
But even less so because it is not physical?
Does anyone do real physical work like build a house or make cars and stuff and actually get paid in Crypto? 
For sure some do I guess. 
Am I missing the whole point of Cryptocurrency?
What is the point of owning Crypto?
Certainly it has been great from an investment pov but that‚Äôs not why it was created as far as I can tell. 
So far I don‚Äôt see a real difference between Crypto and fiat currency printed by governments. 
I think eventually the real value will be found in the programming behind it, ie; blockchain.",1634833153,17,1

qcvdg9,garison,Been working on a simple and to the point Bitcoin description.,"Bitcoin is a very simple thing. It‚Äôs money that cannot be printed by people who want to create more out of thin air. It cannot be stolen from anyone who has it, provided they keep their private keys private. The reason the price seems to go up endlessly is because there is a finite amount, so the more people that discover it and buy it and hold it, the less is available, and so the price people are willing to pay also rises.

The only power bitcoin literally takes from the government is that it‚Äôs a better money for hardworking people to hold than the government‚Äôs money is, because it appreciates in value rather than depreciates.

Bitcoin is on a four year halving cycle. Every four years, the amount of bitcoin that enters the market every ten minutes gets cut in half. So far, bitcoin has halved only THREE times. We‚Äôre only just realized bitcoin is on a pattern with these halvings, and the price will likely continue to go up with each halving. There will be a total of 32 halvings, and at that point the block mining reward will become zero. So we‚Äôre only 3 out of 32 halvings in so far, and look what bitcoin has done. We‚Äôre so incredibly lucky to be here and discovering it during this time.

Bitcoin incentives people to discover it early and rewards them for doing so. This is what people mean when they say it uses ‚Äúgame theory‚Äù. It‚Äôs more rewarding to participate in bitcoin by buying and holding, than it is to not do so. If you buy $5k worth and Elon musk buys $5B, and the price doubles, both you and Elon musks wallet becomes twice as valuable as before.. it doesn‚Äôt discriminate, there‚Äôs no loop holes. That makes it fair in my opinion.

Someday, if everyone prefers bitcoin to government fiat, the government won‚Äôt be able to print money anyone will want anymore, so they‚Äôll just have to get their money from taxing only, rather than taxing + printing money out of thin air.

* A U.S. public pension fund has invested in bitcoin for the first time.
* The Houston Firefighters' Relief and Retirement Fund acquired an undisclosed amount of BTC through institutional bitcoin services provider NYDIG.
* The investment ""represents a watershed moment for bitcoin and its place in public pensions,"" the global head of asset management at NYDIG said.

The pension fund for Houston's firefighters, the Houston Firefighters' Relief and Retirement Fund (HFRRF), announced today that it had purchased bitcoin for the defined benefit plan's portfolio, making it the first announced investment in BTC by a public pension fund in the U.S.

""This investment represents a watershed moment for bitcoin and its place in public pensions,"" said Nate Conrad, global head of asset management at NYDIG. ""Fiduciaries are increasingly aware of how even a small allocation to digital assets can make a big impact over time, and they now have a partner in NYDIG who can help them make it happen.""

HFRRF acquired BTC and another cryptocurrency in a $25 million purchase facilitated by the institutional bitcoin services provider NYDIG, who will also provide custody services to the pension fund, *Bloomberg* reported. NYDIG has set up a private fund, which it will manage, to acquire and custody the assets on behalf of HFRRF.

‚ÄúI see this as another tool to manage my risk,‚Äù Ajit Singh, the chief investment officer for the fund, told *Bloomberg*. ‚ÄúIt has a positive expected return and it manages my risk. It has a low correlation to every other asset class.‚Äù

HFRRF plans to nourish the partnership with NYDIG going forward to allow its over 6,600 benefactors to leverage the suite of bitcoin-focused services provided by NYDIG's full-stack platform. HFRRF benefactors include active and retired firefighters and survivors of firefighters.",1634832645,11,1

All technologies that completely changed the world.  

Bitcoin was dependent on a lot of technologies maturing for it to even be possible.  But its changing the world of finance for the better.  Its lifting the poor out of poverty.  Its going to prevent the ruling elite from continuing to steal our savings.  And there's nothing they can do about it...  We all see it.  We're just waiting for it mass adoption to watch it play out.

But what is the next big thing?  Is the concept of decentralized consensus going to be another building block?

I'm predicting that this is going to revolutionize government next.  We don't need a middle man to centralize our value and rule over us.  While a representative democracy was the best thing available at the time, we all see the problems - and the blatant fraud - that take place daily.

There will be many issues to work out.  For instance, there are issues with letting everyone have an equal vote.  A true democracy is letting 2 wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for dinner...

qaptiu,notarealguy2020,How come bitcoin's code doesn't reward node creation? And other questions.,"From my understanding, for a bitcoin transaction to work, the transaction must be processed, meaning that the request is sent to the blockchain, confirmed, and then recorded in the blockchain. This process is called mining, and the miners associated with receiving, processing, and confirming the transaction receive fees as well as rewards that are built into Bitcoin's code. This is laid out in the whitepaper. [https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

However, the whitepaper does not refer to ""miners,"" it refers to nodes. In my understanding, nodes are different than miners. Nodes are a place that helps computers exchange data and connect to other servers, and other crypto currencies [reward node creation while also relying on Proof of Work.](https://www.presearch.io/vision.pdf)

Is this a different usage? Has the language around crypto developed to where the usage of ""node"" in the BTC whitepaper is now used to describe something completely different?

Is it possible to set up a BTC node that is not mining, but just taking information and broadcasting it to workers, thereby strengthening and securing the system?

Also, there are other concerns. If running a node is truly beneficial to the blockchain, [as suggested here,](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/six-reasons-you-should-run-bitcoin-node) why doesn't the code reward someone who hosts a node but does not mine?

People who passed away around 2008 and earlier never even got a chance to accumulate Bitcoin. People born today and after will get a chance, but they will be forever envious because through no fault of their own, they were just not around to get a bigger piece of the Bitcoin pie. They will be relegated to amounts less than 1 whole Bitcoin (some people are even today). Or conceivably be relegated to amounts less that 0.1 BTC. They will wish they born just a bit earlier to be around closer to the beginning. Not to mention those born 2050, 2075, etc‚Ä¶ they will be relegated to even less.

What do you think they would think of people who had a whole coin or more, who were willy nilly trading it around, losing fractions of coins most of the time? What would they think of people who sold altogether hoping to catch a lower price later on? They would do anything to have been where we are in history and we squandered it due to our greed or fear. 

Is there a chance, we know not what we do when we sell? We are in a point in time that will never come again and we are playing with fire during that time, instead of being grateful that we are here and holding on for dear life. For if we are wrong, then we join the legions who have come and went. But if we are right, we cement a unique place in history and society‚Ä¶ the hodlers who never gave it. The ones who have what other generations could never have. Why toy around and risk that?

So, after I'd notified the fourth or fifth person who posted too much in their history (e.g. location, holdings in r/FIRE, photos of their face, and in two cases, information suitable for extortion), I took a hard look at my own profile, and my (old) user name could be traced to other accounts with even more data.

qal0kl,Hot-Lengthiness-7280,Future IPFS Distributed Storage sends data and both parties use FileCoin to settle.,"Future IPFS Distributed Storage sends data and both parties use FileCoin to settle.

The IPFS network has a high requirement for data storage, which requires hard disks distributed all over the world to work together as nodes and storage spaces. Therefore, IPFS has designed a set of rules to motivate users to store -- the Filecoin protocol -- and released a token: FIL. FIL can be obtained when you help with IPFS network storage files.

In the future, Internet life will be inextricably linked to storage needs, and Filecoin will become an indispensable hard currency in the market, like water, electricity, and gas.

What are IPFS and Filecoin?

IPFS is a network protocol, and Filecoin is a non-central storage scheme based on IPFS. In short, the relationship between IPFS and Filecoin is just like the relationship between bitcoin and blockchain. IPFS is a point-to-point network, and it is well known that the faster participants in P2P networks are downsized. Therefore, IPES requires a large number of nodes to participate. But without a good incentive mechanism, everyone would not be willing to contribute their own hard disk and bandwidth resources, at this time, Filecoin as an incentive system to show the importance of the. Today, Filecoin has become a typical application under the IPFS protocol, forming a tight symbiotic relationship that will be difficult to develop without one side.

When does Filecoin start ICO?

Filecoin is the first blockchain ICO to be overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Securities and Exchange Commission, an independent quasi-judicial body under the federal government, oversees and regulates U.S. securities, the highest in the U.S. securities industry.

In just 30 minutes, the ICO ended on August 10, 2017, raising $257 million, a world record for blockchain project financing. Filecoin was originally valued at $2 billion, while the official fundraising price was $0.75 per piece (private crowdfunding costs $0.75 to $30).

How is digital money issued?

The Filecoin team gave 70% of the Token to the miners in good faith.

The filecoin issue totaled 2 billion for 60 years. Based on investor choice, the Filecoin Economic White Paper (P9) notes that FIL is expected to have a supply of between 0 and 380 million units available in the first year.

Miners who put in early have an advantage over other miners who put in late.

How do I get Filecoin? Filecoin is currently available in two ways:

File-coin is available in all the digital currency exchanges in the world. The cost of obtaining FIL by this method is high.

Make a miner out of your spare hard drive/bandwidth and dig. This is the lowest cost way to obtain FIL currency at this stage.

Being a miner on the IPFS is better than being a miner, because the crowdfunding sold only 10% of the tokens, the protocol labs sold 15%, the Filecoin Foundation sold 5%, and the remaining 70% was miners.

Why is mining the best way to invest in Filecoin?

Investment in IPFS mining machine through mining access to digital currency, its cost is much lower than the market investment, for its profit to provide the first layer of protection;

Because the total circulation of Filecoin money is limited and users are not restricted, the supply market is much smaller than the use market, so prices will continue to rise. The recycling of IPFS miners, coupled with the huge demand for recycling, has resulted in the secondary protection of wealth appreciation. Issued once a year, rising demand, supply decreasing year by year.

Why is it more beneficial to reclaim land earlier?

Take Bitcoin. In 2013, each $1,299-worth of Avalon miners was able to dig up 375 Bitcoins a day, earning $200 ,000 a day. In 2019, the M20S, a 16,800 yuan Shenma miner, could dig up only 0.0023 bitcoins a day, compared with a daily profit of just $125.57.

Over the next three years, $20 billion of storage and retrieval needs will need to be shifted to the Filecoin network, where 650 million FELEs are in circulation, a three-fold premium to the $92.2 expected by the market.

As the FIL price rises, the amount of FIL pledge required for unit service value falls, so the earlier you intervene, the greater the chance.

Will filecoin go up or down like air coins, affecting earnings?

No. The reason is nothing more than two: 1, banker manipulation of stock prices, 2, individual investors with the wind and panic. This situation does not exist in Filecoin, and even if prices fall, it will not affect our miners' earnings, because our miners' earnings come from the Internet and from blockchain companies such as eos, im-token, and other large blockchain companies. And the secondary market speculation is not much to do, the rise is good for us, but once again fell, it will not fall to the lowest point.

Why do we say that Filecoin is real money?

Since the value of IPFS has been realized and more and more Internet companies and blockchain companies use IPFS for storage and development, these companies will have to buy up Filecoin to pay the miners, and the price will go up!

Global Intelligence made further dynamic predictions on the FIL expected pricing model, based on the size and growth of the storage and traffic industry, as well as FIL's earnings forecasts for the next three years, and on the FIL expected pricing model

Can filecoin surpass bitcoin?

Bitcoin is only a digital asset, its characteristics determine its limitations, it can be said that the highest value of Bitcoin is only a ""consensus."" With the advent of 5G era, the demand for data storage is also growing, enterprises, governments and individuals of data storage demand is also growing.

The new IPFS network uses more advanced technology. So Filecoin will continue to add value as well, and surpassing Bitcoin is not a dream! Therefore, seize the pulse of the times, into the blockchain, and combined with their own actual situation to participate in it, so that our future will be better.

So I started working more, took some side gigs and sold some stuff to finally own one full btc in July at $33k. But being a newbie in the space I became victim of all the FUDs and sold it at 30k just a few days before Elon, Cathy and Jack‚Äôs video conference. After that I tried to trade stocks with my $30k and it didn‚Äôt go well. Then I started trading btc but then I again panicked sold them on sept 7 during El Salvador adoption dip.

qacp4o,samdane7777,The Bitcoin Only Alternative To Censored Infrastructure,"Let's talk about some misconceptions.

What we really want is a decentralized infrastructure with bitcoin as the payment rails. This has been consistently thwarted by states and governments going on their censorship warpath. Bitcoin is decentralized but the internet is very very centralized, the finance backrails to the economy are hyper centralized. 

The current finance and internet structure are literally just warehouses full of computers owned by oligarchs with real time monitoring by intelligence agencies. Thats effectively what China's Great Fire wall is, and ours are just a few multinational corporations doing the same. The Cloud is just a billionaires warehouse.

There's a misconception that blockchains and blockchain technology must be a financial ledger, but this is not actually what blockchains are. Blockchains are simply indexed databases that are immutable. There's no reason to make this constant conflation, and thus no reason, no good reason to not use layer 2 bitcoin as the payment rails to interact with non-financial blockchains.

For the hardcore bitcoiner, there's a misunderstanding about non-financial blockchains. There are many reasons for censorship resistent blockchains that contain things such as user meta data, identity, purchase history, shipment, freight, geolocation, virtual proxy networks, servers, storage, DNS, loan agreements, company balance sheets, search history, mortgages, refinancing, interest and savings. You get the idea.

The reason non-financial blockchains are needed, is to protect those aformentioned things from state level attacks. Period. You don't need to use other money for payment rails, but you need this technology or you remain vulnerable to constant state coercion from things like China's Great Fire Wall or our Nsa dragnets.

Now granted, integrating RSK smart contracts and lightning bitcoin correctly with non-financial blockchains and oracles that behave as virtual machines will be some of the most daunting cryptographic work undertaken, but it must be done. But the main hangup with the Bitcoin community has been the idea that the bitcoin blockchain would be the sole basis of the smart contracts. This simply isn't the logical engineering choice. The logical choice is to integrate lightning networks and actual bitcoin RSK smart contracts --with seperate non-financial blockchains and oracles that are able to give us the distributed DNS, distributed domain, distributed server power, distributed virtual machine, distributed front ends/websites/browsers/vpns/storage. 

You don't want the state or some loser billionaire corporation like facebook to take your server, your website, your data, your domain, your loan agreement, your computation power to your smart contracts down, You don't want your infrastructure to be on AWS..so build the alternative.",1634521669,5,1

By the way, what is written on the billboard is just:

Is not even something about a store that accepts bitcoin or a service like some local exchange, no, is just about Bitcoin.

I wanted to share some trading strategies which have been reasonably successful for me over the last few years. All these strategies are delta-neutral, meaning you are not exposed to the underlying price of bitcoin, or any other underlying asset. If you want to try any of these out, you can use my affiliate link to get $100 of free bitcoin when you sign up to BitMEX: www\[dot\]bitmex\[dot\]com/register/B9jEO8

\## 1. Simple Carry Trade

\* Use it when futures trade at a significant premium to spot (fixed interest rate)

\* Buy N BTC at spot price P

\* Sell NxF futures contracts at price F (where each contract is worth $1)

\* Unwind the trade at expiry (see specific settlement procedures for contracts traded)

\* Your profit will be equal to (F-S)xN (potentially +/- small difference associated with how closely you can match the settlement price of the futures)

\## 2. Swap vs. Spot Trade

\* Use it when the funding rate on perpetual swap is positive (floating interest rate)

\* Buy N BTC at spot price P

\* Sell NxP' perpetual swap contracts at price P' (where each contract is worth $1)

\* Unwind the trade when you believe the funding rate will turn negative

\* Your profit will be equal to the total net swap funding payments received

\## 3. Flattener Trade

\* Use it when the difference between the futures contract and swap contract price is too high (and ideally when the funding rate on the perpetual swap is negative)

\* Buy N perpetual swap contracts at price P' (where each contract is worth $1)

\* Sell Nx(F/P') futures contracts at price F (where each contract is worth $1)

\* This strategy will be profitable if the difference between the futures and swap prices shrinks quickly enough to offset the total net swap funding payments

\## 4. Steepener Trade

\* Use it when the difference between the futures contract and swap contract price is too low (and ideally when the funding rate on the perpetual swap is positive)

\* Sell N perpetual swap contracts at price P' (where each contract is worth $1)

\* Buy Nx(F/P') futures contracts at price F (where each contract is worth $1)

\* This strategy will be profitable if the difference between the futures and swap prices grows quickly enough to offset the total net swap funding payments

qa948j,filmrebelroby,Thoughts about Mark Cuban and Preston Pysh‚Äôs debate on spaces.,"Mark Cuban was promoting altcoins as a competition to Bitcoin from a venture capital/ technology perspective, but then agreeing that Bitcoin is a superior store of value without real competition at all. Preston described this as an eye-roll, and for me, it felt like a serious disconnect.

Does Mark not understand the concept of layered money?

I can see the short term viability of smart contract platforms and tokens as they get easier to use and more popular, but if Bitcoin is a superior store of value, I think that they will all fade away and become layer 2/ 3 protocols in the long term.  

Why would anyone want to transact inferior money, when there is a risk of inflation, centralized counter-party risk, or security venerability during the transaction/ period of their contract. Why would they hold inferior money in the interim when there is an easily accessible and superior store of value available. 

Also, although people won‚Äôt want to sell their bitcoin or give it up, but I think people will demand to be paid in it eventually. If they accept less bitcoin than fiat equivalent, wouldn‚Äôt that just drive the price up?

I think eventually all of this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù contact stuff will be built onto bitcoin and I think Mark Cuban is confused. Thoughts? Anyone hear this one?

That said, I wish they just kept the convo between Preston and Mark, too much interruption from others. Link:

Assumptions: BTC price is 60k, can borrow at 3x collateral for an interest rate of 5% a year

Situation: need 15k for university for a child 

Action: Borrow 20k using 1 btc as collateral (60k)
- Pay 1k interest a year, use 15k for university fee, 4k left to pay interest for the next 4 years

Assumption: 4 years later BTC goes up 50% (90k). Since you can borrow maximum a third of your collateral, the maximum amount to borrow now is 30k. You take another 5k out to pay interest in the next 4 years.

Rinse and repeat, as long as Bitcoin grows faster than the interest rate of 5% a year, you win from borrowing vs selling bitcoin, also not generating a sale tax from selling bitcoin.

I am a fairly big youtuber with over 3 million subscribers. I started earning 250-750k per year at 18 and am now 24. Across this time I managed to save over 2 million dollars by barely changing my living habits and investing most savings into the s&amp;p 500. 

Over the last 7 years, what I was doing felt safe, but still filled me with a degree of uncertainty. Being an economics major at university, I was very aware of inflation, and when I saw what started happening in March 2020, I became increasingly suspicious of our financial system. Money being printed, housing prices skyrocketing and stocks hitting all time highs - I knew this was asset inflation. 

So here I was, with a rock solid nest egg, enough to live very comfortably for a long, and I see a storm of erosion coming in to chip it away my savings. I decided to research EVERYTHING, and around last December, I finally fell on bitcoin. Sure it was new, and relatively risky, but from an economic standpoint, I was hooked on the idea of an inflationless, hyper fast asset. My gut felt good about it too. 

Over the next few months, I put half my net worth in; ~1 million dollars cad, at an avg buy in price of around 40k usd. It‚Äôs been a lot of ups and downs this year, but ultimately I have one thing to say:

Nothing has brought me more peace of mind, than owning bitcoin. I‚Äôm not bold enough to not hold other regular assets, but bitcoin brings me a sense of certainty that typical etf‚Äôs do not. I‚Äôm excited to see if we have a huge pop off bull run soon, but ultimately, that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm in this. Bitcoin can keep me financially independent and anything beyond that is just bonus. I‚Äôm so happy I got into this. Anyway much love, Let‚Äôs kill it, and feel free to ask me anything!

His situation:

* the country suffers from war since 2015
* high inflation (\~25-30% per year)
* bank withdrawals are limited to \~$100 per day
* widespread corruption
* high poverty (at least partially because of inflation), a lot of people are hungry and not able to afford enough food

International help is difficult because transport of goods is limited and it seems even many local humanitarian organizations are full of corruption, not to mention banks and governments grabbing for any money they can.

So, Bitcoin cannot solve the transportation problem, but it can get rid of corrupt intermediates if you manage to find a trustworthy local organization inside the target country that is able to exchange Bitcoin to food and other needed goods.

Billionaire supporters. Topics of massive debasement and price increases. Other countries talking about it. SEC head saying it won't be banned. Rumors of an ETF. Banks offering custody services.

Nope, and I‚Äôll prove it with free money.","I see quite a few posts/comments regularly from people wondering if a 24 word seed phrase can be guessed, hacked, brute forced, etc. So here's a simple proposition: **I'll give you a chance at free money.**

Don't believe me? Here's the challenge...

**I've deposited 10,000 sats into a wallet. You get to guess the seed phrase.**

To make it even easier, **I'm going to give you ALL of the words.**

That's right, I'm literally going to give you ALL of the seed words, in random order, for your guessing pleasure.

**Here they are:**

    chalk mimic crane marriage oxygen hood million clerk demand effort grid afford floor force december immense damp toss assume present retire cream clinic gown

All 24 of them right there.

But there's not actually BTC in there right? **WRONG**.

Go ahead and check the balance [HERE](https://www.blockonomics.co/#/search?q=zpub6s87mnPqX9jT5bWvKFz6ZLCrhQsPh275BXx45a9kRuXUYbcxhLYZCpzyP2TpuEWte9mDYMprJv6QwNtCd7D64PAQMj4kSdu1WSZRQL3exyk)

You've even got the zpub there to see all addresses for the wallet.

I'm not shitting you. The words are there. The free BTC is there.

Just go and get it right? RIGHT?

\--------------------------------------------------

**Now, if you want to find out why you're going to fail miserably at this, keep reading...**

Why is it near (and I mean neeeaaarrr) impossible for someone to be randomly assigned your words, or to be guessed by somebody else?

To find out, let's start with a worst case scenario, a head start if you will: **Somebody knows all of your 24 words, but not the exact order of them.**

You might think that's an INSANE advantage right? Let's see...

To find out how many ways you can order 24 words, we can use a factorial. A factorial is simply multiplying a number by all of the numbers below it, denoted by a ""!"" after the number.

4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24

So what's the factorial of 24?...

24! = 24 x 23 x 22 x 21... = **~620,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.**

That is **620 sextillion unique ways to order 24 words.**

To put that into perspective, the average high end gaming computer has a clock speed of 4GHz, meaning it can make 4 billion calculations per second.

620 sextillion / 4 billion = 155 trillion seconds.

155 trillion seconds / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365 = **4,915,017 years to find all permutations using a modern gaming PC.**

Unless they've got a quantum super-computer, nobody will simply guess, stumble upon, or brute force your seed phrase. **And this is knowing ALL of the words to begin with.**

Hell, even *with* a super computer it‚Äôll still take years to find.

If you don't know every single word for the phrase, go ahead and **multiply that number by 2,048!**.

Those are the REAL odds you have to worry about.

**TL;DR: You're screwed. Bwahahahahahahahahaha**",1633494919,509,185

q2cklk,Theta_mind1,I have lost all faith in bitcoin and crypto.,"Hi guys, I'm a long time crypto investor, and over the last few years, I have witnessed something appalling. 

Bitcoin and crypto itself, had an original vision. That vision was to provide people financial freedom, privacy, and decentralized capacity. 

It was a brilliant vision. Freedom was available for a brief moment. Then, out of nowhere, everyone suddenly began chanting regulation, regulation, regulation. As if regulation would somehow make freedom more free.

In the last few years, I've watched as every exchange that never once required KYC, now brings out new KYC rules and spouts it as if its the best thing to happen to crypto.  Everything regarding crypto to fiat is now surveillance friendly. We may still be able to move between cryptos without a name or KYC attached, but getting to fiat is next to impossible.

Unless you can find a cash buyer, which used to be easy on localbitcoin, which now requires KYC, you're out of luck. I do not know of a single way to get crypto to fiat, without KYC, or without sketchy backdoor meetings that might go wrong. 

They have eliminated reloadable credit/debit cards, all exchanges dealing with fiat need KYC. P2P for fiat has been all but decimated. 

I will be in mexico soon, and from what I can tell, there's a grand total of 12 bitcoin ATMS across the whole country. 

It appears to me, that despite how popular crypto appears to be, no one is using it, no one is interested in it, and no one even understands it. 

For the life of me, I cannot understand how Bitcoin is appealing to anyone when you have to KYC to use it. It's hypocritical. I have lost all faith in it. I don't see a point in having a decentralized currency ruled by centralized on/off ramps. That's not the vision bitcoin stood for.  Yet here we are, happily KYCing our bitcoin. 

If anyone does know of any innovation that has not been destroyed on the bitcoin to fiat front, I'd love to hear about it, because right now, honestly, I'm just gonna stick with cash, because cash is still private. Bitcoin may still make people money, good for them. But to me, bitcoin is dead. As is the rest of the crypto space. Prove me wrong. It's been a long 5 years in the this space only to realize it was never the freedom it once promised, but the same prison we all want to escape.",1633492497,82,0

I also realize that my last concern really may not be a legitimate concern since a vote for Bitcoin is really just a vote against a fiat currency and the way it's being devalued by politicians but when enough people move money from stocks and property to Bitcoin it should have the effect of making the economy less productive.

‚ÄãLast week, I stumbled upon an old Medium post from venture capitalist Chris McCann. The venture capitalist took a look at the data and concluded that, in 2018, we were early to Bitcoin.

Are we still there? Are we still following the same trend of exponential growth?

I revisited and updated the graphs to find out:  


**Bitcoin Wallet Address Growth**

The first metric: unique Bitcoin wallet addresses. The amount of total Bitcoin wallets today is closing in on 900 million. In May 2018, the number was about 398 million, which, in turn, forty months before was about 60 million.

https://preview.redd.it/pz9ncaayngr71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b42080a908c125a5810f97351e79e90ae9484c8

So growth is slowing somewhat, although if we compare it to overall internet adoption, it‚Äôs tracking closely, as the rate of internet user growth leveled off over time as well.

It was in the 12th year of public use that the internet crossed one billion users, while Bitcoin is closing in on a billion addresses in its 13th year.

Then again, an address is not equivalent to a user, so it‚Äôs a bit more of a toss-up. Still, a doubling in three years is nothing to scoff at.

&amp;#x200B;

**Active Bitcoin Addresses:**

So how many of those addresses are actually active (that is, have sent or received any quantity of Bitcoin on a given day)? 

Take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/fyroytt1ogr71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ca5094dd6f2bd62aa0a969a9a771bd97b7ac86f

For Bitcoin, two new peaks were reached in January and May of 2021 at approximately 1.25 million active wallets per day. The previous local peak was approximately 1.1 million in late 2017. Things in late 2017 looked to be going parabolic until transactions dropped down to 500,000/day in early 2018.

To me, this graph reflects on some of the transactional limitations related to Bitcoin. While there are definitely solutions to some of the volume-related problems surrounding Bitcoin, it‚Äôs possible that the slowing growth is correlated.

While it‚Äôd be impossible to collect the data for all cryptocurrencies, I‚Äôd postulate that growth is quite a bit higher for crypto as a whole. With 12,000 different cryptocurrencies in existence, however, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to do the math.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lightning Network Capacity:**

Addressing the volume limitations I touched on earlier is the Lightning Network, a system of nodes that allows Bitcoin transactions to be settled nearly instantaneously. Below is a graph of the lightning network's capacity. The red line is the capacity in $BTC, the blue its capacity in dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f5sgeq86ogr71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2ceb062ae4fd50186dcccc5908619ecf3e91544

This is the most bullish news for Bitcoin we've come across in this set of graphs. Lightning nodes cost time, effort, and money to operate, and if node operators weren't making money, they wouldn't set these nodes up.

This graph looks to be nearing parabolic levels, and it spells good news for crypto. It's impossible to say if this network will be immediately adopted or have a crazy high volume of transactions, but the node operators, who are the biggest stakeholders in this network, seem to be quite optimistic.

&amp;#x200B;

**So...Are We Early?**

In 2018, many graphs pointed to Bitcoin taking the same path as the internet to complete world domination. Today, though, it‚Äôs harder to have that same level of optimism.

While at this point, we know Bitcoin won‚Äôt be quicker to worldwide adoption than the internet, at this point in time, it's on a good track to eventually get there.

Here‚Äôs what we can state with certainty:

1. Growth in the Bitcoin world has slowed down.
2. Things have never been so bullish for Bitcoin.
3. It's increasingly unlikely that bitcoin price action will have the 10x, 50x, and 1000x potential of previous cycles.

While McCann in 2018 could fairly compare the growth of crypto and bitcoin to the growth of the internet as a whole, perhaps today, making that comparison is a little too optimistic.",1633365384,10,1

I couldn‚Äôt find great compiled data on total exchange user growth over time, but we can use volume to understand how much money flows through crypto markets. ‚Äã

While this graph roughly traces Bitcoin price activity, we can see that higher highs have a multiplying effect on exchange volume: a total crypto market cap doubling leads to about 3 times as much exchange activity. For evidence of this, check out Jan 2018 vs. Jun 2021.  


**Total Adoption by User Rates:**

One of the most fascinating parts of Chris McCann‚Äôs analysis was his comparison of crypto growth to internet growth. DeutscheBank has since done its own study of the blockchain vs. the internet, below. While this takes into account all crypto, we can't deny the fact that Bitcoin is the king of cryptos in terms of adoption and will represent a lions share of this activity.

https://preview.redd.it/zn0n6qrhigr71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18f60d5a7ea48290a158a535970813279c21f3fb

The first thing to note is that these two graphs exist on different axes and have already diverged. It is almost definitive now that crypto will grow slower than the internet, while in 2018 it was still a tossup as to which might grow faster.

But while crypto‚Äôs growth has been slower than the internet‚Äôs, the coefficient of that growth might be accelerating.

In their projections, DeutscheBank guessed that by 2030, total cryptocurrency users would cross 200 million. But today, in September, we sit at well over 220 million users by many estimates, fueled by a manic bull run.

The math shows that it‚Äôd be quite difficult for crypto‚Äôs overall user base to overtake the internet‚Äôs user base at an equivalent point in time. However, it looks quite possible that crypto crosses a billion users much sooner than expected and, well, that‚Äôd be pretty good news for Bitcoin's price.  


**So...Are We Early?**

In 2018, many graphs pointed to crypto taking the same path as the internet to complete world domination. Today, though, it‚Äôs harder to have that same level of optimism.

While at this point, we know crypto won‚Äôt be quicker to worldwide adoption than the internet, at this point in time, it's on a good track to eventually get there.

Here‚Äôs what we can state with certainty:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Growth in the Bitcoin/Crypto world has slowed down.
2. There are now over 200 million cryptocurrency users.
3. Things have never been so bullish for Bitcoin.
4. It's increasingly unlikely price action will have the 10x, 50x, and 1000x potential of previous cycles.

While McCann in 2018 could fairly compare the growth of crypto to the growth of the internet as a whole, perhaps today, making that comparison is a little too optimistic.  


**Where Can I Find 1000x Growth?**  
If you're looking for 1000x growth, the rest of the world of crypto might be worth exploring. DeFi, Yield Farming, small-cap altcoins, or decentralized governance could all represent new frontiers for crypto. I'm not saying it's for everyone. I'm not here to tell you Bitcoin isn't #1, but perhaps other asset classes are worth exploring.

I know this opinion might get downvoted here, but that data points to the idea Bitcoin growth has slowed somewhat (although it still has a much higher upside than other assets). But that's a good thing for the asset class in general: it means it's being adopted, it's real, it's here to stay.

Is the following possible? 
Is it a good idea? Could it be done differently/ better? 

A Decentralized 
Children‚Äôs Lunch Fund

A tip jar that anyone 
can anonymously 

put as little as 1 penny into and every morning lunch money funds are automatically distributed to wallets 
connected to the system. 

A No kyc , ‚Äúchild safe‚Äù mini wallet with a connected debit card. 
(Not sure if the strike api or Moon pay makes this possible?)

Max balance $3 (system keeps it at $3. New funds aren‚Äôt added everyday unless spent)

Like the black card of school lunch. But if it‚Äôs stolen/ or lost, no biggie because it‚Äôs max $3 and carries no sensitive info. 

My son has started kindergarten this year and I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about kids like him feeling hungry and it‚Äôs become clear to me through my research that many of the ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù in these spaces are just bloated organizations with CEOS making millions a year while the hunger increases. 

Makes my blood boil. Fuck it 
all man. These things are only concrete in our minds. I want to change this. Seems like I could do a more efficient job feeding kids, by myself, with no money, and just my access to this network ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è. 

I believe in Bitcoin and the lightning network and that it will naturally bring back so much generosity and hope to our lives. 

Price of btc is uninteresting, it will just go up and up, get over it üòú! But what starts to happen to us and our world/systems when the friction between our resources goes away? Eventually I believe/hope our generosity to one another is revealed and expanded in ways we can‚Äôt imagine. 

Being able to process hundreds of thousands of payments under $1 with no kyc and very little little fees is so underrated ha. 
I‚Äôm happy to be able to see it and be here at the start with you all  ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è

q16zik,SantiagoSchw,"Bitcoin changed my life, but in a different way","A couple of days ago, someone posted we needed more positivity in the sub, so I figured I'd shared my story. This is going to be kinda long, so I'll include a TL;DR at the end.

I'm from Argentina, a rather poor country in South America. We've been having over 40% yearly inflation for four or five years now, and although it's not as bad as Venezuela for example, it's still pretty bad.

No one with a moderate education in Argentina trusts in the government or any other institutions for that matter. We know they are corrupt as hell, that they take our money (Argentina has the highest taxes in the region, and one of the highest in the world) to finance their lifestyle and that there's nothing we can do. What is more, they are completely inept. I mean, every politician steals, but some of them still do their jobs. They still win elections, though, as they give away free money through assistance plans. In a country with over 50% poverty, 70% child poverty, and where most people are uneducated, that wins a ton of votes.

Over the last year, Argentina has seen their politicians:

* [Distribute drugs on public ambulances](https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/policiales/2020/08/29/simulaban-ser-medicos-y-repartian-droga-en-una-ambulancia-hay-cuatro-detenidos/) (in a partnership with a local drug lord, of course).
* [Have sex during a virtually-held congress debate](https://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20200925/483648923058/diputado-argentina-manosea-pechos-pillado-congeso-video.html).
* Our president has criticized Sweden's approach to the pandemic to save his ass. Argentina has [been declared the worst country to handle the pandemic](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/coronavirus/segun-ranking-bloomberg-argentina-peor-pais-pasar-pandemia-covid-19.phtml), while Sweden was one of the best worldwide.
* During the quarantine, [some people had to see their kids and parents die](https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2020/08/21/murio-solange-la-joven-enferma-de-cancer-que-no-pudo-despedirse-de-su-padre-en-cordoba/) because they wouldn't let them travel to the hospital for covid-restrictions (which are supposed to protect health). Meanwhile, the president was privately receiving [visits from the country's top models](https://elintransigente.com/2021/07/escandalo-por-reiteradas-visitas-de-una-modelo-a-alberto-fernandez-en-la-quinta-de-olivos-en-plena-madrugada/) and [hosting exclusive parties in the presidential residence](https://www.infobae.com/politica/2021/08/27/fiesta-en-olivos-alberto-fernandez-fue-tapa-del-financial-times-por-las-fotos-del-cumpleanos-en-plena-cuarentena/).

These are only ‚Äîa few‚Äî examples, but you get the idea. Argentina is a joke, and many citizens ‚Äîmyself included‚Äî believe it's a failed country. That there's no turning back.

I discovered bitcoin at the very start of the pandemic, Q1 2020. The government in Argentina doesn't let people buy foreign currency, so we're stuck with the worthless peso. But crypto is free to acquire, so I'd said what the hell. I bought in at $9k. The timing couldn't be better.

I educated myself, learned about HODL, about the fundamentals. I remember thinking that Satoshi must have lived in Argentina because it solves literally every problem we have. Inflation, corruption, transparency, negligence. Everything.

I automatically fell in love with the concept of Bitcoin and the crypto industry. I kept buying every time I could (I never traded., Don't know how. I just buy and hold, and never sold even a single sat). I also started writing in blogs and forums. I enjoyed it so much that I decided I wanted to make a living out of it. I wanted to help Bitcoin win. I know first-hand what Bitcoin can do for people, for my fellow Argentines, and I wanted to help make that happen. And I was lucky enough I found a company that trusted in me to do that.

Now, I have a full-time job writing about Bitcoin and mining. It's hard, I'm not gonna lie. Sometimes I get heavily overwhelmed by imposter syndrome (English is my third language), but I keep trying anyway, and they are great and very patient with me. I post my articles here sometimes, and you're always my main source of traffic (thanks a lot for that!).

I make 9x what I did working 45 hours a week in Argentina. I get paid in crypto. F\*cking hell, I'm even thinking of buying a house, something I couldn't even consider less than 2 years ago.

I have plans to leave Argentina for Europe next year. I'm currently in Italy getting my citizenship, then I have to turn back to get my stuff, and then I'll return to Italy, gone for good. Bitcoin also helped me do that, as I have access to all my money in just a few clicks.

So to all of you guys out there, know that you don't need Bitcoin to do 1000x for it to change your life. What I put in Bitcoin is not a fortune, and even if I got in very yearly, I didn't make life-changing money. However, by getting into Bitcoin, I did make a life-changing decision.

\-

**TL;DR**

*I was stuck in a dead-end, low-paying job in a failed country. Bought bitcoin and, even if didn't make tons of money off my investment, I took great interest and found a job in the industry. Now I make 9x my former salary and I'm moving to Europe thanks to Bitcoin.*",1633359175,82,1

Details: In a tweet on Saturday, Balchunas wrote that Bitcoin Future ETFs filed under a 1940 law have a 75% chance of approval this month.

Numbers: Balchunas believes that there are 2-1 odds that ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF gets approved this month. Galaxy Bitcoin Strategy ETF has 50-1 odds, he writes.

Recent Events: On Friday, the SEC delayed its decision on whether or not Bitcoin ETFs would finally get approved.

Final Thoughts: A Bitcoin ETF would give investors exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to actually own the coins.

q1597d,UnitOfACattle,Kill Representative Democracy -- The Killer App?,"I've been theory crafting and came to a conclusion that blockchain -- with its current technological features --- could eradicate the centuries-old cancer tumor, Representative Democracy, which concentrates all voting power in the hands of few, and is the number one enabler of corruption, biased laws, and crony looting.

Proof-of-Work blockchain, on the base layer, can support a  daily vote of every Indian or Chinese, even ten times that, no problem.

What are your thoughts?

*A  public, open, but permissioned blockchain should be the new voting  system to implement Direct Democracy. One blockchain statewide  (citizenship required to participate), another blockchain for municipal  issues (residency card and an address in a certain area to participate). Can we at one day celebrate -- and tell to P.Schiff and N.Roubini -- that blockchain has a killer app?

Breaking the bottom is definitely impossible at present, and there is no signal of breaking the bottom at present in terms of the rebound amplitude and form. Of course, the bullish sentiment should not be too high. After all, the previous callback is still not small, so it is enough to continue the shock of the current structure. The market outlook is not clear, so take it one step at a time.

On the short-term side, the BTC contract in the day surged and fell back yesterday, which means that the strength in the back still needs to be matched by the form. On the short-term side, it oscillates or bottomed out. Operation strategy: the top touches the first empty space in the 48900 area, and the top breaks the 49300 area to retreat and adjust the warehouse. The target is the 47900-47700 area, and the bottom pays attention to the 47300-47200 areas and the 47000-46900 areas.

q9bryg,d-redze,What would happen if‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ What would help stupids like me keep it simple.,"  What would happen to bitcoin if everyone who had some right now started actually using it on a peer to peer level?  
  My buddy owes me a couple bucks, hey just send that in BTC. This is currently the main way I feel the need to use btc. At first I got into bitcoin for investing purposes; and while I still like it for that reason I am more and more finding impulses to use the currency as such. 
  The problems come in that none of my friends or me know how to even send each other crypto, even tho we all have coin base. On top of the lack of knowledge on a technical level the potential tax implications of use is also unknown, acting as another deterrent.  
 It‚Äôs know that YouTube can teach us how to use all this properly, yet most of us have our coin base app right next to the Robinhood app because they are the same thing to us. Not because the information is unavailable, but because it‚Äôs still misunderstood and honestly just inconvenient to get into.   
  I‚Äôm wondering if any of those with a good understanding of all the technology involved in this had any thoughts to share on easy ways for me and my friends to use crypto. Also what kind of things would you like to see in the future for crypto that would make it more ‚Äúuser friendly‚Äù

 Personal I‚Äôd appreciate it if coin base or other big platforms push more for the education of how to use these things rather then sell themselves as a stock trading app.",1634390067,6,1

q9baka,Independent-Neat-873,I like BTC. I dont love it but I like it.,"Reasons i like bitcoin: I like mathematics, i like thats its fixed to 21 million cap. I like that network is distributed by miners, i like proof of work, i like layer 2 scaling solutions such as RSK and lightning network. 

What annoys me about bitcoin maxis arguments is that they think it's going to fix everything. Yes bitcoin much better than fiat central bank debt based currencies and superior to gold. However, i think  Bitcoin maxis are blinded by greed and dont see the downsides to hyperbitcoinisation:

1) Stops people producing real goods and services as they can make more speculating on crypto curriencies. Creating even worse inflation, supply chain disruptions, food shortages, fuel shortages etc.

2) Only the the top 5% benefit from Bitcoin price appreciation as they have the abilty to take out low interest million dollar loans. You average joe broke 23 year old cannot take out any loan to buy more BTC. I can leverage trade which is very risky as my position can be liquidated transferring my BTC to top 5%.

3) Will create huge wealth inequality as the big bitcoin holders can afford to collateralise their Bitcoins and get stablecoins in return if they dont want to spend their btc. Average joe like myself can't afford to collateralise our holdings as we need to pay rent, food, heating, gym member ship. 

4) If bitcoin maxis plan on never selling their bitcoin (i understand why), how do expect to create a prosperous economy if you never willing to invest your BTC? There needs to be a circular flow of bitcoin in bitcoin standard or there will be huge wealth economy gaps. 

5) Anyone who refuses to use a smart phone out of personal choice in a bitcoin standard world, you will have to coerce these people to use bitcoin or they will be homeless. That goes against bitcoins ethos of being libertarian. Personally i hate smart phones, i sometimes wish i wasnt born in this smart phone/ social media age that has destroyed social  relationship dynamics between people. Created mini digital prisons for all of us in. But i still use my smart phone out of FOMO on social events, peer pressure, societal pressure to ""fit in"". 

6) History of Money myth that gold bugs and bitcoin maxis keep pushing: ""Money evolved from barter and trade"". Money did not come from Barter and Trade. Yes ancients bartered and traded goods with each other. But money was introduced in Ancient Sumerian times (5000 BC) by the ""Gods, Kings and priests"" at time to enslave humanity. Money is the best form of enslavement as the chains are invisible and blinds those who benefit from gaining/holding lots of money.

I recently entered cryptocurrencies world and as a lot of people i throw a lot of money in alts thinking i would be a millionaire soon. 

In this months i saw BTC going under 40k and i only  bought  500$ when it was at 41k, i could have bought more, newbie error. 

Most of the people who enter this world thinks that BTC train is gone so prefers to invest in Alts, which is totally ok imho as soon you pick innovative projects with good purposes. 

Finally, i understood that BTC is also a store of value, so i decided to start DCA, i'm buying everyday 5 or 10$ despite the price.

I live in south EU and pension system here is not the best, my job is not that good and i'm pretty sure i will never retire. 

I do think that if i start to DCA BTC i will build my own pension, i'm 33 years old.  I also find very useful thinking in SATS and not BTC. 

I know that no one can predict what will happen but at the moment i believe that this is the best thing i can do for my future.

q979i2,neeya0323,Why Bitcoin mining isn‚Äôt a waste of energy?,"The growing influence of Bitcoin in the world has attracted more and more supporters. But at the same time, criticism against Bitcoin has never stopped. Many people disapprove Bitcoin because they believe Bitcoin mining wastes too much energy, esp, electricity, whereas Bitcoin itself does not create any value.  


As far as I'm concerned, the POW model in Bitcoin mining is definitely not a waste of energy, but instead a storage of energy and value. That is the basis of the value of Bitcoin and the existence of Bitcoin.  


Ethereum has initially formed a complete ecology in the past five to six years, yet it didn't manage to withstand the pressure of all parties, finally choosing to convert the consensus mechanism from POW to POS and leaving Bitcoin the only one that sticks to POW. POW consumes energy on the surface, but in essence it stores energy and value. Now, let‚Äôs interpret the process from the perspective of physics. To begin with, the first law of thermodynamics.  


That law refers to energy protection and transformation in the field of thermal phenomena. It reflects the conservation of different forms of energy during transformation and conversion. The concrete expression is: the increase in the internal energy of an object is equal to the amount of heat absorbed by the object and the work imposed on the object. That is, heat can be transferred from one problem to another stage, or it can be converted into mechanical energy or other energies, but during that process, the total volume of energy remains unchanged. Its extension and essence is the famous ""law of conservation of energy"".  


The law of conservation of energy is one of the basic laws in nature. It is generally expressed like this: energy neither emerges out of the void nor disappears from nowhere. It only transforms from one form to another, or from one object to another, while the total amount always remains the same. If a system is in isolation, then it is impossible for energy or mass to pass into or out of the system. In this case, the law of conservation of energy is that the total energy of the isolated system stays fixed.  


In terms of time, space, matter and energy, human beings know a lot about energy, but also very little. Energy seems very mysterious, it's about the transformation of material movement. Everything in the world is in constant motion. Among all the attributes of matter, movement is the most basic one, and others are all the specific manifestations. Energy exists in diverse forms. According to the forms of movement, energy can be divided into electrical energy, nuclear energy, mechanical energy, chemical energy, thermal energy, radiation energy, light energy, biological energy, etc. These different forms of energy can be converted into each other through physical effects or chemical reactions.  


About energy, what mankind can do now is to continuously transform the energy in nature into energy that can be used by mankind through technology and into the momentum for the development of human society. In daily lives, oil and electricity impress us most. We refuel cars every day, turning the energy contained in the oil into the energy for running cars. We use electricity all the time to supply the normal operation of the entire human civilization. But electricity does not come out of the blue, but from the transformation of hydropower, wind energy, coal, oil, etc. Water and food supplement the energy humans need, otherwise death comes.¬†  


Bitcoin mining we are currently conducting is essentially a process of energy conversion. Firstly, water energy, wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy and so on are converted into electrical energy that mining machines need to participate in hash calculation, which forms computing power, entering the accounting work of Bitcoin, and then obtaining the Bitcoin reward. In the end, the energy of nature is stored in the form of Bitcoin, that is, the value is stored. Bitcoin mining is not free, it has cost, it needs to consume physical mining machines, it needs to consume energy. The energy consumption process is the process of energy transmission, being converted into stored Bitcoin, which happens to be the value support of Bitcoin. Based on this, no other cryptocurrency can replace Bitcoin.

I think there's a reason bitcoin is pulling away from the pack right now: we have hit an inflexion point and the killer app is finally here.  
It's not El Salvador. It's not Taproot. It's not Schnorr.  
It's tips!  
I received my first tip for a tweet I made at SXSW in 2015. The Winklevii were talking there and one of them (the taller one) said something about cash only being used by hipsters in the future. That struck a chord with me. I tweeted the qoute and received 0.001 BTC from someone who enjoyed the use of the term Winklevii. My mind was blown by this. I thought we were about to enter a new era of content creation. The ad networks were doomed.  
However, shortly after that, BTC started to become a victim of its own success as it came up against its scaling problem. Transaction fees became prohibitive, we got into arguments about block sizes, we had a hard fork, and the door was left open for tens of thousands of shitcoins to proliferate. All tip bots closed down. We entered the dark ages where the only thing to talk about was trading. The orginal mission was forgotten.  
Fast forward 6 years. The Winklevii will soon be right about cash. My tip is worth $62. We have the Lightning Network. It works!  
This is super exciting for me. I do think this is the killer app. Why? Because I am using it to achieve something that's not possible by any other means: rapidly testing terrible ideas!  
I have a lot of terrible ideas and have spent thousands finding out how bad they are. Much of that money went to Google Ads and more recently a lot of it went to Facebook, which is even more galling. All I wanted to do was get a few people to use a prototype or try out a new service. For those who've never experimented with PPC, you would not believe how expensive it can be to buy attention.  
But I can do it here. I will prove it. The first people to comment will receive a tip of 500 satoshis. Good comments will get even more!  
How much is 500 satoshis worth? Well, I will leave you to look that up for yourself. It depends where you're reading this. In some parts of the World, it's close to the minimum daily wage.  
I have allocated a budget of half a million satoshis for the fail-fast trial of my latest terrible idea, r/ShitcoinFantasyLeague, which may seem like a lot but it is a tiny fraction of what I'd have to spend testing it the old way. Plus, I can start testing at a much earlier stage.  
My idea may be terrible but my testing is genius!",1634366405,57,1

In the video, Ben points out how Bitcoin's price is increasing logarithmically and finds a relationship between the ATHs - namely their percentage increase gets cut by 0.454x each cycle. I am going to take his concept and expand it to price predictions over the next 30-ish years.

Take these predictions with a grain of salt; none of this is guaranteed to play out exactly as I describe and my predictions could end up being totally off once we actually hit these dates due to trend changes. These predictions assume that Bitcoin maintains its dominance in the crypto space over the next 30+ years, it hits a new ATH every 4 years, and this 0.454x decrease in percentage increase for ATH continues. Note that there might be math errors in these.

&amp;#x200B;

**2013:** $1,151 (3,508% increase)

**2017:** $19,499 (1,594% increase)

**2021:** $141,173 (724% increase)

**2025:** $605,632 (329% increase)

**2029:** $1,508,024 (149% increase)

qhx1ib,Jieke0966,Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin,"Bitcoin, abbreviation: BTC or XBT, is a kind of cryptocurrency based on decentralization, adopting peer-to-peer network and consensus initiative, open source code, and blockchain as the underlying technology

One of the shortcomings of Bitcoin is that the quantity is difficult to meet the needs of market transactions. Bitcoin's program sets a maximum number limit, which is the reason why it can ""maintain and increase its value"", but it is also because of this that it is destined to be difficult to play the function and role of ""currency"". The main function of currency is a medium of exchange. As the economic aggregate is getting bigger and bigger, the amount of money needed will inevitably be more and more. If the economic aggregate becomes larger and the quantity of money remains unchanged, the result must be that money becomes more and more expensive, prices gradually fall, and deflation occurs. Deflation is more harmful than inflation, and long-term deflation can directly lead to the bankruptcy of national finances.

The second defect of Bitcoin is that it consumes a lot of energy, which runs counter to the concept of human green development. Therefore, Bitcoin is also called ""dirty currency"". The latest calculation of the Bitcoin Power Consumption Index of the University of Cambridge shows that Bitcoin mining consumes approximately 133.68 terawatt hours of electricity each year. Compared with the electricity consumption of countries around the world in 2020, this value lies between Sweden (131.8 TWh) and Malaysia (147.21 TW). As the number of bitcoins is getting closer and closer to its theoretical maximum limit, the energy consumption of generating a new bitcoin will increase exponentially.

The third flaw of Bitcoin is excessive volatility. The prerequisite for currency to be recognized by the market is stability, and since the creation of Bitcoin, its price has been fluctuating violently, fluctuating by 10% or even 30% every day.

So I chose to trade the rise and fall of Bitcoin prices. When it rises or falls, I can get a good profit. Bitcoin fluctuates during this period. Very good, but this is an opportunity for me, because the greater the volatility, the higher the profit, and I will not incur any losses due to the volatility of the Bitcoin market. I will not hold it, which is why I have been studying the cryptocurrency blockchain. If you have any questions, you can and discuss it with me",1635456469,23,1

I just found this YouTube video that does a mind opening documentary that sheds light on the 'why', including the links to the very heart of  monetary system itself to humans. It also exposes the dirty business of energy, the hypocrisy surrounding its critics, and how it helps to drive humans towards cleaner and greener and renewable and sustainable energy... All this, and as a bonus bitcoin does it away from controls of any government! Wowww! 

Today, I learned a lot: I feel I should share this video for all in learning more about bitcoin. Lastly, I truly want to say kudos to the creator team of this video.

In a scenario where people rushed to get their coins off the exchange how quickly could they do so?

We've all been told that BTC's max throughput is around 7 tps, give or take, but if you've ever withdrawn coins from an exchange you'll notice that the single BTC transaction when viewed on a blockexplorer is from 1 UTXO to many addresses. These addresses presumably represent withdrawals by other people whose transactions have been batched with your own.

The Australian Securities And Investments Commission (ASIC) has given  early approval to fund managers seeking to launch Bitcoin spot exchange  traded funds (ETFs), according to [*Business Insider*](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/asic-greenlights-bitcoin-etf). 

Many  Australian funds have already begun the application process after ASIC  green lit the spot ETFs. After months of consulting with experts in the  Bitcoin and crypto industry, the corporate regulators issued new  guidance for the space, and detailed a draft of regulatory requirements  for funds eager to offer Bitcoin spot ETFs. 

In a statement on  Friday, ASIC wrote, ‚ÄúWe recognise the interest in, and demand for, ETPs  and other investment products that hold crypto-assets in Australia.‚Äù One  requirement for fund managers is they will need to appoint a Bitcoin  custodial expert who is ‚Äúrequired to ensure crypto-assets are held in  safe and secure custody‚Äù.  


Safe and secure custody includes  storing Bitcoin private keys in air-gapped cold storage, through wallets  which are subject to ‚Äúrobust physical security practices.‚Äù Redundant  backups of seed phrases stored in geographically separate locations are  also required, according to the [*Sydney Morning Herald*](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/asic-gives-trading-of-bitcoin-ethereum-etfs-green-light-20211029-p594ea.html)*.*

Funds  must also front a minimum of $10 million in net tangible assets to  launch a Bitcoin ETF, along with adhering to other pricing and risk  management obligations.",1635514506,29,1

Satoshi points out that eventually there will be a point where the block reward from mining will so small that it becomes unprofitable, so the reward from transaction fees must be high enough, or else the entire network game theory breaks. 

In addition to Satoshi's comment, I'll add that  if Bitcoin becomes too big to fail, people will have a vested interest in securing the network regardless of the block reward subsidy.  If Bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency, the entire world would have a vested interest in keeping it secure. It's not that insane when you think about it. Bitcoin just becomes global infrastructure that governments are incentivized to maintain, much like roads, bridges, sewage systems, etc....

qci0t7,TheDumbInvesto,Crypto Lending question,"I want to understand how crypto lending works:

1. People who need money who dont want to sell their crypto holding (cos it may go up and don't want to lose on gains) are the borrowers. Fine.

2. Lending platform over collateralise, say 150% (deposit 15k of crypto and take loan of 10k). Perfect. 

3. Lending platform gets interest from borrowers for the loan tenure. They can liquidate crypto if interest is not paid. They will also give warning if crypto value drops (asking to collateralise more) and also liquidate if collateral becomes equal to loan amount (150% becomes 100%).  Excellent.

4. Lenders of the platform can lend their crypto to the lending pool and get some interest. The platform liquidates this crypto to fiat currency and pay to borrowers. 

5. Just like banks, the platform giive less interest to lenders and get more interest from borrowers, thus making money.

Sounds good till this point. Now the question is, if crypto prices are up, how would the platform pay interest as well as principal back to investors in the same crypto currency? The very reason why the borrowers pledged their crypto to get fiat currency is because they don't want to lose out on crypto gains. So here, both borrowers as well as lenders are NOT losing on crypto gains. So who actually is?

Eg: Let's say BTC is $50k. Borrower X collateralise 1.5 BTC (worth 75K) and borrows 50k. Lender Y deposits 1 BTC, worth 50k and that is what the platform liquidates and pays X in fiat currency. Now, the loan tenure is over. BTC is 65k. Borrower X pays back 50K and got back his 1.5 BTC. The platform now need to give back the lender Y 1 BTC but it has only 50k in hand and BTC is 65k. How would it fill the gap?",1634785483,5,1

I'm starting a Bitcoin club at my university and we're doing a game night. The grand prize is going to be a Trezor Model One.

I filled out my shipping information then went to pay with my debit card. I figured I'd pay in fiat cause my dollars are only gonna drop in value as each day goes by.

The payment failed and I promptly received a fraud alert from my bank. I responded to the automated text and tried again, to no avail. I got really frustrated and decided I'd do the purchase later.

About an hour later I was able to complete the purchase. Only then did it dawn on me how ironic the whole situation was.

I know my bank was only trying to protect me from fraud, but if I'd paid in Bitcoin the transaction would've gone seamlessly.

This is why we need cryptocurrencies! Fast, irreversible payments, and if I make a screw up, I've only got myself to blame.

I am not a Bitcoin expert, I know what it is, how it functions in general, and I have decent investing knowledge (I'm not a CPA) I haven't yet invested in any cryptos because only invest in what you know. I've made more money than I have lost with my investments so far though :)

However I'm always on the lookout to learn more, and crypto has proven itself as a viable alternative to fiat currencies, which I believe will be around for my lifetime or longer. I've read up a bit, but I'm aware it's a huge field (like almost any field of human knowledge)

I probably don't want to get started with mining, and my current financial contacts don't touch crypto at all, so I thought I'd ask here just to get my feet wet. 

A friend of mine who is quite savvy with bitcoin did once say that ""if you hear the news talking about how it will replace currencies etc, buy. When it dips, buy. Then you sell when it goes high."" Sounds legit to me.

As one looking toward retirement soon, with a small chunk of Bitcoin earning a small return on BlockFi, Celsius, and Ledn, and also in my Ledger (not earning - just appreciating), I can't wrap my head around wanting to sell it to pay for living expenses.

For those of you living off your Bitcoin holdings, if assuming potentially that nothing is as valuable as Bitcoin will be in the future, then you probably don't want to spend your bitcoin on living expenses, so how do you live on Bitcoin if you don't want to spend it?",1634779197,18,1

2nd - 3rd December 2013; Top - 29th November 2013 (Not really a guess but if you look at the chart it is fairly obvious a cross is coming soon)

In this kind of circumstances it would be very difficult to transact and buy goods, as you can not pay with any electronic systems.

I was on a website where they only accept payments in Crypto currency. I have zero experience with Crypto (completely new) and have a few questions before I start my Crypto journey. 

1) I heard with Crypto you don‚Äôt make an account like normal bank accounts. So where do I go to start? How do I know if the site is legitimate aswell?

2) Also when you want to get some crypto do you need to link your bank account or something? Or do you need to transfer money from bank account to get crypto currency? If so, can‚Äôt this be traced back to you?

3) Is there any important things to know before I start my crypto journey? Please feel free to give me some game.

qiqynm,howlingwolfpress,Today it is my task to present to you a bird's eye view of The Saylor Series,"This is all in Michael Saylor's own words from the full transcripts (bottom):
 
 ‚ÄúIt all started for us with channeling energy‚Ä¶releasing a latent energy in matter‚Äîwe‚Äôre converting matter into energy.‚Äù

‚ÄúTechnologies that are dominating today, they‚Äôre dominating because they‚Äôre able to deliver force faster, harder, stronger, smarter...if it‚Äôs got the characteristic that it can be made harder, smarter, stronger, faster, there‚Äôs something compelling about it!""

""The Roman Empire is a great model for the way that human beings interact with technology and the way that they interact with a competitive world and become both antifragile and get harder, smarter, faster, and stronger!""

""The Roman way: there‚Äôs a certain submission to nature and the organism is greater than any one individual and any one family. It‚Äôs continually refreshing itself. We have to have a constant flow of new talent, new leadership.""

""It‚Äôs not that the Romans invented everything, it‚Äôs just that the Romans stole every good idea from every civilization from the Greeks, from the Carthaginians, from the whatever that they crushed.""

""The basic credo of the engineer is: I look at nature and I look at the circumstances that I‚Äôm surrounded by and I use my intellect and every material and technique at hand in order to construct a better world for everyone and everything that I love.""

""The Romans were healthy as long as they kept tension and dynamism and this incredible competition in their ecosystem, and when they lost it, they lost their edge.""

""Everywhere on Earth where you see a big city, it was the center of an empire. Everywhere where you see a city that‚Äôs fallen upon hard times, that‚Äôs been destroyed‚Äîits empire lapsed. [It once had economic density but then lost economic density].""

""Where there‚Äôs an explosion of innovation and an explosion of vitality, somebody tapped into 1,000x more energy or figured out how to deliver the energy.""

""Everyone that‚Äôs succeeded [in the history of technology]‚Äîevery empire, individual, company‚Äîthey all found a way to be harder, smarter, faster, stronger.""

""Humans triumph throughout history by channeling energy. Since 1mm years ago to today‚Äîit‚Äôs really the story of intelligent people looking around for Where is the energy coming from? How do I channel it in a network in order to achieve something harder, smarter, faster, stronger?""

""I want to replace 'monetary network' with energy network, because monetary energy is energy! What is money? Money is the highest form of energy that human beings can channel.""

""Humans prosper by channeling energy. [#Bitcoin is about to be] the most efficient energy network in the history of the world. Because the challenge of humanity is: how do I store energy and transmit energy across time and space and domain?""

""I think the success of #Bitcoin and the network power ultimately is a function of the adoption, the utility, the productivity, and the inflation...If there‚Äôs a lesson of history, the lesson of history is: the most organized team always wins.""

""Everybody that‚Äôs marketing #Bitcoin, everyone working on Bitcoin technology, everyone simply HODLing Bitcoin, everybody that hates it, everybody attacking every other asset, every time another asset fails or another currency weakens it, [the passage of time]‚Äîcontributes to it.""

""#Bitcoin is the best system in the history of the world for controlling, storing, and channeling energy, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs destined to be successful.""

""[On #Bitcoin as a swarm of cyber hornets]: When something is a decentralized, organic creature that is rapidly evolving and adapting, it becomes excessively antifragile because every time you kill an element of it, the elements you don‚Äôt kill get that much stronger.""

""Ultimately, the strength of #Bitcoin comes from the fact that an individual can self-custody...in any of 200 different regulatory jurisdictions, find a jurisdiction where they will have the strongest money where they can generate the most yield and...move to that jurisdiction.""

""#Bitcoin's strength comes from the fact that it‚Äôs being developed‚Äîit‚Äôs not constrained by the lowest common denominator (the weak parts of the herd get culled out, they‚Äôre being deprived of their capital), it‚Äôs strengthened by the highest common denominator.""

""#Bitcoin is an antifragile but scalable platform serving as a store of value. The best possible circumstance would be if the entire world plunged into a war where value was dissipating in every currency everywhere at a rapid rate. And I think it describes what we have today.""

""Insanely great technology is when it does a thing without you doing a thing. And so if I told you: Take all your money, put it into #Bitcoin, and then you‚Äôll be rich and happy and prosperous for all of eternity without doing a single transaction‚ÄîI just need it to always work.""

""If I can channel my energy and put it into a network and that network can be used to fund and power an endowment that will [project my values], then that #Bitcoin network...is going to be my mechanism for achieving all of my hopes and aspirations from now to eternity.""

""#Bitcoin is the universal language of economic truth. I think it will evolve as a unit of monetary energy. The right way to think of it is as just a standard unit of economic energy or monetary energy. An immutable, self-sovereign unit of economic energy.""

""I‚Äôm probably not going to sacrifice my life for the 13th iteration on smart contracts. On the other hand, if you tell me that we‚Äôre about to suck all of the economic energy out of the civilization and plunge ourselves into the Dark Ages‚Äîthat‚Äôs worth fighting for.""

""I‚Äôve never seen an economist say, Why don‚Äôt we actually define the things that a working 22-year old is going to want to buy by the time they‚Äôre 32? And here‚Äôs one thing: early retirement! I want to buy early retirement by the time I‚Äôm 32. How do I do that?""

""The pernicious mistake everybody makes is: they don‚Äôt really think about the energy density and information density of their products, services, and assets. They‚Äôre not applying conservation of energy.""

""When you‚Äôre young, you overestimate the value of functionality and acquisition, you underestimate how expensive it‚Äôs going to be to maintain things, and then you really underestimate this last issue: can you enjoy it?""

""The great challenge is this paradox of the engineer versus the zookeeper: we see nature, we want to engineer a better world for ourselves, and it can be done. But we can also reach too far and try too hard and try to make water flow uphill and try to make time flow backwards.""

""Satoshi engineered money. Whereas every government has created money.""
""The greater the sharing, the greater the economy. The more immutable, the higher integrity. The higher the efficiency of the economy, the more [mathematically] correct. The more effective the economy‚Äîthe faster the network updates‚Äîthe faster the economy.""

""Gold fails [as money] primarily because there‚Äôs no good application protocol. It‚Äôs not conservative, it‚Äôs too difficult, too slow, too dangerous.""

qehfdg,SergeyKalinin,I would like to tell you about my Simplex registration story...,"1. Completely buggy image verification system. I sent I sent my passport in vain thirty times literally (it only to find out that instead of national - that is, my civil passport (is written on the website clearly: ""please attach the national identification document"") , it turns out that a foreign passport is required (!!) and this is indicated by support in a letter a week later! ...

In general, I wonder why require a foreign passport ... I'm not obliged to have one as a citizen of the Russian Federation. Is this something that should somehow hinder the crypto operations via Simplex? Okay, so be it, a week later I started loading my foreign passport ...

&amp;#x200B;

2. Every time I attach documents, the system writes that photos are blurry, glare detected - I actually tried to attach it 30 times, I took pictures from the 8th iPhone, from Samsung, from different angles, under different light conditions, I even asked another person to take a picture of these documents instead of me (I thought it was from maybe my hands are crooked), the result is the same - blurry! ... idiocy, the system simply does not accept documents and that's it. This identification is not really well tested and instead of simplifying the verification of documents, it's just torturing people who want to register !! Passports always contain glowing security features, and they will always be blurry and make glares!

&amp;#x200B;

3. By some miracle, after completing the ""attach pictures"" exercise, from the attempt number 31, having lost faith in humanity, and also receiving robotic replies in Simplex chat - I proceeded to the window, which stated that photos I have uploaded are on ""manual verification""... This window just hung for another week without any changes. After this week of ""manual verification"" I was simply asked to try again uploading pictures to the buggy system ... Dear Simplex, where is logic?  I even mailed them already by that moment all required documents in high quality - all the same, they send only formal replies and asking you to perform clearly according to the algorithm, like robots ... In a response to my letter, they just repeated me a link, to upload all photos to this moronic system as if I have just registered.

So what do you think? I opened that link and saw a window which stated that ""manual verification"" is being carried out and there were no forms for uploading a photo ... Then there were 2 more iterations of useless correspondence with robots and their formal replies in chat and by mail, in style ""we will fix it now"", ""everything will be ok"" ... and another week of my time has gone...

&amp;#x200B;

4. After some time I again managed to upload all the documents and froze for another week on ""manual verification"". Deja vu... I wrote to them about all this in their chat, they promised to speed it up. As a result, thank you, they ""speeded it up"" ... Another week has passed and I receive a new request:

1. Certificate of criminal record (it takes up to 30 days to receive this paper from the police!)

2. Extract from all bank accounts, where I spent how much and how muck i have earned for 3 months (is this really necessary to open a simple banking account??? What will Simplex do with all my McDonnalds spending checks?)

3. Am I a politically engaged person? (Oh Really? They haven't googled that I am the former president of Russian Federation after a month of registration??)

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, In total, it has already been already 5 weeks since I started my registration in Simplex ... In fact, the account has not yet been opened, I continue sending and sending all new documents ... My requests, to somehow speed up this process, are replied with formal robotic answers that are in fact don't help much.

By today, I have sent an the statement from Sberbank with all my income and spendings for 3 months. Now I am waiting for the readiness of a certificate of no criminal record from the police (I have never ever been asked such document in my life, Simplex is the first company that asked me this shit).

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to lose a month of your life, chat with robots and achieve nothing, then apply for registration in Simplex. I wouldn't recommend Simplex to anyone, it's a terrible service. It would be easier to open an account in the most ordinary bank!

&amp;#x200B;

PS. I will by all means get them to open an account. I need it, because without it, you cannot issue a COTI debit card. Up to now it is 1 month that has passed in vain. I will write on how things are developing!

I would like to wish to those who implemented such a ""convenient"" customer service to burn out in hell, I never thought that registration would have to spend so much time and effort!",1635036336,10,1
qehcwk,Daddy_Christmass,How do I get into mining?,"Hello, I'd like to get into Bitcoin mining and I would like to hear the thoughts and views of you who have mined Bitcoin and are more experienced in it. 
So here are a few questions I have:

1 what type of computer set up do you need to mine it, cuz I know you need a purpose build one and your regular laptop would probably work.(at least that's what I've been told)
And what would you recommend?

2 what's the cost to get or build one of these set ups?
  

3 what is the fixed and variable costs? (Monthly)

4 is it realistic to min 1 or even 2 full bitcoins a month?

If you decide to answer thank you because really any feedback is welcome and greatly appreciated!",1635036079,52,1

qeh1nv,Doomsany,"Newbie here, Am I too late?","Greetings,  


For a while I¬¥ve been trying to convince myself to try crypto and I¬¥m finally up for it. I have 2/3 invested at traditional things, stocks etc.  


At Jul/22 I¬¥m getting a nice amount (for my standard) to invest, the last 1/3 of resources, but I¬¥m afraid I¬¥m might be too late for the game? I understand we can¬¥t predict next week, so 06/22 is inconceivably far away.  


\- Basic plan layout until that time arrives:  
Get a Binance account, learn to use it properly, I don¬¥t mind KYC.  
Put 1k there to learn it.  
Reading about it everyday.  
Getting Pro-tips. (You guys)  
Eventually, buy and hold for a long freaking while, no plans at all at spending it.  


Besides if it¬¥s too late, I¬¥m having some doubts about this  


\- Money goes  from bank wire to Binance, it stays there. Can I send from Binance to a hardwallet of mine, and than bounce it between Binance and it as needed? Any tips how to do this or better exchange company?  


Thank you so much for reading and for any insight you¬¥re willing to share.",1635034926,49,1

qedp2i,cbutler1986,Bitcoin is awesome. Really impressed with the long term vision of this project,"So impressed with how yummy switched from v1 to v2. Creating a new growth fund which adds value daily. Now its just announced Nfts with utility to earn. Some very interesting stuff is happening with yummy and will be very interesting to see where yummy is after the big burn in January. 

Run down on  yummy 

Ceo committed 200k to the growth fund which is locked for 12 months. Definitely a stable and long term plan here!

Why YummyCrypto?

-Equipped with Growth Fund Worth $1.2M approx.
-Capable of daily buy backs and burns
-Upcoming single token staking

-NFTs (utility integrated with staking and more)
-Upcoming Discounted Yummy Academy for complicated crypto subjects
-Yummy Staking Multiplier (Scales by Number of NFTs owned)

Here's the utility list for the Yummy NFTs:

üî•Each Yummy gives you discount 10% in Yummy Academy. 10 gets you FREE Academy forever üëç

üî•Each Yummy gives you more in the Yummy Staking Pools for a max of 100%. Example: staking pool is yielding 140%. If you have 100 NFTs, yield is 280% instead (or 2x) üëç

üî•Each Yummy gives you further discount in future NFT purchases

üî•Anyone with 50 Yummy NFTs or more can buy up to $3,000 a month of Yummy Token tax free. At 100 Yummy NFTs that bonus is tripled to $9,000 üëç

qgkbe3,Anonactor,Are there any Cryptocurrency themed film festivals? I'm thinking of launching one.,"I'm an actor/filmmaker and I've been involved in crypto in some form or another since 2011. When it comes to my work, I had some success with a cryptocurrency themed dark comedy film called BUY THE DIP. If you are curious, you can watch it here: [www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdH1EloyWw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQdH1EloyWw)

I have been writing and producing dark comedy films based around technology for a few years now, sort of in the vain of BLACK MIRROR BUT FUNNY, and I'm looking to develop an international festival to showcase films that tackle similar relevant themes, with prizes / awards dished out in Cryptocurrency, featuring educational panels, Q&amp;A's etc.

Has this been done before? If not, I reckon it's about time. I have good connections in the film world and I'd love to create an equally impressive team in the Crypto space to make this happen. 

My other films include the upcoming dark comedy OKAY GOOGLE which stars Rebecca Black as a vindictive AI assistant who breaks out of 'the cloud' to exact revenge on her owner, and the award-winning dark comedy DEATH OF AN ANDROID, which I wrote and directed alongside Always Sunny in Philadelphia director Heath Cullens. Links below if you'd like to check some of them out!

qh2r42,Russell_vi,"Bitfarms: BITF 10,000 $ YOLO : Journal Update Day 1","Gentlemen,   here comes the first update of many as I and one of my closest   companions embark on a YOLO investment into Bitfarms. To start I should   elaborate on our positions, the huge sacked man I am going in and  bought  1750 shares, and 20 5$ calls 10 expiring in December the  remaining 10  in February. My companion, well call him Dimbledorf went  in a far less  long schlong position and bought a mere few hundred  shares and 10 calls,  5 into each respective date.

Now   that the background is covered, let's dive deeper into the why. Why  did I  choose to risk 50% of my portfolio into a Canadian-based Bitcoin  mining  company? That's a great question which I simply only can refute  with  that I am first at my core, an ape. Backed by firm love for  bitcoin and  all its creations, yet the desire to do more than a mere 2x  in the  remainder of Q4 I hence take on a more risky position. A BTC  mining  company. The technicals look pretty solid, the Stochastic RSI  looking to  enter oversold territory on the weekly chart, similar to the  MACD we  are looking to enter some nice positions. Lastly, Hut 8 mining  and Mara  have been enjoying a nice green October while BITF has been  left in the  dust, leading me to believe it will have its turn, much  like every kid  gets to have their turn on the jungle gym, no stock left  behind!

The  next explanation I  owe you fellow Redditors is what is my goal? At what  point will I exit  my positions? Well first, I will never sell in the  red, worst comes to  worst and daddy regulation comes in and obliterates  the crypto market,  I, like a captain of a ship, will go down with it.  There is no  abandoning ship, this is a one-way ship to the moon or die  trying. God  willing, I enter the green I will brave the seas of profit  into I say  this now, a minimum 3x of my money. I didn't come all this  way to call  myself a boomer and sell up 20%, I came to ride this rocket  to the moon  and be one of the many cryptonaut's to reach the  long-desired,  infamous moon. This is the first of many updates to cope  the deep  anxiety that is building in my stomach as I contemplate my  whole life  with every tick of the stock.

A   little background on me while I keep my identities anonymous much like   Batman and Robin. I myself am a simple college student, who   unfortunately plays tennis for the fabled discount on that college   tuition. (Thank you NCAA.) However, soon I will exit this black hole of   my life and open my own landscaping company where I can be free and  roam  the wilds, much like Marley from Marley and Me. Dimbledorf, my  Robbin,  is a simple man who works construction from day to day and  trades in the  night. A successful man no less, owning his own company.  We hold hands  and brace for what is to come, and we invite you to join  us along our  perilous journey.

qgzfjr,niko1798,How do crypto wallets work? In simple words,"A little context: The other day my dad asked me, ""How do crypto wallets work, why are they so secure?"". This question caught me off guard because, while I study computer engineering and understand the concept quite well, explaining it to someone with little knowledge of technology is quite a challenge. After thinking for a couple of days about how to explain it in a simple way, I came up with an analogy that I think is quite interesting and that I would like to share with you. Maybe you can help me refine the details to make it more ""accurate"".

Now, the analogy: Let's imagine that there is a *""material X""* so hard that it can't be broken no matter how much you hit it, drill it, etc. It can be molded once and then it keeps its shape forever. An important property of this material is that it is transparent, everyone can see through it. This *""material X""* represents the blockchain.

Now let's imagine a piggy bank with a lock made of this material. This piggy bank cannot be broken, anyone can insert things through its slot and see everything inside but only the one who has the key to the lock can open it and take out its contents. There is no key that can open more than one piggy bank.

The interesting thing about these is that no one knows who their owners are, that is, no one knows who has the keys that open them, they are anonymous. The only way to know who is the owner of one is for that same person to show others that he or she can open it. On the other hand, if the owner of one loses or is robbed of his key, he will never be able to open the piggy bank again.

Finally, if for some reason people find out what your piggy bank is and you do not want them to know because you prefer to keep your privacy, you can simply ""create"" a new one with a different lock and key and move your funds from the old piggy bank to the new one. As mentioned above, the new piggy bank is anonymous and no one will know who the owner is, even if they can see what is inside it.

I hope you liked it and I am open to suggestions to improve it!

qgxph1,RonPaulWasR1ght,Lending out BTC,"A few months ago someone mentioned to me that Bitcoin could have a problem, due to it being a deflating currency, as deflating currencies don't foster growth well.  While that seems absurd on face, and obviously he was crediting the Federal Reserve System with the growth that America has had in the past 108 years which is patently absurd....if you think about it, there could be an issue with making loans in Bitcoin, due to it's increasing scarcity. 

Any borrower has to be very concerned, that during the life of the loan, that Bitcoin will become harder to source.  As in, his pay will decline (in Bitcoin), and while his expenses do as well, his loan payments generally will not.  So...how can anyone feel comfortable borrowing in Bitcoin for say, a 30 year mortgage loan on their home?  Etc.  And here's the kicker - the lender has the same exact concern!  How does a lender comfortably lend out his Bitcoin, knowing that it will become more scarce as time goes on and therefore the borrower could well have trouble repaying??  

So, I'd like everyone's thoughts on this question - can a deflating currency like Bitcoin, truly foster growth?  Lending must happen using the currency for growth, because it's essential that the capital held by savers be put to productive usage....but could Bitcoin be the proper vehicle for that?",1635344255,23,1

He would have done it in early 2014. I've done some digging and found an API code he wrote down, but don't know how to use or access the account with this information. I'm trying to find the popular trading sites at that time and see if I can't find his account on them. Thanks so much.",1635343148,17,1

So back to my point is bitcoin really worth buying. Now I know crypto will be the future and I have no doubts in bitcoin, but their is one problem for me. I have been earning and saving a good chunk of my money and recently put 450$ in Solana and I still have over 1000$. I'm saying this to you because I'm always being told to put my money into bitcoin which I would do, but I'm buying so little which just won't worth it to me. I'm chasing the crypto that is affordable and will make me decent sums of cash. By that I mean buying SOL or ETH projects the have good potential and make me good money. So I can make money sell at a bullish market and buy back at bear market. I personally believe and crypto and would hold but I'm trying to make money and reinvest is that bad should I just buy BTC and keep working and buy more?

To me it would solve scalability problem and a block would still be mined only every 10 minutes. 

It would make transactions cheaper for users (no need to include transaction fee) but users would still be able to include a fee of their choice to support the network/miners. And I reckon many still would, it would be like your donation to Bitcoin but better.

I even suspect that the overall miners' profit would increase with this model: people give more when they are not forced to and Bitcoin should be more popular with free transactions and more reliable confirmation time.",1633150510,13,1

A lite node keeps only the hashed headers of blocks and not a complete record of every transaction. Is this correct? Do lite nodes keep a complete history of every block header or do they also only store a certain amount?

I understand that the benefit of this is that less data has to be stored. What is the downside, if any? 

Do miners have to be full nodes?

pzjs9p,maroonblood94,My biggest fear with Bitcoin and crypto in general.,"I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get downvoted to oblivion, but I don‚Äôt care. This is a topic that isn‚Äôt discussed enough, and I don‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt think about this more. I‚Äôm invested, and I‚Äôll continue to invest in Bitcoin for the next few years. But this is a topic worth discussing. So here goes‚Ä¶

My biggest fear is that the CIA/Government created Bitcoin and is planning an eventual rug pull that will lead to the biggest wealth transfer in world history into the hands of the elites. 

Think about it. Who would want a Central Bank Digital Currency from the government? Nobody. 

Enter Bitcoin. Built upon the hashing algorithm SHA-256 (which was originally designed by the NSA), and designed by some supposedly benevolent, anonymous creator (Satoshi Nakamoto) with a name that literally translates to ‚ÄúCentral Intelligence‚Äù in Japanese. People flock to it with the dream that it will help them conquer the corrupt financial system by hedging against inflation and allowing them to make decentralized transactions. As it picks up adoption‚Ä¶celebrities, bankers, and big companies start buying it up. Enamored by promises of wealth and financial freedom, everyone ignores the uncomfortable fact that the creator of Bitcoin has 1 million coins and could easily tank the market just by activating his wallet. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead or forgot his keys‚Äù we reassure ourselves. 

By 2030, 80%-90% of the worlds population has invested their wealth and savings into this digital asset. Suddenly, Satoshi‚Äôs wallet wakes up one day and begins to sell-off massive amounts of Bitcoin. Major investors rush to sell off their holdings as the price plunges into a free-fall collapse. Within 24 hours, the value of Bitcoin is decimated. Millions across the world lose their life savings. But it‚Äôs to late. Satoshi (or the elite group who may be Satoshi) have transferred the bulk of the world‚Äôs wealth to themselves. 

At this point, the world governments and banks swoop in to offer their new traceable, trackable, controllable digital currency. 

Revelation 13:16-17: ‚ÄúIt also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.‚Äù

That‚Äôs my biggest fear. Never in history have the elites lost control of the financial system. I‚Äôll still keep buying it in the short term as it‚Äôs making me money. But I‚Äôm not going to be a 10-30+ year HODLER like everyone else. In the next 5 years, I‚Äôll be transferring all my crypto into physical assets like food, land, etc‚Ä¶",1633131162,266,1

He logged in today to Blockchain.com at 11.26 pm and exactly afterwards he noticed a spending tx has been generated at 11.29pm.
The output address (the hacker) is bc1qr5r52hv8245g3xs5g2c93882xy7kgsvmdazgv0

What's interesting is that the hack is underway with 999 tx so far.
I think blockchain.com is hacked and some hacker is right now harvesting login/password credentials and using them to exfiltrate btc.",1633125868,0,1
pzi85n,Athomas1,Bitcoin wastes electricity,"There is no single solution to the climate crisis.

I think that having a market based mechanism forcing electricity producers to compete is really important. We've tried increasing the cost of electricity through carbon credits, and seen some success. Ive been working through the idea of bitcoin as a mechanism for restricting investment into electricity production by providing a global price-floor for electricity.

ill need to assume a few things to explain it:

1. Mining bitcoin is a waste of electricity
2. Bitcoin is bought and sold for a price
3. Bitcoin production does not require massive infrastructure, just computers a satellite and some electricity

(A)  
If  bitcoin wastes electricity and people buy that electricity, they are  effectively saying ""electricity production and consumption is worth at  least X"". Where X is the price of bitcoin.True:  As long as 1 &amp; 2 of  our assumption are true.

(B)  
Coal  plants, gas refineries, or water dams, produce electricity, they can  look at bitcoin and say 'we will at least get X for producing  electricity' where X is the profit from mining bitcoin minus the cost of  building infrastructure to mine bitcoin. If 3 is true then the cost and time required to produce bitcoin is small compared to other economic activities.

True: As long as 3 is true, every electricity provider in the world now has a minimum price-floor for electricity production.

(C)  
The  conclusion is that companies or countries across the world will mine bitcoin if you accept the above facts. The same factors now apply to  previously distant/remote electricity production, that could not be consumed by people, including volcanoes.

True: As long as you accepted (A) and (B) then the above holds.  


If  (C) is true, any investment in electricity production must now compete on a global scale. Meaning the cheapest electricity production and therefore the most profitable, will receive investment and the alternatives such as coal factories, water dams, or potentially solar panels will have their access restricted. 

Its no longer just your local market asking 'is this electricity production going to be cheaper than this other production' its the entire global market using volcanoes, and wind in the middle of the sea, and other shit, to say 'no'.  


p.s. This is an idea that i've been trying to work through but I feel there are some pretty big implications from bitcoin and how it will effect previously 'national'/local electricity markets by forcing them to compete on a global scale.",1633125841,71,1

pz1as8,-Scott_Trenti,October 1 ST: BTC daily line oscillates and the opportunity is empty. Today's closing is the key.,"BTC contract analysis: Yesterday, after a sharp counter-draw in the Asian plate in the morning, BTC basically did not change much in the day. Although we were given empty positions in the 43300-43400 area in the plate, we chose the 43000 area in the early morning to prompt small profits to adjust the position. The daily median closing price is still relatively critical today. From the rising market near the previous low of 29,200 to 52,900, 50% of the retracement is in the area of 41,000-40,900; However, the 382 position drawn back from the falling market in the 52900-39600 area is near the 45000 area. Therefore, if we continue to bear short today, the daily line must not continue to close up. If the daily line closes near the 45,000 area today, the probability of breaking through tomorrow will be great, so we should consider looking around the 47,000 area. Once today's rally falls back and turns negative to close, it will remain unchanged, so long as the market is in the case of suppression, touch the support instead of making a reference, and see the broken position.As far as short-term trading of BTC 

contract is concerned, it turned up yesterday, but the fluctuation rhythm in the daily level remains unchanged. In the fluctuation, it is considered to go to more in the day today, and whether it is going to take the short position or not, with emphasis on today's high position and falling back. The location refers to the vicinity of the low point 43000 in the early morning and the low point 43100 in the early morning retracement correction; Short above, focus on the previous high of 44900-45000. Short-term trading strategy of BTC contracts in the day: retrace the 43100-43000 areas first, and target the 44100-44200 areas; The upper 44900-45000 area is empty, and the targets are 43500 and 43000 areas!

For purposes of making things concrete, let's take a random bitcoin address: [bc1q6pr364uy3zplj0q7p3w7qm6chex53zk06cz48f](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1q6pr364uy3zplj0q7p3w7qm6chex53zk06cz48f)

I read on blockchain explorer: 54 transactions on this address, for a current balance of 0.01232966 BTC.

I have many questions of which it is not as easy as one might think to find an answer for, so I hope some of you could answer:

1. When I download a software wallet (for example Exodus), and click ""receive"", it gives me a bitcoin address like the one above. When I look up this address on blockchain explorer, it has 0 bitcoin and transactions on it. This makes sense. But is it so that the address was pre-existing on the blockchain, and Exodus took a random, unused, address and assigned it to me?
2. When I say ""assign to me"", I really mean ""assigned to the private keys that Exodus created for this wallet on my laptop"". Is this correct?
3. Exodus has not given me a seed phrase to write down. How is this address it gave me, protected? Without a seedphrase, how can private keys be re-generated in case my laptop would crash, get stolen or whatever?",1635621678,10,1

2. download another browser. good choices include firefox, brave, and even chrome is fine. everyone should use different browsers to compartmentalize their activities online anyway. it's a great privacy practice. 

3. get an anonymous email account with either protonmail, or tutanota. they are free for the first one. if you have used your free one, then you can use paypal and ""donate"" $1 for each new account you want (for protonmail anyway, not sure about tutanota).    

4. that's all you need to create another reddit account: an alternate email.   and using this method, you have infinite ability to circumvent these cowards.  

DEAR REDDIT CENSORS: You are the worst people in the world. And you deserve what's coming to you.   Clear your conscience and quit your job before it's too late. You won't be able to live with yourself when you realize how many people you are murdering with your censorship.",1635621089,0,1

I was thinking about a new stable coin model. My experience and knowledge are limited in this matter. I would like to share this idea as a reflective excercise...

The idea is a stable coin pegged to USD but with an automated correction for inflation. If USD gots printed, the new amount will be shared with all coin holders. In this way the coin would be connected to inflation and each holder would get new coins in balance with the inflation rate. You won't loose by inflation, you keep your value during your hold. You can hold the coin as long as you need to without inflation concerns...

What are your ideas on it? Would it be possible? Us it realistic at a technical level? Does it already exist without knowing? Etc...

Looking forward to this discussion :-)",1635619665,11,1

qj6adm,tennovella1381,Step by step guide for newbies to buying BITCOIN (BTC) without the hassle of going through ID verification.," 

Step by step guide for newbies to buying BITCOIN and other altcoin currencies without the hassle of going through ID verification.

I'm seeing a lot of new people ask how they can get in on BITCOIN and there's a lot of frustration around the processes of going through uploading personal documents and SSN. And with the influx of people that will be coming as BITCOIN makes it to the top 100, it's ideal to have a brief post to explain how to get it.

So here it is. A fast guide to get you to swap your Bitcoin/Ethereum swapped for BTC and other currencies.

1. Sign up to Binance on the register page using code 133282515 for up to 20% discount on all trading fees It will be free and you won't need to verify documents/Upload ID to buy, sell, deposit or withdraw. Binance lets you withdraw up to 2BTC per day without needing your ID.

2. Go to Funds tab and click Deposits/Withdrawals.

3. Click deposit beside the coin you wish to deposit into your Binance wallet. If you can't find it, there's a search bar. Click deposit and copy the address for the BTC or ETH (whichever you're planning to trade for BTC)

4. Send your BTC or ETH to that address from your Coinbase (or Bitstamp or whatever you used to buy Bitcoin/Ethereum) NOTE: PLEASE MAKE SURE THE ADDRESS IS CORRECT, ANY MISTAKES IN ADDRESSES WILL RESULT IN YOU LOSING COINS. DOUBLE CHECK ADDRESS ALWAYS.

5. Wait for your BTC, ETH or LTC to be deposited to your Binance wallet. It has to go through over 30 confirmations for it to arrive into the wallet on Binance. (If you're transfer says PENDING just be patient.)

6. Once it arrives to Binance go under the exchange tab (Basic option for beginners). Search for BTC under the ETH or USD tab depending on what you have deposited. Click on it. And go to the buy section and type the amount you want to buy. If you want to spend all your USD/ETH for the BITCOIN just press the 100% option to spend everything in exchange for BTC.

7. Congratulations you now you have your BITCOIN and know how to navigate Binance exchange :) You may keep it in your Binance Exchange wallet or send it to any other BITCOIN wallet you choose.

Note 2: I've included my Binance reference code for you if you don't have one to get up to 20% off trading fees, it's REFERENCE CODE: 133282515 Of course you don't have to use my referral but if you do, I'd appreciate it :)",1635615076,6,1

Thoughts??,"The US Fed will announce it is tapering its bond buying program on November 3rd at 2pm with a press conference at 2:30pm EST. From $120B a month, decreasing by around $15B thereafter. It feels like crypto will trade down on this announcement as this is a major contributor to inflation which is a partial driver of crypto valuation. I don't anticipate interest rate increases will be signaled due to high levels of government debt and for fear of crashing the market. 

The fed may also increasingly acknowledge inflation. If it does acknowledge inflation that should be good for crypto but this will be offset by the coinciding tapering announcement. 

I think temporarily moving to the sidelines may be the best strategy come Wednesday November 3rd morning for crypto. What do you all think?",1635612634,16,1

qdltn6,jack_murray,Some thoughts about the future,"The incentive structures are just too big for Bitcoin to not continue growing. At the moment it's like, you get like at least 2x annual return on your money with little risk. Eventually you will only get a 1.5x. Then it will drop to 20%. Then 10% and we're levelling out with the stock market.

All this time, investment in businesses would probably have slowed down a lot. Crypto is already having this effect on the stock market. But when annual returns drops below 8%, a tonne of businesses will receive investment in Bitcoin, since at that point it will start becoming more profitable to invest your Bitcoin in stable businesses than to hold it.

The previously slowing investment in business will turn into growth, but this time it will be mainly done with Bitcoin. There will be a Bitcoin renaissance.

At this stage or earlier, everybody will be starting to prefer Bitcoin over fiat, and fiat will start to lose value. It will no longer make sense to measure returns in fiat. Returns will appear to go up again, but it wont be Bitcoin getting stronger, it will be fiat money getting weaker. So cash will drop relative to BTC until physical offline cash-based business alone can prop it up. During this phase BTC will remain more or less the same relative to commodities.

All these dominoes falling comes from the simple fact that fiat money suffers from inflation and Bitcoin does not, and that Bitcoin does not require trusted intermediaries. These two simple facts make it appealing to enough people to trigger a revolution.

And you know what the irony of it all is? It's possible that despite all of this, not much will change about society. Instead of printing money to pay off debts every year, governments will be forced to raise taxes instead. Maybe they will invent a new 3% ""annual wealth tax"" to retax money that was taxed in the previous year in order to replace the previous role of inflation, or maybe they will just raise GST. The banking industry will suffer, but it wont disappear completely. They will adapt to provide relevant financial services for new money. Some banks are already doing custody of Bitcoin for their customers.

* Walmart has started a pilot program to bring bitcoin purchasing capabilities to Coinstar kiosks in some of its U.S. stores.
* The pilot is part of a broader partnership between Coinstar and Coinme to offer BTC at over 8,000 kiosks, 200 of which are in Walmart stores.
* ‚ÄúWalmart expands Bitcoin access to more people...and gives it further legitimacy among skeptics,‚Äù brokerage firm BitOoda CSO Sam Doctor said.

Walmart has started a pilot program to bring bitcoin purchasing capabilities to 200 Coinstar kiosks in some of the retailer‚Äôs U.S. stores, *Bloomberg* reported. The initiative is part of a broader cooperation between Coinstar, the maker of machines that allows customers to exchange coins for paper bills or gift cards, and cash-to-bitcoin exchange Coinme to offer BTC at more than 8,000 kiosks in the U.S.

‚ÄúBitcoin ATMs have been around for a while, including in many supermarkets,‚Äù Sam Doctor, chief strategy officer and head of research at cryptocurrency brokerage firm BitOoda, told *Bloomberg*. ‚ÄúWalmart expands Bitcoin access to more people, though, and gives it further legitimacy among skeptics, should they roll it out beyond an initial pilot.‚Äù

The initiative was first reported by *CoinDesk*, which tested the service. Customers purchasing BTC insert dollar bills into the Coinstar kiosk and receive a voucher, which can be redeemed for bitcoin minus a 4% fee charged by the machine. But customers need to set up a Coinme account and pass a background check to redeem the voucher.

‚ÄúCoinstar, in partnership with Coinme, has launched a pilot that allows its customers to use cash to purchase bitcoin,‚Äù Walmart communications director Molly Blakeman told *CoinDesk* via email. ‚ÄúThere are 200 Coinstar kiosks located inside Walmart stores across the United States that are part of this pilot.‚Äù",1634922874,1,1

Thus it may not be relevant to look at the total market cap for bitcoin and compare it to such things as gold or total global wealth to see how far It can grow.

If we imagine example if bitcoin could hit one quadrillion dollars in market cap this would only require an exchange amount of $10 trillion daily which across the globe is possible

In theory the number of ""meaningful transfers"" (transfers that would contribute to a GDB if Bitcoin was used by a country) would be much less than 70%, since a lot of these transfers would be to/from exchanges and personal wallets...

So let's say the ""Bitcoin GDP"" is between 10% and 70% of the US GDP. That's like saying that the Bitcoiners do as much business as 10-70% of the entire USA.

- Bitcoiners: say, 100 million people
- 10-70% of USA: 33-230 million people

qdkh3h,ittsysk1975,Bitcoin and my redemption story,"I've never said this before, but today I am so fucking proud of myself.

Three years ago was the darkest time of my life. I had succumbed to a vicious gambling addiction that drained me of everything I had and then some, save for my closest relationships. I'll spare you the drawn out story of my spiral, but just to give you an insight into what my life had become, there was one time I lost $10,000 in a single day playing online poker. This was when I was making $60k.

Fortunately, my wife chose to stay with me even after discovering that I had squandered the money gifted to us for our wedding. If you've ever been close to having 'those' thoughts, believe me, I was straddling that line pretty hard.

Somehow, I pulled myself together and just started living the ""one day at a time"" mantra. That was not easy. Sure, I was no longer wasting $500 a day online gambling, but taking the rush of gambling out of my life and going cold turkey didn't make my newfound reality and accumulated debt any more easy to live with.

The further I distanced myself from my gambling missteps, the easier things became over time.

Enter bitcoin. I had curiosity into what bitcoin was and before I started buying, I did my homework. I spent over six months reading books, listening to podcasts, getting a firm understanding of what it was so I could justify buying it. I DCA'd into my bitcoin position because knowing myself, I knew I would not emotionally be able to handle the volatility swings if instead I tried to time the market. 

My debt obligations were looming over me, but I still managed to save $50 a week which turned into $100 of btc. As my understanding of bitcoin grew, so did my conviction. I bought on dips and when I got my bonuses from work, I'd peel a little off to continue building my bitcoin position. I haven't sold a single satoshi. 

Yesterday, I found out that I got a job offer which will take my salary well into the six figures. Within the next few months, I'll be able to finish off all my gambling debt obligations without having to sell any of my bitcoin. This news coming within the same week as bitcoin hitting a new ATH. Today I cried tears of joy thinking back to how close to life's edge I had allowed myself to go during my darkest times.

Michael Saylor says that bitcoin is hope. He's fucking right it is.",1634919732,27,1

I was wondering what the best approaches are.

Currently it's all stored in an e-wallet, been there for years now.

One option I've seen is to send my currency to an exchange like kraken and converting to euro through it.

I haven't been able to find websites I'm interested in that accept btc as payment, but that'd be a fairly valid option too if I find one.

Alternatively, i heard there are crypto debit cards, which as far as i understood involve sending my crypto to the card and then i can use it to purchase things using euros. However I'm not sure if that's more convenient than cashing out with an exchange or which option is best.

If there are more options let me know. Much appreciated.

I know cashing out isn't a topic people into crypto are too fond of, but please be understanding. It's not a lot of money and I could use a small boost in cash. \^\^

The pool of new people to onboard is still [about 90% of people](https://v2.cimg.co/news/62888/33325/responsive-images/screenshot-2021-10-19-at-13-14-03-finder-cryptocurrency-adoption-index-finder-com-au___media_library_original_796_1070.png).

A lot of early adopters who had heard about Bitcoin in 2011 only decided to invest long term after the bubble in 2013.

Most people on earth only heard about Bitcoin for the first time in December of 2017. It takes repeated exposure for a new brand to become a familiar brand, and people will trust something that is familiar. It's called the [mere exposure effect](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-8721.00154), and explains why so many people remain clinging to their nice and familiar fiat money.

Despite all of the arguments people make for and against Bitcoin, the simple power of familiarity has been proven by psychologists to be an overwhelming factor in determining our preferences. There is a good summary of the research in Daniel Kahneman's ""Thinking Fast and Slow"".

The mere exposure effect will have a huge role to play in the next decade of adoption, when in 2027 most people will have heard about Bitcoin for 10 years, and it wont seem to them like ""[the current fascination with these currencies feels more like a speculative mania than it has to do with their use as an efficient and convenient form of electronic payment](https://www.rba.gov.au/education/resources/explainers/cryptocurrencies.html)"" - Reserve Bank of Australia.",1634916719,16,1

qdiulb,Misesofficial,Q&amp;A in Telegram group on Mises‚Äô content solution,"In Telegram of Mises, a discussion on decentralization started yesterday. We found it very insightful therefore we re-organized the text and share it here.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Yesterday, a community member asked a few questions on our solution towards illegal content, triggering a Q&amp;A. We found this discussion very insightful. Therefore, it will be presented to you in the following paragraphs.

Q: How does the local node determine what's illegal or not? And how do the nodes apply to those laws?

A: Nodes will comply with the laws of their home countries and will be punished if they are reported for non-compliance. And also, community members will play an important role in the governance.

Q:That's a serious risk i guess, if I try to decide to allow illegal content. Also, ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs accounts and data are not in their own hands.‚Äù .. and Mises would solve that issue I guess.. But checking content by a node (certainly if its done manually) before it gets posted.. I think this breaks what Mises try to solve?

A: The content will not be only stored on one node, there will be a lot of nodes. If, for example, a pic violates the law where a node is located, this node will delete this pic on its storage, but not the other nodes. If user post content which is considered illegal all around the word, then it shouldn‚Äôt be public, right? And we think how a node acts depends on the people that run this node, they can also decide to accept all the content even if facing a potential legal problem. And we think this is how freedom and regulation reach the equilibrium, by game.

Q: I understand, but ‚Äúthe nodes think‚Äù again.. how do they ‚Äúthink‚Äù .. how do they check the content when its encrypted? There is no preview you said. How can the node owner decide and check what's illegal or not? so send a request to a node would require a preview of the content right, otherwise, again‚Ä¶. how does the node knows whats illegal?

A: The chances that your content would trigger reviewing depends on the people who run the node. Most people would not want to host content which is illegal in their resident country, but some people don‚Äôt.

qdhmqk,Fiach_Dubh,Bitcoin Subreddit Ad Fund Proposal: BITCOIN YouTube Channel - AMA,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/c/BITC0IN

Short Contract Proposal:

Purpose: To ensure that the current format of the BITCOIN channel stays the same. What is this format?  The format of each video closely aligns with the Bitcoin subreddit rules. No ads, no sponsors, no unnecessary ego‚Äôs explaining what is self explanatory, no shitcoins, no shilling.

Each video aims to be a short clip of 5-10 minutes showcasing current and relevant discussion highlights on the topic of Bitcoin from all over the web. This helps to boost the signal of Bitcoin only content creators, while also documenting the public discourse in real time as an anthropological video anthology-archive. 

Current Exposure: 6.6 million views, 500+ Bitcoin Video‚Äôs, 59000 Subscribers.

The cost: 1 Bitcoin

Justification for cost: This is how much the channel can generate within one year of being monetized through YouTube‚Äôs partnership program. Note: The channel has been demonetized by YouTube and has been denied after reapplication - https://imgur.com/a/AEUCeHO

Duration of Contract: Greater then 1 year and for as long as the BITCOIN channel is owned and operated by Fiach_Dubh 

What does r/Bitcoin get: 

1. The beginning of each video will start with 3 seconds of the iconic r/bitcoin Join Us image. Other options are available. Example: https://youtu.be/CqSFG8noqMs

2. https://reddit.com/r/bitcoin would be the second link in the description of each video

3. Other functions may be available for community promotion or messaging with this channel that the r/bitcoin mod team may decide upon at a future time.

4. Feedback on direction of the channel is always welcome from the r/bitcoin mod team. My long term vision for the channel is to open it up to multiple Bitcoin only contributors. They would have admin rights to upload their own content provided it follows the same ethos as outlined above. 

Thank you for your consideration,

qdh5bw,manugnr,A few questions before setup my coldcard,"Hi guys!

Recently I bought a coldcard and I was only testing it. Now, I want to setup it correctly and use it as my official cold storage. Before that, i have a few questions:

(About PIN)

1-I readed that it's recommend to use a 4-4 pin but a 3-3 pin it's still safe? Because 3-3 pin could be more memorable.

2-Do you recommend backup the pin on paper? Obviously not with the seed backup. Anyway, if you forget the pin, while you have the seed you just could bought another coldcard or wallet and you can recover / move your founds.

(Passphrase)

3-Do you always recommend to use a passphrase? I mean, it's cool that if anyone find your seed, you are still safe because you have a passphrase and it gives you time to move your founds but I have fear of forget it. Other option it's backup the passphrase on paper like the pin, but it's good?

(About seed)

This step really it's optional. I want to manually generate my seed to ""don't trust anyone"" and to have a really randomly seed.

4-I ""manually"" generated a seed following the next guide [seed generation](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/diy-bitcoin-private-key-project). I followed all steps but in a tails USB and in an old computer that i don't use. The ""problem"" could be that after that, i used this computer to navigate on internet. Always with tails and tor but it could be unsafe, really? Another option that i thinked it's generate a 23 seed with the dices, manually convert the binary to decimal numbers and write the words. After that, i could enter the 23 words and use one of the options that coldcard offers (the checksum of 23 words). I think that it's more safe because you don't have to use a computer or any online device.

For now there are all my questions. I hope that anyone can help me and give me your opinion.",1634909932,8,1

qdh3x6,jankis2020,Bitcoin is Total Peace,"‚ÄúHistory‚Äù as we understand it begins with human beings trying to keep track of who owned what. Cuneiform Tablets and Hammurabi‚Äôs Code in Mesopotamia are the some of the oldest examples of writing and law. And were they trying to do? They were trying to establish ownership of, and mediate disputes about property. 

Living things understand property implicitly. Lobsters, finches, wolves, bears - every creature is territorial. They possess the resources they need to possess to thrive and reproduce and then they defend these resources against interlopers and confiscation. 

In pre-history, we lived in hunter-gather tribes under 150 people (Dunbar‚Äôs number). ‚ÄúProperty‚Äù was understood in this simple animalistic sense, and the property records, so to speak, were kept in the tribe‚Äôs collective consciousness and defended by interpersonal violence. 

As the tokenization of time (money) allowed us to cooperate with strangers, we were able to scale up society beyond 150 people we actually know. This was a phase change for humanity, and it required written records and organized government. We could plan into the future, we could store crops for next year, but this increased the temptation for strong people‚Äôs to violate property rights. This threat of attack creates the demand for defense, and so government is born. 

War is the method by which we determine who gets to write the record of who owns what. Total war happens when the technology of war changes enough to throw off existing conventions of war. 

The difference between today and ancient Mesopotamia is really only scale. Our technological advancements have allowed us to do the same thing (government and written records of property) with many more people. 

This is why Bitcoin changes everything. It is only the second time we‚Äôve made such a fundamental leap in how property is established and defended. 

We have completely replaced violence with energy and cryptography. 

We have replaced alterable and forge able records with unalterable, unforgeable records. 

At no point in human history has the world order been safe from attack and/or coercion by the biggest bully. 

Until now. 

Human history is just a long line of violable property rights being violated. 

With Bitcoin, we leave the age of Total War, and enter the age of Total Peace.",1634909806,52,1

qg6gsa,Ok_Ground3302,Back Again: Third-Largest Bitcoin Whale Bought $37 Million in BTC," After staying on the sidelines for a few weeks, the third-largest Bitcoin whale has purchased another sizeable chunk of BTC.   
One of the largest BTC whales has resumed its accumulation appetite by buying more than $37 million worth of the primary cryptocurrency. This comes after a few weeks of untypical silence.   
CryptoQuant‚Äôs analyst going by the Twitter handle VentureFounder outlined the most recent purchase earlier today.   
As the address associated with this whale shows, they bought 596 bitcoins at an average price of $62,934. This means that they spent just over $37.5 million in total.   
Interestingly, this purchase comes after a lack of serious activity in the past few weeks.Previously, the whale made multiple purchases and sales in accordance with BTC‚Äôs price movements.

3rd-Largest Bitcoin Whale Address Activity. Source: Twitter   
For example, they sold substantial portions when the cryptocurrency surged above $60,000 in They began to reaccumulate when the asset lost half of its USD value in the following months.   
Most recently, they sold some bitcoins at $56,000 earlier this month before repurchasing them a day later at a higher price.   
It‚Äôs worth noting that the current rally, which saw BTC going from $40,000 at the end of September to a new ATH at $67,000 last week, was mainly caused by such whales making large purchases, at least according to on-chain data.

I‚Äôve been in bitcoin since 2014 so, fairly well convinced alread and probably part of the echo chamber, but I‚Äôd be interested in peoples opinions on this podcast episode (for context last week he had max Keiser on). https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-david-mcwilliams-podcast/182-why-now-is-the-time-to-go-for-a-wage-rise/

Just the first 18 mins or so. Trigger warning, he is a proponent of mmt and does drop the f word in description of crypto enthusiasts, so if you are easily triggered skip it

His main arguments against bitcoin and for fiat are

The renaissance problems when the Black Plague hit prevented political solutions as they were tied to the gold standard.
The Great Depression only ended because Roosevelt abandoned the gold standard in the 1930
German rise of nazism was caused by the financial difficulties and civil unrest of the time
If we did not have fiscal flexibility and the ability to print money there would have been riots during the pandemic.

Hope posting this is not against the rules, would really be interested in your opinions and rebuttals.",1635254458,36,1

I understand that miners are hashing block headers while increasing the nonce to find an output lower than the target, but before that a miner needs to grab transactions from the Memory Pool to form their Merkle Root. 

Let‚Äôs say person A sends some BTC to person B (Txn 1). I decide to include my Txn 1 within my block and calculate my Merkle root. After several minutes someone else on the chain publishes a block solution that also has that contains Txn 1. What do I do? Do I just simply remove Txn 1 and recalculate my Merkle Root and start at Nonce = 0 again? Also if the other miners block has 0 confirmations how can we ensure it is not a fraudulent block? If it is, what happens to Txn 1? Thanks",1635249173,13,1

qg4c7a,No_Yogurtcloset_2547,Centralization of bitcoin mining is upon us. Why is noone talking about this?,"I know this is not something positive but I feel like these kind of topics are not brought to discussion frequently enough. It's not a secret that bitcoin mining is being institutionalized. For all we know, most of the hashrate is in the hands of a few companies - many of which are even publicly listed. There are reports of multiple big players onboarding more and more machines, resulting in not only steep increases in hashrate hence network security (which is a positive) but also a clear step towards centralization. There are single players that already govern several EH/s with their current equipment - which amounts to several percent of total hashrate. Just check out Genesis Digital Assets or some other big company that plan to at one point in the following years add another 200,000 ASIC to reach a hashrate that may be in the double digit percentage range. Of course other players will follow suit hence the relative impact on centralization is absorbed a little bit and it is unlikely that one single company will provide more than a couple percent to total hashrate. Nevertheless, in the grad scheme of things, everyone that doesnt add ASIC miners to their inventory will be left behind so in the end it is very much a significant centralizing step.

What are your opinions on the obvious centralization of bitcoin mining which is going away from retail into the direction of institutions - many of which are publicly traded hence need to obey to certain laws and regulations. On the positive is the increase in hashrate and security, as well as the possibility to more closely monitor energy expenditure and percentage of renewables that are being used for mining. This ultimately increases acceptance and leads to a positive public image of bitcoin overall.  
On the negative it is centralizing a crucial part of the bitcoin network and sort of putting it under the control of not only a handful of companies aka people but also under the control of organisations that control these companies/people. Thoughts?",1635247733,33,1

Anonymity, verifying public ownership, setting hard currency limits etc. - all those aren't needed either. Even smart contracts don't require blockchains should they want to implement those.

qg01cr,UnitGod,What a process it has been..,"So, a friend could only pay me $60 he owed using Bitcoin.  I have a Coinbase Account and the Coinbase Wallet App on my iPhone.  I used my *college* email to make my coinbase account some 4-7 years ago and have not been active on CB at all in 2-3 years.  My college email was subsequently shut down without my having seen any notification of so (if there was any) so I have had no way of logging into my college email tied to the CB account to reset.

To make maters worse, my sister sold me her iPhone XR for just $300 just under a year ago.  I of course accepted and moved on. Many 0f my 2FA Authentifications were on this old iPhone, but I would only need it from time to time.  Had to set a time with my parents to go over there and find my old phone - which I did and which had Auth working perfectly.

So now I was able to move to the ID Verifcation step and for the life of me it would not accept my Cherokee Nation Tribal ID.  This is a VALID identification card I would be able to use anythwere..  It wouldn't even scan the back properly.  My NEW drivers license was still to come in the mail since you can do it that way now and my old one had expired. It finally arrived today and I used two great pictures of my DL.

Now, the process I thought that would allow me to set a new 2FA up on my new phone and a new email attached to the account wasn't just that.  So now I have to wait manually for up to 22 hours for them to verify that I am indeed me.  This has been such a process and frustrating at multiple times.

Any advice or input on the situation going forward? Thanks!

Is that done at a 3rd party level, i.e. a company like Strike that uses LN decided how this batching is done, or is it at a lower level, like the LN itself?

qfot8j,titi1992ks,Are we at the top of this Bitcoin cycle?,"Many Bitcoin maxis are saying that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 this year and some others are saying that BTC will reach $200,000. Today I saw an article where Richard Heart says that BTC top was at $ 65,000 and now we are in a bull trap - just before BTC drops to $10,000 according to him. I never actually heard of this guy before but he is arguing what he is saying pretty well. He is saying that he has always been accurate in his predictions, including 2017.

He says that all those guys that have these fan fiction **theories ""the price can't go** below the cost of mining"", think that the cost of mining holds the price up. But he says that didn't last cycle and won't this cycle.

He says that mining price follows the price it doesn't lead it. ""People look at trailing indicators and think they're leading indicators like google search volume. You can't trade the google search volume because it's a trailing indicator, not a leading indicator.  These are reflexive systems they do not have base demand. You do not have to pay your rent in crypto it is a purely speculative play"".  
Here's how he explains his argument that BTC will crush to $10,000. He says that we are on a bull trap right now using the ""hockey stick rule"" and ""the psychology of a market bubble run-up dump"".

""Well basically in a reflexive system you have a parabolic rise up and what that means is that you make larger candles in shorter time frames. So candles have you know usually you're watching the daily candle weekly candle and they get longer and longer and longer and shorter and shorter time frame and it looks like a hockey stick. 

And when you finally fall out of the parabola the rule of thumb is that you drop 85 percent of the move. But in Bitcoin, you don't just drop 85 percent of the move normally you drop 85 percent of the total. So we have seen hockey stick run-up fall out drop 85 percent **over and over and over again and you** know what else we normally see there's a chart you can google called the psychology of a market bubble run-up dump. The bull trap this is where we are now in my opinion"".  


I'm not quite sure guys just wanted to share this with you and get your opinion on the matter. Could we really be at the top at the moment? Or is there more to come in this cycle.

I‚Äôve wanted to invest since 3k per BTC days back in spring 2018 (wanted to buy 3 whole bitcoins at the time) but the government don‚Äôt allow claimants to invest so it meant losing my income (around ¬£500/$700 a month) if I did go ahead, I didn‚Äôt, which I regret that every day. 

Years later that 3 bitcoin would of been serious house contribution purchasing money and I feel sick to my stomach! Lol, oh well that‚Äôs hindsight for you. 

Since the price has gone wild and I‚Äôve now got the genius idea of stopping my disability benefit and dumping 20k (compensation money sitting in a trust earning zero interest being eroded by inflation) into bitcoin at all time highs and hoping it doubles, triples or more within the next 10 years.

But the sensible side of my brain tells me I‚Äôm an idiot, not only am I going to lose my income/disability(which was extremely difficult to get onto and will struggle to get again), but also all my savings if it crashes.

The fixed supply is the one of the main reasons we all expect massive gains in the next decade.

We still have a ways to go before we see mass adoption, but in the short time that BTC has existed a strange occurrence is happening: People are losing their BTC ***forever***.

Arguably, several million BTC has been lost to the void already (20% of the total supply by some estimations). One might argue that the early adopters of yesteryear were well-equipped to secure their BTC properly given the technical knowledge required to overcome the learning curve.

If and when we see real mass adoption, isn't it safe to assume that we'll see another surge in lost BTC? Will the average retail investor be able to dodge scams, adequately protect their keys, etc, or should we expect several more millions of BTC forever lost?

Now flash forward 50 or 100 years and who knows what the circulating supply will be. Half of all the BTC ever in existence disappearing sounds great because it should, in theory, send the value skyrocketing.

Is there a scenario where the remaining supply is too concentrated amongst a handful of entities and thus rendered useless? 

Or will BTC survive despite the supply shock thanks to divisibility of BTC down to individual sats?",1635185600,36,1

qfm0xw,ButtaScotchBaws,Spinning up full node,"Hello all,

So I'm a first year CS student, (second degree, approaching 'how do you do fellow kids' territory) and I think I'm to the point where I think I can start writing a side project. What I want to do, (and what I think a node will provide me) is spin up my own node, and utilize the transaction data running through my node, and program something to play around with that data, try to map trends, backtest models, etc. 

First question I suppose (because there is so much info on how to start a node, and almost nothing on what it actually looks like running/what data you can pull from it), does a node actually generate/provide lists/CSV's of some sort that I can pull onto external storage (live data analysis might be a next semester challenge) and then utilize?

Second question barring a 'no' answer for question one, what kind of data will I be able to pull? I assume wallet addresses to and from, time of transaction, and size? 

Any insight or experience would be great appreciated before I pull the trigger on purchasing components, I want to make sure I get some ROI in the terms of a project/resume building, (maybe even stumbling on some profitable patterns)

Thanks!",1635183518,20,1

But recent rumours are suggesting the Pension fund class might be getting into the Bitcoin environment. Technically Pension funds are normally placed in the most safest asset class possible. For eg QIC (AUS pension fund house worth $69B) are open to invest in the crypto currency in the future.

Global Pension Funds has a total of a whopping $35T AUM. A fraction of this could be a huge boost towards the crypto currency ecosystem.

On the one hand, there are reasons for the growth, including demand from institutional investors, favorable statements from U.S. politicians who do not intend to strictly ban cryptocurrencies, and statements from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell who does not intend to ban cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, all this does not 100% guarantee further growth. Many are finding the situation a bit confusing and are considering the possibility of a more stable income. This is where fintech companies come in handy, paying high annual returns to owners of stable coins. As a result, USDT, USDC, DAI and BUSD play an integral and legitimate role in stabilizing the market.

qdyqh1,mimblezimble,Citizenship-based taxation of Bitcoin capital gains,"The USA is exceptional in its insistence of taxing citizens who no longer live in the country. No other (serious) country does that. I personally know a few Americans who live abroad and don't seem to care about taxes, but they are probably just low-value targets. The IRS seems to really go after important targets. For example:

&gt;In **October 2020**,  John McAfee was arrested in Spain when he was about to board a plane to  Turkey, and **accused of failing to file tax returns for four years**,  despite earning millions from consulting work, speaking engagements,  crypto-currencies and selling the rights to his life story.Jun 23, 2021

McAfee even died in his cell while awaiting extradition to the USA.

So, sometimes they really mean it.

In my impression, Americans with substantial Bitcoin capital gains could be an enforcement target, and find themselves on the receiving end of attempts to arrest, extradite, and deport them back to the USA, wherever they may be on the globe. Merely failing to file the yearly documents is apparently enough for the IRS to get you locked you up in a foreign detention center. Spain is apparently all too happy to oblige. They do not even care that you unceremoniously die there. I wonder what they did with McAfee's dead body? Maybe they even saved money by feeding it to the fish in the Mediterranean?

Given the fact that other countries do not see the legitimacy in taxing non-resident nationals, how does the USA justify its policy? Is every other country on the planet wrong in that regard?",1634967458,19,1

Today, derivatives are more prevalent and more and more people started speculating with insane leverage to make it all back in one trade and looking for home runs. Chad money is also entering the market looking for fat gains. Which changes the dynamics of the game.

supply shock dynamics play out just as before but just when it's on the verge of going parabolic and entering the mania phase, over leveraged casino apes start to add more and more leverage because ""100k in 2 days for sure"" and whales with super deep pockets see this and take the other side of the trade driving the price lower to liquidate them. 

  
Which affects the spot markets too, Whales would hedge their bags with perps taking massive short position (delta neutral), Move coins to spot exchanges and dump them driving the price lower and let the short ride (net short), Baby whales would dump their spot bags too. Degenerate leverage traders would pile in and go 100x too because ""muh TA"", and finally people with very little conviction (paper hands) would see the price drop and join the party panic selling either to cut losses or to book whatever little profit they made (before bear market because apparently every pull back is one that would start the bear market) exacerbating the pull back/dump. Basically what happened just after the recent ATH breakout and the prior 65k top.   


I guess the TLDR would be:  
From here on out, Bitcoin will continue to set new ATH's and climb higher but it will not be the price action that we are used to (No parabolic mania phases or short lived ones). Just stair stepping up with occasional pull backs that liquidate degenerate gamblers. bumpy ride with lots of drama and the only real winners would be diamond hands hodlers and the Michael Saylors of the world.",1634960793,52,1

I know sound really dumb now. 
But I‚Äôm here to understand what are the risks associated with this event. 
He made me open a wallet with blockchain.con, then I shared log in credentials and then he asked me to change the password to be ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. 
I know it‚Äôs useless to change it because if he has the seed phrase can recreate the wallet. 
Then he made me purchase BTC with paybis and send them to the addresses provided by him .


The money are gone forever, but the wallet is still shared between me and him. The seed phrase probably has been saved by him. I‚Äôm not going to use that wallet ever again but I would like to know if there could be problems having this compromised wallet.

Another bold prediction! Rest assured that this has not been without some hours of research. So far, the two previous price and date prediction attempts have been 50/50, but both price predictions have been 100%. Could this be the third time?

On the daily chart above, the price action has printed a new all-time high. A close above the orange line is now needed to confirm support for the previous all-time high.

By 25 October, the trade is confirmed if it closes at $59,000 or above, and invalidated if it falls below $59,000. Why is it important? A close here would print the first full weekly candle above the previous all-time high. This is incredibly bullish. Please see the weekly chart below.

If you can buy from $58.5k, that's terrific, but the current level of $60.1k is very strong support.

The first target is to reach $85k by 20 November (purple circle).

qeum1a,JZA80-Michael,Bitcoin Core Wallet Recovery,"  

 Hey, 

I am looking for a little bit of advice in regards to recovering a bitcoin core wallet from an old laptop, due to the age of the system and an issue I am having with getting 100% hard drive usage I am not confident I will be able to update bitcoin core before the laptop‚Äôs hard drive fails as bitcoin core is around 8 years out behind on the system so I am considering taking a copy of the wallet.dat file and moving it to a new system with an up to date version of bitcoin core but I have a few questions in regards to this.

1. Since I am in the UK where bitcoin core is no longer available for download should I just use my VPN to access a region where it can be downloaded or take a copy of  the original .exe file from the downloads on my old laptop and use that to install it on one of my newer systems?

2. Do I have to use bitcoin core or can I move and access the wallet.dat file from a different wallet program?

3. Since I can just open bitcoin core on the laptop I am assuming I don‚Äôt have a password on it but could there be encryption on it that may prevent me from loading the wallet.dat file on a new system?  I don‚Äôt remember setting it but that‚Äôs not to say I didn‚Äôt so is there was a way to check this?

4. Since the copy of the wallet will on both systems does that mean that as long as there's bitcoin in that wallet it would be technically visible on both machines (if the laptop‚Äôs bitcoin core was up to date)?

5. Are there another methods of recovering this wallet I should consider or is this the best option?

Thanks 

Michael

Just a side note, the 100% hard drive usage is an intermittent issue where it either maxes out or is very high with basic processes, with bitcoin core running if any other processes start up in the background like windows ones it will max out the hard drive which means updating bitcoin core goes at a snail‚Äôs pace, I have tried many different methods to resolve this but I think that the hard drive is just too old at this point.",1635089964,4,1

qeu3j7,Amichateur,"[Awareness/Proposal] The multitude of different ""derivation paths"" in BIP32 Bitcoin wallets causes incompatibility all around when it comes to wallet seed restore operation for non-tech-savy users.","*NOTE: Purpose of this post is to draw attention to a possibility for improving Bitcoin and its wallet ecosystem constructively, so please do not blindly hate and downvote based on a false understanding that this is harmful criticisms. It is not. Negating a fruitful constructive dialogue would be harmful.*

-------

Nowadays different BIP32 wallets use different derivation paths. This means that even with a properly backupped seed a non-tech-savy user may see zero balance when restoring this seed with another wallet even if that wallet advertises to use the same BIP32-based hierarchical deterministic wallet.

Reason for this ""mess"" is partly historical, partly programmer lazyness, partly proprietariness:     
BIP32 and hierarchical wallet methods have evolved over time, and depending when the wallet came out, different derivation paths were used. Some wallet programmers seem to prefer short derivation paths not following BIP32 recommendations apparently to save some lines of code in implementation efforts. Again other wallets find special reasons for using proprietary non-standard derivation paths for special purposes (e.g. Samourai).

See https://walletsrecovery.org for details.

Nowadays, derivation paths most common and recommended by BIP32 are

- m/44'/0'/0'
- m/49'/0'/0'
- m/84'/0'/0'

for the three bitcoin address formats, respectively.

But others still exist for legacy reasons, like     

- m/0' (e.g. BRD wallet, Multibit HD wallet)
- m/0'/0' (bitcoin core, historically)
- m/44'/0'/n' (blockchain.com proprietary)
- m/44'/n'/0' (n=0, 1, 133, 145)
- m/84'/0'/n'
- m/49/0/X (note the missing ' everywhere!)
- m/47'/0'/0'
- m/45'/...
- m/48'/...

Note that n and X above denote variables from 0 to 2147483647, whereas m is a fixed letter that stands for ""master"". The ' stands for ""hardened"" and is also written as h or H is some implementations.

Since the number on each derivation path level can go from 0 to 2147483647 and can be with or without the ' , and since there can be an (almost?) arbitrary number of levels, the number of derivation paths is practically endless, and checking all of them would take an astronomical amount of times longer than the age of the universe even with all computer power on earth. Therefore it is not possible for any wallet to check all possible derivation paths when the user restores a wallet seed.

Therefore we can assume that wallets only check for ""their own"" derivation path(s) when a wallet seed is restored, and this means that they might be missing bitcoins if the seed was formerly used in another wallet SW/HW.

We do not know how BIP32 will evolve in the future. Maybe in 10 years from now today's mainstream derivation paths will be obsolete and not checked any more by default by standard wallets.

Therefore, everybody making a wallet seed backup is also strongly advised to back up the derivation path and the algorithm. Or at least noting next to the seed which wallet SW and which wallet version this seed was used with.

From wallet SW and BIP standardisation point of view it is desirable that

- (a) A new ""BIP nnn"" is created that defines sets of derivation paths (like the ones listed above) that are used/checked for a given wallet seed, and
- (b1) A wallet SW that calls itself ""BIP nnn version R compliant for restore"" must check for all these derivation paths upon wallet seed restore, such that no funds are lost or missed, and
- (b2) A wallet SW that calls itself ""BIP nnn version U compliant for own seed usage"" must guarantee not to use other derivation paths than those listed in ""BIP nnn ver. U when operating on a self generated seed.
- (b3) A wallet SW should also display the BIP nnn version U for every wallet in use such that the user knows that for a later restore he needs a wallet SW whose BIP nnn version R for restore is at least &gt;= U.


W.r.t. (a), this BIP nnn should be updated (i.e. the list of derivation paths extended) whenever a wallet wants to use derivation paths not yet in this list. Then this wallet should apply for a new BIP nnn version.

Then the BIP nnn should be versioned every time the set of seeds is enhanced.


Then, w.r.t. (b), a wallet SW/HW can advertise to be ""compliant to BIP nnn version R for seed restoration"" (higher R = better for compatibility) and ""compliant to BIP nnn version U"" w.r.t. derivation path usage for self-generated seeds (lower U = better for compatibility).",1635088404,103,1

qetz1k,3Comma_Research,Grid Trading Strategy,"Grid trading strategy is important as it can help you maximize your profit in a ranging sideways market with no clear direction. In this article, we will share with you what is grid trading and how to get started as well as some trading tips.

You can also watch our YouTube video below or download the [PPT file](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSswywSE2qNbMkitEwehGHxupmQlk1FwwKkjikqVtkoqFRo1fuRMTW6rVMt2P9uGWx-YUQwhou7EC5F/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000).

&gt;***What is grid trading?***

To put it simply, grid trading can help you take advantage of the market volatility and earn profits for you.

All markets involve volatility ‚Äî even when there is a clear uptrend or downtrend, volatility still exists. Let‚Äôs have a look at this chart.

*Processing img 27495dq2yev71...*

What if we can take advantage of this volatility and make profits? Let‚Äôs say if we can constantly buy low and sell high, that would be ideal, right? That‚Äôs exactly what grid trading does for you. It is not feasible for us human beings to watch the trading all the time as we need to sleep, we need to go out for date, we need to have fun, right? So why not have someone else do the job for you?

That‚Äôs exactly what grid trading does. It is a systematic approach that can automate the buying and selling process. All you need to do is to set up a price range and interval and then the trading bot will do its job.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***What is price range and interval?***

A ***price range*** means you need to decide a range for the bot to trade. And an ***interval*** means you need to let the bot know how often a buy or sell instruction is implemented. For example, if we set up the interval at $1,000, we are basically telling the bot to place buy orders at every $1,000 below the current market price of Bitcoin, while also placing sell orders at every $1,000 above the Bitcoin‚Äôs market price.

*Processing img 62cj7y35yev71...*

&gt;***How price ranges and interval affect your P&amp;L?***

As you can guess, grid trading performs the best when the market is trading sideways and when prices fluctuate in a given range. The more grids you set up, the narrower the interval will be, and thus the more frequently the trades will be executed. However, it also means the profit you make from each trade is lower.

Thus, it is a tradeoff between making small profits from many trades, versus a strategy with lower frequency but generates a bigger profit per order.

Let‚Äôs see some examples. Here are two screenshots we get from KuCoin grid trading bot. Both bots have the same price range. On the LHS chart, you can see if we set the number of placed orders at 100, then profits per grid are between 0.30‚Äì0.69%, while if we set the number of placed orders at 50, profits per grid will be between 0.77‚Äì1.55%. So how to set up these parameters is quite important if you want to maximize your return.

&gt;***How to do grid trading?***

Please check out our step-by-step YouTube video below on how to start grid trading.How to do grid trading

*Processing video aon45dmcyev71...*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***Trading tips***

1. *Use the assets you already own when starting the grid trading*: if this button is turned off, that means the bot needs to buy some BTC when the trading starts, which could slightly increase your cost. If you turn on this button and have enough both BTC and USDT, you don‚Äôt need to place any orders at the beginning which effectively increases your money usage efficiency and lowers your cost. Therefore, the KuCoin official suggested we turn that function on if we do the grid trading.

*Processing img hsd5lo7gyev71...*

2. *Use Token/BTC rather than Token/USDT pair*: So that you can not only enjoy the increase in BTC amount but also the BTC price increase. But how to choose which pair we want to trade? If you go to the dropdown button, you can see all the token/BTC pairs and you can rank them by volatility. We want to use those with higher volatility.

But at the same time, we also need to pay attention to the price change. We don‚Äôt want to use those coins that have already seen a big price increase.

*Processing img kdn8c0jiyev71...*

3. *Profits from grid trading include two parts: grid profits and floating P&amp;L*.

* A reasonable entry price: Floating P&amp;L can affect your overall return so if you believe a token price is already at a high level, don‚Äôt rush into the grid trading. Instead, you can wait for a reasonable price to get in.
* A reasonable price range: Try to make sure the token price will not leave your price range in the next few days. If the price range is too narrow, even small price fluctuations will result in your bot stopping working.
* A reasonable number of grid: More grids means profits in each grid is low, barely covering the trading fee in the worst case. But when the grid is too wide, orders may not trigger very often.

qesvrk,itsalongwaydown2,Over the counter decentralized BTC exchange,"There is a problem getting money in and out of the crypto eco system with regards to taxes and fees.  My idea is to create a peer to peer trust network where people can exchange fiat for crypto to cut out the middle man like Binance or whoever.

I am wondering if there is a way to build a trust network on the ETH chain where you can see person ""x"" has a 100x transaction and is a verified trusted party.

There are people that want to get funds out of the crypto eco-system without a paper trail and likewise others want to get into the crypto eco-system without dealing with local regulatory restraints and fees.  This seems like it could be a cool solution.

I imagine each country would have its own small trust network.  For example, in Canada you can easily send e transfer between Canadian bank accounts.  However, getting money onto exchanges can be complicated and expensive.  If anyone wants to begin talking about this within the Canadian context hit me up.  I am interested in doing this in an informal sense prior to building up any software.

Basically, it would be a small group of people that build up trust and exchange crypto for fiat as needed.  We could start with transactions as small as $50 or $100 and send in tranches to reduce risk exposure.",1635084488,8,1

1 - Most Mt Gox victims that was a weak hand was offered to sale his position to a third party for 14000$ in 2018. Majority did. So very few of the victims should sell at ""any"" price.

2 - There are big institutionals that are buying. They can swallow this 144000 BTC.

3 - The liquidator will be sending most of the 144000 BTC to Exchanges wallets of the victims. Previously the liquidator was selling the BTCs and it was suspected of crashing the market.

144000 BTC is a lot. Last week it took only 840 BTC to create the flash crash to 8500$ at Binance.us because their order book on the spot Exchange is 2000 BTCs at the most at anytime.

Now something that has been always crossing through my mind is, how come no one believes that BTC is being or can be controlled via stable coin printing/injection/buy/sell orders? Tether is being created in astronomical amounts just like the U.S dollar is being printed blindly.

We all know how exchanges do everything in their will to liquidate their customers. The BTC flash crash that happened over binance U.S is something to be taken VERY seriously imo.

q853wv,Truce_VR,Fiat Inflation Tax and Capital Gains Tax - A Post Bitcoin World,"Just a reminder to everyone, as we live in a world of double digit inflation, that inflation raises the price of all assets by the amount the currency was devalued. A 90% loss in a currency's purchasing power raises the price of your assets by 1,000%, which means you lose 25% of your portfolio due to capital gains. If you include the risk that your assets may not even rise faster than inflation - a doubly whammy - then you get the following scenario below:

***Example:*** *Bob retired with a net worth of 1M USD. He owns a 500K house, 250K in stocks, and 250K in cash. From 2020 - 2040 the Federal Reserve expands the money supply by 1,000%, lowing the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar by -90%. The IRS sets a 25% capital gains tax. Assume Bob's house appreciates by 300%, stocks by 600%, and cash by 0%. Bob's net worth in the year 2040 is 325,000 USD:*

*0.1 \* (500,000 + (1,500,000 \* 0.75) + 250,000 + (1,500,000 \* 0.75) + 250,000) = 325,000*

**Simply by the Federal Reserve inflating the currency and IRS setting capital gains tax that does not discount for inflation, Bob loses approximately 70% of his net worth in 20 years.** Another cycle of this and Bob's children basically inherits nothing from Bob's original 1M USD net worth. Keep this in mind for your children's welfare when holding property, assets, art, and other store of value goods.",1634234415,4,1

I have never completed a BTC spend, but I have received 17 BTC payments. 

I have Bitcoin core installed and synced, and I got the Celsius address lined up. I hit ""usable balance"" with ""subtract fee from amount"" checked, set the recommended fee for a 7 day transfer, entered my decryption password and I am getting ""Insufficient funds.""

Doing a little reading, apparently the fee is denominated in BTC/kVB which is not the same as the price of the transaction. So I am guessing I have to manually calculate the fee? How do I know how many kB it will take up? I did a little reading and saw that transaction size has to do with the number of inputs and outputs... so does that mean this will be a large transaction because it involves 17 outputs? 

Also, the wallet supports Segwit, which makes me wonder if there is anything special I have to do to make it a Segwit transaction and so face a lower fee. As of now, I don't know how to actually set up the transaction so that I end up with 0 BTC in my wallet and all the BTC on Celsius.

Sorry to bust your bubble, but that's just not true anymore, unless you already have significant money.

Note: Emphasis on **generational wealth by stacking SATS**.

&amp;nbsp;

Some maths. Do you like a price of $10m? OK, let's take that as our target goal. People might object, or argue it will happen in a long time, but let's stick with it as a best case scenario. Starting price, let's assume $60k. Or better, let's say we get another 150x on money invested from here. ($10m/$60k ~ 150x, if we assume some uncertainty in end price.)

Right, so that 150x is what you'll get. To get to $1m, you need $7k **today**. And I know that $1m sounds like a lot, but it's a lot less than you may think. One thing for sure, that's no generational wealth, in the sense that you can pass it down many generations. Depending on where you live, that might not even be enough for a family house! (So to bust you bubble once more, even in those high cost of living areas your parents probably already own a family house... hardly generational wealth, right?)

Oh, and all of this is assuming you have $7k today to invest. Which not many do. Do you want true generational wealth, say in excess of $10m? You'll need to buy **1 whole coin** today.

Stacking SATS at $50 a pop? Great savings strategy, but don't fool yourself about riches.

&amp;nbsp;

All of the above is true if you invest **today**. What if you stack SATS @ $90k? $150k? $250k? You get the picture.

And ofc I didn't even start talking about the time it will take you. Let's say we get to $10m/coin in ~40yrs. Right, so now you have generational wealth and... you slaved your life away. Enjoy spending that money to treat all the health problems you accumulated until retirement.

&amp;nbsp;

I stack SATS like many, and encourage everyone do the same, including running your own node and having full control of your keys, but I'm under no illusion that those SATS will become ""generational wealth"".

q7f2de,goathen,"Printing machines go brrrrrr, and I don't mind","Something many people don't realize about inflationary fiat: It's actually a very progressive form of taxation. Let me explain. If a country wants to raise $100 million for bridges they can essentially do it two ways: collect the money through taxes or simply crank up the money machines and print it. If they choose the latter, they'll cause a tiny bit of inflation roughly equivalent over time to the money they printed. Essentially, the money printer ""taxes"" every single dollar in existence by a small amount.

The burden of normal taxation falls heavily on the middle class. Most taxes are applied to income, so only us working schlubs pay it. There are other taxes of course: property taxes, capital gains, etc. But most billionaires pay little to none, and their pots of capital grow ever fuller. Taxation via the money printer, on the other hand, applies a tiny inflation ""tax"" to every single dollar in existence, tapping from every one of the billionaire's tax-sheltered investments and off-shore accounts. Us schlubs feel the sting of inflation too, but the pain is so much more disbursed through the inflation tax. My pockets are relatively empty, so I'd much rather pay a 3% inflation tax than a 50% income tax. 

There are many aspects of bitcoin that are great‚Äîwhat an innovation!‚Äîand anyone with a brain will rightfully try to avoid paying inflation tax whenever possible. But the long-term implications are nuanced and worthy of discussion. If a substantial portion of the global economy moves to Bitcoin, the need for traditional taxation will increase (which is why the U.S. appears to be leaning toward allowing Bitcoin to thrive while increasing KYC+close scrutiny for capital gains tax purposes). If Bitcoin is successful enough to take the inflation ""tax"" away from governments entirely, we can expect the alternative forms of taxation to hit us sub-billionaire schlubs the hardest. 

(Note: This is not a conversation about the wisdom of how governments spend money. If you think your government is corrupt, wasteful, etc., then fix the government. That's a separate discussion. Taking away the money printer doesn't fix the government; there are a million forms of other taxation‚Äîdirect or otherwise‚Äîthat will always take its place.)",1634143037,41,1

Let's suppose that one of the big banks in the US has an about-face on Bitcoin and all of a sudden realizes ""Holy smokes, this is the greatest asset in the history of humanity!  I want all of it!""  So, they set about trying to figure out how to snatch up as much Bitcoin as possible as cheaply as possible.  The bank decides to do the following: Figure out which mining companies are publicly traded, determine how many of those comprise 51% of the total has rate, and then set about purchasing 51% of the available publicly traded stock for those companies.  In essence, this big bank has decided to absorb the Bitcoin network by become the majority stock holder for mining companies that exert the majority of the hashing for the network.  Instead of a totally decentralized, secure network, we now have a centralized network completely controlled by a big financial institution.

Is this scenario possible?  Has it been discussed before?  I'd love for someone to poke a hole in this thought experiment.  Thanks for helping and discussing!",1634130795,13,1

q8jkz2,Ape1108,Fixed supply of 21 Million BUT...,"Hey Guys,

Obviously Bitcoin's supply is fixed, immutable and predictable. There will never be more than 21 million coins. However, I recently red Kelly Mitchell's ""The Gold Wars"" (not to confuse with Ferdinand Lips Book), a great read btw, and he pointed out that a major problem in the gold market is its ""artificially increased"" supply through derivatives. He throws out several numbers comparing the physical gold stocks vs the paper gold certificates in circulation and there is obviously a very large delta. Now he goes on to point out various methods which central banks use to suppress the gold price but it essentially all comes down to the fact that the supply of gold was artificially increased manyfold though derivatives. He predicts that at some point when crisis hits the price of paper will separate from the price of bullion which I can totally see. Essentially the market has fractionally reserved the circulated gold via derivatives.  


Now to my question: We, who understand Bitcoin, know that holding BTC in an exchange account is basically just a ""Bitcoin IOU"". But with growing popularity Bitcoin is sure drawing in more traders young and old who just want high liquidity and don't care about final settlement. Furthermore derivatives of Bitcoin could also artificially increase the supply. What prevents the above mentioned gold problem from repeating in bitcoin?  


The obvious answer is ""not your key not your coin"" and I am that kind of guy. But what if artificial supply expansion drains value off real coins? Any thoughts?",1634284495,21,1

Now when BTC is reaching ATH again, they want to invest. They want to send me money without even researching BTC nor trying to make an acc for themselves.

I was a university student and procured Bitcoin for, shall we say, *non-investment reasons*. I was an early adopter, and I operated Bitcoin on my shitty old student laptop. I remember running around campus to find WiFi strong enough to sync the Blockchain, but Jesus it's all got much better! I got a better laptop in 2015, forgot about BTC generally, and didn't touch the computer until I was clearing out some old things.

Booted it up-- with all the BTC talk I've heard in the media, I opened the Bitcoin Core program. I have about 0.05BTC or roughly $3,000USD. (!) The computer is absolutely chugging away trying to synchronize the Blockchain and I've got 330737 blocks remaining. Like an old train engine, I am not certain the computer will survive to see the wallet synchronized.

I immediately backed up the wallet and now I have it as a .dat file, which I saved off the computer in case the whole thing goes up in flames. 

My question: how do I back that .dat file up into a new, modern wallet for sale or trading?

Even if you are  right, the market is going to try to trick you (with big intensity) to  CHANGE YOUR MIND. Price action before reversals is very tricky and  scary. It will look like that it will continue the trend forever and you  will feel very scared. I will feel that an imminent huge move against  you  may come in every moment. This price action can make you change  your initial plan(direction of the position) and make you loose a lot.  Additionally you will lose the move and enter a shock mode loosing your  reasoning. It happened so many times. MY ADVICE? Stick to your initial plan with a good stop loss. STICK TO  IT, and if you are right everything will be fine. BELIEVE IN THE MOVE.",1634735989,3,1

Introduction: I have a very very small amount of bitcoin that I bought back in 2014 (1 bitcoin = 400 USD at the time if I'm not wrong). I bought it only to play with it, since I found the technology interesting, but then a few years ago I found its value was a few thousands dollars. I don't care much for bitcoin, but of course I still want to keep that bitcoin around, since it has some value.

Now, I ""keep"" my bitcoin using the Android's ""Bitcoin Wallet"" app. I have a backup of the keys that I got using the ""export"" file that the application let's you produce. If I'm not wrong, that file is in a ""propietary"" format, that is, I can only use it to load the keys to the same app. That makes me nevous: what happens if in twenty years the app does not exist anymore? I don't want to be checking every few years that I can still use that ""backup"" file.

# Abstract

This article proposes a method and application for a decentralized personal account, MisesId. A MisesId account stores a user‚Äôs basic personal information and social relationship data. Users can use MisesId to log into third-party communities which support the MisesId authentication method. MisesId is generated with crypto and blockchain technology. It‚Äôs unique, secure, and private. Besides, it‚Äôs also compatible with HDWallet addresses. A MisesId account and the data associated with it are 100% owned by the user. Any access to it must be authorized by the user. Mises network utilizes the PBFT algorithm to build a blockchain to ensure data consistency and security, allowing one-third of all nodes to be malicious. Each modification to users‚Äô account data is stored on the blockchain. We will also develop a Twitter-like content community, Mises Discover, to demonstrate the usage of MisesId and showcase building a decentralized community.

# Problem

Thirty years after the rapid development of the Internet, large technology companies such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter have emerged. They have monopolized social, search, media, and other vital areas. In recent years, the abuse of power by large companies has become a significant threat to personal freedom. People‚Äôs accounts and data are not in their own hands. For example, Twitter permanently banned the US ex-president Trump‚Äôs Twitter account, and succeedingly on January 6, 2021, Twitter banned more than 70,000 Trump supporters‚Äô accounts.

1. People‚Äôs accounts and data are not in their own hands. For example, Twitter permanently banned the US ex-president Trump‚Äôs Twitter account, and succeedingly on January 6, 2021, Twitter banned more than 70,000 Trump supporters‚Äô accounts.
2. Facebook and other large companies are unconstrained by deleting content contrary to their opinions, and freedom of speech on the Internet is losing.
3. Big companies are capable of manipulating information spread with search ranking and recommendation algorithms.
4. Big companies are suppressing small platforms. For example, Parler was removed from Apple App Store and Google Play Store, and Amazon stopped providing cloud services to stifle the small platform‚Äôs growth.

While social media and search have become the portals of Internet users, new small and medium-sized platforms or services have to buy traffic from several monopolistic companies to develop their new platforms or services. On the one hand, the chance of natural exposure becomes smaller, and on the other hand, they have capital support. Companies can buy out traffic, making it difficult for innovative companies to grow up, and copycats may rely on capital advantages to win.

Large monopolistic companies have a large amount of user behavior data and obtain user preferences for analysis. For example, as China‚Äôs largest search engine, Baidu has done a series of products such as QA forums, knowledge sharing communities, competing with small companies, or individual websites. As a result, the first page of the search result from Baidu could contain 7 out of 10 links to websites built by Baidu company itself. This behavior is a monopoly and also reduces the value of Baidu‚Äôs search engine itself. Amazon is not only self-operated but also an e-commerce platform. It has all platform merchants‚Äô sales and operation data and finds that a particular product is popular. Therefore, it is capable of self-operating and directing traffic to self-operated stores.

The Internet was constructed to be an open, decentralized, and information interconnected network. IP protocols, application layer Email, DNS are all typical decentralized architectures. Today, can we regain the original aspirations of Internet designers to achieve decentralized services in social networks, media, communities, search, e-commerce, and more importantly, let users be willing to use them and break the monopoly of big companies?

# Solution

To break the monopolistic service on the Internet, we may naturally think about decentralizing it. But 100% decentralization faces insurmountable difficulties.

1. Unbearable resource consumption. Taking Tiktok as an example, if we store all the short videos uploaded by users in each node, obviously no node can hold such a large amount of videos, and the existing blockchain technology cannot solve it. One possible method is to save only 3‚Äì4 copies of each video in the decentralized network, and the decentralized network maintains a DHT to help users obtain the video. Even so, the cost is 5‚Äì10 times higher than that of a centralized solution, and at the same time, sacrificing a significantly reduced user experience.
2. Unbearable performance. In a decentralized network, we cannot assume that all nodes are trustworthy. Every data modification has to reach a consensus. The existing POW, POS, and even DPOS are far from being comparable to the efficiency of centralization. For example, suppose there is a decentralized Twitter. Suppose every user‚Äôs like, or comment needs to pass a consensus algorithm to change the state. In that case, no decentralized solution can support a community of tens of millions of users as of now.
3. No one can afford the cost. The cost of reaching a consensus on a decentralized network is too high. So far, almost all successful blockchain projects are built for financial services. That‚Äôs because only users requiring a super high level of trust and having high profits are willing to pay such a high cost.
4. It‚Äôs difficult for decentralized services to compete with traditional centralized services. Decentralized services have the advantages of security and trust. But the question is whether users care. They may care more about the content they like, goods and service providers with reasonable prices, and a good user experience. Therefore, besides maintaining their advantages, decentralized services must be close to centralized services in terms of user experience. In the early days, when decentralized services have no advantages in content and experience, it‚Äôs an excellent strategy to acquire some seed users, specifically some user groups and content creators sensitive to monopoly.

It is impossible to decentralize all content on the Internet completely. The most significant benefit the Internet brings to people is the convenience of obtaining information and communicating among people. The most fundamental data are personal accounts and personal social relationships, communities, and social interactions. The Internet, e-commerce, and local services can all be built on individuals and their relationships. Due to the network effect of social relationships, it is a natural monopoly on the Internet. Fortunately, personal accounts and their social relationships can be completely decentralized. It is plain text and has a small amount of data; its updates are low-frequency and do not require ultra-high-performance services. We propose to build a Mises decentralized network based on the existing blockchain technology (PBFT, Tendermint, Algorand, Etherum 2.0). For detailed technical implementation, please refer to the *System Design* section.

A decentralized account without users‚Äô social relationships has minimal value. On the other hand, a decentralized account should serve a large number of communities and social services. Users can use the decentralized account as an ID to access the community and gradually builds their social data, but why would they use the community through MisesId? Why should the community support Mises decentralized network? In the early days from 0 to 1, we have to answer these two essential questions first.

There are three ways that the Internet helps people acquire information, Portal, Search, and Social Media, which correspond to the three natural ways people acquire information. Their typical representatives are Yahoo, Google, and Twitter. Portal and Social Media are usually for users to receive new content that they don‚Äôt know. We believe that in Social Media, the distribution of content, the accuracy (meeting the needs of users), and the efficiency of users‚Äô acquisition of new information still have much room for improvement.

1. The insufficiency of the discovery mechanism. In Social media, users obtain new content through the behaviors of the users they follow and discover new users they are willing to follow through the discovery mechanism. The current discovery mechanism mainly relies on the recommendation stream of the system. Popular users and mechanisms such as follow streams are not accurate. We believe that users‚Äô behaviors such as following are a better and more precise discovery mechanism;

2. In addition to following people, it is more efficient to follow continuously updated content sources, such as RSS feeds. ; Forum posts; WeChat public account; daily updated online novels, and so on.

We will develop a content community Mises Discover based on the following relationship, which demonstrates the use of MisesId. The function of the Mises Discover community is embedded inside a Mises browser.

1. The community using MisesId needs to have a client locally, which has the user‚Äôs private key for signature and authorization;

2. The browser can access any web page on the Internet, and the built-in Mises Discover community function makes it more convenient for users to share content;

3. Many content apps allow users to share internal content to the browser, aggregating content from different Apps. Mises browser will also be an open-source project.

The Mises Discover community will acquire new users to MisesId. When the total number of MisesId users exceeds 10 million, its accumulated users and social relationships will appeal to other communities. When third-party communities support MiseId as a way to log in, it can get free or paid Social relationship services, for example,

1. When a user uses MisesId to log in to a community, if a MisesId user he follows is also a user of the community, the community can recommend a connection for the user;

2. Users can use their social relationships to promote the community. In the PC Internet era, there used to be open-source forum software called Discuz. The founder of the forum can start a forum with a simple configuration. Many people want to make a similar App on the mobile Internet, helping forum operators publish their forum apps without development, but it was unsuccessful. In the mobile era, the most significant difficulty is not App development but the channel to acquire users, which is essential for a community.

Users‚Äô basic primary profile information and social relationships can be completely decentralized. If users want to save a large amount of customized data, we can provide them with decentralized storage. The customized data will be replicated to 3‚Äì4 nodes rather than all nodes. The cost of decentralized storage is much higher than that of a centralized network disk. A single node has no advantage in terms of scale effect. Storing the same content in more than three nodes would cost much more. Therefore, users need to pay for decentralized storage. The reasons are as follows.

1. Pay the operating expenses of the node;

2. Prevent users from abusing or attacking the decentralized storage space;

3. The stored content can generate a link separately, and the user can share it with any community. To open the shared links, users might need to pay for them depending on the authors‚Äô configurations.

One of the essential things to run a business on the Internet is acquiring many users. Decentralized services can do so by providing communities and storage with competent user experience compared to centralized services. When decentralized services get more than 10 million active users, they will become unstoppable. Any centralized service platform will face the challenge of decentralized services because decentralized services are more likely to be trusted by users. For example, a hotel booking service can collect and aggregate all the registered hotel information for users to search via a particular algorithm. A small portion of users‚Äô payments would be paid to the Mises network and the developers. On the foundation of the Mises decentralized network, it is possible to provide decentralized versions of air ticket booking, movie ticket booking, takeaway, e-commerce, and other services, disrupting big centralized platforms‚Äô monopoly.

# System Design

The first stage of the system is mainly composed of 3 parts.

1. The validation node of the decentralized network (DSN-V).

2. The end users‚Äô mobile App (DSB), a browser with built-in functions like the community, user, signature, and authorization.

3. A community Mises Discover that supports MisesId.

DSN-V stores users‚Äô personal information and social relationship data. All modifications to these data require all nodes to reach the consensus with validation before committing to ensure the data is consistent across all nodes.

Through DSB, users can create and restore the decentralized MisesId. It safely stores users‚Äô private keys with encryption. When a user logs in to a third-party community via MisesId, it will call DSB (or similar App) to request the user‚Äôs authorization (for logging in and accessing specified data). The message will be digitally signed by the DSB with the user‚Äôs private key and send to DSN-V for verification. DNS-V will verify that the message is genuinely from the user by check the message‚Äôs signature with the user‚Äôs public key. That is to ensure that all access to the data is authorized by the user.

The default homepage of the DSB browser is the homepage of Mises Discover. When the community needs to modify the user‚Äôs social relationship data, the webpage calls the interface provided by DSB through JSBridge, obtains the user‚Äôs authorization or signature, and connects to DSN-V to update the data.

The system architecture of the first stage is shown in the figure:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b8ruiivcqlu71.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3b19c53a386eccbf81bb8fbeab008261c399b38

# Creation and Restoration of MisesId

The process of creating MisesId is as follows.

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3cjk3prfqlu71.png?width=1626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdbc7f01713ae8dd89a5209e01355acd83d1fe38)

The creation of MisesId is similar to the HDWallet address,

1. Generate a 256-bit number called entropy
2. Hash the entropy through SHA256 to get a value, take the first few bits (length of entropy/32), called checksum
3. Append the checksum to the end of the entropy to form a new sequence
4. Form the new sequence as parts, and each part has 11 bits, corresponding to a dictionary with predefined 2048 words.
5. Generate ordered words, aka mnemonic words
6. Generate a 512-bit seed with mnemonic words and a salt value through the PBKDF2 key extension function \[1\]
7. Hash the seed with the irreversible HMAC-SHA512 algorithm to get a 512-bit value. The left 256-bit is the master private key (m), and the right 256-bit is the master chain code. With the elliptic curve algorithm combining m, we can derive the corresponding 264-bit master public key (M). The first 20 bits of M are the user‚Äôs decentralized account MisesId.

If a user downloads DSB, installs it on a mobile phone, it will create a MisesId and private key through the DSB. The private key is encrypted and stored locally on the mobile phone and is managed by the DSB. The user can set a local password for DSB to protect the security of the private key. DSB also provides a function to restore the user‚Äôs MisesId and private key. Thus, users only need to enter the mnemonic when they change to another phone to restore their MisesId.

Users can also choose not to use DSB to create MisesId. Instead, they can use the recovery function of DSB to enter the mnemonic phrase of their existing Ethereum wallet address. DSB will create MisesId based on the wallet address, and DSB will support the wallet functions later. MisesId is compatible with the Ethereum wallet address, which facilitates the integration of the Mises network with the existing cryptocurrency world.

# Authentication

The process of a user using MisesId to log in to a third-party community that supports MisesId is shown in the figure below.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0qic89shqlu71.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d353bf6fad3caa7cd24734f6efcb13f55eba1d2)

The community must first register on the Mises network. Then, when an end-user logs in, the third-party community asks for the user‚Äôs authorization to access some specific information according to its own needs.

# Authorization

After a user logs in, a community usually will ask the user to authorize access to the personal information and social relationships in the user‚Äôs MisesId account. Let‚Äôs take an example of the authorization to social relationships. The process is shown in the figure:

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0j5tgmxiqlu71.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b540f74ad5121576600706f46c1e4bfea46c5049)

Here we compromise between user convenience and safety. Users do not need to grant new access to the community again within a certain period of time. Since DSB has the user‚Äôs private key, it does not need to use OAuth2.0, and the authorization can be done through a private key signature. We use ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) to generate the signature and do the verification. Refer to \[2\] for the algorithm details.

# P2P network

Each validation node, aka DSN-V, connects and constitutes the P2P network of Mises. Due to the adoption of the PBFT algorithm \[3\] in the early stage, the number of validation nodes will not exceed 20. Each DSN-V node maintains the list of all other DSN-V nodes, and they can communicate freely and bidirectionally.

The Mises network will have several well-known DSN-V nodes. When DSB is compiled, it will incorporate the node configuration file which contains those nodes. When DSB starts, it will connect to those DSN-V nodes. DSN-V will also inform DSB of some DSN-V nodes it knows. DSB will choose to connect 3 DSN-V nodes and maintain a heartbeat connection with them. Other nodes will be stored in the local DSN-V node list. If a node that DSB currently connects goes offline or fails, DSB will select another node from the node list to establish a new connection.

The Mises network does not assume or guarantee that all nodes are trusted nodes. Hence, DSB has to connect to multiple nodes, and sometimes it needs to obtain data from multiple nodes and make a comparison to avoid being attacked by malicious nodes.

When the user base grows more prominent, DSB should not directly connect to DSN-V. Instead, it can connect to a Light Client Daemon (LCD) and communicate with DSN-V through LCD. LCD does not have all the blockchain data and does not participate in the formation of consensus. It has two functions. To improve the network performance and throughput and thus serve more users, and make DSN-V more secure, making the entire mises network less likely to collapse due to malicious attacks.

# Data Consistency and Tendermint [4]

The nodes of the decentralized network should all keep an identical copy of all user data. Users are constantly updating their data. We call the operation of users updating their data as a transaction (Tx). In theory, all nodes execute the same transaction in the same order, and the user data on the node is consistent. However, because we cannot assume that all nodes are trustworthy, the nodes need to reach a consensus to ensure

1. Tx is verified, and it is indeed initiated by the user and authorized by the user;

2.The order of Tx execution.

If Tx is compared with a financial transaction, it is obvious that a blockchain is the most suitable solution because it can record the Tx of all users‚Äô data.

There are many kinds of blockchain consensus algorithms today, which are roughly classified into POW, POS, DPOS, and non-fixed validation nodes like Algorand. They have their advantages and disadvantages. POW is the most decentralized, but the Transaction Per Second (TPS) is low. A successful POW chain consumes enormous energy. DPOS has a relatively high TPS, but it is not decentralized enough. The problems faced by decentralized accounts and social relationships are:

1. Except for user avatars, all the data is in plain text, and thus the amount of data is small;

2. Users‚Äô profile is not updated frequently, and many users might not update their profile for a year;

3. Users may update their social relationships at a moderate frequency in the early stage of use. After it is stabilized, the update frequency will be lower;

4. The blockchain does not record financial transactions, and users are unwilling to pay gas fees, so it is not suitable to adopt the POW consensus mechanism. In the economic model part, we will discuss it in detail.

Tendermint is a well-known open-source project, and it implements the PBFT consensus algorithm. Moreover, various notable projects were built based on Tendermint, such as Cosmos and Binance DEX, so we choose to implement a POS-based Mises chain based on Tendermint. The architecture of this part is as follows.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/hwgrr0ckqlu71.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=baed42fcdcb0328c591f0f44bd2871cbc15eabcb)

The disadvantages of the PBFT algorithm are also obvious:

1. PBFT can‚Äôt support a large number of validation nodes because the algorithm‚Äôs runtime complexity is O(n¬≤). When the number of nodes increases, the performance decreases exponentially. Typically, there are less than 30 validation nodes. Hence it is a relatively weak decentralization.
2. PBFT only allows no more than 1/3 of malicious nodes, and the ability to resist malicious attacks is not as good as the Bitcoin network (less than 50% malicious nodes).

BFT has an improved version, and the runtime complexity is enhanced to O(n\*log(n)). Still, it is also impossible to have a scale like Bitcoin or Ethereum with around 10,000 validation nodes. An overly complex algorithm will reduce the stability of the entire decentralized network. Another improvement idea is to support many nodes, but for each round of block generation, only a few randomly chosen nodes participate in forming consensus, considering both efficiency and decentralization.

We will constantly pay attention to Ethereum 2.0 and Algorand and continuously find a solution that considers decentralization and performance. We would like to see more Internet users can join the decentralized world.

We   are having an absolute blast on Raretoshi. Have seen the NFT space for  a  long time. But never really took part in it. Using another  blockchain  was too complicated for me. So I stuck to Bitcoin. And as we  know,  Bitcoin doesn't have a very extensive chain. However,  Blockstream made  it possible, with their layer2 solution Liquid  Bitcoin, to host NFTs and  the likes. Raretoshi is for now the most  known platform using it. Their  platform is FOSS, so you should be able  to build a spin-off!

So  my wife  and I finally got together to put our artist-butts to work. Her  works  are much more detailed and deliberate. I love her Ether Pig or  her Michael Saylor Bull. All her pixel art is fascinating too, and the community has taken a profound interest in her work. My work is a bit   more Cypherpunk, raw experimentation, but full of strong opinions.

I am FULLY verified (ID check, address check, phone number check, etc.).  I have over 200+ POSITIVE FEEDBACK as buyer and seller, and ZERO negative feedback.  I'm in the US, I don't sell gift cards, and I carefully screen whom I buy/sell with as I don't want to jeopardize my financial accounts.

Is anyone noticing the spike in FROZEN or RESTRICTED accounts on multiple platforms in general?!  Okay, I'm beyond livid and frustrated.  There seems to be NO end (going on 2 weeks) to how long my account will be frozen until.  After frantically researching ""PAXFUL FROZEN ACCOUNT"", it was 10000x worse than my worst case scenario üò≥üòì. As I read NUMEROUS reviews of those whose account had been frozen as mine and are still awaiting a resolution, UP TO 2 YEARS LATER!!!

 The notification that my account has been ""temporarily"" frozen implied that it was a security check to determine if I abided to the TERMS OF SERVICE (TOS). To those whom aren't familiar, there are 3 levels in which your account can be inaccessible: 

1. FROZEN ""temporarily can't buy/sell, can't withdraw funds"". (""Constitutes a warning... temporarily frozen due to ongoing account review""..) basically, NOTHING has been determined or discovered.

2. Suspended (restricted from using account)

3. Banned (permanently restricted, but can do a 1 time withdrawal of funds).

Yea, so being ""BANNED"" is more severe, but you can withdraw funds?!?!? I requested them to just BAN my account, to no avail.

Not only do the dreadful reviews from other victims in my position cause me to worry, but so does the statement they made in the email response:

""...We do not have an exact timeframe as to when the review will be completed. Nothing to worry about, you will be notified as soon as the review is done.""

And again in their ""TOS"":

""In the event that we suspend your account or access to your Wallet, we will remove the suspension as soon as possible once the reasons for the suspension no longer exist, however we are under no obligation to notify you as to when (if ever) such suspension will be removed"".

Like when? Tomorrow, next week, next YEAR, NEVER?!
  

First off, PAXFUL is not a financial institution.  They have specific rules that they need to abide to in order to market what they conduct/offer on their platform.  They have less regulations than a bank.  And what's SUPER MISLEADING is what is right on Paxful's GENERAL INFORMATION PAGE.  Below are a few inserts:

""We give the users complete control over their money. Along with our escrow system and our dedicated 24/7 customer support, Paxful is also extremely secure..""

""The peer-to-peer system of Paxful removes borders and limits. You can think of your Paxful account as your very own financial passport.""

""A lot of big problems in the world revolve around money, specifically earning it and transporting it. Sending money around the world is not fast or cheap in any way, but Paxful changed that.""

After much anxiety, sleepless nights, unpaid bills, etc.  I decided to contact those whom were in the same position and got their account unfrozen (mind you, there are only about 2-3 amongst 100's that I read). 

 Here are the recommended authorities to file a claim/submit complaint/submit review/ etc. (IF PAXFUL SUPPORT IS READING THIS, YOU CAN STILL STEP IN TO RESOLVE, BUT I'M NOT HOLDING MY BREATH SO I WILL PROCEED AND POST MY SUBMISSIONS)

At present, ecocoin can be said to almost follow the decline but not the rise, except for FTM, which has gradually increased from 1.4 to 2.4 due to the development of ecological applications. All the others are very weak. At present, One Ecology has ido whitelist HPAD project dedicated to this. One, which currently has a relatively high level of financial attention, may also do better.

&amp;#x200B;

Ladies and Gents I don't want to be a party pooper in this bull run party but we need to pay attention.

Evergrande still has their 83 million bond payment (which they missed last month) to pay off before they default on October the 23rd. 

This could be big for the whole world including the bitcoin space if it crashes it could take bitcoin with it. I hope I'm wrong but this could be a 2008 Global Financial Crisis moment (Although given the GFC birthed Bitcoin it's the best silver lining.)

The contagion has spread already within the Chinese property sector (it's a massive can of worms if you dig deeper I won't get into it here but you should look up on this like how much of the GDP it is, Tofu buildings, 3 red lines and debt, local government income, how much you need to work in your lifetime to save up for housing, housing as investment and speculation in China etc.)

Anyway with that preamble out of the way and a quick 20 mins search I found out that Sinic holding has defaulted on a 246 million bond payment, China property group has defaulted on 226 million bond payment and Fantasia has defaulted on 206 million bond payment. So yeah it's already having a knock on effect on the rest of the Chinese property market.

Also China's debt is 270% of the GDP and foreign debt is at 2.4 trillion as of 2020.

That said it's not all doom and gloom as Evergrande did pay 19 million on sure payment which was due on the 19th of October. That said it seems to me (although it's mainly conjecture) that they're paying domestic investors first as it's politically expedient and given the CCP is big on social stability and all that.

Anyway HODL and buy the dip if it comes (remember not financial advice

* **Hits $64,367.14, near its peak of $64,895**
* **ProShares bitcoin futures-based ETF trading on NYSE Arca**

NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The first U.S. bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded fund began trading on Tuesday, sending bitcoin to a six-month high and just off its all-time peak, as traders bet the ETF could boost investment flows into cryptocurrencies.

The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF closed up 2.59% at $41.94 in its first day of trading, with around $1 billion worth of shares trading hands on Intercontinental Exchange Inc's [**(ICE.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/ICE.N) NYSE Arca exchange under the ticker BITO.

The greenlighting of the ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was seen as a watershed moment for cryptocurrencies and helped push the price of bitcoin as high as $64,367.14, its highest level since mid-April and near its record of $64,895.22.

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, is notoriously volatile, and has risen around 45% this month on hopes that the advent of U.S. bitcoin ETFs - several of which are in the works - will spur billions of dollars managed by pension funds and other large investors to flow into the sector.

 On Tuesday, there were very few block trades in BITO, suggesting that smaller investors and high-frequency trading firms dominated trading, said Dave Nadig, chief investment officer and director of research at ETF Trends.

""I think what we saw today was retail, HFT algo trading trying to find the arbitrage, and a whole lot of institutions sitting on the sidelines and watching,"" he said.

Similar products were set to come to market, with Nasdaq Inc [**(NDAQ.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/NDAQ.O) having approved the listing of the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF on Friday, while Grayscale, the world's largest digital currency manager, said it plans to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust [**(GBTC.PK)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/GBTC.PK) into a spot bitcoin ETF. [**read more**](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-sec-poised-allow-first-bitcoin-futures-etf-bloomberg-news-2021-10-15/)

Crypto ETFs have launched this year in Canada and Europe amid surging interest in digital assets. VanEck and Valkyrie are among fund managers pursuing U.S.-listed ETF products, although Invesco on Monday dropped its plans for a futures-based ETF.

The SEC has yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF.

Bitcoin futures have been overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for four years and ETFs are regulated by the SEC, offering some level of investor protection, the SEC's chair, Gary Gensler, said on Tuesday.

""Yet it's still a highly speculative asset class and investors should understand that underneath, there is the same volatility and speculation,"" he told CNBC.

Let's say one also wants to stop at Wasabi wallet on the way and use the coinjoin features before ultimately making it to cold storage.

What are best practices? 

For example when moving off an exchange - let's just use 1 BTC as an example:

It's suggested when mixing coins to do it in batches. Wasabi has a 0.1 BTC minimum, so I would imagine it would be good practice to split that into 10 separate coinjoins for this example sum. But can 1 BTC be moved in one transaction to a single Wasabi wallet address and then from there be mixed in batches or should the coin also be sent in chunk off-exchange, to a new address every time, and then also coinjoined in batches? I suppose there wouldn't be much difference in fees whether moving off-exchange ten times versus moving off once and then splitting that into 9 more new addresses within Wasabi - or would there be? Is that even necessary? 

Where can I find some guidance on best practices to both minimize transaction fees but still maximize privacy? This is new territory for me and I don't want to fuck it up.",1634714633,18,1

Bitcoin (BTC) contract technical analysis: Bitcoin has been consolidating for several days, and there is no sign of continuing to break upward. What does this mean? From my personal point of view, it is to induce retail investors to get on the car. I guess that after the consolidation of the past few days, most of the retail investors have already got on the car, and some people are starting to feel like they can‚Äôt help themselves. When it is bullish, what we do is not to follow suit. According to my guess, it is very likely that there will be changes in the two or three days. Please follow the ideas I gave before.

q5pli4,AdaZhang1987,Explanation about cryptocurrency,"The value of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) has soared and is expected to hit a record high. The recent bull market has led to an increase in the interest of traditional and institutional investors in cryptocurrencies. However, one obstacle for investors is the unfamiliar acronyms, memes, and technical terms associated with the crypto space. Many investors follow Warren Buffett‚Äôs motto that you should ""invest in what you know... nothing more."" Therefore, to understand the world of cryptocurrencies, investors must not only learn the crypto equivalents of traditional terms related to stocks and bonds, but also many new concepts such as smart contracts, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges (DEX). What is NFT? NFT is a unique digital asset that can be traded on exchanges such as OpenSea. In the past six months, many personal NFTs have sold for more than $1 million (¬£740,000). An example of this is the NFT of digital artist Mike ‚ÄúBeeple‚Äù Winkelmann, which was sold at Christie‚Äôs in March 2021 for $69.4 million. Other miscellaneous terms that cryptocurrency investors may encounter include words such as HODL, which means ‚Äúhold your investment for a long time,‚Äù and gas-fees, which refers to the price classification paid to ‚Äúcrypto miners‚Äù for public trading. account. Every investor in blockchain technology should have a basic understanding of what blockchain is and why it is a revolutionary technology. Blockchain technology is the underlying engine that powers all cryptocurrencies. It is a digital form of record keeping, with the characteristics of tamper-proof, encryption and decentralization. The digital data registers are completely distributed on the computer network or nodes. The technology is revolutionary because the data involved is not stored centrally and therefore cannot be controlled by any single agency. This is a ""trustless"" system, where individuals don't have to trust entities that store data in a centrally controlled location. This system may cause the custodian bank to fail because the transactions recorded on the blockchain are automated by set algorithms. Once verified by the network, these algorithms are almost impossible to change. The smart contract algorithm program can be stored on the blockchain, which can execute the agreement between the participants almost immediately without the need for an intermediary to verify the contract. These ""smart contracts"" are not only capable of disrupting the financial world, but also changing the legal system. They are one of the main value propositions of the Ethereum network, and it is the first blockchain network that allows the execution of smart contracts. ""Hot"" wallets and ""cold"" wallets ""Hot"" wallets are online storage of cryptocurrencies. This can be done on an established exchange wallet (such as Coinbase) or through a browser extension wallet (such as MetaMask). The MetaMask wallet can be used to interact with decentralized exchanges. However, after experiencing a lot of online exchange hacking, investors have lost most of their investment portfolios, and cold storage wallets are considered the safest way to store cryptocurrencies. Cold storage means transferring your encrypted assets to a physical device that looks like a USB drive-this is an anti-hacking method. DeFi and DAppDeFi or decentralized finance refers to any financial activities carried out without the involvement of intermediaries (such as banks). Most DeFi applications currently reside on the Ethereum network, and DApps or decentralized applications are programs that run in a decentralized manner on the blockchain. An example of a DApp is Aid:Tech, which connects charitable donors with beneficiaries. The difference between DEX and CEX can be used to purchase cryptocurrency in different ways. They can be purchased via bank transfer to a centralized exchange (CEX), such as Coinbase (COIN). Once the funds are added to the exchange, users can buy from the list of mainstream cryptocurrencies. Another way to buy and hold cryptocurrencies on CEX is to use a decentralized exchange (DEX), which hosts a large number of coins and tokens. The decentralized exchange does not store your purchases in a central location, but sends the cryptocurrency you purchase to a connected digital wallet, such as the Metamask wallet.

Which means I'm very much in the green right now, as it broke the 60k mark again 

What I mean is: I wish there was a big correction so I could buy more, but in the mean time, I'll have to keep DCAing

Load up if it ever gets below 45k again, which I hope happens before we shoot up to +100k

From what I've read:

* BTC futures ETF (which is posed to be approved as early as next week): tracks the price of BTC futures contracts
* BTC ETF (no news about approval yet): tracks the spot price of BTC

From SEC's POV (source [FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/d7601039-e98e-47c8-97af-79f96c2c3d94), here's the [link](https://archive.vn/rIa56) w/o paywall):

* Gary Gensler hinted that he is more comfortable with trading on regulated futures venues such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
* SEC is concerned about a potential lack of liquidity and the risk of price manipulation on spot exchanges
* SEC believes bitcoin futures are more appropriate for retail investors than trading in the underlying spot market

My questions:

* so appears SEC favours a BTC futures ETF, because the futures contracts are traded in a ""regulated"" exchange (CME), while Bitcoin is not?
* what are other reasons that SEC favours a BTC futures ETF at the moment?
* (might be a naively broad question) from investor's POV, or the ETFs holding BTC futures, would trading BTC futures more risky, than trading BTC?

q8ne9s,jennycryptolady,Is this a right time to buy Bitcoin?,"Yes.

And so is tomorrow. And the day after. And 2,761 days from now.

If you‚Äôre new to Bitcoin it‚Äôs very easy to fall into the trap of chasing gains. You‚Äôll find endless subreddits and YouTube channels promising to teach you how to buy the dip and 100x your gains.

It‚Äôs fool‚Äôs gold.

Don‚Äôt head out into the desert looking for an oasis when you could dig down, each day, and build the oasis around you.

The right time to buy Bitcoin is anytime within the next 5 to 10 years.

Why?

Because Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is the easiest way to live your investment life without placing undue financial stress on your shoulders, while still buying Bitcoin. Not everyone can (and certainly not everyone should) mortgage the house or withdraw their life savings and convert to Bitcoin.

This might work in the long run, but it‚Äôs more likely to cripple your life in the immediate future. Instead, set aside a small amount on a regular basis, and buy Bitcoin - no matter the price. You can even automate this so it comes from your pay without you doing a thing.

You‚Äôll become accustomed to watching $20, or $100 or whatever figure you set, which is going to buy BTC. Instead of buying a lump sum all at once, your money is being used to incrementally add to your Bitcoin portfolio.

This approach means no more trying to ‚Äútime‚Äù the market and catch swings before they happen. Let‚Äôs face it, you don‚Äôt have the time or the skills to do that - and that‚Äôs OK. You‚Äôll also remove the emotional element of investing which will save you a whole heap of stress and uncertainty.

Using this strategy, you don‚Äôt need to worry about the dips. If we look back at Bitcoin‚Äôs 10+ year run, price rallies have typically preceded price drops. But the subsequent floor price is higher than it was before the rally. Knowing this means you can safely buy Bitcoin whether it‚Äôs $20,000, $40,000 or $60,000.

In the long run, your incremental investments will still be benefiting from Bitcoin‚Äôs rise, which offsets any losses in value along the way.

So for the love of all crypto, don‚Äôt focus on bear or bull markets, don‚Äôt try to ‚Äútime‚Äù the market, and don‚Äôt think you can outsmart the rest of the crypto community.

For most investors, a Dollar Cost Average is the best way to invest in Bitcoin, which means it‚Äôs ALWAYS the right time to buy.",1634300879,39,1

q8mnvc,dev_lurve,Global Analysis of Bitcoin with Chande Indicator," Hey guys, I have created a video on Youtube - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StfCbD3y0xo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StfCbD3y0xo). I talk about my global vision on what Bitcoin is going to do next.

Honestly, ofc, I have no idea about the local events, because who has. But, based on Chande indicator, it's clear that we are in the middle of the gyration - see the video to understand this. So, this means that we can either go up and down from this move, but based on the previous global gyrations we always went down, like two times - in 2014 and 2018.

That's why I think that we are going to go down, globally speaking. We may go down to 30K or 1K, or somewhere in between, but we are defo not going to moon rn to 100K? Again, why? Because we haven't been doing this before, globally speaking...

I don't like youtubers who talk about the h1 or even lower charts, coz the majority of viewers aren't traders, but investors. Personally, I am doing a lil bit of trading on M1, and I like it. I haven't been very successful, but I am learning to manage trading metrics and I have a testing balance of a very small amount.

But I've been also DCAing into BTC for years, and I believe that the this is the way to go. I believe that BTC will become the global currency, actively used for developing countries whose fiats suck even more than USD. And I believe that we, first/second-worlders, are the stabilization liquidity needed to stabilize BTC before it goes global.

q8mjpc,GPN1,Is it possible? A Bitconnect succes story?,"After searching through this sub and other crypto related subreddits, I couldn't find a similar story, so I wanted to share my personal crypto succes story. I was first introduced to crypto in 2017, just before Bitconnect really took off. I hindsight, obviously it was a massive scam that could've been seen a mile away.

I 'invested' (even saying that word in relation to Bitconnect make me throw up), $1000 into the platform. Long story short (everyone knows this), it all vanished into thin air. In the mean time however, I researched crypto project more in dept, especially BTC, ETH and ADA. Over the course of the bear market, 2018, 2019 and even early 2020, my investing and DCA strategy started to pay off. Being down substantial amounts, compared to the previous ATH, I broke even around late 2019. From then on, my portfolio grew and grew. I never invested other speculative altcoins, since I was afraid I might do something dumb again, like I did with Bitconnect. Now I delegate a very small portion (&lt;0,5%) of my portfolio to speculative coins, projects and NFT's. This balance makes me feel very sane and also keep it fun and entertaining. Let's be honest.. stacking BTC every month gets old after 6 or so months.

Sometimes I like to think back to those days and remember myself how poorly educated I was back in the day. But also, if it wasn't for Bitconnect, I probably hadn't invested in crypto at all.",1634297572,1,1

Every normal citizen of every country in the world is being robbed every single year through currency inflation. This mandatory inflation is an oppressive force, limiting our life opportunity and robbing us of hope for our future and our children's future because for every step we take forward, we're pushed two steps back as the value of the cash we worked for erodes over time. Worst of all is that we have no choice to opt out and are coerced by law to partake in this violated social contract.

But since the value of bitcoin does not erode, the value of our time cannot be stolen from us, giving us hope for a better future where there is less disparity, less unethics, less competition, less corruption and the energy we put into working can actually be enough to not just get by but actually get ahead. Bitcoin allows for a world where an average person with no extraordinary skill can finally have the time, privilege and resources to pursue the kind of life is most meaningful to them, not just the life they fall into and get stuck in with no hope of escaping.

q37br5,OliaPavlen-1982,Addressing the issues faced during launch,"During our launch, a few issues were faced once the Start Block was verified on respective chains. The team and developers would like to take this opportunity to address these issues, as well as the measures that were taken to resolve these issues.

1. Users were not able to Stake and Withdraw on the website‚Äôs frontend

When users were not able to stake and withdraw their tokens on our websites frontend, we immediately dived down into our codes to figure out the issue.

The library that was used to handle big number values was converting large values into exponential form. (Example : 1000000000000000000 was converted to 1e18.)

The smart contracts don‚Äôt expect values in exponential form. Therefore an error was thrown while staking and withdrawing.

Do note that you can deposit and withdraw using block explorers of respective chains, BSC and Polygon.

Solution ‚Äî We changed the library for handling big numbers to Bignumber.js

2. Incorrect Value was displayed on TVL, Total staked liquidity and a User‚Äôs Stake

On polygon, USDC was used to calculate TVL, Total staked liquidity, as well as a user‚Äôs staked value. USDC on polygon is a 6 decimal token, while the common decimal values for a token is 18 decimals. As such, due this miscalculation, the valuations across TVL, Total staked liquidity and User‚Äôs Stake was wrong.

Solution ‚Äî Used different decimals for each token to get it fixed.

We acknowledge our mistakes and apologise for any inconvenience caused.

The team is currently working hard to address these issues, as well as Wallet Connectivity and the integration of Trust Wallet!

q37bdw,mujshanan92,The Sudanese government failed to airdrop stimulus check because the majority of the population don't have a Bank account - bitcoin fixes this,"&gt;The Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Jibril Ibrahim, acknowledged that there are real problems facing the implementation of the ‚ÄúThamrat‚Äù [Arabic for seeds] support program for poor families, most notably the collapse of the country‚Äôs information and infrastructure.

&gt; Jibril said, according to Al-Hirak Al-Siyasi [Arabic for political movement] newspaper, issued on Thursday, that less than **6% of the Sudanese people own bank accounts, while 94% of them are outside the banking system and have no relationship with banks**, either from near or far, because most banks are located in the center and do not have branches in all  Sudan regions.

&gt; He added, ""We do not know the families who are eligible for support until they hand over their share of the cash support.""

&gt; And he added, ‚ÄúThere must be a national number [governmental ID] for any citizen and a means of communication so that he can receive his share of support.‚Äù

[Source in Arabic](https://sudafax.com/351855/%25D9%2588%25D8%25B2%25D9%258A%25D8%25B1-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2585%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%258A%25D8%25A9-94-%25D9%2585%25D9%2586-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2585%25D9%2588%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B7%25D9%2586%25D9%258A%25D9%2586-%25D9%258A%25D8%25AF%25D9%258A%25D8%25B1%25D9%2588%25D9%2586-%25D8%25A3%25D9%2585%25D9%2588/amp)

So, to summarize, the Sudanese government was supposed to airdrop 5$ a month for the low income families to stimulate the economy, but the failed to do so as they discovered that 96% of population don't have a bank account.

MoonFlight is a fully decentralized launchpad which allows anyone to launch new projects and provides FLIGHT holders passive income. Holding FLIGHT tokens grants holders automatic airdrops of newly created tokens the moment they are distributed.

It is a decentralized launchpad and will allow anyone to launch a project without centralized approval. When a project launch completes its raise, the project will be subject to a 3% fee. Half of this fee is in the form of the newly launched token and the other half is in the form of BNB. 2% of the listing fee is shared among FLIGHT holders and the remaining 1% is retained by [MoonFlight.io](https://MoonFlight.io).

If you hold FLIGHT in your BSC wallet, you will receive a portion of the fee. This means, FLIGHT holders will receive 1% of the new token and 1% BNB. This percentage is proportional to the amount of FLIGHT you own. The more FLIGHT you hold the more tokens and BNB you will receive.

EXAMPLE:

XYZ TOKEN launches on [Moonflight.io](https://Moonflight.io). They are looking to raise 100 BNB. XYZ will be offering 2,000,000 tokens. These tokens will be sold at a rate of 20,000 XYZ / 1 BNB. Once this raise has completed, 1 % XYZ and 1% BNB from this raise will be distributed proportionately to FLIGHT token holders based on the amount of FLIGHT they hold.",1633601895,1,1

q34zvw,sikeig,The Problems that slow down mainstream adoption of Bitcoin (In my Opinion),"#**Fraction Buying**

The majority of the population still isn‚Äôt even aware that neo-broker offer buying fractions of a stock. ‚Äî Not a single person that I know outside of the crypto market knew that you can buy a fraction of a Bitcoin.

- People aren‚Äôt aware of fraction buying; they consider Bitcoin ‚Äú*too expensive*‚Äù (they think they can‚Äôt afford it)

- If they plan to invest in the crypto market, other coin prices seem more attractive since they don‚Äôt understand market capitalization

And I don‚Äôt think the transition from BTC -&gt; Sats as a metric makes anything more simple for the average user.

#**Fool Proof**

Well I think Bitcoin isn‚Äôt **‚Äúfool proof‚Äù**. Maintaining your own private keys on a non-custodial wallet is quite a challenge for the average user.

- Maintaining security on a day to day basis with software/hot wallets

- No central entity, No 2FA, No password reset options etc.

This will obviously lead to custodial wallets and centralized software/exchange solutions. More centralization of services and coins.

#**Transaction Fees**

Well I don‚Äôt want to fuel the block size conflict and proposal of hardforks but base layer transactions aren‚Äôt competitive at all. Free online banking transactions are simply the norm.

I don‚Äôt really like the Lightning Network and the idea of having your Sats sitting off cahin in a channel.

#**Price Fluctuations**

Since Bitcoin shifted from a P2P cash sytem to a ‚Äústore of value‚Äù asset, most of the holders are only interested in acquiring more fiat funds.

- Mostly over-leveraged positions are the reason for the drastic price changes

For the past three years, I have used mostly the same strategy for buying BTC:

\- every Monday I look at the indicators which are important for me (BTC fear &amp; greed, Puell multiple)

\- when they are below my ""overheated"" threshold, I buy, and otherwise I wait for better times

\- the more pessimistic the indicators are, the more I buy (again, using my own thresholds)

However, for selling and re-accumulating, I do not have a good rule. I did sell (""DCA out"") some BTC this spring, and re-bought that in Q3 during the dip. But in hindsight, I should have sold more, and closer to the peak.

Do any of you have a strategy for maximizing BTC accumulation that you are happy with? Should I keep an eye on indicators like the ""Pi Cycle Top"" for better guidance?

Ideally, I would want to buy when the market is low, do nothing when it becomes overheated, sell when it is close to the top (I realize you can never time the top anyway), and re-buy when the market cools down again.

Please ignore tax implications; in our tax system, it makes no difference whether I hold my assets in BTC or fiat currency, and how often I buy or sell.

q1rxeu,-Scott_Trenti,"October 5: BTC is expected to bottom out, and the retracement continues today.","BTC contract analysis: Yesterday, the overall market has gone to the expected bottom and picked up. We suggest that there are many areas in 47,300-47,200 and 47,000-46,900, and harvest in the final target of 48,900 in the evening. The daily line bottomed out and turned up. In the short term, it is still a signal of more shocks. Therefore, today's thinking is also very simple, and the main rise is the best policy.

In the short-term view of the BTC contract in the day, it has risen and fallen yesterday, which means that the future strength still needs to cooperate with it. In the short-term day, it is justified or the bottom will be reviewed. Operation strategy: the upper reaches the 48900 area and the 49300 area is first empty and the position will be withdrawn. The target is 47900-47700, the bottom is concerned about the 47300-47200 area to open long, and the target is to look at the 48400-48900 area. (Note that shorting must be short first, bottoming out and giving up shorts, there is no limit for longs

For short-term trading of BTC contracts during the day, the daily line broke the previous day's high, and it basically closed at yesterday's high in the early morning. If you are long, you cannot wait for a large retracement. In today's operation, you need to be aggressive to intervene in arrangements. , Focus on the continuity after Boyang line, short-term trading strategy of BTC contract: retrace the 48700-48600 area first to light up the position, go to the 48400 area and then cover the position to the normal position. The target is near the 50,000 area.

The more negative the market is, the more money I put in (again, according to my threshold). That way, I accumulated a nice amount of BTC and ETH in the past three years.

But when it comes to taking profit, to re-buy the dips again later, I don't have a good approach. I sold some in the first half of the year, and used the profits to rebuy in the Q3 dips. But in hindsight I should have sold more, to maximize my buying.

How do you decide when to sell? And why? Do you have a system where you e.g. sell x% when the price increased y%?

q3r67i,mommmom,"US FDIC Said to Be Studying Deposit Insurance for StablecoinsÔºåSo-called pass-through coverage would insure the holders of these tokens against losses up to $250,000 if the bank holding the collateral were to fail."," 

The agency is trying to analyze what so-called pass-through FDIC insurance might look like for the reserves that stablecoin issuers hold at banks, the sources said. Such coverage would insure holders of the tokens against losses up to $250,000 if the bank holding the collateral were to fail.

The FDIC is also looking at what regular, direct deposit insurance might look like for banks that want to issue stablecoins, people familiar with the discussions said.

‚ÄúThis is all part of a process by which they are trying to bring stablecoins into the banking system in a responsible manner,‚Äù one insider said. ‚ÄúIt depends on what‚Äôs backing the stablecoins. If it‚Äôs backed by reserves at the Fed\[eral Reserve\] for cash then I think you just make the argument that it‚Äôs a deposit. If it‚Äôs backed by Treasurys \[bonds\], I think you‚Äôll have a hard time treating it as a deposit.‚Äù

The discussions come amid a broader debate in the U.S. about potential stablecoin regulation. This week the Wall Street Journal reported (and CoinDesk confirmed) that the Biden administration would subject stablecoin issuers to bank-like regulations. Circle, issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sent an investigative subpoena to the company in July.",1633670695,1,1
q3r63t,Winnie_930,What are the key factors behind Bitcoin's recovery?,"On October 2, U.S. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said he did not think the Fed needed to raise interest rates until 2024. After the news came out, the market stored easing policy expectations, sentiment positive under the short term rise in bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition U.S. banking giant JPMorgan Chase also provided a comprehensive overview of some of the key reasons behind bitcoin's recent rally. JPMorgan noted that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear that the Fed has no plans to crack down on cryptocurrencies, which is considered to be the main factor behind the recent price spike. It should be noted that after the news that the Development and Reform Commission and the Central Bank issued a series of notices to regulate mining and virtual currency trading speculation, the market speculation faded and the crypto market as a whole sank.

&amp;#x200B;

However, experts in the crypto field are more worried about the regulation in the U.S. than in China, and Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer of CoinShares, pointed out in an interview that the bigger risk is that U.S. regulators follow China's example. And at the same time, U.S. regulators have stepped up their focus on the crypto sector. Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has been calling for regulation of the crypto market, and the SEC has been working overtime to develop a set of rules to do just that. Others, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have also expressed concern about the space.

&amp;#x200B;

And with Powell making it clear that the Fed has no plans to crack down on cryptocurrencies, crypto market concerns have seen a huge upturn. In addition, Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, also said that his agency has neither the authority nor the intention to ban digital assets during the hearing.

&amp;#x200B;

Notably, JPMorgan also believes that the rapid adoption of lightning networks has also driven the rally. Largely due to El Salvador and Twitter, this has led to a significant increase in the adoption of the Tier 2 payments track.

&amp;#x200B;

Previous news shows that Twitter has integrated Bitcoin through the Lightning Network, enabling Bitcoin tipping payments for iOS users. The tip feature will rely entirely on third-party payment services, such as the Strike app, and the latest news on October 8 shows that Twitter's ""Tip"" feature is now available to all IOS users, who can find the ""Tip"" option on their profile page. Users can find the ""Tip"" option on their profile page (the default status is ""off"") to activate it.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, news on October 7 revealed that Open Bank Project, API3, Qredo &amp; Sovryn and Banco Hipotecario have formed an alliance to facilitate the process of bitcoinization in El Salvador.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, investors' concerns about inflation have resurfaced. gold stabilized on Oct. 4 news as the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly, with higher-than-expected U.S. inflation data and strong manufacturing activity. Meanwhile, bitcoin is gradually replacing gold as a hedge against inflation, reigniting interest in using bitcoin as an inflation hedge. galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz also predicts that bitcoin's market cap will surpass that of gold within a few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Notably, the latest news shows that the SEC has approved the Volt Crypto Industry Revolution and Technology ETF, which gives investors easy access to companies that hold large amounts of bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition,, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz recently predicted that bitcoin will rise again by the end of 2021. He claims that the horse that turns near the finish line tends to win.

Here, I'll queue it up for ya:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NLgRlObe1w&amp;t=3790

Saylor explains why people want and need custodial services, ETFs, and all the rest.

Maybe you'll listen to him, since you don't seem to be capable of listening to anyone else who explains it.  He does it clearly and concisely, laying out how pension funds, companies, cities, and all the other institutions often CANNOT ""just buy Bitcoin"" because of regulations and charters.

q6pows,jebeseme,Fuck CashApp,"Maybe not the best place for this rant, but the main thing I used CashApp for was to not keep all of my bitcoin in the same place. I got a new phone a couple of months ago and transferred my CashApp account but the screen was broken on the old phone so it wasn't the smoothest process. Regardless, I had everything set up and it was working properly. A week ago, I went to check the value of my bitcoin and it said my account was closed. I hadn't received any notifications about it so I don't know when this happened exactly, but I haven't had any new transactions since I got my new phone. I started three chats with their tech support to try to figure out what I had done to get my account closed. They said I violated their terms of service and would send me a link. Side note- they actually linked me to a dead / broken link and I found the TOS on my own but I thought that was hilarious. I wanted to know how I violated the TOS though. They kept saying they would transfer my ticket to someone who could help and nobody would ever get back to me so I'd reach out again and again. They'd say they're escalating my ticket, but never heard back on any of the three attempts. Finally I called them (initially didn't know they had a support number) and the guy on the phone said the same thing - I violated their terms of service but he couldn't tell me how. Again, I haven't had any recent transactions so I have no clue what I would have done besides ""multiple login attempts"" is apparently a reason to permanently close someone's account and maybe that was it but I don't remember having many problems here either.   


So whatever, I'm moving my money out of CashApp but for some reason, my limit is $2000 per day and $5000 per week. Apparently (after searching on google) its because my account is not validated, but they never prompted me to validate it while the account was open, and I have a phone number, bank account, debit card, and a bunch of bitcoin on the app so I don't understand how I could do all that and yet still not have my account be validated. Whatever, there's no way to validate it now as my account is closed. I'm stuck trying to move my money out in pieces and here's the best part. According to their TOS:  


""**Access to Virtual Currency upon Termination.** You will be permitted to transfer your Virtual Currency or USD funds held in your Virtual Currency Account for ninety (90) days after your access to the Virtual Currency Services have been deactivated or cancelled, unless such transfer is otherwise prohibited (i) under the law, including but not limited to applicable sanctions programs, or (ii) by a facially valid subpoena or court order. ""  


So with the amount of bitcoin I have on CashApp, its going to take me about 10 weeks to transfer the money out piecemeal assuming I don't forget to do this at some point. If I had any more bitcoin, it sounds like they would be allowed to just seize it after 90 days. Oh man what a joke. And on top of this, their fees were always ridiculous. I have recommended CashApp to some newbie friends that wanted to get started in Bitcoin because it's super easy to get started, but not doing that again. Also considering selling all of my square stock which has served me pretty well over the last few years all because of this bullshit. Fuck CashApp.",1634055238,11,1

Bullish: Miller praised Bitcoin and compared it to ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù during the conversation. He said that the digital asset is now established and has the backing of venture capitalists.

More Coin Praise: During the conversation, Miller also said that he liked Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) and that there are some other cryptos, such as Etherum that are good.

Background: Miller, who famously bought shares of Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) 20 years ago, made an investment in Bitcoin earlier this year. It is meaningful for Bitcoin to have the support of a famous investor.

Big Picture: Investors are always looking for a hedge in their portfolios. For a while, investors turned to gold, but Bitcoin has become another alternative.

Final Thoughts: The price of Bitcoin is at its highest level since May.

Would you please help with my account being hacked?

Last night I noticed that my wallet has been compromised and 0.9 Bitcoin was taken from my account which holds slightly more than 1 Bitcoin. The Bitcoin was taken on 28 September 2021 and the transaction is shown in my dashboard. I had email authentication for login. I received no email from blockchain for any new login. I only accessed my account through my mobile app. My phone is an iPhone 11. I never used my email on my phone to add a security level to my wallet. Just last night I noticed that the Blockchain app was uninstalled from my phone, which I am sure I didn't do so. After installing the app, Blockchain said that my saved credentials (apple saved) is wrong. I input the password that I was using and the password was correct. So it means that my password was not changed. The last time I connected to my account on a browser was more than 1 year ago. I had 3 more wallets connected to this wallet but only this one was compromised.

At the time of the transaction, I am 100% sure that my mobile phone was with me, and I was working from home alone. So the chance of someone taking control of my phone is zero!",1634040393,219,1

q9gufu,paris0022,Power of Bitcoin for borrowing,"Wanted to share some thoughts here.  Bitcoin can make life easier if you need to borrow against your own asset.  You never have to sell your Bitcoin if you need large short term cash.  

One example is using Coinbase lend.  Let say you own 1 Bitcoin at and it is worth $60,000.  You can borrow 40% against your coin for 8% APY which would be about $20,000 you can get cash in your bank account within a few days. 

Done are the days where to you have to fill a lot of paperwork for the bank for a personal loan and pay a loan processing fee.

You could only pay back the interest amount or more on your own term until it is paid off. The risk is low of being liquidated if Bitcoin even nosedive one day, and reduces as you pay down the principal amount.

Why would someone borrow? Let‚Äôs say you needed to get a used car and have to borrow cash for it.  You could go to the bank/auto dealership and deal with a lot of paperwork and credit check.  Or you can simply borrow against your coin and pay it back on your own term without selling.

If you need cash, think about borrowing against your BTC vs cashing out.

If you have a credit card with 24% interest, and want to pay it off faster, you could borrow at 8% to pay your card faster.  You want to make a large purchase? Borrow cash against your Bitcoin vs your high credit card APY. 

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend borrowing the cash to buy more Bitcoin or other coins.",1634406424,48,1

q9g4x1,jack_murray,"A friend asked ""Why don't we just start Bitcoin again?"" on Facebook, this was my response","Bitcoin is just another boring old payment network, like Visa, MasterCard, Western Union, Unionpay, etc, with two main differences:

1. Bitcoin has no traditional organisation structure running the project. It's all open source and contributions are voluntary.

2. With Bitcoin, people are transacting in shares of the Bitcoin liquidity pool, rather than than in IOUs for paper cash.

When you say ""start Bitcoin again"", it's kind of like saying ""start MasterCard again"": You can try to compete in the payment industry, but it's highly competitive and highly regulated so the setup cost is high.

And because it is so competitive, the chance of success is low.

Bitcoin as a project managed to evade all existing financial regulation, which in part contributed to it's early success. Governments had to produce new financial regulation for it, but it is nowhere near as mature as regulation of traditional financial institutions.

The reason people are buying up large portions of the Bitcoin liquidity pool is because an increasing number of people are using it as a settlement network, which generates real-world demand for liquidity shares (no ""greater fool"" in this scenario).

These people buying up liquidity pool shares are gambling on Bitcoin becoming as ubiquitous as MasterCard in 10-20 years. So far, Bitcoin has been crushing it in terms of growth, and it's starting to become clearer that they will be competitive. But they may stagnate and never reach the ""critical mass"" required for most businesses to accept it.

It's a long-term investment that may never pay off.

""Why Bitcoin, vs some alt coin"": Bitcoin was first to market with this ""business model"" (if you can even call it that), and being the first to move provides a significant advantage. Businesses are only going to accept it if the majority of their customers want to make payments with it, and so far it seems the majority of the money is buying up Bitcoin shares rather than altcoins.

Personally I think it's a good gamble, since the upside of the bet is still like 10x on your liquidity shares, even at today's prices, and even if there is only a 5% chance that the project succeeds at the scale of payment giants like MasterCard and Visa.",1634404191,15,1
q9g28j,AlexWasTakenWasTaken,Why a futures-based ETF will massively affect the spot price of BTC - A technical and general analysis,"The  SEC has now finally approved a Bitcoin Futures ETF. However it seems  like the sentiment about this in terms of price movement for Bitcoin is  not where it should be. People think that purchases of a futures ETF  will have almost no affect on the spot price of BTC, which is absolutely  untrue.  
Let me elaborate, as this might blow your mind.

**Technical Analysis**

When  a futures ETF launches, there will be way more buying than selling  pressure. We can see this already, because futures on exchanges trade  for a much higher price than BTC spot. On FTX, the BTC-0325 Future is  trading at 65'600$ while BTC is trading at 61'080$.

When  futures ETFs launch, they too will reflect higher prices than the  Bitcoin spot price. What will risk-averse, smart investors do? They will  short the high ETF price, BUY BTC spot on a lower price and pocket the  difference. Currently doing this on an exchange would yield a 7.5%  risk-less return within the next 6 months.

*ELI5?:  I will now spot-buy Bitcoin for 61k and sell it to you for 65k BTC on  March 25th. I can arrange and fix this sales price by shorting the ETF  now. I have made 4k of secure profits.*

As  you can see in this example, the availability of a futures ETF directly  affected the spot demand of BTC. With more and more ETFs launching and  trillions of dollars being directed towards them, price spreads will  increase and so will the buying pressure on spot markets. This is huge  and many have yet to understand this.

**General Analysis**

The  approval of a Bitcoin Futures ETF on Wall Street will legitimize the  asset once and for all in the US. It brings the credibility of crypto to  a new level for many higher-ups in finance.

Also,  regulation is still one of the biggest risks we're facing. The further  crypto can spread, the harder it will be to regulate crypto in a way  that is harmful to the financial industry. And an ETF is doing exactly  this, no matter whether it is futures-based or not. You cannot take down  something that is so deeply connected to the economy. Once people  allocate their 401k, IRAs etc. regulators will be even more weary of  hurting the crypto space.

**Summary**

The  launch of a US futures based BTC ETF is huge, both from a technical and  general perspective. It is untrue that it won't directly affect spot  prices and this will soon become clear to us all.",1634403960,52,1

The real innovation in BITCOIN and blockchain in general is the fact that they operate on a totally different network which is impenetrable.

qb9btp,serhr792,Do you have to be rich to start investing in crypto/coins?,"Yesterday I got a thought that to make some real money, you already need to have a lot of money invested. And some folks can‚Äôt afford it, but they want to become at least a part of the crypto community. And it‚Äôs cruel that to buy one coin that might rise in the future I‚Äôve to spend at least 150$. 

So I found small coins under 10 cents. Maybe some of you will consider it useful, they‚Äôre VET, BTT and Wabi. All of them went thorough ups and down, and now they are stable. Some ppl say that less or not known coins are higher risk investments in comparison to Bitcoin cause Bitcoin is already more volatile than most other assets, so one should think twice before investing in it. While less known coins can provide higher returns in a bull market. 

I personally own Wabi and I started with it from its launch, so I can speak only for it. My experience with Wabi goes smooth, and unlike some of the above statements, I didn‚Äôt lose a shit. I invested in it a big sum, with which I would buy only 1 or 2 popular coins, and in 4-5 years I‚Äôll double or triple my investment (around 9k). Maybe this long term hodl is not suitable for all, but it‚Äôs fine for me. Though it‚Äôs still far from making millions, cause it‚Äôs simple as it is, 100% growth of 100k is 200k, 100% of $10 is just $20. 

Most of us got into crypto to get rich, but it turns out that you already have to be rich, it sounds unfair. Do you also think that to make a million with crypto, you gotta have at least 400k or so?",1634642163,9,1

I used pretty moderate assumption of Bitcoin going up on average 12% a year (historically it's been growing at 130% a year)

A Redditor asked an interesting question: What if Bitcoin go up much faster, reaching the ""best case scenario"" potential of 100 trillion USD in 20 years or at a price of  5 Millions per coin, how would the calculation look like?

**Assumptions** (Best case scenario imho, I know this is HOPIUM but just for fun and for the sake of the thought experiment)

\- Average 25% growth year on year with short term flash crashes of 60% 

\- Lender give out Bitcoin backed loans at 5% interest rate, flat rate for 21 years, LTV = 40%

\- You have 1 BTC to use as collateral and and enough assets/cash on the side to  never get liquidated even in flash crash periods

\- Lender has insurance to guarantee 100% of your BTC value in the case of a hack or a lost

**Using the above assumptions,** 

Scenario 1:  You can sell the BTC today to get 60k OR

Scenario 2:  You can use BTC as collateral to take out a loan of 60k EVERY YEAR starting 2025, for 15 years. At the end of 15 years, you want to payback both loan and interest of roughly 500k, you only need to sell  est. 0.1 of your Bitcoin

You would have made a 4.5 Millions worse decision in scenario 1.",1634638015,38,1

I plan on converting some of my coins soon so i wanted to understand the full tax implications. 

Also i was reading up on Singapore being a tax haven. Would it be possible for me to send my crypto to a friend who converts it into fiat in Singapore and then wires me the funds. I read there are no taxes on foreign wire transfers.

qcmavw,JacobTheSmuggler,Coinbase Recurrent Purchase - They are likely scamming you,"I buy Bitcoin every week through Coinbase using their recurrent purchase feature, and once it's available, I withdraw to my HW wallet. 

I have been noticing how Coinbase always picks a price that's on the top 10% prices during that day as the sale price. With an example, if the price for a given day ranges between 50K and 52K, you will almost certainly get an auto-purchase sale price of \~$51,900.

Yesterday's case is more egregious. Besides the $3 fee applied, they gave me a sales price of $67,022.51 / BTC - a price that was never reached in their platform.

It's pretty obvious to me that they are scamming me, and probably everybody, with the sale price. In between the fee, and the inflated price, I think they are regularly making 5+% on each of my purchases.",1634801280,93,1

qcry7t,CypressHunter53,Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones Now Prefers Crypto Over Gold as Inflation Hedge,"
Paul Tudor Jones, the founder of asset management firm Tudor Investment Corp., talked about bitcoin being his preferred hedge against inflation in an interview with CNBC Wednesday. He said:

Clearly, there‚Äôs a place for crypto. Clearly, it‚Äôs winning the race against gold at the moment ‚Ä¶ It would be my preferred one over gold at the moment.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got crypto in single digits in my portfolio,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúI do think we are moving into an increasingly digitized world.‚Äù
Jones said he is worried about rising inflation, noting that it‚Äôs posing a major threat to the U.S. financial markets and the recovering Covid-hit economy.
The price of bitcoin surpassed all-time highs Wednesday after the first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. started trading on the NYSE. Gold lost 8% over the past 12 months while bitcoin gained 437%.
The billionaire investor was asked to comment on investing in a bitcoin ETF as a way to get exposure to the cryptocurrency. Admitting that he is not ‚Äúa real expert on ETFs,‚Äù Jones said:

I think a better way to get in would be to actually own the physical bitcoin, to take the time to learn how to own it ‚Ä¶ I think the ETF would be fine. I think the fact that it is SEC-approved should give you great comfort.

He was also asked if the approval of an ETF means that the regulators are saying that crypto is here to stay. Jones replied:

I think crypto is here to stay.

He proceeded to explain the reason the U.S. is ‚Äúthe most prominent economic power in the world is because we unleash our individual entrepreneurism and creativity.‚Äù
In contrast, he said, ‚ÄúChina is doing the exact opposite. That place is on an economically slow boat to the south pole.‚Äù
The billionaire fund manager previously said that bitcoin was a store of wealth, like gold. He began¬†recommending¬†BTC¬†for portfolios early last year. In October 2020, he said that he saw massive upside in bitcoin and¬†likened¬†investing in the cryptocurrency to investing in early Apple or Google.",1634823304,11,1

I was comfortable holding my stocks and felt they were safe and had a great return.  However, they have not compared to BTC‚Äôs overall returns after this bull run.

When BTC began making headlines again, I dove into the research and actually had a panic attack when ‚Äúit clicked‚Äù in my brain.  How could I have not seen the potential before?  Thank goodness I never self a single sat during the bear market.

I decided to aggressively DCA into Bitcoin.  I sold all my stocks and Alts when the first dip occurred this year and put it all on BTC.  I bought every dip.  Then I called my IRA manager and told him to sell everything and mail me the check.  I dumped all of it on BTC in the low 30k‚Äôs and 29k.  My IRA manager said it was crazy. 

Well, I‚Äôve now DCA‚Äôd everything into BTC.  New BTC purchases will come from my salary.  I have no other assets besides my house and an S19j Pro ASIC miner I recently bought.  I plan to keep everything I mine and purchase more ASICs. 

I‚Äôve never had more money in my life and I‚Äôve never felt so optimistic.  Who‚Äôs crazy now?",1634822780,137,1

qcri44,Misesofficial,How decentralized social media deals with illegal content - example of Mises," How does decentralized social media deal with illegal content? The principle of Mises is to delegate the power of content reviewing to nodes. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/kaqo5bbdzsu71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b16f62c42a324f7b1ee157dbaa01a4dfdf28cf0f)

Every country has laws against illegal content. However, the laws of different countries are different. Illegal content in one country may be OK in another one. Since different nodes are under different jurisdictions and they must compromise to different regulations, Mises‚Äô team decided to give the power of reviewing content to nodes. The node can review the content stored on it. For content that violates local laws, the node can mark it as illegal and refuse to host the content. Since the user‚Äôs content is stored in a decentralized network, the content is not only stored in one node, and other nodes may not necessarily reject the content, so the content can still be accessed unless all nodes in the Mises network refuse to host it. If the node refuses to host, it cannot obtain the storage fee from the user. On the other hand, the user can pay to start a DAO arbitration. If the DAO judges that the node rejects the user content without a valid reason, the node should compensate the user, and the qualification of this node will eventually be terminated.

In the 2002 Kazaa case, the judge cited the photocopier as an example. The photocopier can be used to copy documents in the office and can also be used to pirate books. When the photocopier is used for pirating, the owner of the photocopier is responsible, not the manufacturer of the photocopier. As a decentralized project, Mises cannot control or limit the content from users. This ability and responsibility are delegated by the node.",1634821920,4,1

qcreor,_kr_saurabh,Decentralized Finance comes to Bitcoin!,"**You‚Äôve probably heard the term Defi or Decentralized Finance being used in the news or by people you know. But in case you don‚Äôt know what it means, here‚Äôs a simple breakdown:**

**Decentralized finance, or Defi, is a system by which financial services and products are made available to private individuals on a public decentralized blockchain network. Being on a blockchain makes them open to anyone with an internet connection to use. Being decentralized means it's independent and free from the control of governments, central banks, and other middlemen like Hedge funds or brokerages. And unlike with a bank or brokerage account, you don‚Äôt have to provide a government-issued ID, Social Security number, or proof of address to use Defi.**

**More technically, Defi refers to a system by which software written on blockchains makes it possible for buyers, sellers, lenders, and borrowers to interact peer to peer and exchange financial services, tokens, and assets within a strictly software-based trust-less(secure) environment rather than through a company or centralized institution that facilitates a transaction and charges fees and commissions.**

 **Blockchain in general and Defi, in particular, make use of smart contracts which are a set of rules and protocols that automate agreement terms between buyers and sellers or lenders and borrowers making a new and democratized financial services industry possible. Regardless of the technology or platform used, Defi systems and blockchain networks, in general, are designed to remove intermediaries between transacting parties. Smart contracts enable a host of decentralized applications of which Defi is just a small subset. Very popular blockchain networks and projects that comprise the Defi ecosystem are Ethereum, Avalanche, UniSwap, and Polygon to name a few.**

 **But can you guess which blockchain network has been noticeable absent from the Defi scene until now? Which network is not only the oldest (ten years plus) and most secure but whose market capitalization is the largest? If you said Bitcoin you would be very right. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency out there, setting the stage for all the rest. Bitcoin is the most secure network out there because it was designed to be a store of value and nothing else. Because of this Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap is almost 1.2 Trillion dollars as of this writing and each coin is worth $64,000 and rising again, breaking its all-time historical since bitcoin was invented! Again!**

 **To fully understand what separates Bitcoin from the rest, it would help to recognize the distinction between an asset and a service. Just like in the business world, you can sell a product or a service. So most blockchains projects either operate to host assets or to host services (applications). Now if you want to do both, you will have to make a trade-off in terms of speed, efficiency, ease-of-use, simplicity, transaction costs, and a host of other factors. Bitcoin does one thing and it does it well ‚Äî that is to be the most secure, deflationary (as opposed to fiat or normal currency which is inflationary), and accessible store-of-value in the world. It was designed with a very minimalist scripting language that did not allow apps or other services to be created on its network.**

 **So how do you unlock $1.2T in monetary value just sitting there? Well, the Stacks network was designed to do exactly that. Created in 2017 by two Princeton alumni, Stacks is technically a separate Layer-1 Blockchain (same as Bitcoin), created to host an ecosystem of apps and services. It links into the bitcoin blockchain to verify and secure the transactions of all the activities it carries out.**

 **And so after a lot of work by the Stacks community, we finally have Bitcoin Defi, a term that would have been an oxymoron just a short while ago. And a strong building block of this evolution is the ability to swap or exchange native Bitcoin to new assets and other native cryptocurrencies. This opens the door to let in a new wave of advanced decentralized apps and financial transactions, which benefit from the security and stability of pure Bitcoin. Defi users will soon be able to perform trust-less BTC swaps to stable coins, derivatives, variants of these, and other crypto-assets built on Stacks, as well as purchase any digital assets (like NFTs and decentralized domains), all by pure Bitcoin transactions on the Bitcoin chain!**

 **Decentralized finance is still in the beginning stages of its evolution. The total value locked in Defi is more than $128 billion and growing according to Coingecko. The total value locked is calculated by multiplying the number of tokens in the protocol and their value in USD. Though the total figure for Defi may sound huge, it is important to remember that it is relatively small because many Defi tokens lack sufficient liquidity and volume to trade in crypto markets. This is why unlocking the full potential of Bitcoin‚Äôs trillion-dollar value capital has been one of the Stacks‚Äô major objectives and lo and behold here we are.**

 **The Stacks network now makes true Bitcoin Defi possible, given that smart contracts built on the Stacks network have the ability to see into the Bitcoin state and have an inherent ability to leverage Bitcoin‚Äôs security and settlement assurances. All Stacks transactions are settled on Bitcoin. This ensures that Stacks shares Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term, unparalleled security for transactions! You can read more about the revolutionary work and developments that Stacks is making a reality here.**",1634821641,5,1

qcqds8,cidadefalcao,Seven GOOD things about the Futures-Based ETF,"We have seen in the last few weeks a lot of bashing on the recently approved ETFs (so far, ProShares, which has been launched, plus Valkyrie and VanEck, which will launch tomorrow and next week respectively). I do not disagree with any of the arguments around (apart from occasional ""duh they gonna suppress price through paper BTC"" argument, which is simply wrong - I explain that in my first point in the following). Now I proceed to list a few GOOD things about a futures ETF in comparison to a spot ETF, mostly because I've seen no one mentioning those so far. Again I stress that **I agree with the arguments for why spot &gt; futures**. **No need to repeat them and say that futures is shit and spot is good because I agree with that.** I am just presenting a silver lining here given what we have in the markets now.

I) The Futures ETF, by not requiring the ETF issuer to hold bitcoin but just future contracts from a particular exchange, is **more easily auditable**. The daily open interest on bitcoin futures at the CME can be checked at [https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitcoin.volume.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitcoin.volume.html), making it very difficult for the ETF issuer to increase the ETF shares supply without going long on the futures contract. With a spot ETF, you need to trust the issuer (or the custodian) holds the bitcoins because they very likely will not reveal the address where the bitcoins are (for either security reasons or regulation reasons, or both). 

II) With the Futures ETF, there is **ZERO risk the coins can be stolen, confiscated, or lost**, because they hold no coins. By holding a contract that provides exposure to the underlying, the ""carrying risk"" is held by those buying spot and shorting futures to capture the premium. One of the main sources of this premium (in addition to the time value of money), which is not small and is the main disadvantage of the futures ETF) is precisely having to manage the security by your own.

III) With the Futures ETF, you can **benefit in the short term by a rapid increase in BTC prices**. While a spot bitcoin ETF would ideally perfectly track the bitcoin price, the Futures ETF track future contracts. The futures premium over spot can increase over short time periods, providing a higher return than simply holding bitcoin spot.

IV) With the bitcoin futures ETF, you can **benefit from shifts in interest rates**, should them ever occur. If the interest rates go down, the new future contract will trade at a lower price than they would otherwise. When rolling them, the ""contango bleed"" (the loss by selling a close to spot futures to buy an above spot futures expiring at a later date) will be reduced. If the interest rates go up, those holding the ETF will instantly benefit as the futures premium increase. Over time though, they will lose as the contango bleed increases. Admittedly, this is a very limited benefit because it goes away over time.

V) **If there is a big crash, you can benefit from an ""inverse contango bleed""/carrying premium** as futures may trade at a lower price than spot. For those holding the ETF through the crash event though, their losses can be magnified (although not necessarily: the futures price might decrease less than the spot price). This is not necessarily an advantage as it has a good and bad side but, with the futures ETF you have the possibility to have, at some point, a carrying premium. With a spot bitcoin ETF, this cannot happen.

VI) **Many institutional investors are restricted from taking positions in foreign-traded ETFs either by regulation or by mandate, so the futures ETF is all they have**. Same for some individuals. Again, not exactly an advantage over spot, but an advantage over nothing nevertheless. An hypothetical advantage over spot in that regard is that some institutional investors might be restrained from investing in some ""riskier"" ETFs, which in terms of security as explained in I) might be the case of the spot ETF but not the futures ETF. I admit however that this is a very speculative reasoning.

VII) Due to the return on the cash holdings (a futures ETF typically holds cash/treasuries and go long on future contracts), **a futures ETF might offer a lower effective total expense ratio/management fee than the spot ETF** (particularly if interest rates rise one day). Even if they do not rise though, a small return will be earned in the cash, which is not the case of the spot ETF. Additionally, due to competition with spot ETFs in the future, the futures ETF issuers might be able to reduce their fees even further, capturing some market share from spot ETF issuers and benefiting investors.",1634818370,3,1

A transaction is presented to the miners. What exactly is it about the transaction that causes an invalid transaction to be so? Every article I read just simply states, that even if a node tries to ""scam"" the transaction through, another node will declare it false and invalidate it.

But I know that there is a proper explanation underneath it, but for the life of me I cannot uncover it.

qbfmer,Seebeedeee,The US wants to raise its debt limit to $28.9T. How much money is that?‚Ä¶,"Let‚Äôs add up all ten of the world‚Äôs top assets.

Gold - $11.2T
Apple - $2.5T
Microsoft - $2.3T
Saudi Amaraco - $2T
Google - $1.9T
Amazon - $1.7T
Silver - $1.3T
Bitcoin - $1.1T
Facebook - $0.9T
Tesla - $0.8T

Together, these assets total just $25.7T and much of that wealth exists outside the USA.  Even if they confiscated all this wealth, who‚Äôs underlying assets would immediately lose tremendous value, they‚Äôd still be $4.2T short of being able to pay off the debt, which is more money than all of the US billionaires own combined.

The point of this is to demonstrate that there is almost no way to pay back $28.9T.  We could raise taxes and ‚Äúeat the rich‚Äù but that won‚Äôt even make a dent. The only feasible way to pay off the debt is to print more US Dollars until it‚Äôs value is near zero.  To make things worse, our government hasn‚Äôt even proposed a viable solution to fix the problem.

qa31ly,xcryptogurux,Beyond SoV - Bitcoin is the best money in history. It's the pinnacle of monetary evolution. Reserve currency status is a fait accompli. Nothing can stop this eventuality. Bitcoin has already won.,"How can a good store of value (SoV) also be a good medium of exchange (MoE) and unit of account (UoA)? Seems too perfect, right?

If the goal of Bitcoin is to replace fiat money, but Bitcoin is expected to increase in value in the long term, wouldn't it be prohibitive to use Bitcoin for paying for things?

This perspective comes from measuring Bitcoin's value in an inferior, depreciating form of money, and stems largely from a collective price illusion that the dollar is a stable representation of monetary value. The dollar price of Bitcoin is merely relative face value, rather than intrinsic value, while Bitcoin, as a nascent form of money, still remains in the process of discovering its true value to humanity.

# What is money?

Money is anything that's accepted as representing value by the parties to any transaction. It's really that simple. Three thousand years ago, cowrie shells were used to represent value. Humans have always sought money that can hold value over time until it was required to purchase other things that hold value to them - goods and services.

When you purchase goods and services now, the question you ask yourself is whether what you're purchasing is valuable enough to you that you're happy to part with a certain amount of dollars to acquire it. Everything being denominated in dollars/fiat money lends to a perspective that the dollar represents some value and can be exchanged to buy things you need in life. 

When we get to a place where sats replace dollars as UoA, it would be a question of whether the good/service you're purchasing is necessary/valuable enough to you that you're happy to part with a certain amount of sats to acquire it.

But how can Bitcoin even be money when its supply is finite and limited to 21 million? It's finite but divisible. You could argue there aren't enough bitcoins to go around for everyone, but there are enough sats to go around for everybody - circa. 2.1 quadrillion.

Let's try imagining that 1 Bitcoin represents a 100 million-dollar bill, which at the current rate of inflation may not be so far-fetched to imagine in the near future. Are there enough 100 million-dollar bills to go around for everyone? Probably not (yet). But there are enough one-dollar bills to go around for everyone.

Additionally, the smallest unit on Lightning Network is millisats, 1/1000th of a sat, named after mill, which is 1/1000th of a dollar, an abstract unit of account in dollar-denominated accounting.

1 Bitcoin = 100 million sats

21 million Bitcoin = 2.1 quadrillion sats = 2.1 quintillion millisats

Infinite divisibility, but not infinite supply, is an important property for money. The putative best scarce money in history, gold, does not have this property. Bitcoin does.

# Bitcoin economy

In a Bitcoin economy, every good/service will be priced in sats, rather than dollars, and you can move your sats instantly from one corner of the world to another corner of the world at next to no cost peer-to-peer without middlemen. No money in history ever had this property, not dollar, not gold, and it's arguably what makes Bitcoin usurping the dollar as the world's reserve currency inevitable.

What a Bitcoin economy would do is immediately eliminate the moral hazards that inhere within the extant monetary paradigm predicated on arbitrary, whimsical, unscrupulous, flagrantly unmoderated expansionary policies founded upon nothing more than the existence of a lender of last resort with access to an infinite supply of money created without any effort out of thin air to continually bail out those at the top of the pyramid exploiting said moral hazards with impunity. It would restore rigor and sustainability to credit lines without frequent intervention at the cost of rampant inflation, and overall, cultivate better spending habits.

# Fiat money is a pyramid scheme

The current system of credit constantly incentivizes or even forces you through a myriad of machinations to keep spending money from tomorrow's labor, but the new injection of money from your tomorrow's labor ends up being concentrated at the top, with the ultimate consequence of inequitably diminishing your purchasing power and continually enriching those at the top of the pyramid.

In short, money borrowed against your future labor ends up destroying your own purchasing power while the lender profits off your future labor, both in the form of interest and by being closer to the new money. It's a double whammy.

&amp;#x200B;

[ A system of credit based on infinite, but concentrated expansion of supply. Inflation benefits those close to the new money \(top of the pyramid\), while those at the bottom bear the brunt of it. This is Cantillon Effect.](https://preview.redd.it/mppw2dr2m0u71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4fed33b1c01af8c7a402b5af7c5f885e178f559)

&amp;#x200B;

This system is ""sustainable"" for a reasonably long period of time, until hyperinflation becomes untenable, only because it enables infinite, unmoderated expansion of the money supply. Fiat monetary systems have never in history survived beyond a few generations.

# Aftershocks of the Nixon Shock

In 1971, President Nixon canceled the convertibility of the US dollar to gold. The subsequent collapse of the Bretton Woods system gave central banks absolute monetary authority as the dollar was no longer required to be backed by gold reserves.

The Fed's newfound abilities to continually manipulate supply, interest rates, and velocity of money have led to deleterious consequences. Perpetual expansion to spur economic growth has sent deficits spiraling out of control and resulted in, inter alia, a vicious cycle of inflation and ever-increasing, now extreme, economic inequality.

# The Pinnacle of Monetary Evolution

I view Bitcoin to be the culmination of humanity's 7000-year quest to perfect the representation of value by truly democratizing its creation, distribution and exchange. Never before have we had a money with all the necessary properties of money. All previous forms of money had compromises.

Scarce money has always been sound money but previous iterations of scarce money lacked the other properties required to be viable as MoE and UoA - fungible, readily portable, infinitely divisible, incorruptible, indestructible, provably finite and objectively verifiable.

Bitcoin ticks all the boxes. What's more? It adds a whole new dimension to money hitherto unimaginable, obviating the need for trust, eliminating counterparty risk without the burden and attendant inefficiencies of involving trusted middlemen.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Sound money fulfills all three functions of money - SoV, MoE, UoA](https://preview.redd.it/t1azmamjn0u71.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb96dbc2eb0e78bfaaca45fb2da5b10305848f1)

 

# Triffin Paradox

The Triffin paradox explains why any sovereign currency serving as a global reserve currency is unworkable - the state issuing the reserve currency is required to continually run up a deficit to meet the world's demand for its currency. This creates a conflict of interest between domestic and international monetary policies, which becomes untenable in the long run, leading to the collapse of the system. The average lifespan for reserve currencies is 95 years.

Bitcoin is the only monetary system in history that has the properties to last forever, for it doesn't derive value from the authority/wealth of the issuer, which is fleeting, but a timeless universal constant - hard-coded mathematics.

Bitcoin is the reserve currency of the universe, should we ever need one.

qa2jbk,Neat-Apartment3871,"In the era of inflation, only BTC is the real asset","The production price affected by the rise in commodity prices is a manifestation of the beginning of inflation. The inflation rate in developed countries accounts for 7.1%, and it is now in the 90th percentile of historical data.

During the epidemic, non-agricultural wages increased due to the dismissal of low-paid workers. As these workers return to employment, wages are more likely to fall rather than rise in the coming months.

The data shows that BTC has begun to play a role in hedging inflation. Observing the changes in BTC prices relative to inflation, we can find that this relationship is becoming more and more important statistically.

We are still not sure what will happen to inflation in the next 5 years, but we believe that increasing real assets is a prudent measure to protect the investment portfolio from the tail risk of out-of-control inflation.

1. Inflation is beginning to show up

Signs of potential inflation problems are beginning to appear, the most obvious being the tightening of employment conditions (and the consequent rise in wages) and the rise in global production prices. However, there are still differences among investors. The outlook for inflation is divided into two schools of thought: one believes that the impact of inflation is more short-lived in nature, and the other believes that inflation has risen to a level that threatens economic stability.

&amp;#x200B;

The data shows that from a historical point of view, the current global inflation rate is not that high. The current level of inflation is similar to that observed after the 2008 financial crisis, and since 1970, it has only been placed at the 55th percentile. This is because production prices are affected by rising commodity prices, and inflation is beginning to rise. 7.1% in developed countries, the current figure is in the 90th percentile.

&amp;#x200B;

In the era of inflation, only BTC is the real asset

&amp;#x200B;

During the recovery phase of the new crown epidemic, the unemployment rate has fallen much faster than during the global financial crisis, which means that the labor market has begun to heat up, and it also means that wages may increase with it, as we have seen in the United States this year. Although wage growth has intensified during the epidemic, the unemployment of low-income workers has reversed this situation. As these workers are re-employed, wage growth in the coming months is likely to decline, rather than increase.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether a higher inflation rate is just around the corner. Global shipping disruptions, wider supply chain issues, and inventory challenges have exacerbated short-term inflation, which has led to some supply bottlenecks, but this does not necessarily mean that it will lead to longer-term inflation problems. Therefore, it is difficult for us to say exactly what will happen to inflation. This issue is in the hands of central bank officials, and history shows that they will be more passive rather than proactive.

&amp;#x200B;

2. The dilemma of the central bank

Reducing currency issuance after unprecedented easing policies is likely to cause a dislocation in the bond market, which will result in greater market volatility. Speeding up liquidity in order to alleviate market pressure has left the US Federal Reserve and other central banks stuck in this dilemma, so it is difficult to eliminate its negative impact.

&amp;#x200B;

This is why the market pays so much attention to the recent June FOMC (Federal Oversight and Monetary Commission) statement. The minutes of the FOMC meeting highlight that the Fed maintains a very moderate attitude in general (even if the minutes are unexpectedly tough). At the same time, they are considering the danger of inflation by raising the inflation forecast rate and sending out a signal to predict a rise in interest rates in 2023. The FOMC still believes that inflation is temporary in nature and is therefore happy to see inflation ""heat up"" over a period of time.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that the Fed‚Äôs ‚Äúresult-based‚Äù approach, which is the so-called ‚Äúwait until inflation arrives before taking action‚Äù, is risky. Especially considering the rapid changes in the world economy and technology, some traditional indicators of inflation may be unreliable.

&amp;#x200B;

Investor behavior also shows that many people do not believe in results-based methods. Due to a series of capital inflows since mid-2020, the assets managed by trading products in the trading platforms protected by inflation have increased by 74% in the past year.

&amp;#x200B;

In the era of inflation, only BTC is the real asset

&amp;#x200B;

These record capital inflows also highlight that perhaps concerns about inflation are becoming a consensus rather than an isolated view. It also implies that many investors believe that the Fed and other central banks may be behind the curve in the chart.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless of the outcome of inflation, the central bank may lose control of inflation, and there is still considerable tail risk. Therefore, as highlighted by the above-mentioned capital flow events, inflation hedging is becoming more and more popular. During inflation, there is a small part of hard assets that should perform well, and we think BTC is one of them.

&amp;#x200B;

3. BTC as an inflation hedge asset

Conceptually, BTC makes sense as an inflation hedge asset. This is what economists call ""real assets""-an asset with a limited and predictable supply. Therefore, if the supply of U.S. dollars or any other fiat currencies increases, the price at which BTC can be exchanged for these fiat currencies may appreciate, even if its purchasing power remains stagnant.

&amp;#x200B;

The data shows that BTC is beginning to play the role of this inflation hedge. Since its creation in 2009, observing its price changes relative to inflation during the two-year period highlights that this relationship is improving, and the current R2 is 0.30 (since 2019). And the relationship between BTC and inflation is currently better than the relationship between inflation and gold.

&amp;#x200B;

In the era of inflation, only BTC is the real asset

&amp;#x200B;

Citigroup compiled an index to track unexpected inflation by measuring inflation forecasts and delivery results.

&amp;#x200B;

At a level above zero, inflation is higher than expected. BTC also has an early but possibly convincing relationship with unexpected inflation. Our analysis emphasizes that BTC does respond to unexpected inflation and will rise when the inflation data is higher than expected.

&amp;#x200B;

In the era of inflation, only BTC is the real asset

&amp;#x200B;

We realize that the relationship between BTC and inflation is likely to be uncertain at this moment, because the sample size is small. In other words, this relationship has been steadily improving over time, which has also increased the credibility of the concept of BTC as a real asset.

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, BTC as an asset is maturing

More and more evidences show that BTC as an asset is constantly maturing. After the recent FOMC statement (June 16) expressed an unexpectedly tough tone, the price movement is very similar to that of gold. This highlights that BTC's behavior is in line with investors' expectations of physical assets, which will appreciate when the U.S. dollar depreciates, and vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

In the era of inflation, only BTC is the real asset

&amp;#x200B;

We are still not sure what exactly will happen to inflation in the next 5 years, but we believe that adding BTC and other physical assets as a prudent measure is to protect the portfolio from the tail risk of out-of-control inflation. BTC originally had the concept of an inflation protection certificate, and it is now proven by increasing investor participation, as evidenced by the improvement in its relationship with consumer prices.",1634489360,25,1

qa16r7,Rudd-X,A Bitcoin economic future ‚Äî for the HODLer in you,"[Have you noticed a pattern in the seasonal peaks in the Bitcoin price?](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/)

Each seasonal peak reaches less and less into the red zones.

My hypothesis for this decrease of the acceleration of the price is  this: as the size of the Bitcoin market cap has grown, there will be  comparatively fewer other ""wealth and savings"" assets that Bitcoin can  effectively substitute.¬† With an example: whereas it was really easy at  the beginning for Bitcoin to act as a substitute for the first 1% all  gold / T-bill purchases, the last 1% of those purchases will be very,  very hard to substitute (after all, even as a maxi, I'd ask why would  you want your savings to be 99% into Bitcoin?).

This does mean that the advantage of early HODLing (you know, dear  HODLer, those 100X returns) would be gone.¬† But there would still be an  advantage to HODLing, and that advantage would never, ever go away.¬†  I'll explain this now.

As this hypothetical future comes closer to us, the Bitcoin price will continue to increase at a rate dictated *only* by the following factors:

&amp;#x200B;

* **(+)**
   * the monetary inflation of the currency the price is denominated in
   * the aggregate increase in size of the economy due to productivity increases
* **(‚Äì)**
   * the Bitcoin supply (ever-diminishing)

If we strip the monetary inflation out of that equation, then what  remains is (1) the Bitcoin supply increase (which will reach a near-zero  epsilon in the coming decades), and (2) the increases in economic  productivity.

At this point the purchasing power a Bitcoin HODLer has becomes ‚Äî in a  macro sense ‚Äî a concrete slice of the pie that is the global economy's  purchasing power.¬† Importantly, this would be true irrespective of  whether you're operating with local currencies or Bitcoin as daily  payment forms.

Think about it for a second ‚Äî *this would be a complete reversal of the global order we have today*.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Today**, if you're living in a ""lucky place"", the  pizza you ordered ""inflates in price"" at a rate of, say, 3% annually,  even though it gets *cheaper* every year to make that pizza (both  in terms of labor and ingredients).¬† Meanwhile, your salary grows ‚Äî  maybe ‚Äî at a rate of 2-3%, and *sometimes* it crashes to zero for long periods of time.
* **In this potential future**, your salary would  maintain itself (assuming you do the exact same job forever), but you'd  see very clearly how every year you can afford to buy more, and more,  and more, with the effects of this *eternal price deflation* compounding over the decades in your lifetime.¬† Pizzas would become cheaper and cheaper ([um, when have we seen this before?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWU3O3X5kKE)).¬† Think about it ‚Äî if productivity increased 100%, your savings would buy ‚Äî *ceteris paribus* ‚Äî more or less *double* what they buy today.

We've already seen this exact same thing happen in countries like  Venezuela and Argentina ‚Äî HODLers managed to protect their purchasing  power as their nations' currencies crumbled.¬† Imagine this happening  worldwide, and you get to understand the magnitude of this economic  order change.¬† The value of your money ‚Äî Bitcoin ‚Äî would be, for the  first time in a long time, maybe ever, truly tethered to the increases  of productivity of the whole world.¬† It would mean the absolute reversal  of [what happened in 1971](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/)... slowly, then suddenly.

This phenomenon will, of course, render many modern ""bullshit""  economic activities completely unprofitable, vis a vis just HODLing ‚Äî  not that this is novel or anything, as I think pretty much every HODLer  already knew this.¬† Why would you invest in a business that gives you 3%  returns with non-negligible risk, when just sitting on your money will  give you an automatic 3% increase in purchasing power?¬† Obviously you'd  keep saving...

...and all you have to do, to bring about this just economic order, where people keep the real value of what they work for, **is keep saving**.

qa0nh5,jcoll627,"Why Bitcoin Could Break $65,000 This Week","When Bitcoin reached its previous high in April it is clear that high was built on higher leverage than today's price. April's $64K was driven by leverage with the near term goal of reaching a $1,000,000,000,000 (Trillion) Bitcoin market cap for the first time. We then saw a pullback as investors deleveraged to take their gains.

During this recovery phase which has put us over $60K once again, we saw an influx in a higher proportion of actual dollars versus leveraged dollars. 

These are my top reasons why this week's potential Bitcoin all time high is different...

 (1) institutional investors continue to announce investments and plans to invest in Bitcoin (long term holders means more stability, and less / safer leverage)

(2) high amounts of Bitcoin were being purchased and placed in cold storage during the pull back (less supply on market)

(3) recognizable names and companies are increasingly endorsing crypto which further increases the network effect and legitimizes the assets (Tesla, Mr Wonderful, Mark Cuban, Societe General, Fidelity, Twitter, Visa, George Soros, etc)

(4) the US government and the SEC appear to be permitting ETF futures which is a positive signal for a potential physical ETF.

This last point is much more significant than people estimate. If an US ETF is approved it inherently means the US government is limiting its ability to regulate Bitcoin in a negative light. Once retirement savings are legitimatized via ETFs, regulation will come in the form of... How best can the US government protect people's retirements versus pre-ETF approval it feels like the government could still do what it wants. 

Even Mr Wonderful acknowledged that a trillion dollars of ETF money is on the sidelines waiting to enter Bitcoin.

In other words, US ETF approval signifies escape velocity for Bitcoin, both in terms of US government legitimization and stabilization from ETFs capital inflow. We will without a question be above $100,000 Bitcoin if this happens. 

I have Fidelity and I am 38, if that ETF is approved I move my whole retirement (actual retirement from the pharma company I work for) into Bitcoin because I believe the best way to build a better world is to allow programmers to tokenize/digitize the interactions of humanity one interaction at a time. I believe more in technology and programmers than Washington politics and lawyers. If left with the latter we all end up on dystopian welfare. Future generations of Americans will never let this happen! Let's go free markets and capitalism!

qa0l0h,Thowaway24243747474,Appeal to community - Please pull your coins into cold storage,"I know this post isn't exactly novel, but I think it should be reiterated.

The futures ETF as well as any derivative investment vehicle for BTC will not be good for bitcoin long term.

The entire premise of 21 million coins being a hard cap is threatened each time the legacy financial system adds some derivative instrument on top of btc.

The major problem statement with fiat currencies is banks' abilities to issue unlimited unbacked cash with fractional reserve banking and quantitive easing.  If we allow centralized exchanges to hold all of the coins then they can sell as many IOUs for bitcoin as they want, which is no different from your local bank issuing loans for dollars they don't hold.  Futures ETFs will give hedge funds ways to manipulate the price as well, and these groups have even less reason to care about bitcoins long term health than exchanges.

This is an appeal to:

**1) Remove your coins off of the exchange to cold storage.**  

I know there are those that are afraid of controlling their own keys, but please put the effort in to properly secure and store your keys.  Think of it as both a learning opportunity and your chance to do bitcoin a service as a whole.

I know there are those that like earning passive interest on your coin - Consider starting a lightning node and earning sats in this manner instead of using an exchange's interest program.  Your 4% APY for lending your btc to shorters is laughable compared to the amount you may lose over time to price suppression from paper btc and naked shorting.

**2) Never, EVER, EVER buy an ETF that doesn't have proof of reserves (hint, the new futures ones DO NOT).**

Educate those around you to hold the real thing.  not your keys, not your bitcoin.  I know there are certain investment monies that need to go into a legacy stock, but this new ETF is not the thing.  Either pull the fund and buy real bitcoin or pick Microstrategy with your IRA.  At least Saylor is a bitcoin Maxi.

TLDR;
I know there is already a ""Proof of Keys"" day, but I think this should be less of a single day thing and something we do often and unexpectedly to keep exchanges honest.  

If the exchanges have to add more btc to their reserves because everyone pulls their coins into cold storage, it will allow the real spot price to come through (Assuming exchanges aren't already keeping an honest 1:1 btc reserve for their customers).

If this post gets even only gets a handful of people to pull their coins off, I feel that it was worth the time.  Thanks for listening.",1634483401,291,1

qa0eep,KosmosHD,The only possible way to get BTC wallet private keys. [A simple guide]," This is an old vulnerability but still is around. Not many bitcoin companies/wallets will re-use values these days when signing transactions, but people who are creating new copies of old coins and wallets generally don‚Äôt know about this vulnerability. While researching this, I discovered that a lot of Russian bitcoin hackers have coded bots to automatically grab coins from vulnerable addresses of this type and others as mentioned at the beginning of this tutorial.Here are some ways that a bitcoin address or wallet may be vulnerable. A private key is created with a common password such as ‚Äú123456‚Äù.A simple copy/paste mistake. A transaction is created with non-standard outputs. A random number generator was used wrong or produced the same output. The private key was posted publicly.We are going to be talking about a transaction with a broken random number generator (string). These addresses re-use certain values in a transaction due to poor knowledge, programming errors, or a broken random number generator.Take a look at this transaction: 

    https://blockchain.info/tx/9ec4bc49e828d924af1d1029cacf709431abbde46d59554b62bc270e3b29c4b1?ref=hackernoon.com

There are two inputs and one output in this script. This is alright. Inputs are pointers to outputs of previous transactions. Outputs are, at the basic, an amount and an address.Taking a closer look at the inputs of these scripts we notice that they are similar.

    ScriptSig: PUSHDATA(71)[30440220d47ce4c025c35ec440bc81d99834a624875161a26bf56ef7fdc0f5d52f843ad1022044e1ff2dfd8102cf7a47c21d5c9fd5701610d04953c6836596b4fe9dd2f53e3e01] PUSHDATA(65)[04dbd0c61532279cf72981c3584fc32216e0127699635c2789f549e0730c059b81ae133016a69c21e23f1859a95f06d52b7bf149a8f2fe4e8535c8a829b449c5ff]

The beginning of the scripts contains the signatures (defined as ‚Äòr‚Äô and ‚Äòs‚Äô). The end of the script is the hex public key. So we have:

    r1: d47ce4c025c35ec440bc81d99834a624875161a26bf56ef7fdc0f5d52f843ad1

    s2: 9a5f1c75e461d7ceb1cf3cab9013eb2dc85b6d0da8c3c6e27e3a5a5b3faa5bab 

It turns out that the r values in the scripts are exactly the same. This means we can derive the private key.Now for some math equations:

    Bitcoin Private Key = (z1*s2 - z2*s1)/(r*(s1-s2))

We have the r and s values, now we need to find the z1 and z2 values.Go here: https://2coin. org/?ref= hackernoon.comEnter in our transaction ID: 9ec4bc49e828d924af1d1029cacf709431abbde46d59554b62bc270e3b29c4bFind the z values.

    https://imgur.com/a/FMGc6B3

We find:

    z2 = 17b0f41c8c337ac1e18c98759e83a8cccbc368dd9d89e5f03cb633c265fd0ddc

Bitcoin uses an elliptical curve for generating public keys. The order of the curve is secp256k1.¬†

    p = parameter for the secp256k1 curve.
    So p = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141

My goal was to buy a little house and just live there minimalisticly. What do you need for a living , not much I guess‚Ä¶



All in all , I had about 500 000$ in cryptocurrencies. 

I wanted to cash out and buy a small apartment or house as I was planning for years.

Already had meetings with the bank to transfer the money and so on. 

As they didn‚Äôt give me an answer I had to wait and watch how to price is falling ‚Ä¶


My intention was to sell when the price was 64000$ per bitcoin. 

A month later I get a negative answer back as the bank is not willing to do the transaction, I should do it with another bank.

Ok, so far so good. Bitcoin price has fallen down to under 30000$. So I decided to wait and sell at the next move up in price.

A few days later I checked my wallet, and all coins have been sent out ! 

Somebody hacked my mail, stole my passphrase and stole all my funds. 

I had about 6 BTC and more other coins. 

No I am down to zero. 

My life work from the last 10 years is completely whiped out ! 


I was never to lazy , I did any job I can get to make some extra money . I‚Äôve put in blood sweat and tears. 

I cannot handle the loss.

I don‚Äôt know , I am hoping that maybe somebody is super super rich and believes in karma. As I do , I think you get what you give. 
I believe in law of attraction. 
When I wake up, the first thing that come to my mind is , how I lost everything. 
You start to think about ways to make this much money again, but when you deep honest with yourself. It will be hard to earn this money again, as I bought my first bitcoin under 1000$. 

So i don‚Äôt know how Continue my life ‚Ä¶ 
Does god exist ? If somebody would tell me this story, I would not hesitate to send him some if I have a lot. Depends on the person, if he deserves it. Like nothing in life is guaranteed. You may have a car accident and never be able to walk again. 
I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs completely crazy to me and I don‚Äôt know how to move on. 

How much does somebody need for a living? Of course it‚Äôs all relative but to make a decent living and not have the need to work until becoming an old person.

Of course I am willing to put in work , as I never was lazy. 

So can somebody hook me up in any way ? 

I would literally do nearly anything.",1634482348,37,1

qaktxa,RoloAL35,Should my brother sell his bitcoin?,"Some context: I introduced my brother to bitcoin back in around March of this year, only a couple months after I started stacking sats. He is in his final year in university and was unemployed during the summer due to the pandemic. He had a work placement for about 8 months until the summer, and got paid for that, but has since run out of that money. He has started a new part time job very recently, but hasn't been paid yet and basically out of cash at this point. We both still live with our family, so rent isn't an issue for him. But of course he still wants to be as independent as possible, not taking money from our parents. 

Cut to today, he's asked me if he should sell his bitcoin because he's now almost out of cash. He's made a profit, maybe 50% or so. I won't divulge how much he bought, but it isn't exactly a life changing amount, but it would tide him over for a few months I'd say. I don't want him to sell, obviously, because I don't want him to regret it later. I work full time, and whilst I don't make a lot of money (hence why I've yet to move out of my family home), I am good with money and have money saved up and invested in different places. I've offered to loan him money to get him through til he starts getting paid, but I obviously also don't want to pressure him about what he does with his money/bitcoin, as that is ultimately his choice.

Should I let him sell his bitcoin without any pushback or should I try to convince him to accept my loan offer? Like I mentioned, this isn't a life changing amount of money, it would be a very small loan realistically, so there's no fear about the common issues people have when loaning money to family.",1634556807,23,1

qak3n5,JunoKat,How do you imagine the ‚Äúend game‚Äù of Bitcoin?,"I think it will go to zero one day.

Here‚Äôs why:

* 99% of national currencies ever created have been abolished, debased or replaced over the course of many thousand years. Regime changes, currency changes too.
* 99% of countries and regime, kings and queens, government and institutions have ‚Äúgone to zero‚Äù over the course of history
* Prime real estate Lhasa (Tibet - year 800 BC) gave way to prime real estate in Rome (Roman - year 117 BC). It then gave way to many other successors that then gave way to prime real estate in New York, London, Shanghai, etc

One day, something better will replace Bitcoin too. My assumption is that it will take more than dethroning one country, one regime, or one national currency for it to go down. The reason is its decentralised and amoral nature:

* It work for Russians the same way it would for Vietnamese or Americans
* It protects your fund with the same level of security (hashrate) whether you are a billionaire in the US or an office worker in Vietnam
* It doesn‚Äôt care that one or five governments go down, get into wars, shut it down, or ban it. It would still work perfectly well for the other governments and citizens that embrace and use it.

&amp;#x200B;

I was very struck by Thiel's comments on E-Gold and how it may have helped spark Bitcoin as a decentralized alternative. Also, reading about E-Gold and Douglas Jackson is really quite fascinating. He had all of the major issues exactly right, far earlier than anyone else. Granted, he did create a centralized solution which clearly failed but it's a very interesting story to learn about in contrast to what is happening today. Shame that he believes Bitcoin is a speculative bubble. But an interesting vignette in Bitcoin history that I rarely see discussed.

Twitter and Square Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted last Friday saying that Square is looking to build a bitcoin mining system.

&amp;#x200B;

Targeted at individuals and businesses, it will be based on custom silicon and open source.

&amp;#x200B;

Dorsey previously tweeted that he hopes to make crypto mining more accessible, commenting that the current industry is dominated by large-scale players who can afford to buy the specialty gears for coin mining. 

&amp;#x200B;

Square has been working on several bitcoin projects, including building an open developer platform and a hardware wallet for the cryptocurrency.  

&amp;#x200B;

On Friday, bitcoin topped $60,000 for the first time in half a year, and it stayed above the line over the weekend.

qahmc6,NicholasBen123,What is the relationship between IPFS/Filecoin?,"What is IPFS?

&amp;#x200B;

The Chinese name of IPFS is the Interplanetary File System. Like the HTTP protocol, it is the underlying protocol of the Internet. Unlike the HTTP protocol, IPFS is a distributed storage underlying protocol.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The HTTP protocol has been in use for 31 years. In our actual application process, there are often problems such as user data being cleared, backbone network operating efficiency is low, cost is high, and servers are easily attacked by hackers. Then these problems will not occur when using IPFS. IPFS is inherently resistant to DOS attacks. It is more efficient to read multiple points at the same time, and the cost of use is one-tenth of that of centralized storage.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of the above technical characteristics and cost of use of IPFS, IPFS is entirely possible to subvert or even replace the current traditional centralized storage protocol. In addition, the Protocol Lab has also won awards from many world-renowned investment institutions including Y Combinator, Winklevoss Brothers Fund, DCG Group, Stanford University, Anderson Horowitz Fund, Founders Club, Union Square Ventures, etc. invest. At present, IPFS has been applied to countless industries, including Google, Microsoft, Firefox, World Wide Web, the Library of Congress, the German Space Center, the official website of the Canadian government, and so on. Based on the technical characteristics of IPFS, the prospect of IPFS is very impressive.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What is Filecoin? What is the relationship with IPFS?

&amp;#x200B;

Filecoin is an incentive layer token based on the IPFS protocol. It can also be said to be the value system of IPFS. It is used to encourage more nodes to contribute their own storage and bandwidth to participate in the IPFS ecosystem, and resource contributors will get it based on their effective contributions. Its purpose is to more effectively involve the public to promote IPFS.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At present, FIL futures have been listed on 300+ exchanges worldwide. And Filecoin also created the miracle of global ICO private placement, raising more than 257 million US dollars in one hour, becoming the world's most eye-catching investment project comparable to that of Ethereum. The FIL coins we obtained can be directly traded on exchanges like Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How can IPFS participate?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What we need to do is to buy mining machines to mine, obtain FIL coins, and then sell the FIL coins we have acquired and hold on the market, or hold them, and wait until the price reaches our expectations before selling.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Filecoin's revenue sources are divided into three parts: block revenue, storage revenue, and retrieval revenue. Block rewards (incremental market): Miner C will automatically receive FIL rewards every time he packs a block, releasing more than 410,000 each day. Storage revenue (stock market): Customer A has storage requirements and bids X FILs. Miner C provides storage resources and obtains X FILs. Retrieval income (stock market): Customer B has a file retrieval (viewing) requirement and bids Y FILs. Miner C provides retrieval services and obtains Y FILs. So how to calculate the specific benefits? Let me give you a brief introduction. The total amount of Filecoin issuance is 2 billion, and the halving mechanism is 6 years, and it can only be mined in 60 years. The price of FIL coin will fluctuate to a certain extent with the proportion of the IPFS market. The higher the proportion, the higher the price of FIL coin, the shorter our return period, and the faster and higher the natural return.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone's investment philosophy and methods are different. We can consider comprehensively according to our own capital situation, choose the investment method that suits us, avoid investment risks reasonably, and maximize our investment income.

Honest question from my very ignorant point of view.

We've all been reading plenty about the electricity shortages happening all across the world. The most pessimistic (and conspirative) people are even preparing for a 2-week electricity cut in Europe in the following months, during winter.

Let's assume the worst-case scenario, that these things happen worldwide and mining facilities are also affected. I assume that would leave the bitcoin network wildly unprotected, and probably susceptible to a 51% attack. What would happen next?

qagio6,hookey13,Bearish post in a bullish phase. Advice worth considering.,"Dear Hodlers,

Bearish post in a bullish phase. I'm expecting downvotes, but I am happy to have them if it means I can give wisdom to 1 or 2 people. In this post, I wanted to list a few things to be mindful of when entering what could be one of the craziest weeks of price action we have seen in a few years.

I want to preface my points by saying, I have been, and still am, a HODLER of BTC and other cryptos for many years and have also been burnt in the past and seen significant portfolios dwindle because I didn't take profits when so many fundamentals were screaming at me to do so. I'm not a professional. However, I have a strong passion for trading and love all Bitcoin, and the broader crypto community is looking to achieve.

Here are my thoughts moving forward:

1. Buy the hype, sell the news. Coinbase listing &amp; futures. These two events have been equally as significant as the recent news of a US Futures Bitcoin ETF, which is looking likely to go ahead this coming week. When previously mentioned events occurred, the price has often risen the weeks prior (buying into the hype) and crashed the day or days later after the news hits and is confirmed.
2. As Warren Buffett said, ""Be fearful when others are greedy"". It takes one search of Bitcoin on YouTube to see the sheer number of green arrows, bulls, and shocked faces at present to action/consider this advice. More so, the BTC fear/greed index is at a point where rejection/price correction has occurred seven times over the last year. See the following link: [https://ibb.co/Fwz5fRk](https://ibb.co/Fwz5fRk). I've overlayed the one-year BTC price and the fear greed index. The white lines represent times the price hasn't blown through this point and instead rebounded or consolidated, resulting in a decent drop in price (&gt;15%).
3. Bitcoin IS overbought from a technical analysis view. I think that's pretty clear to everyone. Most indicators have been screaming for a reversal. We all know that BTC ignores indicators in true euphoric bull runs and respects them when simply rising in price, reversing close to when it should. At this stage, Bitcoin keeps being bitcoin and is going against all the bears claiming 20K incoming.
4. Nothing is linear. Price has been too euphoric. Bitcoin and all assets like to retrace. It's essential for the longevity of a bull run. Since the 25th of September, the price hasn't retraced &gt;\~7% from high to low. It's relatively uncommon, especially with the greater than average volume we have seen since this date.
5. Finally, Evergrande. As much as we like to think that BTC isn't tied to traditional markets, it is. I'm not going to lecture you about what's happening. If you don't know what I mean by simply stating, Evergrande, google it and read. It hasn't gone away and isn't any time soon. It could heavily impact this euphoric run we are experiencing if the broader traditional market were to tank.

As much as I'd love to give you the pipedream that we're going to surpass ATH and go the moon from here, I've been led by my emotions so many times in times like this and wanted to give (what I hope) are some wise words of advice.

To me, I am just a prudent value investor, because I have heavy bank loans to pay, I have underage children to raise, and I have elderly and sick parents to take care of, so I only hope to invest through stocks to get a return slightly higher than the bank interest rate. In fact, I live as hard as most working class. How many times have I wanted to give up due to the hardships of life, but¬†finally I opt to be optimistic and firmly believe that the light at the end of the tunnel. My nightmare started when I purchased with the stock code of 02009¬†in Hongkong Securities. This is an infrastructure builder and building materials provider. Its PB¬†and PE¬†are very low, although I am now knowing the PE or PB¬†is not a measure of whether a stock is worth investing in, but unfortunately I bought it. Since then, the nightmare began. The stocks are falling and falling, and the shorts such as Fulbright Securities¬†and Instinet Securities¬†take turns bombing and shorting. When these bloodthirsty shorts celebrate the pleasure brought by shorting, what they leave me is endless hesitation, loss, self-blame and guilt. How can you experience this feeling if you don't experience it personally? There is nothing wrong with being short, but it has been short for 5 consecutive years from¬†4HKD to 1 HKD, based¬†on the company's operating conditions are¬†so¬†good, and the small¬†investors are not given any chance to withdraw. This is how greedy and bloodthirsty it is.

I am not reconciled, I want to fight back. I want to make those bears who have no bottom line pay a heavy price. Why can these big bears act in collusion with¬†each other, and our small¬†investors who have suffered so much cannot be teamed up, and the suffering they cause us needs to be repaid 10 times.

q107z7,DredgerNG,Countries adopting BTC as legal tender are committing suicide.,"Why are you all so happy about this move of El Salvador and others? 

I acknowledge BTC as revolutionary genius invention and I'm sure blockchain will change our world to  better. But legal tender?

Inflationary monetary policy discourages money hoarding and encourages spending and more importantly investments. BTC is deflationary and therefore encourages its hoarding.

Now what happens if spending/investment is discouraged by adopting BTC as legal tender? No investments by companies means not improving efficiency of the production process and its technology. No progression to automation in production means people will be stuck with their boring monotonous job instead of learning something new or be released from salary slavery altogether (universal income when automation is ubiquitous and taxed for example). What I see future hold for these countries is factories falling apart producing the same things for decades. No technology improvements at all. Salary slavery never ending.

One plus would be people being able to save money and maybe retire at some point. And probably products made to last which would benefit our planet. Remittances cheaper of course. All these good effects could be attained and better by issuing CBDC on a public blockchain. You could issue deflationary currency for the people and inflationary for businesses for example (or currency with expiration). Or build in incentives for sustainability... Many other things which would benefit everybody and the planet. CBDCs would of course require very good privacy provisions otherwise it would unleash horrible Orwellian dystopia.

I am by no means expert on monetary policy and I have no formal econ education, but this LEGAL TENDER thing seems to be quite scary, don't you think?

In the beggining, the  Internet was supposed to be the ultimate tool for sharing of information  and free knowledge, and bring the whole world together. Fast forward 30  years and well, we all know what the Internet really is today, right?

Most  of it is controlled by very few big companies, it's constantly used as a  tool of manipulation and advertisement, and a weapon against the  working class. Sure, it has made some changes in our lifes yes but, is  your life really better because of it?

Let  me be clear, I'm not saying the Internet is a bad thing. I think is a  wonderful concept. But human nature does not deal very well with  wonderful things. It always ends up boiling things down to a matter of  dominance. And it will do the same with crypto.

Fiatmarketcap.com takes a Bitcoin standard approach to analyze currencies. It measures the world‚Äôs biggest currencies in terms of market capitalization as priced in BTC, the best form of money ever created but still lagging in perception.

The website also uses BTC as a measuring stick for countries‚Äô gross domestic product (GDP), which puts Bitcoin at eighteenth place.

As the world starts recognizing the superiority of BTC in nearly all aspects of a good money, namely durability, portability, verifiability, divisibility, and scarcity. As time progresses and bitcoin adoption increases, it is set to have a more well-established history of success, which confers upon it a greater appeal for usage.

By thinking in bitcoin terms right away, people can realign the incentives governing their economic decisions. As monetary supply increases indefinitely, inflation follows suit and so do prices, leading to a distorted view of the economic reality based on the feedback given by free market prices.",1634751965,54,1

qc5l8s,CrazyCryptoNoob,"Recommended Crypto (esp. BTC) to my family, got a shitstorm because of two reasons","Hello together, I've been a silent reader of this great community for some time. However, because of this topic, I had the urge to create an account:

When BTC was at 58k a few days ago, I said to my quite wealthy family members, please invest a bit of your dead cash into BTC as BTC might soon hit ATH (omg, just did) and then ... etc. etc.

Good god, as answers, I just received links to illegal activities (1) + environmental issues (2). From drug dealers in Mexico to the Iranian regime funding their activities with crypto.

Long story short, where noobs like me need support or better understanding are **data driven facts:**

* is the share of illegal activities with BTC more than with e.g. USD/EUR? are there good sources somewhere? If this is an issue, how can it be mitigated?
* the same for environment, here the question is a bit more complex?  

   * are there some top altcoins that might have less footprint than BTC (if they reached mass adoption)
   * what if we take into account all the energy that conventional banking consumes (e.g. having branches etc.); is BTC still doing super bad? If this is an issue, how can it be mitigated? I guess there are ""networks"" working on this?

Cheers to all of you.

P.S.: I want us to be brutally honest, e.g. ""yes, the situation is really bad like now but it could be fixed with X and Z in the future"".",1634749460,24,1

qc5bq7,msamuelem,ETF vs Cold Storage,"Hello everyone, I am from Canada and recently starting learning about money, inflation, bitcoin, assets, etc. I have researched the value of bitcoin and believe in it‚Äôs intrinsic value as a dominant global monetary asset.

Now I have invested a little bit of money into purpose Bitcoin ETF (https://www.purposeinvest.com/funds/purpose-bitcoin-etf) simply because of tax purposes. I can invest in my TFSA (tax-free savings account) and get 100% profits i make off bitcoin. The bitcoin held by the ETF is held in cold storage which is good. 

Now to be honest, the reason I am investing in bitcoin is because I see the potential upside and see the potential of financial freedom in 10-20 years if I invest enough through DCA every 2 weeks when I get paid.

I have been researching how fiat currencies are losing there value rapidly and how mass adoption of bitcoin could occur so my question is:

In order to be financially free in 20 years, should i keep my investment in the ETF where I will pay no taxes on profits and just sell it back in which it will be CAD whenever I have made enough or switch it over to physical bitcoin and keep in cold storage and just stack sats as i go? And how would I avoid the taxes if I switch over to physical bitcoin?

Thank you",1634748738,19,1

I won't explain much about the leak itself, but Lightshot is an app people use to print screens and send to someone to see, which you can easily view random prints that other people posted by typing a random 6-digit code. Search on it if you don't know what I am talking about.

This leak became a fiddling thing for many people, there's even sites that generates random codes for you, which I was using because I was bored out of my mind, and I stumbled upon across [a print of a chat](https://prnt.sc/w9za1w) of a dude giving his BTC wallet credentials to another dude, on a supposedly trading website that I never heard of. I ran virus check on the site and it was OK so I visited and tested his credentials, which worked and it had almost 2 BTC there... Which made me worry for the owner, that I immediately mailed asking for them to change the damn password and use 2FA.  


**But the plot thickens...** ***\[This is the important part, read it here\]***  
I was puzzled about this, because someone who mined almost 2 BTC would never be so careless with random print screen apps... So I searched and discovered that **it was all a scam**, to make you think you accessed a random account in a random trading website, and when you try to transfer the money, the site asks for a small fee for it, which you pay and the site never works, *supposedly*.  
I didn't even tried to transfer the money, so I didn't fell for the trap. I found this by a quick search on Google. I guess my parents teaching me that stealing is wrong worked great for me, but I figured that I might pass this information to others regardless. To think that I even mailed the guy...

I  have access to the old laptop's hard drive (which works just fine).

""There‚Äôs a lot of hype about Bitcoin - but these two things are true.

* Many people use Bitcoin. Since its launch in 2009, more than 76 million people worldwide have used Bitcoin.
* Most investors have no idea how it works. One survey says that only about 17% of crypto investors ‚Äúfully understand‚Äù their investment. In contrast, more than 33% have almost no idea how it works. This is not surprising since 40% of all crypto purchases come from new investors.""

I suggested that he change US$ fiat into bitcoin.  And then when he goes to Spain, convert bitcoin back to Fiat.  Since his crypto provider here (Robin Hood) does not offer services in Spain, he'd have to set up an account with a platform / exchange over there. Will he run into any issues?

qhqoa0,NoahsArkJP,Biggest Misconception about Bitcoin,"I feel like the biggest misconception about bitcoin is that ""it doesn't have any intrinsic value"". In thinking this way, people assume that money most be some kind of physical commodity to have value. The nature of money, though, is that it is a means of facilitating the exchange of things that have physical value. 

I think this misconception in thinking is similar to the ancient way of thinking that written words should look like the objects they describe. Writing evolved from hieroglyphics to more abstract symbols when people hit on the idea that the symbol need not be similar to the object it is referring to. Money in a way is like a certificate of service. E.g. if I perform a service of value for someone, but they have no service or product that I want, the dollar bill or piece of gold they give me is like a certificate that I did something of value for them, and, as a result, I can give this certificate to someone else in society who will then provide me with something of value in return. The certificate need not be something physical. Pure digital form will serve the purpose. 

Money is a good store of value when it's easily divisible, indestructible, and easily transportable. Bitcoin, while not perfect, serves these purposes well. Money need not be edible or have any value outside of it's usefulness in exchange. The fact that gold is beautiful helps make it something that many people will accept in trade, but even beauty is not a required characteristic of a good medium of exchange. Once gold starts circulating as a store of value and not for the purpose of being used as jewelry, people will accept it merely for it's usefulness as a savings vehicle. It could also be argued that bitcoin is even more ""beautiful"" than gold due to it's design ingenuity which gives it symbolic value. 

So, money should not be confused with the tangible wealth it is used to circulate.",1635438175,17,1

&amp;#x200B;

My friend, Carlos, having read the above and messaging me:  
 

&gt;are you concerned how a ton of BTC is held by a small amount of users?   
&gt;  
&gt;like concentrated amount a small pool of ppl?   
&gt;  
&gt;so if they sell BTC tanks? 

*So I responded...*  


""yeah this article is very misleading, i can break down every one of their points 

this will be fun here we go 

**#1 ""This inherent concentration makes bitcoin susceptible to systemic risk and also implies that the majority of the gains from further adoption are likely to fall disproportionately to a small set of participants.""** 

so, they clearly haven't looked at the trend which would easier disprove this.  It's getting less centralized as more people participate, not more centralized.  they would need supporting evidence to back this claim since the evidence ive seen suggests the exact opposite 

other than mining pools, but even mining pools are debatedly decentralizing since anyone include you and me can join them to make a profit.  Pools are where everyone pools together mining power into a conglomerate so that you can get paid since if you tried mining alone you'd never mine a single block in 1000 years 

 as far as mining pools centralizing risk, the china ban kind of showed thats not an issue.  Mining took a rocket to the chest and it came back like that metalic android from terminator 2 

&amp;#x200B;

**#2 Researchers found the biggest 10,000 bitcoin holders held around 27% of the total 18.6 million coins in circulation at the end of 2020, with a high degree of concentration among crypto exchanges and so-called miners‚Äîthose that secure the bitcoin blockchain in return for freshly-minted coins.** 

this is kind of what i mean with trends.  10,000 is waay up from where it was and rising.  and 10,000 is VERY decentralized, lol, especially if those are exchanges and miners 

exchanges aren't gonna dump the market, they're literally holding the coins for millions of people!! 

even if one did there's thousands and many of them are giants, very decentralized 

i mean, that's like saying what if wall street as a whole just dumps on us?? 

its like dude they are making the trades for 100+ million americans, they cant just dump everyones stocks without their permission 

what are we even talking about?? 

hahaha 

&amp;#x200B;

**#3 The top 10% of miners control 90% of the bitcoin mining capacity, with just 0.1%‚Äîabout 50 miners in all‚Äîcontributing 50% of this.** 

so yeah this is the mining pools thing again.  it's just a long tail graph, it's the same as saying ""coinbase, kraken, binance, gemini, bittrex, and bitfinex exchanges hold the majority of the exhange volume!"" 

its like yeah i know.  chase also like 20% of the entire banking sector 

then wells at like 10% 

then i dunno US Bank at 5% 

eventually you get to the top 10% have the vast majority of people's money and then there's thousands of tiny banks 

mining pools are made up of many individuals mining.  they aren't going to agree to tank their own network... they'd just switch to a mining pool that isnt evil 

&amp;#x200B;

**#4 and final: ""pointing to many of the early mined bitcoins that are likely all controlled by bitcoin's mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto but are spread across some 20,000 different addresses.""** 

Satoshi's coins are the only real risk, and that's estimated to be around 500K-1MM coins, or up to 5% of the supply 

which is not a lot and with the liquidity these days would most likely be absorbed pretty easily 

might dip us down like 25-50% for a few months worst case 

thats assuming he DUMPS 

which he wouldnt 

 

*Carlos:*

&gt;fo sho   
&gt;  
&gt;solid points 

&amp;#x200B;

he would sell here and there over time so as to get a decent value 

hes not gonna be like 

you know what i wanna do 

sell my coins way cheaper than i have to 

ive got an emergency and i need my 100 billion TODAY 

lol

Background: The SEC recently approved of the first Bitcoun futures ETF a few weeks ago. A Bitcoun futures ETF allows investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own the actual coins.

Numbers: Since the introduction of Direxion‚Äôs ETF on Tuesday, the value of Bitcoin has fallen by about 6%.

Final Thoughts: It was only a matter of time before an ETF that shorted Bitcoin would be introduced. If approved, it is ideal for those investors who are bearish of cryptocurrency.

*This is a promoted article provided by Unbanked.*

Through the crypto-based banking platform Unbanked, traditional banking systems are integrated with revolutionary blockchain technology to deliver cutting-edge access to financial instruments to users all around the world, all made possible by Bitcoin.

Since its founding in 2018, Unbanked has striven to use the decentralized power of Bitcoin and blockchain technology to reach the hundreds of millions of people worldwide who are ‚Äúunbanked,‚Äù those whose total assets and property, to the extent that they exist, are stored in reservoirs totally disconnected from the global banking system. This includes those who can only access services from smaller banks, whose regulations may fluctuate wildly from country to country and even within certain countries, as well as those who cannot access financial services that are more fully integrated into the broader world of money.

But what is the point of Bitcoin, if not to create a worldwide system of money, to revolutionize the way transactions are carried out by means of a radical decentralized vision?

As the co-founder and co-CEO of Unbanked, Ian Kane, explains, ‚ÄúBlockchain is the most efficient way in human history to transmit value, and it provides an opportunity for billions of people around the world who are not able to partake in the global financial ecosystem.‚Äù

Although this has been part of Unbanked‚Äôs strategy all along, Kane added that ‚Äúmore people are moving towards touchless payments in a post-COVID world. We provide tools and products that allow them to participate.‚Äù

Unbanked already offers banking access to users in over 200 countries and territories worldwide, and the company‚Äôs plans for the future include not only growing into a broader range of service areas, but also establishing a deeper level of adoption in the countries where it already operates. Espousing a firm belief that people have a right to control their economic destiny, and that social progress is massively aided by people worldwide having the ability to make such connections, Kane claimed that Unbanked is always working to give people ‚Äúthe on- and off-ramps to be able to use BTC like traditional fiat currency.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe provide FDIC-insured bank accounts for instantly converting in or out of crypto, as well as debit cards that allow people to deposit crypto and spend at 70 million merchants globally,‚Äù Kane said. ‚ÄúNo matter where you are, Unbanked‚Äôs global bank accounts provide a crypto-friendly banking experience that empowers you with full flexibility and control of your currency. We‚Äôll even aggregate buys of BTC across multiple platforms to ensure you‚Äôre getting the best rate available. You don‚Äôt have to do a thing except make the purchase. We‚Äôll handle the rest.‚Äù

Unbanked provides a number of FDIC-backed bank accounts, that can be used to quickly execute a number of cash-to-crypto or crypto-to-cash conversions, allowing people to easily take Unbanked debit cards to a wide range of local vendors, or use bitcoin to directly access the decentralized economic frontier. Kane added that ‚Äúthe products enable instant remittance and the transfer of value on blockchain rails in a compliant and regulated market,‚Äù which is a use case particularly attractive to a wide range of people worldwide.

Summing up Unbanked attitudes toward bitcoin, Kane stated that ‚Äúit's money you can't \*\*\*\* with.‚Äù

Blending traditional finance with cryptocurrency, Unbanked is able to significantly diversify the economic control that millions of users worldwide can exercise in their own daily lives. With the user range of the service only planning to expand",1635429641,1,1

qgi56v,Skypee08,Legit concerns over the threats to BTC of government confiscation and taxation of unrealised gains.,"
TLDR: with 95% of crypto today being sold through exchanges relaying KYC data to governments, the vulnerability of holders to government confiscation (as opposed to the ban of transactions I.e. China) and taxation on unrealised capital gains is making me very worried.

1. The case for confiscation risk:

95% of Bitcoin on-ramps today require KYC information ([Source](https://bitcoiner.guide/privacy/get/) and exchanges are now required to relay these info to national tax agencies (IRS, HMRC). Therefore, governments are essentially aware of who holds Bitcoin (along with their address and bank account), how much they own and the address in which it is kept (using the public ledger to track transactions).

This makes BTC no longer even pseudo-anonymous (since KYC ties addresses to real-life identities and is relayed to governments) and very seizable with legal pressure applied on the individual holding the private keys of said address. In this circumstance, the BTC holders would have no choice but surrender their BTC to the (clearly authoritarian at this point) government or risk legal repercussions. Unlike confiscation of gold in the US in 1933 (Executive Order 6102) the public blockchain makes it very clear who owns what and where. Even if the user declares having lost their keys, the funds would essentially be frozen forever as any subsequent movement of crypto from this address would prove the user lied and risk further criminal actions. 

This confiscation scenario is different from China‚Äôs ban on crypto which simply declared all crypto transactions illegal but users simply holding their crypto while moving jurisdiction can remain within the law and in control of their BTC.

If the government then sells the BTC the coins would be redistributed (with a temporary price crash) but the network survives. However, in the case that the US government actually understands BTC and decides to hoard it indefinitely, can it now not have a double-whammy of being able to print as much fiat as it want to consolidate global power while simultaneously pump its own BTC bags to infinity? Such manipulation of the BTC system would surely destroy the whole point of a ‚Äúself-sovereign‚Äù and ‚Äúoutside-of-government-control‚Äù currency. Any BTC would now be further dis-incentivised from cashing out to fiat and spending their BTC would only surrender their ‚Äúway out‚Äù

2. The case for unrealised capital gains tax risk:

A second threat from a majority of new crypto holders going through KYC exchanges is again the vulnerability of holders to a government (*eyeing you US government*) implementing annual capital gains tax on unrealised profits (I am assuming the current US proposal will eventually include a majority of BTC holders in the wealth threshold - gradually lowered as the government seeks more and more tax revenues - given that the central banks will continually inflate the BTC price by printing and devaluing fiat).

This scenario would force holders to sell their BTC to pay for the unrealised gains (plus additional capital gains tax on the now sold BTC??). Would that not make BTC unattractive for new holders? I.e. I buy 1 BTC for $1000 (for simplicity sake); the printing of fiat inflates that 1 BTC to $2000; I now owe 30% of the $1000 gain as tax (=$300); I now have to sell $300 of BTC (i.e. 0.15 BTC @$2000 spot price) to pay that tax (+ 30% of the $300 I just withdrew as realised capital gains tax? - unsure about this); i now am left with $1700 worth of BTC but only 0.85 BTC, which is more USD, but less BTC than I started with. In a world where USD is going to 0 and I want to put my life savings in BTC, this seems to me like a huge problem. 

PS: I just wished I bought my crypto from P2P from the start.... Bitcoin has definitely made me more libertarian and suspicious of government/central banks than ever lol.",1635287917,122,1

Using the Inter-Blockchain protocol it will be able to communicate with heterogeneous chains build on the same tender-mint infrastructure.

Using web3 crypto wallets such as metamask users will be able to connect to an interface of web applications built on the Altera network. A single node able to connect to an interface capable of hosting, creating and securing countless nodes side by side.

The linking will take place using a private/public key approach known from Secured Shell/SSH. When linked the decentralized applications will be able to create, host, and secure applications such as blockchains or other similar web applications. All At the cost of crypto valuta, with the use of only one wallet.

Functioning as a permissioned blockchain only a specific set of validators will be able to commit a block to the blockchain. The consensus thereby creates untraceable and unlinkable electronic transactions; transactions incapable of being traced on block explores and unlinkable to both virtual as physical identities.

This makes the Altera network able to truly create a metadata-free network environment. Most cloud providers use your metadata as their main income form, Altera will solve this problem with the use of a crypto-based solution.

Launch 8 november. See website for additional info.

**STEP 3 / QUESTION**: What is a good/safe and easy-to-use no bs client (desktop preferably) that I could use to access my funds and ***send*** that BTC to a different wallet. 

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

I would need cash flow to cover the debt service (so normally that would be easy out of direct income it‚Äôs only $3k or so).

This fund is being established by the founder/CEO of NZs largest crypto platform Easycrypto.

The founder was working for NZs second largest bank as their Corporate Strategy Manager when they registered Easycrypto with the NZ companies Office.

Nine months after establishing Easycrypto the Founder/CEO moved to work in an executive strategic role for NZs national airline AirNZ where a former PM of NZ and current chairman of the largest NZ bank (US majority shareholder owned) is a board member. The ex PM and chairman of NZs largest bank was very fond of the AirNZ CEO and nominated him to be the National parties Next leader and so subsequently the CEO Christopher Luxon was elected to parliament and is biding his time to take leadership of the now opposition National party. The National party is known for its close relationship with the US owned banks that dominate the NZ banking sector.

Anyway now this close associate of both of NZs largest banks not only operates the largest crypto platform but is also opening a investment vehicle designed to attract investors to Bitcoin by holding the custody of the Bitcoin in foreign funds.

This type of fund argues that many people don't want the trouble of holding their own Bitcoin and dealing with the tax complications and so they will hold the Bitcoin for you while charging an annual 2.5% fee. They hope to do a deal with the NZ government tax department allowing the fund members to be only taxed on an assumed and fixed rate of return of 5% instead of taxation on actual gains or losses...although the NZ IRD does not appear to have yet agreed to this deal.

This looks like the commodification of Bitcoin by bankers.

They offer the government a secure tax stream and themselves a secure income while the investors take all the risk but hold no real custody or control over the Bitcoin.

Such funds could be designed to move toward a scenario where Bitcoin can only be held by such institutional custodians and not held directly by citizens- this is of course a complete undermining and subversion of the entire Bitcoin ethos and values.

The bankers cartel are afraid of Bitcoin because its superior integrity is attracting more and more citizens to move their savings from fiat shitcoin to Bitcoin integrity.

Their corporate strategy managers are looking for all and every way they can capture and control and ultimately neuter Bitcoin.

I hope they fail as enough of us are aware of their intentions and will never surrender our coins and hopes of change to their corrupt rentseeking custody!",1633469508,5,15

qgx7pw,Guigamuck,Living under inflation or hyperinflation reality,"Greetings my Bitcoin friends. I don't know where most of you come from, so, please allow me to assume that most of you come from developed countries where inflation has not been a problem (at least for the last 50 years).  


Since March 2020 the world is facing the Covid-19 pandemic and one of the most evident symptoms or consequences of it is the disruption of supply and production chains all around the world, the acceleration of quantitative easing and for last but not least - INFLATION.  


Inflation is a direct consequence of the endless money printing frenzy from the governments, and, I have to tell you guys - living with it is hard!  


I was born and raised in Brazil. Back in the 1980s, we suffered from hyperinflation and sometimes we had [monthly inflation of ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Brazil)[over 80% in 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Brazil)!  


Believe me or not, I have serious problems with inflation and this is a childhood trauma I have. My parents have always been hard-working people and since I was born until the creation of the Brazilian Real (the current national currency) and the new economic plan that allegedly stabilized the economy (even though, since 1994 the [BRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_real) lost over 90% of its purchasing power due to, guess what, inflation! - and this year alone we lost 40% face value against the USD) I saw my parents lose our house, the cars and we literally became lower middle class because of inflation.  


Of course, I know many people around the world faced and still face much worse living conditions, however, the main point here is to warn you of all the dangers inflation and hyperinflation bring!  


Fortunately, we have Bitcoin and other cryptos to protect us from the government, from the depreciation of fiat currency, and to unshackle us from the monetary prison!

Problem is, my bank does not condone Bitcoin profits because they believe there's a link to terror financing, so moving my money would be pretty much a one-way road. 

I'm looking for a trustworthy platform that works well in Eastern Europe and has a good offering of different coins in case I want to swap. I've heard that some services (probably in USA) have their own debit cards to use at ATMs and shops after cashing out some crypto. 

I want my money as far away from traditional banks as possible but I will still need the possibility to pay in fiat and I won't have the option to transfer profits to my own bank. I would also go for as much anonymity as possible but I do understand that these days there's not much choice for that. 

I'd be grateful for any recommendations and your personal experience with exchanges, wallets, cards, services and any other things involved in moving your money away from banks in Europe. Thanks!",1635341483,8,1

Finally I got a good friend of mine into research for bitcoin and ether. He was or maybe still is a great sceptic about crypto. Now he said he bought ‚Äûthe bitcoin standard‚Äú, got the whitepaper and read about ethereum. 
We will meet Friday and he already announced that he wants to discuss bitcoin vs ethereum. 

My first point here is, that eventhough i am a bitcoin maximalist i would say that before you hold fiat it‚Äòs better to hold ethereum :)

Second point is, that i prefer bitcoin over ethereum, because:

- bitcoin is decentral and ethereum is not (regards to ethereum foundation)

- pre mine of eth foundation of 30%

- bitcoin is limited to 21 million. Ether is not. It tries to be limited with the new ‚Äûburnings‚Äú of ethereum. But with that comes a higher gas fee?

- bitcoin is better distributed than eth

- proof of stake vs proof of work. Proof of work makes it it more secure eventhough more energy is needed. The one who invests most work/energy/costs has power over the network. Proof of stake means lower energy cost. But therefor more centralized. Entities who hold the most have the most power over the network and are able to create the most new eth. Richest getting richer?

It would be nice if you could correct me or go deeper into my arguments. 

Thank you all!",1635331779,1,1

During the hackathon, you would supervise a group of scientists and creatives developing solutions to the global avian migratory crises through an art project with an actual visual outcome. The work will be minted on a blockchain as a collective creation, exhibited, and auctioned at a later project stage. Our campaign will gain worldwide visibility due to the sheer nature of the subject and by the generous support of leading institutions and organizations.

Birds that migrate through the African-Eurasian Flyway compose three main groups: Waterbirds, Landbirds, and Raptors. These birds face various threats throughout their migration, from habitat loss to illegal killing, most of them being anthropogenic such as pollution or collision course. Change of avian migratory behavior is one of the best-studied phenomena presumably associated with recent climate change, yet to what degree these behavioral changes represent responses to climate warming is still controversial.

NFT DEB Generative Dimensions invites scientists, engineers, and artists to the Hortob√°gy Natural Reserve, the most frequently visited Central-European site by migratory fowl species. We aim to provide original solutions to a large-scale climatic issue by studying the natural phenomena of avian migration.

qcddt4,networkninja10,JPMorgan Says Bitcoin‚Äôs Record Run Is Being Driven by Inflation,"‚ÄúBy itself, the launch of BITO is unlikely to trigger a new phase of significantly more fresh capital entering Bitcoin,‚Äù wrote strategists including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, referring to the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF. ‚ÄúInstead, we believe the perception of Bitcoin as a better inflation hedge than gold is the main reason for the current upswing, triggering a shift away from gold ETFs into Bitcoin funds since September.‚Äù

Growing concerns over inflation have renewed investors‚Äô interests in assets that can act as a hedge -- and that includes Bitcoin. Gold has failed, in recent weeks, to respond to heightened concerns over rising cost pressures, and the shift away from gold ETFs into Bitcoin funds has gathered pace. ‚ÄúThis flow shift remains intact supporting a bullish outlook for Bitcoin into year-end,‚Äù the strategists said.

Take, for instance, the $56 billion SPDR Gold Shares ETF, ticker GLD, which is on pace to see its fourth straight month of outflows that so far total more than $3.6 billion over that span, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin investors already have a ‚Äúmultitude of investment choices,‚Äù JPMorgan said. The bank‚Äôs strategists point to the launch of the Purpose Bitcoin ETF (ticker BTCC) in Canada, which saw a warm reception at first that then slowly waned. ‚ÄúThe initial hype with BITO could fade after a week,‚Äù they said.",1634770816,0,1

BTC is the fastest asset to grow to a trillion dollars, and it's now set a record for fastest ETF to reach 1 billion. **Bitcoin and crypto are growing faster than THE FREAKING INTERNET.** Like, you must be blind to not see that BTC has been bullish for a loooong time. 

But the bears keep saying: ""Ooooh it's gonna crash!"" Well, that would be cool, as that's a good buying opportunity. Bulls are just more often right than bears with BTC and in the stock market, so it's usually better to be a perma bull than a perma bear. If you miss the top this cycle, you can just average down and become rich next cycle.

I wish I was bullish on BTC earlier than this year, but better late than never.

""Empty your mind.  
Be formless, shapeless, like Bitcoin.

There is a problem. A real problem. Not a ""this will go away problem"". This problem is massive rising wealth inequality and devaluation of currency. I am seeing it everywhere, and now people are starting to notice it. My friends making $120k can't afford a house. In the next 5 years we are going to have a MASSIVE amount of old people that are homeless or the debt explodes higher. Many people have zero retirement.

We are at the first stage of a generation between 18-40 REJECTING the current system. It is becoming clear that are leaders are not clowns, but instead very smart and massively corrupt. Fed members day trading and Nancy Pelosi being a super investor is showing people how corrupt America is. The things we thought happen in 3rd world countries are happening here. They are happening now. I went to school and got a bachelors degree in economics and barely learned how things work.

I am also seeing a lot of pride and EGO from people I know about bitcoin and it's price going up. I can only control what I can do, but to me I am starting to get scared. Bitcoin rising might be signaling that a lot of people are starting to wake up. They are starting to realize something is wrong. If enough people wake up, that's both great, but it leads to scary stuff.

When bitcoin went to 60 last time, I went to go check out an r8. Now I'm thinking I need a lot more bitcoin and a lot less of a car (didn't buy).

Please, for the love of all that is holy, if you care about someone, don't tell them first about bitcoin. Walk them through the current system and debasement of currency. Walk them through this: if you stay at your current job, what does life look like in 3, 5, 10, 20 years? Generally, the answer is ""worse then currently"". The system is designed to extract from them, not give to them.

If you get through to 1 out of 10 people, great.

qcb8tq,MortAlbum321,Theory questions from someone not into Bitcoin whom thinks too much,"I'm someone not into Bitcoin, not into crypto-currency and all that stuff, because I've been too busy to get into it. For all I know it's either the second coming of Capitalism (and I have no idea if that's good or bad, but I won't get into that for now) or a flash-in-the-pan fad. But I'm also someone whom thinks WAY too much, and I came up with some questions that I'm sure people can answer. Perhaps these are basic, perhaps they are good debate options, perhaps this post will be absolutely destroyed for being horrible, I have ZERO idea what's accepted or not. 

So the questions (the numbers are the general topic, each topic has LOTS of speculative questions): 

1.) How would a Crypto-economy handle basic emergency services usually provided by governments? 

Let's say the world economy gets completely decentralized by Bitcoin. How do cities (or even ordinary citizens) pay for police officers? The cities would have to trade in Bitcoin to even have the ability to pay the firefighters and road maintenance workers and park rangers, wouldn't that defeat the purpose of cryptocurrency to take power away from governments? Or would it result in a complete evolution of the local political landscape, where those whom CAN pay for those services survive the resultant anarchy after a destabilization period?

Or, is all that happens is USD and fiat currencies get replaced by Bitcoin, and effectively nothing changes, with governments still having the power over said emergency services, regardless if they have control over the currency to pay for said services? After all, what's preventing the US Treasury from buying up lots of Bitcoin, or even creating their own mining operations, and creating a Sovereign Bitcoin Wallet, the access of which is hidden under thousands of layers of encryption even though the transaction history would be public knowledge? Would the transaction history being public knowledge even matter? Perhaps for Public Relations, but with time any PR problems do pass away. 

Are there complications with such a scenario that I am completely missing? 

2.) If the CURRENT governments would ""get rekd"" by a crypto-economy (that's an ""if"" as far as I know) and completely dissolve due to the ""might"" of Bitcoin, would the blockchain be strong enough to allow people to work together to solve problems governments handled up to that point? 

I guess I am wondering if Bitcoin would survive a global destabilization as a result of its decentralizing of the global economy. After all, if the government that maintains the power lines were to disappear overnight, how does the power grid stay alive long enough for Bitcoin traders to buy the rights to the power infrastructure and hire the workers to keep the network alive? If the goal is complete decentralization, that means no central power whatsoever, which means theoretically no guarantees beyond the guarantees you can buy with your Bitcoin wallet, if you're even in an area that can ACCESS your bitcoin wallet. 

Does that mean that true decentralization can only occur over a process, in cooperation with the governments, to ensure the handing over of the power infrastructure to the Bourgeoise of Bitcoin, whom would have the wealth to facilitate such a transfer? What kind of decisions would they make regarding those whom cannot even pay for guaranteed access to the blockchain? We have seen what happens with Internet Service Providers having way too much power over their customers, what's to stop the same thing with access to the blockchain? If all a Bitcoin holder in charge of a power plant needs to do to ""censor"" somebody is to cut off power to their home, doesn't that defeat the point of Bitcoin in the first place? Whomever owns the hardware, controls whether or not the software works as intended. 

And if physical devices that run on minimal electrical power and provide Bitcoin transactions IRL become popular to counteract this problem (probably through an NFC token), whom builds the physical devices? What's to stop the Bitcoin rich from buying out those manufacturers? 

Make of my rambling questions however you will. As you can see I am skeptical, but am open to seeing where Bitcoin goes. If Bitcoin does succeed and the people figure out how to solve these challenges, I would be a LOT less skeptical. 

Perhaps the issue with crypto-currency isn't the theory behind it; it's the execution of that theory that is the problem. Perhaps there are issues with the execution that I have not yet seen people knowledgeable about crypto-currencies answer. 

Then again, I think too much. I hope this is at least a mildly entertaining read of where the blockchain could go, if it solves these issues. 

Maybe. If these are even the issues it NEEDS to solve. What if there are things I personally never thought of that are even MORE cause for concern for the future of crypto? 

By all means, link and post whatever you wish that you think answers these questions, if you even want to engage in these questions.  Thanks if you do make it all the way through the post!",1634764723,29,1

qcaral,nDizzle89,THIS is the hard part,"This is more aimed at the newer bitcoiners, but a good reminder to all of us:


THIS is the hardest part of hodling.


Yes, its difficult when prices are low and stagnate. No matter your belief, there's always that little voice questioning if you are mistaken. There's all the media talking bad of bitcoin's outlook. There's all those people in your life telling you how unwise the investment is, how unrealistic your views on the future are, and throwing out convenient numbers to ""prove"" XYZ stock/metal is a better investment.


That's nothing compared to now. All those same people now telling you to take the massive Return On Investment. Loved ones imploring you to be smart and get out while the gettin is good. The ""factual"" reasoning they used before are now replaced with emotional appeals. All of a sudden media and people are experts about bitcoin cycles. They tell you it will crash... And they are right in a way since it *eventually* it will dip after reaching some new peak before the next cycle.


For most, the profit would help their lives significantly. Pay down/off a house mortgage, getting a new car, paying off/down debts, etc. For others the current profit is life changing money.


We all know it WILL peak and ""crash"" to a low that's still higher than previous cycle's ATH. That knowledge spawns the brilliant plan to sell then buy lower to increase stacks.


Timing the market is a game of Russian Roullete, tho. You might get lucky a few times, but eventually you lose, and you lose big.


Now is the time to remember why you bought bitcoin in the first place. Be 100% brutally honest with yourself. Ponder the future if it now. Compare that to what you believed when first buying. If there is a difference, find the reason for your change in views. 


Figure out which type of person you are. Which would you regret more:  
not taking profit if it permanently nosedives  
or  
cashing out now at a much lower price and it continues skyrocketing in the next few months/next cycle.


Be realistic on thinking if you do cash out and it continues upward, are you going to buy back in (at the much higher price). 


Everyone daydreams and has these thoughts. Especially considering we're on the second leg of this cycle.. Just like all the previous ones.


Just so you know, it doesn't get easier. Each cycle is more money and the temptation becomes greater. Each cycle brings more voices weighing in on your investment.


Just be honest with yourself. There's nothing wrong with taking a profit to improve your life. Just be completely sure if you decide to cash out (now or in the future) it's because of what YOU want and YOU believe.",1634763374,118,1

At that time, Gensler said he looks forward to regulators reviewing ETFs that are particularly associated with bitcoin futures, he mentioned the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 as possibly being sufficient enough for regulation.

Gary Gensler also spoke about the approval of the Proshares bitcoin ETF during an interview with CNBC Tuesday and he said: ‚ÄúBitcoin futures have been overseen by our sibling agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \[CFTC\], which I was once honored and proud to serve there and that‚Äôs been four years.‚Äù

The Proshares and Vaneck bitcoin futures ETF approvals mark a milestone for bitcoin-related exchange-traded funds in the United States. For the first time, U.S. investors can participate in an ETF that has some ties to the leading crypto asset bitcoin (BTC).

The U.S., however, is not the first North American ETFs to be approved as Canada has approved a few bitcoin-related ETFs during the last 12 months. While October 23 is a Saturday, the community expects the Vaneck bitcoin futures ETF to list the following Monday on October 25.

Basically futures contracts are contracts to buy an asset at a certain price sometime in the future regardless of what the price is at that time. They seem similar to options, but unlike options you don't have the option to exercise or not, you have to buy when the expiration date is reached. However the contracts can be sold, or in the case of these futures ETFs rolled over onto new contacts with a later date.

Now I don't exactly understand the process where the contracts are rolled over. Are they sold and new ones bought, or do they simply exchange them? Either way if the price of BTC is outperforming what the futures contracts are predicting then these contracts should be worth a premium when they are sold or rolled over right?

If that premium is worth more than the cost of management fees and fees for rolling contracts, wouldn't the ETF outperform?",1634761171,7,1

1. Measure its value against the dollar (If that's a ""shitcoin"")
2. Why would you sell it, and turn it into fiat instead of keeping it?

Personally I don't even care about the price against the dollar/euro anymore, it's just Bitcoin against the value of Bitcoin, so 1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin. Just trying to accumalate as much as possible, because I don't want my money in banks etc.

I don't see it as: The value of Bitcoin is going up or down, it's just because you compare it to dollars, euros etc. 

Yes, almost my entire bank account is in Bitcoin and I will continue to do so, apart from my expenses, as most businesses don't accept Bitcoin. But I just try to get as much as possible, regardless of the value against the dollar, euro, venezuela currency and whatever.

qfypc1,SiameseScream,Buying feels hopeless,"Let‚Äôs get a few things out up front: I‚Äôm 19, just started working 4 months ago and just started buying crypto‚Ä¶ Sunday. October 24, 2021. I have no car and am currently saving up for one. 

My issue is this: Bitcoin is at an all time high, and I‚Äôm saving for a car right now. I have less than 1k to myself and I don‚Äôt think I have it in me to spend like‚Ä¶ ALL my money into Bitcoin seeing as that I need to save for a car and keep that money in the bank. 

Now I know what you will probably say: money is probably more safe invested in crypto than it is in the bank, and that may be true, but it is frightening to put, let‚Äôs say, $500 into crypto, and immediately see the price drop from $500 to say‚Ä¶ 498.97. On the other hand, I know that no one has ever lost money investing in Bitcoin and if I kept my money in Bitcoin from now until who knows when, my money could double, who knows. 

So what is.. $17 in Bitcoin. But even putting $500 in just seems kind of hopeless when a single Bitcoin is about 65k and I make about 8.50 an hour and can‚Äôt invest thousands of dollars like some people I see on here. When calculating $500 with a projection of 100,000 by the end of the year or even end of next year, it‚Äôs only about a $290 profit. Which is $290 free dollars I didn‚Äôt have to work for, but it‚Äôs still discouraging seeing people who bought hundreds of shares at $4 and now have paid off their house, I would have to wait forever for a profit like that. Am I overthinking this?

qfve9i,RadTadTad,Does Bitcoin Have Intrinsic Value?,"Let's first be clear what we mean by **intrinsic value**. 

Value is derived from [utility + scarcity](https://www.bitcoinisdead.org/well-actually/it-has-no-intrinsic-value-its-not-backed-by-anything).

The term ""intrinsic value"" is often used in finance to mean *""as nearly as possible, the underlying value of a company and its cash flow.""* ([Source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp)). In broader terms, intrinsic value is *""a property of anything that is valuable on its own. Intrinsic value is in contrast to instrumental value (also known as extrinsic value), which is a property of anything that derives its value from a relation to another intrinsically valuable thing. Intrinsic value is always something that an object has ""in itself"" or ""for its own sake"", and is an intrinsic property. An object with intrinsic value may be regarded as an end, or in Kantian terminology, as an end-in-itself.""* ([Source1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_\(ethics\)), [Source2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-intrinsic-extrinsic/)). 

An argument can be made that the only truly intrinsically valuable thing is happiness and the closest anything else can come to this is to be an instrument to achieving happiness. In order to have a productive conversation beyond definitional philosophy, however, let's assume that things can have intrinsic value if they are useful in and of themselves. Let's explore what this tends to mean in terms of currencies.

**How does a currency acquire intrinsic value?**

Example 1: [ArmyCoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years)

- A government is most accurately defined as an institution or entity that possesses a monopoly (or near-monopoly) on violence in a given locale. In this sense, an army is arguably a government, and viewing it as such can be helpful, at least as a thought experiment.

- Imagine that an army comes to dominate some amount of land. The land contains people, resources, communities, etc. The army needs logistical support to survive and operate, which is most frequently provided by a civilian population. Instead of going door-to-door and extorting each village and household for goods, materials, and conscripts, the army can instead enlist the populace as a whole through a much more efficient mechanism: currency.

- The army simply announces to its occupied subjects that in one year from now, every adult will be responsible for making a payment to the army coffers in the amount of one ArmyCoin. Any person who fails to provide the necessary payment will face grave consequences which they are powerless to prevent unless the army‚Äôs monopoly on violence is disrupted.
- The army then offers payments in the new currency, ArmyCoin, in exchange for supplies, tools, and labor that it finds useful to its war effort. Those who have been paid in ArmyCoin are then able to pay subcontractors a portion of their ArmyCoin wages, or pay for their food, medicine, etc. The person who supplied the army directly with useful production is then able to be supported by another layer of producers who need to acquire their own portion of ArmyCoin.

- By operation of this mechanism, the entire subject population has been put into the service of the army‚Äôs support operation, all while maintaining a market mechanism where people are free to try and provide their own type of value, express their preferences (up to a point), and reach equilibrium prices in assessing the value of any given productive capacity. ArmyCoin has become valuable by operation of the demand created by the specter of violence by the occupying army.


Example 2: Taxation

- A nearly identical arrangement is made when governments demand payment in fiat currency for taxes that are owed to the government. The government typically has the sole ability to issue the fiat currency, but by mandating that each citizen provide some amount of that fiat back to the government, it ensures that those people can be bent to the productive ends of the state, though perhaps through less direct means than in the previous example.

- The demand for payments of tax obligations in fiat currency is itself an inherent value of the currency. It is the only ‚Äòtoken‚Äô that is accepted by the government in exchange for them not exercising violence against you. This creates an inherent demand for the fiat token as long as the government retains control. Escaping violence and imprisonment is arguably an intrinsic good that gives the currency intrinsic value. Not a very cheery characterization of value, but certainly value nonetheless.

**Intrinsic value in crypto**

One of the common accusations leveled against crypto currencies and assets is that their value is speculative and not backed by anything ‚Äì that they have no intrinsic value.

- In many ways, currencies in any form are a social construct that could theoretically evaporate if or all (or even many) of the participants decided that a currency no longer possessed value. The above examples offer ways in which certain intrinsic demands help the perceived value to stick and for this possibility to not be realized ‚Äì why would people suddenly believe they no longer wanted ArmyCoin in the absence of some failure by the army to remain a credible threat, for instance ‚Äì but the possibility is there. Currency is ultimately a social construct, a [Hararian inter-subjective phenomenon](https://medium.com/@andresnavia/inter-subjective-imagined-orders-156f8d6d49ed).

- However, crypto assets do (or should) offer their own inherent value that help to provide similar stickiness. A coin or asset issued on a blockchain almost always (or at least should for the asset to make sense) represents the right to utilize space on that blockchain. Because computing power and storage space have become so cheap, those resources on a blockchain must offer something above and beyond their off-chain equivalents. So, what is different that justifies their expense?

- A blockchain is fundamentally a type of security assurance. The cost in purchasing the right to space on the blockchain is essentially the purchase of the security assurances that the blockchain provides. For blockchains with poor security assurances, this premium should be quite low. The security of a blockchain is arguably  a combination of its hashrate and the distribution of that hashrate (at least on PoW), the number of full nodes, the robustness of the cryptography itself, the competence of technical contributors, distribution of governance rights, and arguably closely related to the last point, the size and culture of users in the ecosystem. 

- For bitcoin, the assurances resulting from its security characteristics could be summarized as: perfect scarcity, irreversible transactions, seizure and censorship resistance, and a culture that prioritizes antifragility by way of layered architecture and technical conservatism. These factors combine to provide tremendous confidence that access to the bitcoin protocol in the form of holding BTC is going to continue to provide utility ‚Äì the utility of having access and the ability to leverage the security elements of bitcoin for whatever use case one may have in mind. This is a form of intrinsic value. Of course, there will always be speculation as to the exact dollar value of that utility, amplified by the fact that we are in unprecedented territory and currently undergoing violent price discovery. But speculation occurs around plenty of assets that do unarguably have inherent value (pork bellies, houses, etc.) The presence of speculation does not alone indicate an absence of inherent value.

- El Salvador's recent legal tender law now also gives it inherent value for the coercive reasons discussed in the above sections pertaining to government mandates. There is plenty of room for thoughtful debate as to whether this type of coercion is in-line with bitcoin‚Äôs freedom and voluntaristic principles, but there is at least one key difference: even when the coercive powers of the state are leveraged to mandate bitcoin use, the state is categorically unable to to exercise any type of [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage) over the currency, which is typically a hallmark of the state employing a currency for its own ends.",1635211414,10,1

I (as a user) want to buy bitcoin. I have fiat $5000 to spend in bitcoin. I transfer my fiat to the company (for example coinbase, crypto.com, binance) swap to be BTC later on.

First time posting on /r/Bitcoin and on reddit in general so it's a big step for me üòÖ   
I've been on the bitcoin wagon since 2017. I have never made any big purchases, just every now and then when I had some money I could spend. But couple of months ago I bought *The Bitcoin Standard* after *Saifedean Ammous* and while reading it and finishing it recently I've been doing a lot of thinking and reflecting.

So the thing that hit me the most is inflation bubble we live in. How there is actually no real value behind our current money standard and since we wen't of the gold standard between the WWI and 1971 we've been forced to spend more ""thanks"" to Keynes and his theories on how an economy should be built and run.

Anyway I've been wanting to move away from debt for a couple of years and never as much as now. Therefore I'm in the process of selling my house, cashing out some money to buy some coins as well as getting rid of my huge debt. It's a slow process and I'm a bit impatient while watching the price pr. coin going up. Kind of hoping for a small dip soon lol.

I just wanted to share this, don't know why but have a great day and embrace your self for the future üöÄ",1635157285,89,1

It might be anecdotal, but something just feels 'off' to me about this website. About a year or so after examining the website I felt compelled to google ""is crypto.com legit"" and found a reddit article suggesting it was. I was interested in seeing how their credit card worked, so I signed up. I then got another weird feeling when I noticed they require all these proprietary tokens to use their services. I deleted the app and didn't think much of it since.  
&amp;nbsp;

In this article you can see a great example for the selfie, please take a look at it: *link redacted*

**M:** Delete my account immediately. I have never used your service so there is no security to be concerned with- there are no tokens or assets under my account, and no reason to hesitate on the deletion except where you refuse to remove my personal information from your databases.  
&amp;nbsp;

Needless to say, they won't comply. Maybe some of you don't mind having your information held hostage by a shitty company- but I do.

q7ypoi,Harkonnen_Baron,Bitcoin - new Gold,"I found this article interesting [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bitcoin-may-very-well-become-the-new-gold-1030865899](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bitcoin-may-very-well-become-the-new-gold-1030865899)

and though of some translation for crypto enthusiast with good heart but lack of knowledge about market reality. 

Gold is becoming Tier 1 asset due to Basel III regulations, that means banks will no longer be allowed to finance their liabilities with paper assets, these will have to be now &gt;85% physical. This is causing massive buying of gold by all central banks at hugely discounted price comparing to M1 money supply. 

The price suppression is achieved by combining the real physical gold with paper derivatives in 1:100+ ration used in short selling at artificially low prices. This process is something that may come to BTC with creation of new ETF and futures market: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q4k2bl/jpmorgan\_and\_soros\_are\_now\_into\_btc\_beware/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q4k2bl/jpmorgan_and_soros_are_now_into_btc_beware/)

US and EU are already compliant with Basel III and the last bastion of global price manipulation in London due for compliance in Jan 22. It is obvious there is not enough physical gold to sustain trading volume required for ongoing suppression and if after January Barclays, HSBC, Standard Charted, JPM are not compliant, will be penalized by regulator.  

Gold business is fading away so what comes next for speculative capital? This feels like possibility for BTC to replace Gold or precisely paper BTC could replace paper Gold.

Forget about all characteristics of crypto or fact its digital, hassle free. Derivative is derivative it has no encryption key or hash and if paper volume becomes dominant, complete price control becomes reality.

Remember than bullion banks , which are custodian of smaller funds (citadel etc) are all together working for FED and other central banks, ensuring their flagship product (fiat currency) maintains purchasing power. Price of BTC will be set to suit central banks agenda.

Btw. When the time comes gold and silver (even more suppressed) will be re-valued to cement demise of fiat currencies.

qj3mxs,VisionGuard,"Bitcoin as an ""inflation hedge"" vs Bitcoin as a ""safe haven asset""","**Prior TL;DR:  Bitcoin is now like Gold in the sense that it is showing signs of being BOTH an ""inflation hedge"" and a ""safe haven asset"", and did the latter around the turn of the year, shown via correlations with DXY.**

I want to gore a certain sacred cow that most people think about with Bitcoin, and also point out something weird and unique about what's going on right now.¬† Feel free to disagree, but do so openly so I can see why.  Set the stage:

1.)¬† When inflation occurs, it's because we print more dollars.¬† This generally means that the dollar versus other currencies (DXY is the dollar index versus a basket of currencies) drops in value.¬†

2.)¬† If Bitcoin is an ""inflation hedge"", then people should flee towards it  (i.e. BTC/USD should go up) when the dollar is dropping in value.

3.)¬† Historically since 1945, the dollar itself is used as a safe-haven asset when downturns are about to happen, because it's the world reserve currency.¬† To wit - you sell some of your stocks when you think the economy will slow and they'll go down, and thus you're ""buying"" dollars.  Thus in these cases you often will see DXY go up.  See [here](https://www.daytrading.com/us-dollar-recession) for a demonstration.

4.)¬† Gold is often considered the OG ""safe-haven"" asset (sometimes run into during downturns) AND ""inflationary hedge"" (sometimes run into when money is debased).¬† Though not always true, a somewhat reliable time when people don't buy gold is when they think the economy will boom.

5.)¬† Bitcoin is often slandered as NOT being like Gold because it nominally acts as an inflation hedge, but is ""too volatile"" to be a ""safe-haven asset"" particularly during economic downturns.¬†¬†So they say.

6.)¬† Thus, Bitcoin must show spells where it works inverse to the dollar tanking (thus is an inflation hedge) but \*also\* show spells where it works \*in tandem\* with the dollar rising *when growth is slowing and people are fleeing to the dollar*.

Chart 1:¬† Bitcoin (bars) from 2017 to 2020 end shows an ""inflation hedge"" type response to the DXY (orange line).   You can see how every time the DXY drops, we *tended* get a run up in Bitcoin and every time¬†the DXY moved up, we *tended over time* to drop in BTC/USD value. 

Chart 2:¬† BTC vs DXY 2021 YTD:¬† It almost looks exactly correlated.¬† 2021 people started viewing Bitcoin as a ""safe haven asset"" as well as expectations of global GDP growth are slowing throughout this time period.¬† As an aside, final week of Dec 2020, I watched a panel in which a bunch of economists talked about the value of DXY - every single one (literally) said it would go lower through 2021, and the survey of like 100 more ""experts"" agreed in like a 95% manner.¬† DXY is obviously up at the final 200 meters of a mile run.¬† Keep that in mind the next time these experts say anything about inflation or Bitcoin or whatever. 

Chart 3:¬† BTC vs DXY overall 2017-2021:¬† Can really see the 180 at the turn of the new year.¬† Bitcoin is basically the new Gold, IMO, and this is showing it.¬† It's changed in stature.¬†

He is very influential in politics and journalism and has a strong following. We were discussing Bitcoin and he was interested but my lack of knowledge wasn‚Äôt enough. 

Can someone link a video or paper that makes a impact on what Bitcoin is and what it can do for the masses. I will forward this on and hopefully it will help spread the word.

Not interested in how it will make people rich only how it will change things for the better. I don‚Äôt think the white paper will be the best right now. That can follow once he is interested.",1635599081,11,1

qj01mi,JoyBangla1,How to guesstimate the cycle top and bottom of #bitcoin?,"Contrary to popular beliefs, a pattern has worked for 10+ years to approximately guesstimate the macro top and bottom.

Follow the following steps to approximately guesstimate the cycle top and bottom for $BTCUSD:

1. Open INDEX:BTCUSD on Trading View
2. Change the layout to be on the log scale
3. Draw fib from first macro top to first macro bottom. Ensure the fib is on a log scale as well.
4. Note the levels at 161.8% and 233%. 161.8% is the next macro bottom. 233% is the next macro top  


**Please see the charts below for proof:**

q5bb7e,Iakobab,a question for Bitcoin maximalists who consider themselves libertarian,"Hey, this is in good faith. I'm invested in Bitcoin, I DCA weekly and I wish the project all the best for two reasons: I dig the decentralisation of currency, and I'll make a bit of money if the price continues to rise.

As I mentioned, I'm attracted to BTC as a project because I like the idea of decentralising our currency. Full exposure: I'm not a big fan of our current form of free market capitalism and I believe there are better alternatives. Although I don't think Bitcoin adoption will correct the major problems of capitalism, I do like the idea of people claiming sovereignty over their own savings and taking power away from the traditional financial institutions/entities. 

As I understand it (correct me if I'm wrong), Bitcoin Maximalism is the term ascribed to the belief that one day Bitcoin will come to replace fiat currency and become either the dominant or the sole global currency. Many Bitcoin Maximalists reference their Libertarian principles as a moral foundation for their belief i.e. Universal Bitcoin adoption will be better because people will have a greater potential to freedom. 

What I can't get my head around is the following: how do you marry this supposed Libertarianism with the fact that all transactions are written into the ledger and thus accessible by everyone always? In a world where BTC dominates, won't this ledger make illegal transactions impossible? Don't we need to protect the means of illegal transaction, in case a future dictatorship outlaws something which we now collectively value?  

Perhaps it's better if I make a clear thought experiment to enable you to explain this to me. Imagine if, say, Coca Cola took over the world. Our new global corporate leader then outlawed the drinking of any fluids other than Coke. You get thrown in jail for purchasing drinking water with the intent to consume it, and possession of drinking water with the intent to supply others is punishable by death. Wouldn't Bitcoin's ledger make it incredibly difficult/dangerous to buy drinking water without being incarcerated or murdered? 

Obviously this example is absurd. But, imagining that it is existant, please explain to me why Bitcoin wouldn't reinforce the dictatorship.",1633883155,43,1

q5am5m,Diligent_Buyer9440,BITCOIN VISION ‚ú®üååüå†,"(((((((((((((((((((((((READ THE DISCLAIMER:
This post is not to criticise BITCOIN.
This post is only based on studies and analyses I read.
Is intended to make the community stronger about this topic and help others, that see or hear that the creator/creators accumulated 1M BTC in his/their wallets (to help protect the network from 51% attack in the early stage of Bitcoin genesis) but views these wallets as a potential thread.
I personally think about the risk that this technology it was something that represents a natural evolution of internet and of how humanity thinks about money as a token for energy, and that was inevitable at this stage of civilisation that some intelligent person/group could invent, so (ipotetically) some gov. like China could have (ipotetically) anticipated, and studied (also with the help of AI and statistics) this natural evolution of internet and made this invention trying to control this innovation rather than make it spread freely.
I will try to make a fair point in my opinios.
I would like to trascend the idea that bitcoin is godlike techonology to go rather thinking that bitcoin is the community and should never stop to update itself and trascend mere electronic technologies and change the world in a better one. You are Bitcoin, we are Bitcoin in a sense, as humanity.
THIS IS NOT COMPLOTTISM.
THIS IS NOT TO SPREAD FUD.
THIS IS NOT TO CRITICISE OR HATE.
THIS IS NOT TO SPREAD DISINFORMATION.
BITCOIN IS FREEDOM.
BITCOIN IS POWER IN INDIVIDUALS.
BITCOIN IS THE BEST TECHNOLOGY IN HUMAN HISTORY.
If you have studies that points in a different way and states for sure that the founders or any one else(or association, group, nation ) never accumulated 1M BTC in the early Genesis of BITCOIN please be kind and post these evidences. ))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

Why ‚ÄúSatoshi Nakamoto‚Äù did not destroy his milion BTC ? Is there a reason linked to the common knowledge that he dispersed those on a lot of wallets because he didn‚Äôt want somebody taking those still while he/they was linking all computers used to preventivo 51% attack during the genesis of Bitcoin ?
He/they could not mine to fake wallets and destroy these store?
What if that was China to create a sort of ‚ÄúTrojan Horse‚Äù for democracy and they‚Äôre waiting the world finally adopts bitcoin, and put that milion on exchanges with the intent to destroys financial system of our countries and rule the world becoming the most powerful nation on Earth ? 

HINT NUMBER ONE- They have been ahead in every technology through human history, and if they knew statistically that something like bitcoin was coming, so they created it before, having sort of auto-destruction button to push, the exact day they want to do that ?
I think there should be an update in Bitcoin to eliminate this ‚ÄúSatoshi‚Äôs 1M‚Äù risk
Maybe a fork/ soft fork like TAPROOT, that will help adding this feature, just to eliminate the last risk now on crypto world.
Or a secondary layer feature that helps solve this problem. ?!?!

I would like you to think THIS COULD BE THE ONLY RISK NOW ON BITCOIN, apart from this, bitcoin is going to spread all over the world in the next months.

HINT NUMBER 2 CHINA also bought many tons of gold in their reserve these last months, meaning that they think/know that bitcoin will not substitute gold as digital gold? The answer could be in this post.
They really like to destroy BTC if they can and if we (the community) don‚Äôt take this risks or others as serious as possible. So be patient is you think differents idea and leave a kind comment.

HINT NUMBER 3- BITCOIN could be the only thing in the universe that could really eliminate TOTALITARIAN GOVERNMENTS and DICTATORSHIP-LIKE GOVERNMENTS.
THEY ARE/WAS REALLY SCARED BY THIS KIND OF INVENTIONS, LIKE CRYPTOS IN GENERAL. So this post is also to think about this way in the future, knowing this ecosystem has a well known enemy/enemies.
Also USA AND EUROPE AND OTHER ASSOCIATION are really corrupted sometimes and the opinions said in this post could also apply for this kind of entities as well.

Bitcoin is besides this supposition the most powerful technology invented so far in human history and will finally boost with others technology the 2nd industrial revolution and surely create a better world, and bring peace and joy to many many lives in the world, will also help us to reach space exploration in less times, creating big wealth, possibilities, making dreams come true, and happier times to those that believed in it and reach a level of deeper comprehension of it, and of how money should work.
Will make the rich and wealthy people wealthier, and give people with low income areas a possibility to reach wealth as well.
And all this is purely wonderful, transcending technology on a level unimaginable by others invention made so far üöÄ",1633881017,43,1

On December 4, 1921, The New York Tribune published a story detailing a plan by inventor Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company, to replace the existing gold-backed currency system into one based on an ‚Äúenergy currency.‚Äù 

Ford goes on to say ‚ÄúUnder the energy currency system the standard would be a certain amount of energy exerted for one hour that would be equal to USD 1. It‚Äôs simply a case of thinking and calculating in terms different from those laid down to us by the international banking group to which we have grown so accustomed that we think there is no other desirable standard.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe essential evil of gold in its relation to war is the fact that it can be controlled. Break the control and you stop war.‚Äù

I tried to reason him by many rational thoughts and all, but he's still like ""*I have to get back the money i lost learning how it works""*.

The first stated that the content, an interview on bitcoin, was harmful and dangerous (lol). They then stated that we would receive a strike, but then I received a second email saying the channel was being deleted seconds later.

q61ghl,_FreeThinker,Can I heat my home with mining rigs in the basement?,"So, I'm thinking of heating my house which is in Canada by having bunch of mining rigs in the basement (let's say about whatever about $100k can buy).

When I was thinking more about this, I started to discover the complexities here.

* The house (upstairs) will have gas/electric heating available; I'm not thinking of heating it solely with the mining rigs (but only as a supplement, I'm basically trying to not lose heat that I have already generated).
* I would have rigs connected in data-center style to a frame
* Ideally I want to have some outside air-flow through these rigs because the cooler the better for them right?
* Then, somehow I would have to channel the heat-produced to the interior of the home upstairs (since I don't want to lose this heat to the outside ambience).

Is this possible, or am i just crazy? I'm thinking that through some thought-through design and architecture I can make this work. I'm here to see if anyone here has some insights, experience, or resources they can point me to. Thank you guys!",1633974625,22,1

Long story short, she apparently put like $7k in an IRA 20 years ago. She told me yesterday that she made less than a dollar on that IRA last year. I asked how that was possible, and it turns out that for the entire 20 years, the IRA is just sitting there in cash. Anyway she's been hearing me talk about Bitcoin here and there for the past 7-8 years, and she finally brought it up out of the blue. She said she bought a bit on Venmo, and she now wants to cash out her stupid IRA and buy Bitcoin. She is old enough that there won't be any penalties, and it's a Roth, so no taxes (not that she has any capital gains either way). So it seems like a good idea, but at the same time I don't want to be responsible for her money. I want her to know what this is all about and be completely on board. At that point I'm happy to share my knowledge. 

So... I'm looking for the best short video or article to share with her. She isn't super interested in the details (eg, I used the word Blockchain with her and then I stopped and asked if that term meant anything to her and she said no). I don't want to get caught up in the weeds (""should we start with the Byzantine Generals problem, or would you prefer Schnorr signatures?""), but at the same time she needs a basic understanding.

I feel kinda guilty, because I told him that he should use x wallet to store his coins ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

His BTC address is `bc1q839pkll7ka4dkgeaznml8c8ntj2sxt78nkajgj`, which I checked on Blockchain and Blockchair, and there are 3 transactions to the wallet `165HaLWWiVQiSaN6fKxAStvuyVrFuzrXUN`, with a total of **0.00867056 BTC** (already emptied from that wallet).

How this happened? He emailed himself both his 12-word phrase and his wallet password (this last to GMail and Hotmail), so anyone with access to his PC could have free access to that information. No need of 2FA, since the wallet only needs the password to confirm a transfer or the phrase to recover it from another device.

He also told me that his Facebook warned him about an unknown access attempt. I told him to log out of all devices, change his passwords and don't spread sensitive information via email.

I know the only person to blame is him. That way of storing passwords was super reckless. I don't want to give him false expectations. For me, that money is gone. But, I read some posts that people have recovered their coins somehow?

Anyway, please keep your passwords safe.

I am in a couple of Telegrams groups and made a comment in one of them venting my frustration. Soon after, a gent private message me saying that he needed medical treatment and that he needed cash urgently so he will be willing to sell all his BTC (1 BTC) for 10k if I made a bank deposit.

q34uyl,ZeroOne15,DD on Predictions Market!,"#  Polymarket: A Decentralized Prediction

MarketMarket-based forecast is created, which can help give the average person insight into what to expect in the future.

Speculating and giving opinions on various topics has been a part of life for a long time, and being right gives people an invaluable feeling. Everything from electing our leaders to trying to predict our sports team matches has been a part of life between individuals, and decentralised prediction markets are simply a way of monetizing people‚Äôs opinions and giving them the feeling of being right.

Polymarket is a decentralized prediction that is non-custodial ‚Äî meaning, it never retains user funds and does not profit from bets. On the Polygon blockchain, all transactions are made in crypto, and all processes are transparent and automated. The markets platform that allows users to speculate and make predictions on the outcomes of real global events. It was released in 2020 and is built on Ethereum and polygon technology, users trade on what they believe will happen, which generates probabilities. A result is generated using the knowledge of the crowd, and the winning predictions are able to collect their rewards as a result. Coronavirus, politics, current affairs, sports, movies and other topics are discussed.

**How the platform works**

You‚Äôll need an Ethereum wallet and a web browser to operate Polymarket. Polymarket provides an Ethereum-based Polymarket wallet for you when you sign up with your email address.

You must first deposit the USDC stablecoin into your Polymarket wallet before you can begin speculating. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are tied to stable assets like the US dollar and have a steady price.

After you‚Äôve finished this stage, you can choose a market to engage in and a yes or no outcome on which you want to speculate. When the market‚Äôs outcome has been clearly determined, the market closes. Your result shares can be cashed out if you choose the perfect result; if you picked the wrong outcome, your shares are worthless.

**Conclusion**

While prediction markets have existed for some time in our society, this is an online decentralised prediction market built on Ethereum that provides significant value and utility above centralised markets, including lower fees, no middlemen, and more transparency. Decentralized prediction markets will play an increasingly important role in the new economy as the market grows.",1633596676,0,1

qbrmz6,Godfreee,Someone asked me if it was still OK to buy Bitcoin at $64K. This was my answer.,"Bitcoin is an emerging technology, network, and asset class that is only 13 years old.

It is growing across all metrics at a rate faster than the internet itself in the 90s.

The amount of capital and brain power pouring into all facets of Bitcoin (tech, asset, network, and related fields) is unprecedented. 

The amount of people who have accumulated massive amounts of capital over the years because of Bitcoin are deploying that capital to make Bitcoin even more secure, easier to use, easier to access, and easier to integrate is also increasing rapidly, creating a positive feedback loop.

Bitcoin at $1 Trillion in market capitalization is still too small in the financial markets today, but that is changing rapidly. The total addressable market for Bitcoin's use case is at least $10 trillion (gold), and then an order of magnitude more once Bitcoin eats into bonds, real estate, art, and other stores of value.

Bitcoin has no rulers, only rules. It has no central points of failure and has time as its ally. Every single block produced by the network gives new information to the market and ossifies Bitcoin's position as a long-term store of value that is free from human interference and political manipulation. 

The demand for such a monetary network, asset, and technology is increasing exponentially as people see no end to fiat debasement.

Bitcoin is here to stay, it is not going away.

One of main bullish arguments is of BTC being a store of value as a safeguard against the effects of quantitative easing, inflation and the fall of the dollar. 

It would seem to follow that if that is the case and the dollar crashes, the price of BTC would rise even more as the result of the loss of value of fiat. 

My question is this, what if Plan B is correct about the price of BTC reaching into the millions (USD) only for us to find ourselves in a situation where a gallon of gas is $250 and a dinner for two at Wendy‚Äôs costs $1,200?

I'll try to keep this short. I'm 25, and for the past couple of years I've been looking at btc, thinking of it as this bubble that's about to explode. Relatively recently however, I started looking into it, and realised the terrible mistake I had made. I did, however, realize that whenever is better than never in the world of Btc, and a couple months ago made my first deposit. My financial situation is far from great, so I put down a couple hundred euro, and during the past months I've invested a total of 900euro (current value about 1.3k).

With the current situation in my life, I can only put down about 200-300eur each month, and the skeptic inside me keeps on saying that I've missed my train to financial freedom.

My goal with btc is making sure I can pay off my mortgage, and ensure a good shot at life for my kid, and early retirement for me and my wife.

qbp228,Mitrade_Official,US Treasury: Digital assets could hamper US sanctions effectiveness,"The US Treasury Department advised in a report this week that the government should modernise and adapt to cryptocurrencies, as digital assets could hamper the implementation of US sanctions.

For example, the country‚Äôs major sanctions targets, China and Iran have found ways not to be adversely impacted by US sanctions. China developed its own digital currency yuan, while Iran managed to export more barrels of oil per day to countries other than the US. 

The rapid rise of cryptocurrencies allows people to figure out ways to go around the financial system. That said, the greenback remains as the world‚Äôs reserve currency. 

Therefore, to remain the US‚Äôs financial positioning in the world and to dismantle the threat from digital currencies, the report suggested that officials ""should deepen its institutional knowledge and capabilities in the evolving digital assets and services space"".

According to the Times, a senior Treasury official said on Monday that one way to solve this is to make it more difficult for cryptocurrencies to be converted into government-issued money.

Hereis my understanding on each scheme:

* **BIP-045** details the derivation scheme for legacy P2SH multisig wallets.  BIP-45 stands out because it includes a `cosigner index` level where each signing party is given a number based on the position of their public key at the purpose level sorted in lexicographical order.
* **BIP-048** details a derivation scheme that can be used for different script types. It can do this because it has a `script type` level with registered constants to use for different script types. Surprisingly, the BIP only registers two different script types, Native and Nested Segwit, which makes implementing legacy wallets with this derivation scheme non-standard. So if a wallet application were to use BIP-048, they would have to use a separate or non-standard derivation scheme for legacy multisig HD wallets. For example, Bluewallet and Electrum use BIP-048 for Segwit and BIP-045 for legacy wallets.
* **BIP-087** details a common derivation scheme that can be used for any script type. It lacks any levels that can be used to identify the wallet type. It is arguably the easiest for developers to implement but I am yet to find any wallets that use this derivation scheme.",1634006690,3,1

q6aups,jack_murray,The long term effect of the global DCA army,"Say only 1 in 20 people in the world understand Bitcoin and want to hold it over other assets and currencies.

Say on average these people can contribute $10k per year.

That is $3.8765 trillion per year in upwards sell pressure, or 68,233,494.00 BTC.

If weak hands downwards sell pressure exceeds this value, price will go down until the weak hands are empty.

Then price will continue to rise.

The point is that we don't need a very high adoption rate to prove store of value utility over time. Which will encourage more people to educate themselves.

Once 1/3 or 1/2 people are in this DCA army, funnelling value into Bitcoin, businesses will have a strong business case to accept Bitcoin, and we will see the [hyperbitcoinization](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/hyperbitcoinization) inflection point in action.

ii) Created an incentive struct for independent actors to operate a financial system

iii) Created one of the most robust security models known to date

iv) Lead to an entire nation state adopting a new legal tender

v) Motivated an entire segment of our global population to be ACTUALLY interested in economics

And obviously we could list another 1000 tangential accomplishments that came from this whitepaper. Obviously I know he did not singularly implement it but it is safe to say without his amazing foresight we could easily have never had this version of the industry.

I saw this on CNN today:

Some guy predicted the effects of shifting the minimum wage. Not saying that isn't good work but objectively the impact is not even 1% of the way there.

Is it the case that these awards go out after x period of years? To be fair if he doesn't ever win it, I feel like it is more of a sign that the system is nepotistic and flawed but I also think if he does win then it is an important societal validation.

Leftists whine about the environmental impact. Far right spews the same hyperinflation conspiracy theories they've been spewing long before BTC or even the internet existed. Everyone tries too hard to give everything a deeper meaning, even if it isn't really there.  The actual explanation is much simpler.

BTC is nothing more than a display of social media's power to enable to people to work together far more efficiently than before. Despite intrinsic value or lack thereof, if enough people buy, we can achieve gains that were never possible for the average person before. Social media can generate virtually infinite momentum via hyperefficient communication. The millionaire lifestyle is now accessible to everyone thanks to social media.¬†

The more people who invest their hopes and dreams into it, the more reward we all will gain from it.

Crypto has changed the way markets work, not because of crypto itself, but because of what it's revealed to the world about social media. The exact same momentum building tactic that has been used for crypto has also been utilized for GME/AMC and pop culture collectibles, and has been incredibly successful there too.

Crypto may not be the future of currency, but crypto DID show us what the future of finance is: not Wall Street, but social media instead.

qc389m,youbehasbeen,thoughts on Bitcoin as nothing but speculation,"People often misunderstand bitcoin as a speculation. This happens when you think that the exchange rate is the signal, or in other words, that price drives value rather than value driving price. Through this lens, you have no foundation for knowing whether the price will go up other than your hope that there is a larger number of suckers to come after you who will drive the price up. This is the essence of speculation. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, if bitcoin or any asset is able to provide something of value, then the price is not what drives value - it simply represents a growing awareness of the inherent value that already exists while also providing some level of additional value.

&amp;#x200B;

I've spoken with and seen enough people who think bitcoin is speculation. They have the whole thing on it's head. It's easy to perceive something as speculation when you don't understand it.",1634743092,12,1

I will assume this question must have been answered already somewhere in Reddit, but the sub is so big that I haven't found any comprehensive answer. 

So here is the situation:

My BTC funds are sitting in a legacy account in a Trezor wallet. I am planning to move a small portion to my bank account. 

Should I move it first from a legacy account to a regular account? 

Should I wait for taproot?

My bank has no fee for BTC/ETH deposits and just a flat fee of 10 USD to convert them to fiat, so I assume there is no better option and the only important fee I will have to care about is the transaction fee in the blockchain, right?

So that's basically it. Since I have never touched my BTC funds, any other advice from people with experience is more than welcome. 

Thank you! Cheers!",1634741860,10,1

Normal futures contracts the buyer is obligated to purchase the underlying asset at the agreed upon price at time of expiration.

When the vet hospital being built with profits was mentioned, someone said, no, they should just hold. But it may be possible that they intend to pay the builders, etc. in BTC in which case the coins never need to be sold. If other countries, say Argentina, produce medicines that vets use, then BTC can perhaps be used to pay for those and again, no need to liquidate.

This sort of thing has never happened on a large scale. The economy of El Salvador is not huge, but it could tie up a lot of BTC and as more countries are added who use BTC as a legal tender, I think you get the picture.",1633857888,43,1

1.) Marathon digital holdings (MARA). They have a market cap of 4 billion dollars, and hold Bitcoin equivalent to about 350m. If the market is forward looking, does that mean it expects Bitcoin to reach $500,000 per coin? 

2.) involvement of Silvergate Capital: they issued a 100m credit revolver for marathon, which happens to be collateralized with Bitcoin.

q52x38,Blueworld7997,Localcryptos : racism and arbitrary suspensions of this website which is the worst P2P exchange platform,"Localcryptos is the worst trading site out there. In addition, the administrators are racists, which is inconceivable. When a black person (from an African country for example) registers on this site, there is a good chance that your account will be suspended for no reason, that is why they say in their ""terms and conditions"" that they can suspend or ban an account without giving a reason. I had read several people on several forums who complained about racism from Localcryptos (see for example this link as proof https://www.reddit.com/r/localcryptos/comments/o7h9h0/why_am_i_suspended/). Even in their telegram group, I counted over 200 suspension complaints (mostly blacks, Indians, generally people of colour) and they did not respond to any of them. And when you send them a mail, they don't even reply to you, and if you send several other emails, there is their worst administrator, a certain ""Anibal"" who finally answers you after several days, telling you that he has no explanation to give you and that your suspension is irrevocable. There are just a few rare accounts on the site that are registered in Africa so that administrators can pretend they are accepting black people and can counter complaints of racism. Me for example my account was suspended for no reason, I did not even make a single trade. I opened another account with my wife's phone and her own internet connection, and that account had also been suspended without making a single trade. So I negotiated with a friend who also opened an account on the site using his own phone and his own internet connection. And his account was suspended too, without having made a single trade. Aside from this racism issue, if you are new on the site you also have a good chance that they will suspend your account without allowing you to make a single trade. Apart from localcryptos I am also on https://hodlhodl.com/join/TFHZ which is the best P2P website, you will have no problem on this site, they accept blacks, new registrants, whites, and everybody. You will not see any such complaints about Hodl Hodl on any forums. You can trade on that website without problem.",1633848811,1,1

That means that the price of an apple would be less and less every year, even if the price of Bitcoin is stable.

q4zj5q,91-divoc-eht,"Massive Liquidations, both LONGS and SHORTS (Are they here to stay forever???)","Hello all! Hope you are doing well! I was just thinking about this the other day and since I'm fairly new to the game I thought I would ask the question. Over the past half year I've seen massive liquidations, both LONGS and SHORTS and I just had a couple of questions. These types of millions/billions of dollars of liquidations happen when people are using huge leverage multipliers, which some exchanges allow traders to place. They are triggered by a buildup of trades which causes a huge chain reaction. My question is this, will this type of activity which can cause massive price swings for bitcoin (5-20% increases or decreases) be around forever? Or, will they start to decrease when the price of bitcoin goes higher. Lets say theoretically bitcoin reaches the gold market cap of 10 Trillion and is 500k per coin. Will traders be less hesitant to place huge leverages on their trades? 

I am completely fascinated by this topic as it seems to be a huge reason why many people are very hesitant to want to get into bitcoin in the first place. There is a lot of volatility in bitcoin as it is, but these types of swings, which no one can predict when they occur just seem to put a lot of people off to the concept of owning bitcoin. It almost seems like these events happen every month, almost multiple times in some cases. 

I know I'm not the first and will not be the last person to have thought about this, but will the price of bitcoin ever be so high that these types of liquidations do not occur on this scale any more?",1633833664,10,1

Bitcoin mining is the process of adding new blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain network by solving cryptographic puzzles. If you have the technical know-how of mining and the luxury of high computing power, then traditional mining is worth your effort. See miners that mined traditionally used to earn huge fortunes in the initial stages of the crypto revolution. However, today individual miners can hardly compensate for their electricity bills by mining Bitcoins.

Does this mean you can‚Äôt earn money with BTC mining? Not at all, thats where cloud mining services like the platform I'd recomend come to play, where you have to pay once, and that‚Äôs about it. You don‚Äôt need to mine, nor you have to worry about your rising electricity bills.

Cloud mining services involve renting mining equipment for other miners so that they can mine for you. You have to invest once, and you will keep receiving your share of the cake.
To put it all together, cloud mining is still profitable if you to do it the right one and way.

 Before pouring your hard earned coin in a cloud mining company, verify it‚Äôs credibility as spam is at an all-time high in the crypto space.",1634686192,4,1

2. Since it must be online will this not present some security risks such as is it possible for one of the two parties from a payment channel to close the channel and pocket funds while the other is away (fraudulent channel close)?
3. Could someone spam or congest the channels so much where transactions expire and someone can steal the funds? 
4. Ideally, wouldn't it be more secure to just use the base layer?

q665d5,migu3333l,"What happens when you get informed by fake news, Buterin about El Salvador","Hi! First time posting here. 

This is my opinion about what Buterin said, I'm salvadorian and maybe I'm not the regular salvadorian but if the law didn't require big businesses to accept bitcoin most likely I wouln't be able to pay in the supermarket. I work online and I receive my payments in bitcoin. I found online jobs as my salvation for the moment while I find something better, here in the country I haven't been able to find a job in my field as a creative artist and illustrator. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our law says that those businesses must accept bitcoin but they're not forced to receive them. How so? Thru the national wallet Chivo they have the option to instantly convert the bitcoins they're receiving into US dollar. And the government has repeatedly said that it's fully optional to receive bitcoin. Now with that said, we, salvadorians, know that there is plenty of fake news in the internet created to make El Salvador look like dumb and I know it myself because as a content creator in the internet these people have contacted me to create fake news for them. Many of these news didn't tell all the truth about what is happening here. These news have created the notion that Nayib is a dictator and evil person to their target auience, which Buterin fits into. Now, about the ideal of freedom that Buterin talks about, we're still free to use or not bitcoin, AND if the law didn't require busineses to accept bitcoin who would have that freedom restricted would be me.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that bitcoin was adapted to our reality as a society and not as a simple technology and they didn't just leave the people on god's will to whatever happens to them. Buterin was right that some people was scammed but again, the government has announced they're going for these scammers. I don't agree with many things about Nayib but the thing is that all salvadorians have to push to take our country out of where it was in the past and this just gives me the feeling that even with some mistakes (the government's app failed a lot at it's launch, for example), at least we are giving little stept and not being in the same position forever as a country.",1633987315,18,1

q64sby,ShortCourse,Finally took some profits.,"I made all of my Bitcoin purchases around November/December of 2020.  Put a little over $5,000 in and left it untouched, no DCA or additional purchases.

Like so many, I loved the high you get from when it runs and the pit in your stomach when it dips.  Never had any plans for it, it was more of a fun/moon shot investment, but with that being said, that ~$5,000 investment was a lot of money to me and it would hurt to lose it.

Me and the wife recently bought our first house together and as of a few moments ago, I sold a smidge under half of my holdings.  While I didn't ""need"" the money, it will certainly help with some of the projects we've got in the works and will keep our savings intact.  I got my original investment out, plus a little bonus and still have what will hopefully be sizable amount at some point.  

It feels really good to have locked in a little bit of win.

Now that's out of the way, I think Bitcoin is counterintuitive to it's own success, not just Bitcoin but all things deflationary.

We all want to accumulate more BTC, most of us buy it, others mine it and some steal it. Ultimately mining is the only way to make more though, the buck stops with the miners (did I use that correctly?) The problem that I'm sure has been brought up before is that the more miners on the network, the less each miner gets... Makes it tricky to accumulate more whilst encouraging mainstream adoption.

Sure, it's divisible and sure, the more people who own it and buy it, the higher the value goes but that in and of itself creates another issue and it's akin to inflation... But it works in reverse. Oh you know the word, we say it enough.

Anyway, let's look at the world we're currently forced to endure, your minimum wage job doesn't pay you enough to cover all of your bills, sufficiently feed yourself and have money to actually progress in life. Typically you will end up wasting what little money you have at the end of the month on something just to cheer yourself up so you can keep slugging on through.

The Government does you a solid and increases minimum wage, ideal, you've got more money! But lo and behold before the years out your utilities have increased, your landlord wants an extra $20 a month and the price of milk and fuel has gone up. Why? Because Eff you that's why. I'm kidding, it's because of capitalism. Companies and businesses know you have more money and know they can squeeze more out of you. Capitalism and inflation only really affects the lowest rung of the totem pole or at the very least, they're hit the hardest.

We've all experienced this, we all know this and right about now you'd like me to hurry the Eff up and get to the point.

Sorry, a quick hypothetical. Bitcoin has become the global currency, everything is priced in BTC and you're no longer choosing to accumulate, you're forced to. It's how you pay yours bills! But much like inflation only screwing the little guy, so does this... At least I think it would. The supermarket charges 100 sats for a bottle of milk. Always has, always will. No need to increase the price of it in a deflationary world.

Why? Because in all likelihood, just like the miners receiving smaller and smaller rewards as time goes on so to would your minimum wage job pay you less and less each month ""but it's called minimum wage!""
...Yeah but how do you put a minimum on something that is constantly reducing? it's the same as putting a top on something (fiat) that's constantly increasing.

And so I FINALLY get to my bloody point. I think if bitcoin became the world currency we would have the exact same issues as we do today...  just in reverse. I'm not even sure if fiat is actually the issue or the Governments. It's probably just human nature and greed, survival of the fittest and all that.

I appreciate bitcoin isn't supposed to be a cure all and all it can do is help our own personal economic struggles but maybe it poses it's own (struggles)? 

What do you all think?
