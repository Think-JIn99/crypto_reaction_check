fcxwo1,Solarfornia,Tax Questions: Coinbase third party network transactions,I got my 1099-k and see over a million dollars for Gross amount of payment card/third party network transactions. Thing is I made pretty much no money. I'm a shitty trader I guess. But am I going to be screwed with the IRS even though I lost or broke even? Is there another form besides the 1099-k? It's the only one Coinbase is giving me. Thanks!,1583256057,2,1
fcxut1,jayj9,Help with my Bitcoin Dissertation?,"Hi I’m writing my dissertation on bitcoin for my bachelors in Economics and Finance. 

I am writing about the viability of bitcoin as a currency which I have heard is determined by its volatility. 

I am currently a quarter of the way through and need to do an empirical analysis of it. Possibly using econometrics or another statistical model. I was thinking of using some sort of model to calculate its volatility. But I don’t know what to do. 

Does anyone have any ideas on what statistical model to use to do this. And whether it’s a good idea to do it on its volatility? 

Thanks in advanced.",1583255857,2,1

fcxfpd,HodlMeNowSatoshi,Bitcoin Doubling Scam Being Livestreamed on Youtube Right Now - You know what to do,"This scammer is replaying a Tesla podcast/video stream to an audience of almost 10,000 people with the well known ""Elon Musk giving away free BTC"" scam plastered all over the visible area.

How to tell it's a scam?

1. The website (btc musk dot com) is registered to an individual in Moscow Russia.
2. This is the only video on the channel.
3. Spelling/Grammar mistakes.
4. Unrelated content on community tab (Liverpool Football Club)
5. Country of origin on About tab is Canada (from which nothing good comes)\*
6. URL is random character new user default, not a qualified Tesla-related Youtube channel.
7. Channel originally created in 2015 under Sports category.

No one is going to ""double"" your bitcoin for free.  The scam is their trying to get you to send a small amount of BTC to their wallet, and you'll magically get more sent back to you.  You will never get anything in return but shame and disappointment.

I know about the satoshi unit, but this one intermediate value isn't good enough. 285,170 satoshis for a pizza is a mouthful.

fcty28,usrname001,Bitcoin gift idea for no coiners,"Just thought I’d share a neat concept I used to gift bitcoin to family members on their birthday or Christmas which was received rather well and generated a lot of interest. Use a [mockup certificate ](http://www.pixeden.com/misc-print/psd-print-certificate-template#) to create a “bitcoin gift card” which displays the amount you are gifting (in bitcoin, since the value fluctuates) to the name of the person. You can add other elements like the coin name (Bitcoin of course, but I’ve done it for Litecoin also since a family member already had BTC), add the coin symbol etc to make it look more quirky. Add a QR code that [links to a reliable source ](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) that explains how the gift holder can create a wallet of their choice without being mislead. Once the gift holder acknowledges that they are ready to receive their token, you ask for their address and send over a test transaction to confirm that they’re doing it right. Then send over their gift funds. Interest sparked. Creative gift idea sorted. If they don’t create a wallet you simply hold their funds on their behalf until they are ready to accept / or might even just want to cash out - of course you insist that they don’t cash out and explain the HODL wisdom.",1583239038,6,1

But if you follow the curve we are almost at the end of that practice... it is not physically possible to get 20x-50x-100x in ASIC efficiency like before, so the solution would be only to stack more chips right? then again there is power consumption that we can work on, but then again that has limits also, so are we going to get stuck with super-efficient ASIC chips that can squeeze only a few % to get better over the course of next decade? and the only solution would be stacking chips and trying to get better electric efficiency? that was not a problem to consider before so much as it is now, that many people don't think about.

We have XY amount of ""Hash Power"" now with every halving block reward cuts in half,  that will trow many miners out of the game if ofc price doesn't increase dramatically... so more and more people want to mine but the game is much much harder, you have to invest in stacks and stacks of ASIC chips that reached almost their physical limits, in theory.

Paper is in German.

Abstract:

When  Satoshi Nakamoto developed the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin in 2009, terms  like Blockchain, “e- money” and decentralized Money were only known by a  few Cyberpunks. Nakamoto has developed the Bitcoin as a reaction to the  2008 finacial crisis und the massive sate debts following it. He wanted  to invent a currency that is independent of a singular institution like  a bank or a state. He wanted to give the monopoly of money back to the  people. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to government issued  money and was supposed to be used as an alternative currency. 10 Years  have passed since 2009 and a lot has happened since. Nakamoto has never  been seen again, the development of the cryptocurrency is done by  different people and the popularity has increased enormously. The  Bitcoin- Course has reached a Makret Volume of over 350 Billion Euros,  only to Crash again by 80%. There were countless splits, so called “hard  forks” from the official Blockchain, which became cryptocurrencies of  their own. As of June 2019 there have been over 1500 different  cryptocurrencies. States like Venezuela and international companies like  Facebook have issued their own cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is used for  Remittances, to store value, for money laundering and as payment method  for illegal activities. According to Google trend Data, most Peoples  interest in Bitcoin is how to make them more money. The question, what  goods and services are to buy with it is not part of the Top 25 Google  search terms in combination with Bitcoin. Why is Bitcoin used so much as  an asset then as an actual payment method? This paper tries to answer  that question and under which circumstances Cryptocurrencies are used as  payment methods. This research included a survey, where 105 people of  the Austrian Bitcoin Community, have been asked about their behavior  towards Cryptocurrencies and their socio economic background. The goal  is to get results about the different usage of cryptocurrencies and  different characteristic of the users.",1583221315,13,1

What other options are there? I don't want to get scammed and don't want to pay too much over the current price. I am aware of the risks and am aware that scamming is possible.

fg00mf,Nesh_,"Currently ~14M USD worth of Bitcoins are mined a day, ~420M USD a month. After halving we need ~210M USD less new money every single month to stay at the same price.","Just think about it, these numbers are huge (even at the currently dropped prices!). We need 420M USD of new money every single month to just absorb the newly mined Bitcoins at a price of 8k USD (either bought on the market for $ from non-miners or ""bought"" by the miners for electricity, which also means for $).

If we think about likely above-average investors and assume they can buy $1k worth of Bitcoin every month, we would need 420,000 such investors to just absorb the newly mined Bitcoins.

After halving we need 7M USD less buying power every single day, or 210M USD less every month or 2,520M USD less every year. It would be crazy if this doesn't result in increasing prices medium to long term. Short term the speculative effect of the halving will be a larger driving factor for the price (both up and down), but once the dust about the halving has settled there should be notably less sell pressure and thus slowly but steadily rising prices over time.

And to those thinking that the amount of newly mined Bitcoins is negletable compared to the total daily trading volume: that's a flawed argument. The big big majority of the daily trading volume is 1) fake volume from stupid exchanges, 2) bots constantly trading back and forth with what ever strategies they use (arbitrage etc.), 3) people day trading, i.e. also trading back and forth to make profits.   
Only a tiny tiny part of the total trading volume are people actually selling without buying back at a lower (or higher if they screwed up) price and only that volume needs to really be absorbed by new money. I would argue that the newly mined Bitcoins are a decent chunk of that ""real sell volume"", so they absolutely have a rather large impact on the price.",1583781343,16,1

I am now far more confident about how On Yavin’s Slanders Mafia is growing. I observed this several times. If there is a conflict, the winner will be he who publicly slander his enemy. A slander brawler would tag On Yavin with a text full of lie. On Yavin would add some shit, add a spicy headline and promote as a heroic investigative journalism work. Now the slander is a cool friend of On and On is a friend of the slander. They both are now partners in crime, a gang with a common goal to destroy potential enemies - friends of destroyed victims. Do you want to support your slandered friend and mess up with this slanders mafia?

No, you would prefer to keep silence, smile, shake his hand.. then get some whiskey and share what you really feel - incognito!

And a couple of noticeable comments (will copy here in case Cointelligence guy will try to remove it): 

&gt;""I am considering to get listed at the Cointelligence IEO page as my marketing firm suggests. And feel worried.Fees are slightly higher than other IEO listings site. The package is standard - project page, details, ratings, some promotion if buy a premium package. There is a chance to get Low-risk score which is their estimation of the project success. However, they are not visible in Alexa or Similar web and look overpriced. I would prefer old horses with sizable traffic like ICO Bench.Not that easy, my marketing agency says I should choose On Yavin’s Cointelligence. Why?  
   
“Are you crazy? You must get listed here and never list on his main competitor like ICO Bench. Do you want big scandals from nothing? You do not, but On Yavin wants. You will get low score and announced as a scam. Your community will be used to beat you for the wrong decision. Scandals will attract your community to your scam page on cointelligence to boost On’s referral links fees. The other projects will see this and learn the lesson to make the right decision where to get listed. Did you hear that he rarely changes the rating after publication? This means you must pay in advance.This is Mafia. There is two types of people in crypto - friends or enemies of On Yavin. Friends support each other and coordinate to beat enemies. Projects of friendly advisors would gent high score and protection from attacks even if each of the advisor’s projects is doing scam exit. Influencers and community leaders would prefer to join the coalition even if their friends slandered. Everybody wants to be a friend of On”.Should I accept the offer? What would you do?""

Unfortunately, i don't think all of you will be able to come, but what do you think of the matter ?  
Should the money stay in the sole hands of the state ? Should the power over it be shared ? What of the regulation ? What is your opinion on the way countries reigned over money for the past centuries ?

Will Bitcoin break the hegemony of the state over the wealth ?

feb4bo,SlowMist_Team,Be Cautious of Multiple Omni USDT Double-spend Attacks,"Recently, the OmniCore team has fixed a major security vulnerability. As the node does not properly handle the “sync LOCK” problem when receiving a new block, an attacker can send a specially constructed block to cause multiple transactions to be recorded in one transaction, making the account balance wrong.

Earlier, the SlowMist security team captured a USDT false top-up attack incident against the exchange. After analysis, it was found that because some exchanges used older versions of the OmniCore client (such as 0.5.0). Meanwhile, Hackers used the carefully constructed transfer transaction, which can be marked as a successful transfer on the client of the old version and displayed as failed on the client of the new version, thereby achieving the purpose of false top-up.

The SlowMist security team wants to kindly remind the relevant node operators that conducting double-spend attacks by using un-upgraded nodes is a common hacking method, especially on layer 2 solutions such as OmniLayer. Such attacks will not cause the main chain to fork，it is not easy to be found. Therefore, It is wiser to be vigilant and upgrade the node to the latest version (0.8.0) in time.",1583487061,1,1

fhqay6,AvailableHorse,Will Bitcoin become the new gold?,"Both gold and Bitcoin are down. During a liquidity crisis, cash is king.

I recommend everyone to check out forums about gold, like [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/Gold/comments/fhgnn4/why_is_gold_going_down_in_price_during_these_times/). People are asking why gold is down, and the answer is simple - the debt is huge and a corona-recession is coming, so any dispensable investment is sold to be able to pay the debt.

The 2008 gold veterans also remind everyone that the printing and stimulus packages will arrive soon, and when Fiat will go down, the investors will buy gold again.

&amp;#x200B;

Or maybe they won't. This time the investors have another option. This time they can put their money in a different scarce asset, far more liquid with no need for mediators to validate it or trucks to drive it around. The only question is whether the culture behind Bitcoin is as strong as the culture behind gold. Will people that love Bitcoin keep hodling as much as people who love gold keep their golden jewelries?

Just a reminder, the total market-cap of gold is around 80-100 times the total market-cap of Bitcoin. Even if those investors will put in Bitcoin 10% of what they intended to put in gold, Bitcoin will skyrocket. The upcoming halving couldn't have come in a better timing, it will be a great advertisement for Bitcoin. This is not 2008, CoronaVirus is a real thing and not a man-made crisis (afaik), but it's one of those moments that Bitcoin was created for. The rest is up to you.",1584057336,7,1

fhq7ty,tomclancyv7,The Halvening Will Not Increase The Price Of Bitcoin. Change My Mind.,"Every four years, there is a halvening event, which means the numbers of bitcoins that miners are given as a reward will be halved. Per supply and demand, if the supply of something decreases, while demand remains stable, price should increase(Example is the corona mask and toilet paper rush). But the supply of bitcoin is still increasing. It's just that the rate is slowed down every 4 years. There are more bitcoins available to buy today than yesterday and there will be more the following day so why is there a reason to believe that halvening will increase price?  


Since price has halved(drop in price from $10k to $5.6k) and mining rewards are also halved won't it affect the miners since they are getting lesser money from selling the newly halved bitcoins? It seems like a really bad deal if you ask me.  


Many people argue that price rose in 2016 due to halving and that it will repeat itself in 2020. But was it really due to the halving(I wasn't in crypto back then, started in early 2017). Since everyone is keen on the halvening event, won't the whales use this as an opportunity to fuck everyone over and make easy money?  
In case this halving does not get the desired effect in price, what is the next hype catalyst for bitcoin?",1584056991,8,1

Actually, my conspiracy theory mindset has me wondering if this overdone Corona virus was created just to have a market crash while the elite still had a sizable percentage of the Bitcoins in existence which they acquired via mining and OTC markets for the sole purpose of crashing the bitcoin spot Market harder than the stock markets to try and shake people's belief in it being a non correlating asset or better than gold as a SOV. Most FOLKS here believe (myself included) that in a truly open market that could simply not be the case due to the fact that it is the first Truly finite asset and one that we do not need anyone to validate nor anyone's permission to transmit to anyone anywhere anytime instantly. I believe that math will work out here  over time and that this is a temporary pre halving opportunity for us to acquire bitcoin cheaply. I will continue to dollar cost average, run my own node, and store my own keys. I will not sell no matter what the fiat price is. I do this knowing its risky, and also with the belief that this is a way to vote for the future of humanity in the right direction away from the financial oppressors and a truly decentralized world with a bonefied truth machine to hold people accountable and create a more just world for all!

fhon2g,hurray_for_boobies,Bitcoin lost $56 billion in market cap over the past 7 days. Gold lost $420 billion... Store of value? Safe haven?,"Bitcoin lost $56 billion in market cap over the past 7 days. Gold lost $420 billion...

What does this mean for Bitcoin's status as a store of value/safe haven, compared to gold?  
And what if Bitcoin's market cap were equal to gold's? Hypothetically, of course ;-)

**Math and some reasoning below, please correct me if I'm wrong:**

Market cap of Bitcoin 7 days ago: $166 billion  
Market cap of Bitcoin today: $110 billion  
=&gt; [Bitcoin's market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) decreased by $166-$110 billion = $56 billion.

Market cap of (above ground) gold was [estimated to be $7 trillion in 2017.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/08/17/how-does-bitcoins-market-cap-stack-up-next-to-gold.aspx)   
Gold's market cap [decreased by 6%](https://www.bullionbypost.eu/gold-price/week/ounces/USD/) so 0.06\*$7000 billion = $420 billion.

Two (purely mathematical) conclusions:  
\* Percentage-wise, Bitcoin's market cap dropped 5.5 times more than gold: **33% vs 6%**  
\* USD-wise, gold's market cap dropped 7.5 times more than Bitcoin: **$420 billion vs $56 billion**

Obviously, if there's one thing you want from a safe haven asset, it's for it to retain its value, so low volatility. But maybe Bitcoin's higher volatility (today) can be explained by its (currently) small market cap, relative to gold.

To raise $1 billion USD:  
\* 1/7000th (around 0.014%) of the current gold supply needs to be sold  
\* 1/110th (around 1%) of the current Bitcoin supply needs to be sold  
Clearly, to raise a certain amount of USD, a much bigger chunk of the total supply of Bitcoin needs to be sold, compared to gold. During times of high sell-side pressure, the smaller market cap makes it more volatile, which is bad for a safe haven/SoV.

But this also means that, if Bitcoin's market cap were to rise, its volatility would decrease, thus improving its usefulness as a safe haven or ""store of value"". And in an ""apples-to-apples"" comparison with identical market cap, Bitcoin might have sold off a lot less (% wise) than gold...

Am I making any reasoning errors or missing something here, other than the unknown side effects of such a large market cap (\*)?

By the way, if anyone could roughly estimate how much USD the global public stock market cap has dropped over the past 7 days, that would be awesome - both for comparison and perspective! :-)

**TL; DR: Gold only** ***looked*** **like a better safe haven/SoV than Bitcoin this week because of its bigger market cap. But what if the market cap goes up?**

*(\*) I'm deliberately ignoring the fact that with such a large market cap, Bitcoin would clearly be much more significant for financial markets. Retirement and hedge funds might have it in their portfolio's, etc. This introduces many unknowns. As I don't want to speculate on those unknowns, I've tried to ignore them in this thought experiment.*",1584050900,8,1

BTC was never intended to be a panacea that would protect it's holders from every possible type of market downturn.  Rather, the ""Store of Value"" narrative speaks towards Bitcoin's resilience against a very specific type of economic crisis, namely the collapse of the fractional reserve banking system, and the resulting carnage.  While we very well may look back at last week as the straw that broke the camels back and made said collapse inevitable, we still have a long way to go before we get to the point where Bitcoin's strength as a store of value will shine.  The Fed still has a little ammunition left, and they are going to pull out all the stops to do whatever they can to keep their house of cards from crumbling down around them.  I expect Bitcoin to go down more - a lot more - before it goes up again.  I also think that it's more likely than not that we will come out of this with the credit system intact...the printing press is powerful, and people have believed in the ""Full faith and credit of the US Government"" as a 100% guarantee for, well, generations now.

LocalBitcoins will revoke the ability to leave feedback to anyone found criticising them. If you use LocalBitcoins and have a bad transaction, they will use their ability to silence you. I advise anyone who uses LocalBitcoins to avoid the platform at all costs. 

Furthermore LocalBitcoins' support is terrible. Their site is going downhill and it's only a matter of time before the platform dies out. I would recommend using alternative platforms such as Paxful/Bisq or to wait for a new P2P platform to come out. LocalBitcoins is starting to die out. They have a suggestion thread on their subreddit however, that thread was simply made to make them look as if they were doing something. LocalBitcoins has not taken any of the suggestions into account. Their support time is still ridiculous, people are still having problems with their accounts getting suspended and users are being forced to wait 14 days to get their Bitcoins back.

It's no surprise that what LocalBitcoins is doing is illegal. They cannot lock people's bitcoins for 14 days and in some cases even longer.

For all of these steps, questions about identity, name and address should all be answered as the guardian, not the minor.  So the account name is in the name ""Adult Smith"" not ""Minor Smith"".  Same with SSN and ID checks.

For even lower fees you could ask your parents or guardians to KYC through Binance, Kraken, Gemini or Coinbase to link your checking account to a real exchange.

For those with guardians or parents that would not agree to KYC for you through CashApp, here are some non-KYC options, though the fees are much (much) higher than 2%.

* [P2P exchanges (e.g., LocalBitcoins, Bisq, HodlHodl, Paxful, etc.,)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8/list_of_bitcoin_persontoperson_p2p_bitcoin/)
* [Purse.io/earn](https://purse.io/earn/btc) (shop Amazon for BTC, must be 13yo).
* [Mycelium Local Trader](https://mycelium.com/lt/help.html)
* [Meetup.com - Bitcoin](https://www.meetup.com/topics/bitcoin/) or any meetup you can find.  Ask (discretely) to buy BTC for cash after the meeting.
* Switch to [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/bri541) and get small amounts of cryptocurrency while you surf, but you can't cash out till your 18.
* Buy altcoin then [convert to Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cd1fr8/list_of_nokyc_instant_exchanges/).  Different coins have different P2P buy options.
* Mining &lt;= Super crazy risky unless your a savaont, makeing a profit is hard.
* Craigslist sell for Bitcoin (double the price and offer 50% off if paid with Bitcoin)
* Work for crypto (mow lawns and offer 50% off if they pay with Bitcoin).
* Look at a [Bitcoin Job Board](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e8exv1/willing_to_work_for_bitcoin_00004_btchour/fabcw8w/) to see if you could do any work there.
* Look at [Lopp's ATM List](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/buying-earning.html).  There may be some non-KYC ATMs near you, but they are rare.

Please remember that bitcon is easy to steal.  Since minor's have limited standing in US courts, most exchanges don't want to deal with them.  If you proceed there is a 100% chance that someone ***will*** try to scam you.  Make sure you catch every scammer you encounter, or you will go broke fast.

fj48l0,John_erick01,How to make a mobile wallet connect to my full node through Electrum Personal Server?,"I have Bitcoin Core (full sync) and Electum personal server with basic configuration in linux (mint) but I don't have enough technical knowledge on how to connect to mobille wallets like bluewallet, samourai, breadwallet (BRD), coinomi etc, all of them unfortunately require that connect to an electrum server instead of our own node (direct enter IP address).

But unfortunately I can't find any tutorial on the internet, could someone please tell me what to do?

Detail: Some wallets like Bitcoin wallet for android (schildbacth wallet) and BRD allow you to connect to your full node just by adding your IP address (which would be much easier and more convenient), however my node is configured with tor and these apps do not add address .onion.  


Is it possible to do this only using the electrum personal server or EPS only connects locally and does not allow more than one connection?

Do I have to install another electrum server like ElectrumX?

Do I need to create an alias certificate to connect to these mobile wallets?  


    Motivation: Why the need to connect these mobille wallet apps to my own node since these apps automatically connect to their own servers, and obviously will require a lot of technical knowledge in addition to time??
    
    Because I care a lot about my privacy and I believe that most users that run full node not only to help the network, but to validate and transmit their own transactions instead of relying on third parties for this function.
    
    One of my motivations is also because I have a full node and I want to live up to the almost 300gb that occupy my HDD, I have already managed to make my Electrum wallet to connect to my full node through EPS, now my goal is to connect mobille wallets with my own node that have this option.

fj3321,imm4nuel_cunt,An Objective Analysis on the Current State of Bitcoin,"this ought to be an objective discussion about the current and future state of bitcoin in our society. i am neither pro or con bitcoin, neither am i invested or plan to long/short bitcoin. i am a computer scientist grad student and opened this thread out of interest for the topic.

bitcoin long showed exponential growth. exponential growth though needs an exponential amount of resources to be sustained. this fuel was undoubtedly provided by the exponential spread of information that one can make ""easy"" money with bitcoin. if you remember, at its peak suddenly everyone in the world was talking about bitcoin and cryptos. this is when bitcoin price started to drop and never went up to these levels again. there were no people left that could be told about bitcoin, cause everyone already knew. no more exponential fuel to be gained.

yes, bitcoin very much promoted the idea of blockchain and a decentralized banking and money system. as someone who is working in this field i can tell you that, similar to other nice distributed systems concepts, blockchain concepts have been here before, but just didnt receive a lot of attention because they were not commonly used to ""make money"" with. 

my point is: bitcoin is completely replaceable. the technology isn´t very special or sophisticated as the quick development of many other cryptos has shown. due to its immense volatility it is unusable as a replacement for traditional currencies. no one will be happy with a currency that makes you buy a pizza for 5 btc for lunch and 50 btc for dinner. no serious business will accept a currency that could shift its value by +- 20% within a day. bitcoin does not provide, apart from being used as a speculation object, any real world use that could not be achieved far more efficiently and better with other currency solutions. it just happens to be the most popular crypto at the moment. nothing more.

i do understand that especially in this subreddit many people are financially and emotionally bound to the success of bitcoin. but please try to set your emotions aside and answer honestly and with the best arguments you have: 

what makes you think that bitcoin will not turn out to be just another ponzi scheme and break down in an exponential downward process, similar but inverse to its rise? what do you think will happen when people need the invested money for real world issues like paying bills or medical treatment in a crisis like the one we have now? what exponential fuel should bitcoin use to continue its former growth?

fj323x,holderlab,Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading strategy in a panic on the coronavirus.,"The upcoming problems with banks and the Fed’s money printing are excellent opportunities for cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. Incredible events are taking place in the stock market, the fastest falling markets in history, the spread of coronavirus in the United States and the likely risk of falling consumer demand, lower consumption and, as a result, recession.

Analysis in such conditions becomes impossible, the position of traders is removed from the market. The Fed’s cash infusion is $ 1.5 trillion per month and the base rate is reduced, as a result, money is poured into the market in order to stop the market from falling, but this may not be enough.

# Oil war

In addition, a trade oil war was added to the coronavirus, and this could cause serious problems for US shale oil companies, whose production costs are $ 30–40. The US oil sector is sitting on a wild leverage, and as a result, banks that lend to them can start problems. Thus, is it possible to say that this is perhaps the best moment for cryptocurrency projects that can be competitive in comparison with the banking sector? Well, we still have to find out.

# The fall of Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market

Bitcoin’s collapse was stronger than the stock market for several reasons. Well, firstly, the correlation between the S&amp;P 500 index and Bitcoin reached 1. If earlier Bitcoin was associated as a protective asset and did not have a pronounced correlation, now all markets have started to fall during a mass panic. By the way, you can [check the correlation of your crypto portfolio for free at Holderlab.io](https://holderlab.io/)

# The search for liquidity as the beginning of accelerating the fall of cryptocurrencies

The reasons for the strong current decline in the cryptocurrency market may be due to the fact that stock market traders were looking for liquidity in order to maintain margin requirements. In this case, liquidity was sought in risky assets, those Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies, perhaps some traders went completely into the dollar. This is where the first wave of decline in the cryptocurrency market began.

## Bitmex Margin Trading

The incoming wave from the reduction of positions in Bitcoin from stock market traders has demolished the position of margin traders on Bitmex. As a result, $ 500 million in long positions were liquidated in an hour, and it remains to be seen how many were liquidated for other trading pairs.

&amp;#x200B;

[BitMEX XBTUSD Liquidations data from skew.com](https://preview.redd.it/3jy659f4vum41.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16969cfcf85a834a6bb6f1e6331a79bb41c721b7)

As a result, we saw a drop up to $ 3800. A great lesson for those who trade with leverage.

Another curious fact is that cryptocurrency exchanges do not have mechanisms to stop trading, as we saw in the stock markets when there was a limit down on S&amp;P500.

## Trading Bitcoin Futures on CME

In anticipation of the elimination of margin positions on Bitmex and other crypto exchanges. Starting February 25, there was an active closing of long positions in Bitcoin futures and opening short positions on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Which also influenced the fall of bitcoin as a whole. Cryptocurrency exchange margin traders have become a blast wave for the fall of Bitcoin.

# Cryptocurrency trading strategy in a panic situation

Already today cryptocurrencies are sold at a significant discount, but now we are forced to monitor the dynamics of the S &amp; P500 index and the general news background, which can affect the price of Bitcoin. However, in our opinion, the best moment for the Bitcoin HODL is probably coming. Today we see a good discount before the upcoming halving.

&amp;#x200B;

[Halving zone](https://preview.redd.it/e5y2ndw9vum41.jpg?width=1432&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb14fc53780b159790e651a6bb63dcdd3c661890)

Do not expect the best price, it is almost impossible to catch, if it is possible to place pending orders this is good, today you can slowly buy current prices.

My question is this - if we're reaching a point where the banks have all the power to rewrite policies to recoup their losses, what do we do with cash in daily life?

My plan for the future continues to evolve, but as it stands now, I am wanting to invest in commodities such as silver, and crypto because of its decentralized nature.

""Whoamisoon"" - since that's his username - says he's a ""former beginner in BTC mining"" who returns to his first cryptographic love after a long hiatus.  Very quickly, the members of the forum set up a chain of solidarity and assist them in their quest for lost BTCs. ""Whoamisoon"" finally got access to his old wallet, which contained several Bitcoin forks and 1,000 BTCs that he sold just before the cryptocurrency crash.  A very pretty story, here are the details.

The former miner asks the community how he could move the Bitcoins in the wallet and sell them.  Thanks to the spontaneous help of a few members of the forum during the same day, Whoamisoon will not only realize that their wallet contains 1,000 BTC and a multitude of Bitcoin forks, but in addition to achieve it!

The estimated total timeframe is 3 days to complete, but as far as I know I get allocated the BTC equivalent to my winnings at the START of the process. Is 3 days enough time to see a serious loss? Thank you all.",1584574424,10,1

""FED printed x-time the MC of BTC just over night"". ""Stockmarket/Gold crashed x-times the MC of BTC in one hour"".
Of course that shows us how much more there is left for Btc to grow.

But what happens if banks or governments finally come to realize how great bitcoin is and decide to buy. And I mean a lot. They could raise the price so tremendously high in the matter of days that even the strongest hodler would get weak.
I mean good for the one who can sell, but the whole idea and dream of Btc would just have dissolved before our eyes.

Just checked the market and noticed how the DOW touched 18,9XX today. That’s a 4 year low for the stock market...

If bitcoin hit It’s 4 year low today, we’d be trading BTC at roughly $400-$420.

For me, the average Joe with no expertise in economic, finance, banking or trading; I’d say it sounds like bitcoin is a much better investment than the general market of my country(US). 

You’d break even on your bets that the stock market wouldn’t get hit super hard four years ago. If you had chose BTC as your sole investment you’d still have 10-11x your investment as of today. If you didn’t touch a penny.

The amount I had on the exchanged happened to just exit its trade hold otherwise it would have been in my hardware wallet. MY phone carrier was AT&amp;T and their gross incompetence allowed this individual to obtain my phone number and two factors to get through my account.

I  dont want to put coinjoin or wasabi into this, but if I tried to do  some internal transactions inside electrum with coincontrol, avoid  patterns, etc. can the exchange still know just looking in the  blockchain or with blockchain tool that  the same wallet/electrum is  still being used? Is there more metadata beyond what we see in blockchain like version, time lock? Can the be same wallet be associate by hash, signature, etc?

SCENE 1 : The curtain opens: China becomes ill, enters a ""crisis"" and paralyzes its trade. The curtain closes.

SCENE II. The curtain opens: The Chinese currency is devalued. They do not do anything. The curtain closes.

SCENE III. The curtain opens:: Due to the lack of trade of companies from Europe and the USA that are based in China, their shares fall 40% of their value.

SCENE IV. The curtain opens:: The world is ill, China buys 30% of the shares of companies in Europe and the US at a very low price. The curtain closes.

SCENE V. The curtain opens: China has controlled the disease and owns companies in Europe and the US. And he decides that these companies stay in China and earn $ 20,000Billions. The curtain closes. How is the play called?

SCENE VI: Checkmate!

ReAmazing but true

Two videos have passed between yesterday and today that convinced me of something I suspected, but had no basis. It was just my speculation. Now I am convinced that the coronavirus was purposely propagated by the Chinese themselves.
At first they were too prepared. Three weeks after the start of the roll, 14 days and a 12,000-bed hospitals were already under construction. And they really built them in two weeks. Awesome.
Yesterday they announced that they had stopped the epidemic. They appear in videos celebrating, they announce that they even have a vaccine. How could they create it so quickly without having all the genetic information? Well if you are the owner of the formula it is not difficult at all.
And today I just saw a video that explains how Den Xiao Ping gave the west a half stick. Due to the coronavirus, the actions of Western companies in China fell dramatically. China I just hope, when they went down enough they bought them. Now the companies,
Created by the USA and Europe in China with all the technology put in by these exchanges and their capital they passed into the hands of China, which is now rising with all that technological potential and will be able to set prices at will to sell everything they need to the West. How are you?
None of this could have happened by chance. China who cared that a few old men died? Fewer old-age pensions to pay, but the loot has been huge. And right now the West is financially defeated, in crisis and stunned by the disease. And without knowing what to do.
Masterfully diabolic. It had to be the communists. |

Adding to this, they are now the single largest owners of US treasury with 1.18 trillion holding surpassing Japan.
An instrument that has seen the most rally

One ☝ prospective &amp; Analogy....

How come Russia &amp; North Korea are totally free of Covid- 19? Because they are staunch ally of China. Not a single case reported from this 2 countries. On the other hand South Korea / United Kingdom / Italy / Spain and Asia are severely hit. How come Wuhan is suddenly free from the deadly virus? China will say that their drastic initial measures they took was very stern and Wuhan was locked down to contain the spread to other areas. Why Beijing was not hit? Why only Wuhan? Kind of interesting to ponder upon.. right? Well ..Wuhan is open for business now. America and all the above mentioned countries are devastated financially. Soon American economy will collapse as planned by China. China knows it CANNOT defeat America militarily as USA is at present THE MOST POWERFUL country in the world. So use the virus...to cripple the economy and paralyse the nation and its Defense capabilities. I'm sure Nancy Pelosi got a part in this. . to topple Trump. Lately President Trump was always telling of how GREAT American economy was improving in all fronts. The only way to destroy his vision of making AMERICA GREAT AGAIN is to create an economic havoc. Nancy Pelosi was unable to bring down Trump thru impeachment. ....so work along with China to destroy Trump by releasing a virus. Wuhan,s epidemic was a showcase. At the peak of the virus epidemic. ..China's President Xi Jinping...just wore a simple RM1 facemask to visit those effected areas. As President he should be covered from head to toe.....but it was not the case. He was already injected to resist any harm from the virus....that means a cure was already in place before the virus was released. Some may ask....Bill Gates already predicted the outbreak in 2015...so the chinese agenda cannot be true. The answer is. ..YES...Bill Gates did predict. .but that prediction is based on a genuine virus outbreak. Now China is also telling that the virus was predicted well in advance. ....so that its agenda would play along well to match that prediction. China,s vision is to control the World economy by buying up stocks now from countries facing the brink of severe ECONOMIC COLLAPSE. Later China will announce that their Medical Researchers have found a cure to destroy the virus. Now China have other countries stocks in their arsenal and these countries will soon be slave to their master...CHINA.Now here is an interesting conspiracy theory if you want:
Impact of coronavirus on stock exchanges worldwide, within 1 month:

🇺🇸 -26%
🇬🇧 -26%
🇨🇦 -25%
🇧🇷 -27%
🇷🇺 -20%
🇦🇪 -19%
🇿🇦 -16%
🇦🇺 -24%
🇮🇳 -14%
🇸🇬 -17%
🇭🇰 -12%
🇰🇷 - 17%

Now, look at this:

🇨🇳 (China) + 0,3%

China, creator of the pandemic, has miraculously ""recovered"", has almost no more cases of coronavirus. The world is now beginning to feel the effects and panic about the disease. Who recovered first ?? China itself! It seems to be that this virus was a move by the Chinese government in response to the loss of the trade war with the United States. The goal: to throw the world into recession !!!

Is the scenario not clear? They are already growing! China bought almost everything it devalued on the stock exchanges around the world ... with that the Chinese became owners of the global companies that are in China and without the money leaving China.",1585098945,8,1

The asset will surely never die and I still believe it will eventually go to 1M. But be very careful, right now you should only buy if you have money to pay the your bills for at least 3 months I would say. It’s the minimum. Look at the numbers please, everyone it’s so sure it will not drop hard and everything it’s fine now but it’s not. I remember just last week I was commenting that Italy was out of control at 400 each deaths in 24 hours. Now the country by my side it’s also at 500+ deaths per day and Italy keeps rising it’s at 800. Will most likely hit 1000. The US is now the country with the fastest spreading rate, will be hit hard, I would not find weird 2000 deaths per day really soon on the US. People will go from afraid to terrified. More places will be quarantined and people will lose their jobs. At that point I don’t see how BTC will not drop. And I mean drop hard. My 2 cents for you is, look at your situation, but truthfully, assume you will lose your job and the pandemic will keep getting worst for 3 months, if you can sustain your family for that amount of time and you still have plenty then after that plenty you will have the spare money, with that you buy BTC if you wish, this way you will ensure you don’t have to sell your bitcoins and everything will be fine.

What if that is not met? Rbe acenario I see is that more and more miners will leave the network, causing delays in transactions processing, causing less rrliable network etc. i. e doom and gloom.

When I think about how to balance security and convenience I quickly become overwhelmed. I have several questions that I've been unable to resolve for myself.

* How many separate bank accounts should I have? For example, I want to open an account on an exchange like coinbase and I want to open an account on localbitcoins. Should I have two separate bank accounts for these?
* How many phone numbers or phones should I have? Using the previous point, should I have one phone for dealing with the exchange and an entirely different one for localbitcoins? Related to this, should I have a different phone number on each bank account than the one I give to both the exchange and localbitcoins?

For example:

bank account 1, phone #1

bank account 2, phone #2

exchange account, phone #3

localbitcoins, phone #4

1. Agree to meet in a public place (I guess during quarantine that will have to be a grocery store parking lot?)
2. Move the btc to a new wallet on my phone
3. Ask for 25% cash and agree to send 25% agreed upon btc to his wallet. Count money while txn processes

fqg2os,some_dadaism,What price of bitcoin is needed to maintain the network safety.,"Hi, I am a newbie with very basic understanding of Bitcoin. What I understand roughly:

Bitcoin transaction are secured by blocks.
Blocks need to be mined with much compute.
If there are too few different miners the security of the network goes down.
Miners are rewarded with Bitcoin.
To limit the amount of Bitcoin the Bitcoin reward for mining is halved every so and so often. 

My question: 
What I understand it is possible for Bitcoin to increase in value significantly. At the same time Bitcoin is only safe while we have enough miners. With the continued halving of the rewards could the decline in miners compromise the safety of Bitcoin?
Has anyone ever done the math with mining capacity of GPU ect. and can tell what minimal USD value Bitcoin needs to hold in the long run (after many halvings) to keep the network safe by financing the mining effort?",1585383171,69,1

One day or the other, the **Coinbase** DeFi mafia will not be able to buy back the coins, because the price went unexpectedly up instead of going down. At that point, the **Coinbase** DeFi app will simply file for bankruptcy.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a lot of bitcoin out there, \~18 million BTC. There's \~3 million bitcoin to go and until all bitcoin is mined, the value of bitcoin is just going to rise. 

Along with this, due to more future halvings, the hashes getting harder / needing more power, and less (possible) return on mining, my theory as time goes on is that only very few, or one, bitcoin mining companies will have control of the mining and have a sort of a monopoly on the rest of \~3 million bitcoin. 

Do you guys think this somewhat theoretical or possible? Is it dependent on the value of bitcoin for investing to mine and get returns?

 I just want to know what other people think about the hash rate dropping along with there being less and less miners as time goes on.

So we have a group where people could buy and sell bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, people simply post B/S with the amounts they desire, and other people respond if they're interested, in 90% of the cases they meet in person.  


I'm actually one of those who have built and raised that group, so I've been there from the start.  
Usually you'll see people selling 1-5% down off the price, and to see people selling with premiums is very unlikely, last time I've seen people selling with premiums was back in 2017 when bitcoin rallied all the way from 6k to 19k.  
And this came back after the last drop, for the first time after 2017, this has inverted, people are selling with premiums on the price and buyer agrees to pay higher price for BTC.  


I find this very interesting and can't wait for halving to take place to see what will happen then, when the supply will be even lower.  


A little bit offtopic but HODL guys.. you've got into this business for a reason, this isn't the time to quit, the events were going through right now will be historical and will be remembered for many years, there are so many upcoming news in the economy and you really don't want to miss out, because this is what bitcoin was created against, bitcoin was created after the housing market crash, its was created to provide people different monetary policy and something that people can trust to keep their savings safe from its supply manipulation, this is the time Satoshi have been waiting for since he/them created bitcoin, this is the real test.

&amp;#x200B;

**How did a book about crowds get you into a cryptocurrency?**

The book begins story about the French bank failure in the 1700's. After a switch to fiat currency, the masses poured money into bad investments instead of saving. Sound familiar? Crowd mentality ensured that people kept investing even though most knew the investments were bad. The bank printed more un-backed currency to fund the people's bets.

The bad investments mostly funded the Mississippi company, which speculated on a huge hoard of gold to be found in French America. Sound familiar to many startups speculating on future returns? When the french economy took a post-war downturn, the bank collapsed. Speculation of gold fortunes from the Mississippi Company failed and resulting rippling caused a fiat collapse and freeze of capital. Misery and french depression ensued. Gold and silver returned as the form of currency.

Today, the bad investments are not limited to one large company;

* Corporate and Municipal Bonds
* Corporate Equities with too high debt
* ETFs which capture over-leveraged markets

&amp;#x200B;

So how does the world (not just US) we compare to France in the 1700's?

* Currencies are not backed by metals and central banks print money at their own will. There is a constant threat of inflation. (A tax against savings)
* Savings taxes give incentive to put value in investments. Individuals and groups seek higher returns on these investments than on simple stores of value.
* Bad investments seem good in comparison to long term investments, yet, as long as the capital flows the investments stay good. 401k's to stock pickers are choosing investments that never profit! (See Uber, etc....)

&amp;#x200B;

**So how does BTC hedge against this system?**

Eventually, an event would cause bad investments to fail and cause a huge loss of value in the economy. Fiat will be worthless because the only way out of a market crash is printing more money. Thus causing huge inflation.

* BTC has a mathematical design of value. Supply is decreasing over time value always increases.
* BTC can't be printed as the network decides on rules. No one party can print more.
* BTC can't be regulated in a free market unless you take extreme steps.

&amp;#x200B;

*I really thank this book for leading me into the light. I suggest you read it!*

TLDR:

1. I read [chapter 1 here](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/24518/24518-h/24518-h.htm#miss_scheme) of [Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_Popular_Delusions_and_the_Madness_of_Crowds)
2. I realized the current financial system is not about value and will eventually fail

Those two abrupt declines in volume were caused by the companies Veriblock and Coinbase respectively (I think this is the result of Coinbase batching, correct me if I'm wrong).

Whatever territory you give them, they will take. Veriblock will just spam the blockchain with its useless crap if it's cheap enough. There has to be a fee market, and those who use the blockchain inefficiently must be made to pay until they improve their practices. Otherwise why would they ever bother to do things better?

/u/luke-jr was probably right when he said the block size should actually be decreased. It could have hastened adoption by making running a node easier. But of course, consensus is the name of the game and neither he nor the big-blockers could get it.

NB: Of course, the current limit is more like 4 MWU (million weight units), corresponding in practice to a usual limit of around \~2 MB.",1585625126,28,1

However, I noticed that if you do a wire transfer it’s not only free on binance side but it also only takes only a day. On the flipside, a wire transfer is very expensive ($30 per wire for my bank). Thus, I wanted to see if I could use TransferWise to get a smaller fee on this wire transfer. I’ve used Transferwise before a few times for sending internationally between different currencies. It’s a lot cheaper than regular wires between banks. The advantage they have is they have banks in these countries so they route it through the bank of the recipient country. 

So my question is: would it be cheaper for an entirely domestic transaction? In other words, I’m sending a domestic wire transfer from the US to US binance. So it would seem to reason Transferwise might not have an advantage in this case because it’s all domestic anyways, but I’m curious if anyone else has tried this to get a cheaper wire transfer fee.",1585623684,5,1

There will be more and more of these ""underground"" services, especially in areas where doing so (even if it is just resuming what they did before) equals survival.   Because these ""underground"" businesses are unable to use the banks, they will gravitate towards bitcoin -- as both a store of value, and as a medium of exchange -- especially for payment that cannot be done locally, with cash.

This is not just going to be true in Nigeria and Venezuela (using an example of two countries where bitcoin already has gained the most significant levels of traction, on a per-capita basis), but in every country that continues heavy lockdown policies.

American household combined wealth was worth well over 120 trillion dollars during the peak. Now have fallen before 100 trillion mark. With such large amount of on money disappearing throughout US and the world, that be be deflation, not inflation?  So might not be so great for bitcoin?

Also, most of the investors are retail, if you watch bitcoin prices, it's usually the strongest near the beginning of the month as the working salary person gets paid. This virus situation really puts a damper in prices. How many of you guys are putting money into crypto? People will be selling off cryptos just to survive. As a self-employed person in advertising, I used to earn about 15k to 20k+ a month and put more than half into crypto every month. But now, with most of my customers closing stores and basically non-existant of paying customers, I am living off my savings with my girlfriend. My girlfriend resell high end handbags, we hope the stimulus package would maybe help her clear some inventory, but I think there will be deflation, not inflation of prices on our handbags.  

I think what would happen, is that after the economy craters completely, and maybe at least 2 years of prices falling then we can see hyperinflation, and final destruction of dollar.

fbv2jd,RIX2020,"**Bitcoin, I need to talk to you**","Dear Bitcoin.... We need to talk

## Oh, Bitcoin...

You were the **one**. The *only* one! When you came along, you changed the world. You demarked a new era in history. By the time I met you, you were still a child. You had siblings, for sure (Litecoin, Namecoin, Peercoin), but - for me and most - it was all about you. I joined a tight-knit community - a bunch of computer nerds and liberty zealots with dreams of fixing money (and our fortunes). You had enraptured me! You combined everthing I cared about into one elegant solution. Though you were tiny, your footprint was large.

We felt a tremendous sense of responsibility back then. We needed to *prove* that something like this could work. That you could be adopted. *That you were not a scam.* We tested everything. We questioned much. We made it our personal mission to spread the word; to get you running on new platforms and place you into new hands. We felt as if we were *so close* to a free-market, home-grown solution to the decay brought on by banks and their monetary debauchery. It was very exciting!

And, it worked! *You* worked! You still work (as well as you were designed). You are still leading the charge for monetary freedom, and you are the reserve currency of the crypto ecosystem. Your open design and (relatively) extensive infrastructure make you easy to adopt, and easy to understand. You are essential for teaching the concept and proving the idea.

## But...

You are no longer my idol. You no longer excite my passions. Though you have changed so little, I have changed too much. Your transparency - which has, thus far, been essential to your success - is now your greatest failing. You tell everyone and everything what we do together, everytime we do it! While I will still hodl you in private, I cannot be seen with you in public.

Monero is the one for me now. I know you know her well. She's long been present - always in the background, always improving. She's not nearly as experienced, nor as important, but she also doesn't talk even a fraction as much (no offense).

She has many challenges to overcome. She may yet disappoint me. ...but the spark is there - the community spirit she carries reminds me of you. The dream of individual autonomy - at least in financial affairs - is still alive with her. She is still willing to adapt herself to that goal. Some would even call her fun^gible to be with.

..........

You are a big part of me, and you always will be. I know you will still be around, still on top, still the center of attention. That's okay. I wish you all the best, all the success in the world. You are amazing in what you do, and you will keep on doing it! It makes me sad to split apart, but... I know we must pursue our own paths, now, towards that vision of a better future that once made us whole.

*Love,*

I'm still kind of a newbie here, saw lots of posts saying indubitably that Bitcoin will go to the moon which I'd love. 

But, why and how ? What are the main reasons for Bitcoin's price to rise ?
 I mean, except the halving thing which I understood, I can't find people explaining why !
And I find it other worse for Ethereum : according to what I understood, the smart contracts don't need to buy Ethereum except a few gas, so I don't see the link between the mass adoption of Ethereum smart contracts and Ethereum price's rise. At the opposite, I'd believe that if the Ethereum price rises, it would avoid a massive adoption because the transaction fees would be higher and higher !

Can you please help me guys ?

fckdof,jeddyconstant,The Compumatrix Scam - How they do it and get away with it?," First they give you points then Compuceeds which you can trade for their (fake) bitcoin for doing stuff for them. Then they turn it into what they call Compumatrix.btc when you pay them more ""bts"" to ""Claim"" it to your DEX (personal exchange account) but then tell you you must convert it to real bitcoin using their TradeCeeds company. But Tradeceeds continues to make excuses about things like being blocked by Chinese exchange rules etc.. and have no real address or website. Just some ""flunky"" developers.  


To convert your coin you must qualify by buying some of their devalued  crypto with your good bitcoin and bts (Bitshare's coin) to do it. Constant fees and stalling because of Beta testing, typhoons in the Philippines and numerous other upgrade and Bitshares update delays has put the few thousand members into silent crazy mode.  


Mad or not they only answer the questions they want to with files of ""How tos"" and have brainwashed staff  running the chats who threaten to kick you out if you get to inquisative and if you misbehave they will bad mouth you and threaten to kick you out.  


And that's just the overview and doesn't cover the multiple times they already have promised things like store items for ridiculous prices at the beginning which most people lost their shipping charges, Bitcoin “Fork” earnings,  5 to 1 deals which they stole millions of our crypto and never paid back, investment money in shares of the company, Christmas bitcoin Blessings they promised but oh they can't send you money, bitcoin or anything but wait you can send them money, Trigger Smart contract deals which you had to buy their BTCPLUS coins by the hundreds which supposedly give returns of millions of dollars, etc..  


Ask any member if they (in over 15 years) have ever withdrawn anything to fiat that would put bread on your table and now after they have driven the coin values down to pennies they say we can't withdraw until their values go up to what the outside exchanges have! 

From top to bottom are David Morris - President, Henry J. Banayat - Founder and Head Developer in the Philippines, Gail Storm VP, Erline Martin COO and dozens of Regional Reps all over the world. There is a remote office now in Las Vegas and another somewhere in Iowa but they have not given its exact location or address.  


Pass the word about these guys and their scamming Bitshares Ecosystem. Henry the Scammer, their God and all his followers are nothing but common criminals using a new Bitshares Blockchain application to rip off thousands of people ! 

Don't be fooled and join this so called business. Ask any member if what I say here is not true!  Now how do they get away with this? First the Bitshares system allows them to monitor and control your Exchange account thru permissions and [Crytofresh.com](https://Crytofresh.com) and their own application ""Portal""  now called your CDAP. Also thru their Discord chat and forums. No staff give out their real names or contact information either.

fcjijn,possibility12,"I just don’t foresee mass adoption of bitcoin. When the federal bank started issuing paper money in the United States, many people were outright distrustful of it. People were","... counterfeiting the paper notes all the time. Different types of notes were used (in ways comparable to alt coins) and it was decidedly difficult for commoners to evaluate their currency with confidence. Eventually it got to the point where congress-issued paper notes were “not worth a Continental” a commonplace term. 

I’m not a historian, but I know some presidents were even elected, in part, on the basis that they would sort out the financial system (Andrew Jackson) who fought for the “common man.” 

I compare investing in bitcoin now to buying paper money - at the fraction of its stated value - with more “trustworthy” gold during the early 19th century, hoping one day it will be an easily verifiable, stable form of currency. But hardly anyone did that, and even if they did in the early stages, the currency evolved to the point where the form they bought wasn’t even worth anything. 

Only when the government took action and backed the notes with their power and authority (which rules over the immediate, every day lives of the common man) did people start accepting and exchanging paper money with confidence.  

The government redefined united states notes as “legal tender”—bills that were legally required to be accepted when presented in payments.  And not accepting was punishable by law. 

Until this happens and the government backs a particular digital currency as the de facto solution - I don’t see the general population or the common man taking to bitcoin the way it would need to happen. In order for something decentralized to take precedent, billions would have to come to a consensus or the authorities where those billions shop, retailers, institutes etc. 

Right now and for the last decade there has been a positive movement in forming that consensus, by educated tech savy individuals. But what happens when the pendulum swings back and the normal people don’t adopt. I fear many of the forward thinking people of bitcoin might be willing to give up the ground they took and the price will drop, big time.

On the other hand, if bitcoin did dig its feet into the ground and it eventually functioned as an everyday currency, it would have the potential to flip the entire wealth pyramid on its head. Essentially, smart, forward-minded (potentially poor) people could be become immensely wealthy just by buying one bitcoin early in its run. A wealthy man’s 250k could in essence be equal to a poor mans 3k in early 2017. I cant see the people in power or the wealthy enforcing that paradigm, and thats what history has shown us needs to happen. Authoritative enforcement. Maybe the internet (global community) is that authority. But there are still too many voices on the internet that look to the gov’t for the rules.

Im not trying to offend anyone. Im just ruminating on paper. I want bitcoin to be successful, I just cant circumnavigate this idea in my mind. Genuinely curious about counter positions. Thanks for your time! And enjoy your day. And remember, there are way more important things than money! Im reminding myself not you guys  😂 😓",1583185171,14,1

They will choke on our innovation that will be forced down their conniving gullets.

Their efforts are nihil. Our will is invincible. Banks will rape and pillage no more. There is no way for them to implement these solutions because they are too distracted with their foolish ability to make profits.

What they lack is where we are strong. We are the stone that takes down Goliath. The spear that blinds the cyclops. Yes, gentleman, we are the silver bullet.

Financial infrastructure will fall bruised and bloody as we assume our electronic battle station desks and assembled a true economic system. Your efforts spent with your weaponized mechanical keyboards will NEVER go unnoticed.

Banks will die in their sleep, poisoned by their own drowsy practices, succumbing to their exploitative wet dreams until it turns into our night terror.

fch88a,bswen,Ten Million Bitcoiners: The Intransigent Minority,"Drawing on Taleb's idea of the [Dictatorship of the Minority](https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15) \- this post does the math on how much more adoption we need for Bitcoin to have a viable intransigent minority - a force that can [tip the scales toward mass adoption](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/ten-million-bitcoiners-the-intransigent-minority). 

&gt;For most observed complex systems, the minority contin­gent required to flip a popula­tion to comply with their intran­si­gent view is in the  3 – 4% range.  With a U.S. popula­tion of 325 million, 3% is 10 million.  
&gt;  
&gt;A fintech fund that’s been in the Bitcoin space since 2012 recently ran intense analysis resulting in the best estimate I’ve seen for  Bitcoin owner­ship.  Just 7 million people globally are storing $100 of value or more in the Bitcoin protocol.  For round numbers, let’s assume half of those people are in the U.S., and that one-seventh of those are above a more signif­i­cant threshold like $2500.  That’s just 500,000  U.S. citizens with a meaningful amount of Bitcoin.  And of those, what percentage actually under­stand and care about Bitcoin to the point where they would fight for it?  Let’s be generous and say 20%.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are approx­i­mately 100,000 Bitcoiners in the United States.  This means that *just to get to “intran­si­gent minority” levels*, we need a 100x increase.  This is why adoption dominates all other prior­i­ties for Bitcoin.",1583176511,22,1

Once I see this message, I quickly remove this user from my session. Without further thinking, I just ignore it and continue using my phone.

Until, the 12th of February, things got really ugly. Someone has been trying to login my telegram again. And so, I deleted my telegram account and created a new one but with the same phone number. I thought everything will be just fine, until on the 13th of February, my ""Luno"" account got hacked while I was asleep in the middle of the night around 5am +8 GST. This is where things got really ugly.

The password for my Luno account got changed and it also seems that the hacker is able to access my email account because I receive this one time sign in code below.

And of course I did not act immediately as I was still sleeping. I was shocked when I open up my Luno app, my balance/total amount gone to ""0""! I did not know what to do, so I called up customer service and they say will let me know the next day. But the next day when they call me back, they say they can't do anything as all my BTC, ETH and BCH has already been transferred to another wallet which is not associate my any Luno account.

Transaction as below.

I know, the chances of me getting back all my fund is very very slim. However, I'm just hoping someone could tell me, how did the hacker is able to get into my email, my telegram and my Luno account. Did my phone got hacked? Is that even possible? Could someone take control of my phone and see everything inside it? I've format my phone hoping it won't happen again in future. Or could that hacker cloned my sim card? I'm lost here. I've no idea what and how the hacker got all my information.

And if I'm lucky enough, someone who recognizes those addresses and could help me to find that person. Hope that he/she can return those coins back to me, those are my hard work and savings.

🎶""I don't like Mondays tell me more""🎶,

Ok! It should be crystal clear even to the most subservient minion, that this is more than a touch of FLU 🤒 and we appear to be in, the beginning of a Pandemic 😷

I know your illustrious leaders and the Orange man said not to worry, even those at the ""WHO"" said it was just a wee contagion... but the BATCat is out of the bag, and Captain Trips is not playing.

So i hope you have been ""Stacking $ats"" I really do! remember every little helps. In fact that smoke you see rising in the distance is the Legacy Stock Market

In addition to ""Stacking $ats"" had to get a few more provisions in before the rush starts 🛒🛒.

The Central Banks &amp; FED's only option will be to print and pump trillions of FIAT, in an attempt to stimulate the reality of what you can all see.

The buy pressure for Bitcoin is acute, and the exchanges cannot suppress the ""Honey Badger"" much longer.

I won't tell you in this post what will happen in consequence to the printing ""too long"" , all i can say is ""Stack some more $ats"" and ""Beware the Ides of March""

""Remember"" The Corona Virus lingers on the surface of cash coins/notes .......don't touch money or ATM keyboards without gloves.

There isn’t any authority looking over these whales to make sure they are acting morally or in your best interest. There is zero consequences for manipulating the price. What’s stopping them? 

Much bigger financial scams involving more people have been orchestrated in the past for much less money involved in bitcoin.

I've used BitPay as a wallet (mind you I'm an individual, not a company looking to accept Bitcoin payments) for a year now, and I never had any issues. Actually after trying a few wallets over the past 4-5 years, it's the one I've liked the most so far.  


From what I can understand, it's BitPay's practice of limiting its payment processing to BitPay only wallets, which I do agree can be very annoying to force users to pay with their wallet instead of their own, and that goes against the whole ""Ideology""/""Point"" of Bitcoin. However, I heard they're currently transitioning to accepting payments from any wallet since February (and when you actually are paying from a bitpay wallet, it is quite convenient to have everything \*just work\*).  


A part from that, the wallet UI is nice (on mobile), easy to use, the giftcard and credit card options I find are very convenient, transitioning to and from another wallet is also an easy process in my experience. When I had issues with something, the BitPay staff were always reactive and helpful. So I don't quite understand why they're so hated on this subreddit. They're the closest thing I've experienced to using Bitcoin as an actual mainstream currency that's just as easy to use as opposed to the very dodgy and more complicated alternatives which I was acustomed to and I've had numerous bad experiences with over the past 5 years I've been involved with Bitcoin.  


So is it just a bad experience on the Business side of things (that I am not involved in), is there more than the one example above? What's so terrible about it that should make me move to another wallet?",1583624002,7,1

ff3e4v,Discounted_,(New?) Way of scaling decentralized payments,"First off, I want to say it's not like I'm some Satoshi Nakamoto, this is just a shower thought..

So we all know Bitcoin transactions became very inefficient throughout time, it wasn't always as slow and expensive as it has now become. What I was thinking about, what if instead of one single Bitcoin blockchain, there were 10 different chains, each with 2.1M bitcoin, people can choose in which chain they want to have their coins ofcourse, but these would be the 10 Bitcoin chains. This way transactions are not all stressed under one chain and speeds and transactions fees should (this is where I could be wrong) go back to early bitcoin days. 

It's almost like with internet connections, people can choose routing channels, which ones are the fastest at the moment.

Ofcourse all of this would be developed in an ease of use way, think of the current best performing blockchain being used for the transactions, amounts from across the blockchains being combined and displayed in front-end etc. There would always be settings for people to get maximum performance though just like how techies can mess around with local internet DNS and IP settings for better performance.

Same for miners too, they can choose the concurrent most profitable chain of the 10, or whatever number proves to be the sweet spot for the most scalable network of chains. 10 is just a random number to give an example.

 I could totally be wrong ofcourse, as I said, I'm not experienced in anything about cryptography. Let me know what you guys think.

Someone on BTC Talk referred me to Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), it was a pretty interesting read.",1583622870,11,1

ff2v7c,r3310,Governments CAN kill Bitcoin- they just don't care,"I understand that my opinion is probably an unpopular one, so I expect a ton of downvotes.

Let's imagine a perfect scenario- everyone knows for Bitcoin, volume is high, people are spending it and/ or stacking sats. Now, this is **not** a good thing for govs, reasons were mentioned thousands of times on the internet so I will not bother about mentioning all of that again. How to kill Bitcoin, you may ask? Declare it illegal, start the propaganda machine, prosecute people who are mining or using it, shut down mining farms under the accusation of supporting the system that is used by criminals- add a bit of human trafficking, drug dealing and money laundering to the headlines to make it look justifiable in the eyes of average Joe. After all of that, hashing power will probably go to 20% of what is now. Next step, seize the ASICS and conduct a 51% attack. Congrats, no more BTC. You may say that your rights are hurt, but CCP (Communist Party of China) doesn't give a fuck.

There is a cryptocurrency that could survive a ""mass extinction"" of that kind. It's called [Idena](https://idena.io/) and it's **truly** unstoppable. It's using a novel protocol called ""Proof of Person"". In order to mine it, you must prove (validate) that you are actually a human being, all **without** 3rd party or personally identifiable documents (aka KYC). How to prove that you're actually a human being? Currently, validation days happen a few times a month, and validations start at the same time all over the globe- New York is at 9:30AM, Berlin is at 3:30PM and Sydney is at 11:30PM. Validations involve solving a user-made flips- flips are user made captchas that are impossible to solve by machines- because they involve abstract thinking and emotions, which only humans have. Incentive to make flips is simple- to validate on next validation day you must make 3 flips which will be randomly distributed to other users on the next validation day. Idena introduces sybil resistance by limiting the time of validations, you can validate yourself on one node, it's almost impossible for one person to have two nodes. All mining rewards are split equally to every miner, so there is no concentration of hashing power, mining farms are impossible and stopping/ censoring is **impossible** because Idena can work on any 64bit OS- Windows, Linux, MacOS and even Raspberry Pi- Computing power is irrelevant and it will be irrelevant forever! To stop Idena, governments must ban computers, from all people who are running this most decentralized and democratic currency on the globe! Sounds like an impossible task to me.

ff2kjl,Robot1775N14250E,Need Help Understanding A Few Things,"Ok so from my knowledge I understand that miners can create new Bitcoins by utilizing processing power to complete complex mathematical calculations which rewards the miners with Bitcoins and adds new coins to the float? And I believe the new miners coins can only be able to be circulated if the miners use the Bitcoins to make a transaction? 

Also, when someone buys a Bitcoin from someone else, who isn’t a miner, or simply pays for something with Bitcoin, my understanding is that a POF has to be completed in order for the blockchain to be settled and verified? But are miners also completing the POF for these P2P transactions and receiving a reward in Bitcoins for the POF as well?

Am I on the right track that complex mathematical calculations need to be performed to create new Bitcoins but also need to completed to verify transactions which also provides a reward of a Bitcoin? I guess my confusion stems from my understanding that miners could technically mine new Bitcoins but never sell them or use them to pay for anything, potentially leading to a hoarding of Bitcoins so that no coins circulate, causing a barrier to entry of new investors who aren’t miners.

I know I’m confused and missing something so set me straight friends of Crypto!",1583619418,18,1

ff2bjc,SufficientRadio,Proof of Drinks: An Open-Source Bitcoin Drinking Game,"*I’ve developed a new game that is played P2P…*

**Proof of Drinks: An Open-Source Bitcoin Drinking Game**

GAME RULES

Player Types:
+ The Market
	1. Includes Drinkers, Buyers, and Sellers
	2. Anyone within The Market may play any of the aforementioned roles at any time.
	3. Manages BITCOIN PROTOCOL
		- Block Reward (frequency, amount, halving)
		- Die Rolls
		- Drink Pour
+ The Bartender
	1. Acts autonomously; is not included within The Market.
	2. Sells glasses and drinks to Drinkers.
	3. Manages PRICE LIST OF GOODS
		- Glasses (fiat/glass)
		- Drinks (fiat/oz.)
+ The Government
	1. Acts autonomously; is not included within The Market.
	2. Manages MONETARY POLICY
		- Inflation Rate
		- Circulating Supply of Fiat

Items needed:
1. Copies of GAME RULES, BITCOIN PROTOCOL, PRICE LIST OF GOODS, and MONETARY POLICY.
2. One six-sided die.
3. A number of six-ounce measuring glasses equal to the number of players within The Market.
4. Drinks (alcoholic or otherwise).
5. Fiat money (or Monopoly money).
6. Minimum 6 players or so.

Object of the Game:
1. To learn the mechanics of bitcoin and the economy through drinking and having fun.
2. The game ends when one or more of the following conditions are met:
	- You run out of drinks.
	- Everyone is tired of drinking.
	- Everyone is tired of playing.
3. At the end of the game, the person with the highest net worth (fiat + bitcoin) is deemed The Winner.

General Rules and Definitions:
1. All die rolls are performed in front of all participants.
2. Bathroom breaks are permitted, however gameplay continues. If a Drinker is in the bathroom during their round, their round is forfeited.
3. Anyone within The Market may buy and sell anything at anytime.
4. Round: The procedure for drinking; may or may not result in the production of bitcoin.
5. Block: A round that results in the production of bitcoin.
6. Anyone within The Market can propose a change to any rule at any time.
	- If everyone agrees, game play continues with the new rule.
	- If no one agrees, the person who proposed the change may continue playing or quit the game.
	- If some, but not all, agree, then the game may be forked into two separate games (Note: this may cause hurt feelings). The Government and The Bartender tend to both games.
7. All values (bitcoin, block reward, fiat, etc) are to be rounded to the nearest whole number.

Analogies:
1. Drinkers = Miners
2. Glasses = Mining equipment
3. Drinking = Proof of Work
4. Die roll after drinking = Mining for the nonce
5. Drink pour = Difficulty
6. Bathroom break = Mining equipment maintenance
7. All drinks and die rolls observed by everyone = Nodes validating

Game Setup:
1. Designate a minimum of one player to be The Government.
2. Designate a minimum of one player to be The Bartender.
3. All other players (minimum 2? 3? 4?) are collectively The Market.
4. The Government gives The Bartender and everyone within The Market ___ dollars each.
5. For the first round, everyone within The Market is a Drinker (in subsequent rounds, anyone can step in our step out of the Drinker role).
6. All Drinkers claim a chair around a table.
7. All Drinkers purchase a glass from The Bartender at ___ dollars per glass. (Use a 6 oz. measuring glass for ease of pour.)
8. All Drinkers roll a die; the Drinker with the highest number goes first. Subsequent rounds proceed clockwise.
9. The Bartender determines the initial Cost of Drinking (fiat/drink).

Round Procedure:
1. Determine the Nonce
- Someone in The Market rolls a die. The number rolled is the Nonce for the Block.
2. Determine the Pour
- Someone, other than the Drinker for this round, rolls a die. The number rolled equals the amount of drink poured (e.g., a roll of “3” means 3 ounces is poured into the Drinker’s glass).
3. The Drinker drinks the pour, then, once The Market has collectively determined the glass is free of liquid, the Drinker rolls a die. All participants in The Market verify the die roll.
- If the die matches the Nonce, the Drinker receives the Block Reward! It is now the next Drinker’s turn, beginning again with Step 1 above.
- If the die does not match the Nonce, no Block Reward is granted. It is now the next Drinker’s turn, beginning with Step 2 above.
4. Every 10 Blocks, the Block Reward is cut in half.
5. Once all Drinkers have completed a Round, The Government determines a new Inflation Rate and inflates the Circulating Supply of Fiat accordingly.
- The Government rolls a die in another room then comes out and announces the result of the die roll. The number of the result is the inflation rate (e.g., if the roll is “3” the inflation rate is 3%).
- The Government multiplies the Circulating Supply of Fiat by the Inflation Rate and adds this amount to the Circulating Supply of Fiat. The Government can do anything it wants with the fiat created.
6. The value of each bitcoin (fiat/bitcoin) is determined by members of The Market.
- For the determination of the Winner at the end of the game, the final value of bitcoin is the last value at which it traded.",1583618391,4,1

I have no idea how to do this.  I hear there are machines where you can put in cash and it adds to your bitcoin account but don't want to have to go through a huge hassle setting up accounts (One wanted a scan of my drivers license, nope) just for $50 that I am going to spend and never use BitCoin again as far as I know (only had this one site require it in the last 5-6 years).

Obviously Id prefer to meet up and use my laptop to log into the site to put in what ever the BitCoin info/number to complete the transaction is.  It's only $50, but I value my account on the site that is hard to get into more than the $50.

It says they take BitCoin or BitCoinCash.

Please PM me.  Id be willing to tip $20 for your help if we meet in person to do the 'deed'.

Im just too old and conservative to get into BitCoin and want to get more than 10 things off the website a day as a 'guest' member.

fez43t,OtheDreamer,The macroeconomic appeal of BTC's lower relative volatility to the USD,"I truthfully haven't bought any BTC yet, but I think if I were to it would be soon. Hopefully the prices drop a little bit further, I'd be a buyer at $5k. If prices go above $9.5 I'd probably start investing too because it would mean what I'm about to say has come to be realized by investors. 

From a macroeconomic standpoint, having a currency that is able to grow independently from any single nation's economy while simultaneously be liquid enough to transfer to any other type of currency...just makes business sense for investors. It's only a matter of time now. 

I've predicted the major fall in BTC price when everybody was saying ""Buy and HodL!!"" because my concerns were not due to the currency itself...but due to how it was synonymous with criminal activity. BTC was artifically pumped up using darkweb cleaners until ~2018. At that time dark web operations slowed down, and big moneys stopped being transferred...which obviously (I think) was a huge component in the cryptocrash of 2018. 

This time it's different. The U.S. is full speed ahead in a recession. As the dollar falls, so too will global prices fall in general. This should include BTC (which is why I'm hoping it goes down to $5k honestly)

**Here's the difference**

I think investors will finally see after this recession that it makes more sense to have a currency that is not so ""chained"" to the USD. In otherwords, if the US economy / US money becomes super volatile (like right now with the stock markets) then it should mean that BTC is relatively less volatile. 

When investors realize it's less volatile than national currencies, it becomes infinitely more appealing.

Somebody please tell me if I'm wrong. My reasoning has nothing to do with the actual security of blockchain technologies...but to do with investor feelings on a macroeconomic scale.",1583605462,24,1

Tomorrow (Thursday) is the [first liquidity day of the month](https://twitter.com/bisq_network/status/1234927798248034304), with subsequent liquidity days every Thursday throughout the month.

Each week, we're hoping to build on the previous week's success and end March in a strong way. February was nearly a record-setting month for Bisq, so there's already strong momentum for March to be even better.

**You're highly encouraged to post offers tomorrow!** Not only would it be good for the network, but probably for you as well—the concerted publicity drive means more eyeballs than usual, so offers will be more likely than ever to be taken. 

We're shooting to hit 200 trades and 1000+ offers tomorrow, which is close to our all-time record...and hoping to beat that in the following weeks to hit new all-time highs.

We're also experimenting with helping core markets in other ways...for example, there's currently bots for reddit Twitter, Telegram in development, so that anyone can easily see offer books without having to open Bisq.

We'll also make a post soon analyzing the most successful trends in Bisq trading in general, including what tends to make USD and EUR offers successful.

And lastly -- tomorrow we'll have a [call tomorrow](https://github.com/bisq-network/growth/issues/188) (Thursday) at 8:15pm CET to debrief and discuss subsequent plans for the month. You're all welcome!",1583345986,19,1

fddq8i,AlacoAnalytics,Alaco Analytics | Next Generation Due Diligence,"Hello [r/Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/)!

Recently Alaco Analytics launched a Bitcoin transaction explorer: www.alacoanalytics.com

The purpose of the platform is to help users identify risks and warnings attached to addresses - from hacks, scams and ransomware to sanctioned addresses and terrorist groups. We've also included the odd exchange and payment service in there to add sense to transaction flows. We pass no judgement here, so there is no risk scoring or matrix!

fdctuj,Bruce-Hopper,Bitcoin blockchain size concerns,"From january 1st, 2018 to january 1st, 2020 the blockchain has grown an average of 53GB per year.

As blocks are almost full, scaling would continue by increasing the number of transactions in a single block so growth would remain linear.

In 50 years, the bitcoin blockchain will be **almost 3TB**. According to Moore's law, it would take up less space in percentage terms in our hard drives than today. But what if there is a **technological stagnation or even a technological recession** ?

Do you know if there is any researches in progress ? Is it technicaly feasible to reduce the size of the blockchain or the size of blocks without losing scalability ?

Believing that you can grow infinitely in a finite world is stupid and dangerous. [The limits to growth study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth) shows that somewhere around 2030 there will be a massive collapse due to lack of ressources we need to sustain our unsustainable way of living. Of course this isn't the only prediction to a massive downturn.

fdtj7t,deckoff8-,Time to buy bitcoin?,"What up peeps. I'm a transplant from wallstreetbets, but I have no loyalty to any asset and gains is gains, and I think bitcoin is a good thing to buy right now. Here's my thoughts...

There's a chain of thought that says bitcoin acts as a safety asset that should go up when stocks go down. I don't think that's exactly true: when people are extremely fearful, everything goes down, like last week when stocks, gold, and btc all went down at the same time. People panicked, the moved into cash.

But, much like the spring follows the winter, greed invariably follows panic. Now that people are no running around screaming their heads off, they're starting to chase yield. After the rate cut by J Powell last week, and with the incoming stock sell off from corona crash, there's going to be a lot of capital to deploy to chase yields. And where's it gonna go? Since most people are not comfortable buying puts or shorting stocks, I think that leaves bitcoin.

Earlier I said that bitcoin doesn't act as a hedge, and I think that's true: bitcoin is purely speculation, it only goes up because it goes up. But I think there's a very strong case for it going up now.

1. More corona virus news hits
2. People pull money from stock market
3. People are greedy shits and will need to put it somewhere
4. Any move to bitcoin will cause people to buy it there looking for yield
5. Bitcoin goes parabolic again up to 20k+ and anyone holding prints dollars.

I definitely think there's enough upside to buy some right now. It's definitely not 100% it goes up, but I think if it goes up it goes up a lot, and it just went up 4% today. It's a very asymmetric payoff that I think is worth a shot. I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but anyone got issues with my line of thinking?",1583405350,44,1

The first method is with Etoro. Here you can deposit your PayPal funds directly into a trading account and exchange between stocks, commodities and crypto currencies. When you want to cash out you will have to exchange back to Fiat dollars. 

Next, there are LocalBitcoins and Paxful which are both reputable person-to-person marketplaces for buying and selling bitcoin. As a buyer you have buyer protection on your side so it is relatively safe to buy bitcoin on these platforms. 

Next, there is Wirex which is a reloadable debit card which allows you to spend fiat dollars and cryptocurrency using the card. This card can be funded with PayPal.

fglpyi,IQ74,COVID-19 and the future of BTC,"Obviously BTC has dropped significantly over the past few days going from around 10k back down to 8k.  This is a short term reaction that is similar to what we have seen with stocks and the general market taking a hit amid COVID-10 fears and a slowing of the global economy.

Looking to the future I view the situation with COVID-19 as something that will greatly strengthen bitcoin.  COVID-19 isn't a problem that will quickly be resolved.  Even 1 or 2 years from now there will still be outbreaks (I assume) and it will be a long time before life returns to normal where we can be in large crowds without fear of contracting COVID-19 or something else.  In truth life may never return to normal.  

My point in saying all this is that having a currency such as bitcoin which can be used internationally without any person to person contact positions bitcoin in a very unique place right now.  If you want to send a wire transfer you need to go to the bank and interact with people which puts you at risk.  If you do a cash transaction you need to touch the money which potentially puts you at risk and also requires you to be at the same physical location as another person.

I think Bitcoin will become stronger and more used in the coming months and years as people want to reduce exposure to other people and the possibility of infection from COVID-19 or other viruses.

It appears another one of my predictions is coming to pass exactly on schedule. 

To oversimplify why I think crypto investments are going to become profitable very soon:

* They have less relative volatility in relationship to the downward swings of any one nation's currency

* They have higher relative value during swings when compared to any one nation's currency to neutral commodity goods

* They have higher relative resilience over time during extremely volatile trends

* The price of cryptos can never be fully predicted, but the movement swings and trends CAN

I'm still hoping it reaches $5k for me to be able to start my bets. I still don't anticipate trends to be equitable enough to invest in for at least 2-3 months (after the split) but if it hits 3K we can invest sooner.",1584032180,6,1

fhiae1,SimpleSwapExchange,Cryptocurrency adoption around the world,"It’s obvious that people use cryptocurrencies all around the world but let’s take a look at the countries which already adopted crypto.

# Germany

Germany is one of the most open to new technologies countries. Cryptocurrency here is a legal tender. Cryptocurrencies are considered to be equal to fiat money. It is allowed to make a purchase with crypto without taxation.

# Estonia

Estonian financial regulators determine cryptocurrency as a ""value represented in digital form"". Cryptocurrencies exchanges can function legally. However, they must be registered and operate under strict governmental control. It is known that Estonia is planning to launch its own cryptocurrency in the future.

# France

In December 2019 Financial Markets Authority of France published new rules regarding the crypto policy. According to these rules cryptocurrency exchanges have an opportunity to get a license in France if they prepare a two-year business plan, a list of digital assets that will be represented on the exchange, a geographic area the service will cover and some other things regarding firm's organization.

# India

In the beginning of 2020 the world witnessed a supreme change in Indian cryptocurrency policy. Exchanges banned in 2018 now can function again, which promises huge opportunities for the country.

# China

Although China is the biggest player in the crypto market, and its government's actions influence the whole industry, this country has a very strict policy. China sees miners as a part of a dark market, thus tends to ban their activity. Nonetheless, China was one of the first countries to announce the launch of sovereign digital currency.

fib9v2,dont-listentome,[ELI5] Storing bitcoin securely.,"Was gonna comment this, but thought it maybe deserved some more exposure for the newcomers:

Ownership of bitcoin is basically defined by ownership of private keys, since private keys are needed for signing transactions. If there's only one thing you are going to understand about bitcoin today, then understand that you need to keep your private keys FUCKING PRIVATE.

Having that said, private keys, in its most low level form are essentially just a string of 1's and 0's, in practice however we convert this binary format to more readable and fault tolerant formats like say ""5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF"" (Do not use this! I've posted it here so clearly it's NOT FUCKING PRIVATE ANYMORE!

Good, now that you know that private keys are essentially just numbers. You need to know it's a pain in the ass to keep track of all the private keys you have. That's why some smart people devised *Hierarchical deterministic wallets*  to generate a practically infinite amount of private keys from a single string of 24 (or sometimes 12) English words. These keys are generated in a deterministic way, meaning the same string of 24 words will always generate the same private keys. These wallets are known as HD-wallets. I hope it's clearly fucking obvious that you need to keep those 24 words FUCKING PRIVATE as well. It's called the *Master Seed* btw.

Now onto Hardware Wallets. Hardware wallets are simply devices that store your master seed and try to do absolute minimum of what is necessary to use bitcoin safely. Essentially they are devices to generate and store master seeds, generate private keys and sign transactions. Although, there is clearly some level of sophistication and complexity involved for such a device to even be able to perform these operations. Generally speaking, complexity is an enemy of security, so we want these devices to be as dumb as possible, the dumber the better.

When it comes to computer security, I would never trust a Windows box, ever. Linux is open source, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for information security. Linux is awesome, but there are still plenty of attack vectors left for hackers to exploit on your linux box. You may want to play around with Electrum for small amounts first. Once you're comfortable with that, maybe try signing some transactions offline with an airgapped machine. If you're lazy, then just get a hardware wallet.",1584151755,14,1

**More than 1200 CEOs left their positions in 2019 which was a record year for exits.**

**In January 2020, 219 CEOs left their positions (which is also a record).**

Lots of investors are panicking, and it has been a bloodbath with the DOW experiencing it's worst day since Black Monday.

Chamath Palihapitiya, the former Facebook executive and billionaire who's fund Social Capital has delivered fantastic returns, has indicated that he believes the [downside target is around that of the 2008 financial crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT1N_48aX_Q) (\~50%).

**This is now the fastest bear market after an all time high in history.**

Looking at historical drawdowns and how many days it takes to reach the bottom of a bear market, it seems that the downside will continue.

This virus is serious stuff, and it is important to have cash and liquidity at this time.

One of the traditional hedging assets, gold, also plunged (apparently because hedge funds needed to cover margin calls).

**DISCLAIMER: NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE**

In the very short term, Cash is King.

In the short to medium term, I would expect gold and silver to do pretty well in the 1-3 year time frame.

In terms of a general approach for stocks, Dollar Cost Averaging in a Bear Market is generally the way to go - the question is ""how long could we go?""

Well, Chamath thinks a correction of the same level as '08 is possible - indicating that the S&amp;P 500 could hit 1500-2000.

On a more qualitative basis, when Warren Buffett starts announcing deals is also not a bad time to start buying back in!

In the longer time frame (5-10 years), another asset that has had a *terrible* time recently is Bitcoin.

**Bitcoin is essentially a hedge against excessive fiat printing.**

The response to this situation is likely to involve a LOT of fiat printing.

Therefore, perhaps it will prove undervalued in the long term (particularly as Central Bank Digital Currencies come into play).

fj0l9i,sveg944,BTC = Gold 2.0 - This made me even more bullish,"First of all, English is my second language so I don't write perfect English, sorry about that.

I am a Millennial and I have been in crypto for over two years now and after this coronavirus outbreak made me think about my pension, and I wanted to start investing every month into something that can hold value over several decades. Which made me think of buying psychical precious metals since I do not trust any 2nd party for storing my precious metals.

It is kinda funny, but after I was finish doing research about gold I became even more bullish at Bitcoin as a store of value in the future, so I actually ended up buying more Bitcoin.

Here are the three points that made even more bullish on the future of Bitcoin.

Some problems that I noticed with gold after my research:

1. Divisible. 1 Oz of gold is pretty expensive for an average person, especially for the younger generations.
2. To buy psychical gold makes you buy for around 10% higher than market price + you must play for shipping and maybe an insurance every time you are going to stack some psychical gold. It is pretty hard to earn 10%+ in a market worth around 8 trillion USD.      
It is also hard to sell psychical gold and when you find a buyer you would not get the market price, which also is a pretty big loss if you have been stacking gold for years or maybe decades. 
3. Difficult and expensive to store. And also if your gold or safe got stolen you can't have a ''backup'' to protect your stolen precious metals.

Bitcoin:

1. Bitcoin = 100 000 000 Sats. A whole Bitcoin is expensive, but everyone can afford to buy some Sats.
2. If you buy/sell Bitcoin on forexample Coinbase you will not get the exact marketprice, but you will not pay as high as you would have done with psychical gold or silver (10%+). It is also pretty easy to buy BTC compared to precious metals, just make a wallet, register at an exchange and boom you are done. It is also very easy and less stressful to sell compared to gold/silver where you have to find a psychically buyer which then offers you a way lower price than the market price.
3. Cheap and safer to store. You can easily store your BTC on a Ledger or Trezor and this is pretty cheap compared to a safe + you can have an extra hardware wallet located in another house or something. Then you can easily transfer your found to another wallet before the stolen hardware wallet gets hacked.

There are of course more pros/cons with both, but these are the points that I think will make Bitcoin gold 2.0 in the future. And when the younger generations grows up and when the wealth transfer happens, I think that they will see the value in something that is digital and not psychical like gold/silver. Because they have grown up in a digital world and sees the value in digital assets + it is so much easier for them to buy/store BTC than gold/silver.",1584275148,13,1

fiyqz6,rx_engineer,Beware Bitcoiners: Scammed by BitMart Exchange,"I just wanted to inform others to be very careful with this exchange ([www.bitmart.com](https://www.bitmart.com)). Unfortuantely, it is very likely that I have been scammed of my own funds with this exchange. I created my account for the sole intent of making others aware.

Like most of you, I wanted to accumulate more BTC and I mainly do this via PAX USD stablecoin. Checking the volumes on this exchange has led me to believe that they do decent numbers with the BTC/ PAX pair so I signed up. I deposited PAX USD and put in some buy limit orders. I have already done the required KYC, 2FA etc. When the recent crash happened, I did acquire some BTC as a result. I was also not very happy with the experience so I wanted to withdraw whatever PAX and BTC I had. This is where the issues started.

Its been 4 days now and the funds are still held up by them. I have raised a ticket and also msged via the telegram channel on a daily basis. There is barely any response via their ticketing system and the admins on telegram keep stalling citing ""security"" reasons for the hold up. They dont give any timeframes whatsoever. They give you ""hope"" as well. The admins delete my msgs when I voice my concerns on the channel. Its a legitimate concern but they see it as FUD against their working scam. That was a big red flag and it just does not feel right. There seems to be some others who have their funds held up indefinitely as well. The telegram channel is sketchy as hell for a ""reputable"" exchange. Im starting to think that their volume numbers are fake to attract customers and trap customers with the withdrawal step. I, of course, hold myself fully responsible here but I just wanted to inform others. Dont do the same mistake and if you are considering using this exchange, STAY AWAY!!

Im aware of the risks of posting the below. The ""exchange"" has my KYC and can fully disclose my identity. I have a substantial amount held by them hence the frustration. I can't stand seeing my funds being stolen from me while not being able to do anything. I intend to spread this information via media, influencer etc wherever I can to make people aware. Its the only thing I can do. Just dont be stupid like me. Its a tough pill to swallow. If my situation does change, i'll update.

Here are my pending withdrawals (Only created, no txids and therefore not broadcasted to the blockchain):

It is still very young and has very few options, but more options (mini private key, mnemonic, password recovery) will be added _slowly_.  

For now the main feature is recovering a private key missing an arbitrary number of characters.

With any luck people may see it as a safehaven and drive prices up further","We've been in a bull market (in Australia) for decades. A house that was 300k 10 years ago is now $900k-$1m. 

Wages have stayed pretty much the same as house prices sky rocketed. 20% deposit required on a house in Sydney. That's $200k. Median income is around 75k. Rent averages $600 per week. 

But there's more fuckery involved. You somehow manage to save up your deposit with help and sacrificing your first born, then you get slugged with $35k ""stamp duty"". Literally a stamp on a piece of paper.

You can't borrow the stamp duty with your home loan. Sacrifice another child or sell your ass in dark alleys.

I bought in 2016 against the advice of my next door neighbour ""financial consultant"".

I took profits, sold a little during ATH and hodled. Never traded except arbitrage between exchanges where you can make $1000 between Bittrex and BTC markets in Australia sometimes.

If i sold every time there was panic I'd have nothing. I wasn't in for a quick buck but it was a bonus. Play it smart, sell a little when it's up 10 or 20%. Inevitably there's always a dip, buy back in.

I'm no expert, i don't care for charts or whatever, but jeez guys, which other investment can gain you 10% in some cases over night? Sell 5% of that then.

Hodling through highs and lows, then lamenting over ""should have sold, should have bought"" and taking a stubborn stance where you'll never sell regardless is kinda silly don't you think?

Take a little profit sometimes when it's there. There's always a ""what if it moons"" but there's also a ""what if it tanks again""",1584665883,2,1

As far as I know, nowadays goverments print money to postpone the total colapse of their shitty centralized economic system.

My question is how would Bitcoin and other coins perform during this kind of pandemic crisis on a very long term future where decentralized cryptocurrency will be the base of the worldwide economic system?

flkcqn,nxy7,Bitcoin finally has real use case?,"Hello everyone, I'm not active redditer and usually just read stuff here and there, but I got interested in investing (stock and crypto) recently and have some thoughts which I'd like to confront with You.

So, many people here think bitcoin will drop again soon and recent pump is caused by whales etc etc (I'm not sure if these people have any evidence here or are they bad faith actors trying to buy lower again). Some people say that global economy is yet to crash and price will go down significantly, but to be honest I think that BTC would benefit from this crash greatly. Here's how I think that could play out.

First economy crashes &gt; Banks print out huge amounts of money to increase stock price and for people to increase demand in economy &gt; InflationIsn't it perfect scenario for crypto which cannot increase  quantity ? New money gets printed every day even rn and in some point it has to cause some problems. I might not be educated enough (and I'd be happy if some of You could prove me wrong), but this situation with increased inflation might be first real use case for BTC. It never solved any problems, why would people use it over USD or other currency if it was so much more inconvenient. Now it can solve incoming problem of inflation/hiperinflation. If your money loses value every day You obviously would want to fight that somehow. Stocks are not safe store of value, even gold loses value these days. BTC has history of being super unstable aswell but that's mostly due to it being treated like stocks. Now it being immune to upcoming problems with monetary system could increase ""base"" price on it, even if it became unstable i think the new bottom will be much higher soon.

My theory is that initial drop in last weeks was due to people panic selling and cause BTC is ineffective in fighting with COVID virus (meanwhile fiat can buy You stuff). But COVID will  cause monetary problems that can finally show BTC worth.

Thank's for reading, even if I don't get any responds writing helps me organize thoughts :-)GL and i wish You gains no matter if You Sell or Buy now 💗

Just tether alone printed close to half a billion (you can see the screenshots and validate the statements through the blockchain explorers). Another reason why stablecoins broke the 1$ earlier (went to .96c).

People are leaving this landscape massively and there is very little % of fiat in the system (first hand information from legit exchanges that deal with fiat only). You will end up bagholding stablecoins which will eventually go to 0$. It is not BTC or ETH that will go to zero because there will not be enough liquidity to dump to 0.

There is not even a meme anymore (digital gold / store of value was the last one that died when things went -50% in a day)

I've been super long in this landscape and its been great (I hold BTC from 600$), and it was great when it was small (mostly filled by smart people trying to build something meaningful), but right now its filled with people that want to make free money overleveraging themselves and fraudulent exchanges, marketmakers and corrupt media websites who are taking the money of the poor people.

Some ""Jordans"" may think the opposite but i have to disappoint you, Bitcoin price wasn't dumped because of the possible recession, it was dumped by the stock players who do not understand what they bought in at the first place. Let me just clarify: bitcoin won't loose value if the whole world is in quarantine, also it won't dump if every factory shuts down, it even won't dump if every gold bar get contaminated with an unknown virus, well i might say that it won't dump even in the case the internet shuts down. BUT it will dump if you panic, besides the panic none of the offline world problems will affect the price, NONE.

If you want to earn in these times, or at least you if don't want to loose, try to understand what you are investing in. It seems internet will save millions of jobs right now all over the world, but in 20 years cryptocurrencies might save most of the world's economies.

**Also you almighty Jordans Belforts who induced last weeks dump, might want to consider that US stocks are not the center of the world, at least not in the cryptocurrency markets, when US stocks are dumping might be the case of an asia pump like today because bitcoin market is worldwide and investors give zero(0) fucks about market conditions in the other part of the world, especially if you dump it to a level that is uncomfortable to most market players.**

fmfdjq,zeki5555,Bitmex unjust liquidation," On friday March 12 I placed a 3 btc x10 short order at $4412, unfortunately without realising there was a huge spread of the markprice to the last traded price on the exchange. My margin which was supposed to be 3 btc instantly became less than 0.5 btc upon order execution. This is not how financial derrivatives are intended to work, Bitmex states, on their website, the following:

*"" BitMEX employs a unique system called* *Fair Price Marking* *to avoid unnecessary liquidations in its highly leveraged products. Without this system, unnecessary liquidations may occur if the market is being manipulated, is illiquid, or the Mark Price swings unnecessarily relative to its Index Price. The system is able to achieve this by setting the Mark Price of the contract to the* *Fair Price* *instead of the* *Last Price*\*. ""\*

The markprice did the exact opposite of what it is claimed to be doing in my case.

Then I went a little deeper and looked at what happened with the BXBT index on the time I got liquidated (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 23:59:22 GMT ). According to my liquidation e-mail the BXBT index rose to $4922.37 and the markprice (which is based on the BXBT index) rose to $4913.0. I then looked at the BXBT index historical values and specificcaly the high of the 23:59:00 minute candle and to my surprise see that the high was $4861.51 which is far from the $4922.37 which triggered liquidation.

Based on these previous facts I have submitted a ticket and provided the bitmex team with documents that substantiate these facts. I also have requested a refund, but so far all I get is basic answers like what markprice is and what happened during the ddos attacks, which all are not applicable to my case.

I will keep you guys updated if something substantial happens, have a good weekend.",1584799190,58,1
fmfcmo,sydrooz,Project: My own bank: Cold storage without proprietary hardware,"Hi all,

I am playing with the thought of settinh up a cold storage for bitcoin using a multisig wallet. 

The objective is to have BTC under own control (not on an exchange!) but minimize risk of 'own storage' and keeping the thing manageable with intermediate knowledge. The whole thing should run without BTC proprietary hardware like trezors, it should run on 'regular hardware'.

It seems the following approach could work:
- multisig electrum wallet
- one wallet completely offline on airgapped device
- electrum private server connected through vpn and firewalls with separate ip, different to home network

What are your thoughts on these points:
- electrum a good choice regarding usability, or even the only choice if multisig wallet needed?
- electrum having limited privacy without own server; setting up a new (proprietary electrum?) server as own node it seems (which is a shame as I have a functioning bitcoin full node). Is there a way to get electrum or another desktop wallet _with multisig support_ running with a regular full node ?
- own node to verify own transactions and to avoid  disclosing wallet balances to unknown servers
- the offline machine will need updating at some stage if new versions of electrum are out (??) how to go about this
- keeping software and setup overall robust long term (many years - where it's possible to re-install the wallet, replace its hardware)

fmed7p,manitoboss,"Bitcoin Bumps Up, but for How Long?","
As traditional markets continue to struggle with the coronavirus crisis, cryptocurrencies are seeing an upswing in both price and volume. Now crypto traders are wondering how long this new rally will last.  
Bitcoin (BTC) is up 1 percent in the past 24 hours of trading, currently changing hands at $6,224 as of 19:00 UTC. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization may be trending below its 10-day moving average in price, but it’s still above its 50-day average, the signal of a continued upward trend. 
On Coinbase, prices were as high as $6,993 on the U.S. exchange over the past 24 hours. That’s an 80 percent appreciation from its lows of $3,845 on March 12, which was hit, in part, by liquidations on BitMEX  coronavirus-related news.
Related: Coinbase Broke Traffic Records and Saw Massive Volume During Market Collapse
“We saw buying in large sizes from some larger players in the last couple of days from $5,000 and up,” said Darius Sit, managing partner of Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital. 
Over the past 24 hours, Bitfinex traded on its spot markets more than $400 million worth of cryptocurrencies, according to the exchange. This coincided with a price spread developing and arbitrage opportunities forming on exchanges like Bitfinex and BitMEX. 
Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino told CoinDesk the action comes from “a combination of multiple factors [including] halving, hedging against the traditional market and an important number of fiat inflows entering crypto markets to take advantage of the recent decline.”

With the potential of government stimulus plans boosting economic activity, bitcoin has been very bullish. 
So where is bitcoin’s price going? Professional stakeholders, as usual, differ on opinions and strategies. 
“Conditions look set for a stellar rise with unprecedented monetary easing and fiscal stimulus along with the halving narrative. So once there was a sense of some stabilization in the spread of the virus (0 cases in China yesterday) a frenzy of buying occurred,” QCP Capital’s Sit told CoinDesk. 
“In terms of the recent recovery, if the trend will continue the next resistance will be around $7,200,” said Constantine Kogan, a partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital. 
However, Kogan also noted a lot might happen on a fundamental level with the coronavirus epidemic and subsequent market reaction. Both the S&amp;P 500 index and bitcoin volatility are jumping to dramatic highs.

“Seems like markets are having their relief rallies after a destructive week,” said Michael van de Poppe, an Amsterdam-based cryptocurrency trader. “So far I think it’s a bearish retest and we’ve got to test $5,500-$5,800 and perhaps $4,200-$4,400”
The Nikkei 225 ended its trading session down a percent, while the FTSE 100 index in Europe closed up 1.5 percent. As of 19:00 UTC, the S&amp;P 500 is down over 3 percent while gold is eking out less than a percent gain. 
Other top gainers in the crypto market today as of 19:00 UTC include dash (DASH) also in the green 9 percent Zcash (ZEC) up 5 percent and bitcoin SV (BSV) gaining 1 percent,. Downward pricing dogs in crypto include cardano (ADA) down 4 percent, NEM (NEM) also in the red 2 percent and IOTA (IOTA) down 4 percent.",1584794447,4,1

Very suspicious circumstances led me to a new bitcoin exchange website( [https://binancechange.com/](https://binancechange.com/)). It has no reviews or scam reports as of yet, it seems to be brand new. The circumstances leading up to my discovery of this website were a discord message from an unknown profile claiming I had won a random lottery and received a code to promote the new BTC exchange website. Once redeemed, it was worth 0.05-0.5 BTC.   


I created an account, redeemed the code, I apparently have 0.55 BTC on an exchange no one has reviewed. To withdraw the funds, you have to deposit 0.03 BTC to ""verify your account and prove your age (+18)"" according to the website and support. This is obviously incredibly fishy, as they have an identity verification process already involving official documents.   


Just curious if anyone has used this platform, has any endorsements, etc. Any new information or ""clues"" related to whether or not it's a scam or suspect would also be appreciated.

fmc06j,Bityardofficial,Anthony Pompliano: Bitcoin will be the best performing asset in the next two years,"According to Substack, Anthony Pompliano, co-founder of Morgan Creek, published an analysis saying that in the next 18-24 months, almost all asset prices will rise sharply. Specifically, non-New Crown epidemic-related enterprise stocks (CIS) will receive a return of 40-70% in the next two years (based on the current overall market decline of 40-50%); Is another case. It is expected that the stocks that have fallen the most so far may get the greatest returns. Gold will not exceed $ 2,500 in the next two years, with a return of 35% to 65%. Bitcoin's outlook is similar to gold, but with some key differences. As the dollar depreciates, investors will seek inflation to hedge assets, and Bitcoin and gold will be two of the beneficiaries. But one major difference is that Bitcoin is much more volatile than gold. Although I think gold has a 3-65% upside, he has a relatively high confidence (more than 85%) that Bitcoin price will be at least three times higher than it is now. This will bring it back to an all-time high of over $ 20,000. In summary, Bitcoin will be the best performing asset in the next 24 months.

&gt;For those with an uncertain understanding of its history, bitcoin entered the world on Jan. 3, 2009, when a shadowy hacker — or team of hackers — working under the name Satoshi Nakamoto released an ingenious string of computer code that established a system permitting people to transfer money to one another online, directly, anonymously and outside government control, in much the way that Napster once allowed the unrestrained transfer of music files. In a 500-word essay that accompanied the code, Nakamoto suggested that the motive for creating bitcoin was anger at the financial crisis: “The root problem with conventional currencies is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.”",1584548998,7,1

fkpdka,FinnHe,Can Bitcoin separate from the independent market,"Recently, the price of Bitcoin plunged to $ 3,600 on BitMEX and $ 3,800 on Bitfinex, setting the worst one-day drop in seven years. The sell-off coincided with a sharp correction in the US stock market.

Bitcoin, at least in theory, should be a safe-haven asset immune to the turbulence of traditional financial markets. However, in the past two weeks, as investors frantically sold high-risk assets, Bitcoin has begun to fall in sync with the stock market.

Do US stocks dive leading crypto market down?

Over the past week, the bitcoin price has responded to several key events, including President Trump's announcement of a 30-day travel ban between the United States and Europe, and the Federal Reserve's announcement to reduce the federal benchmark interest rate to 0.00% -0.25% Levels and more.

Compared with the trend of S &amp; P 500, Bitcoin is almost the same as Bitcoin.

https://preview.redd.it/2asc4s2plfn41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=495f610ada720436a3abfd8e97d66ac062def543

OKEx's advanced analysis is that William told Golden Finance, ""Just as bitcoin price has no correlation with gold, there is no obvious correlation between bitcoin and U.S. stocks. The reason why U.S. stocks and bitcoin are falling is that the market is too lacking Liquidity, all funds are looking for safe, liquid assets. ""

He explained by way of example that, in normal time, the water in the well is difficult to connect with the water in the lake; but the sky fell and the water levels of the lake and the well fell sharply. Even so, there was not much connection between the two sides. Just because of the influence of the big climate.

US stocks are about to open. How is Bitcoin trending?

In the early morning of March 18, local time, all three major US stock index futures fell, triggering trading restrictions.

The S &amp; P 500 index futures contract for June 2020 fell to 2393.50 points, down 3.70%, hitting trading restrictions. The NASDAQ (7334.78, 430.19, 6.23%) index futures contract for June 2020 fell to 7064.25 points, hitting trading restrictions. The Dow Jones (21237.3809, 1048.86, 5.20%) index for the June 2020 contract was reported at 2039 points, which also hit trading restrictions.

Only 2 hours from the opening of the US stock market, will the US stocks reappear?

In this regard, industry analysts believe that the current US government is preparing to introduce the US $ 700 billion to the US $ 1 trillion stimulus plan and issue it directly to the public. All the US stocks rose due to this positive impact yesterday. But whether the liquidity crisis can be resolved is still a question mark. In addition, there are already confirmed cases in all states in the United States, the number of confirmed diagnoses in Europe is also rising sharply, a large number of factory shutdowns, which has a great impact on the stock market, so the probability of US stocks will fall in the next few months. Investors are not advised to take a dip at this time. It is now a crisis period and a dip is now a high-risk event. Regarding Bitcoin, it is recommended that you do not buy it, for the time being, at least it is not too late to buy it after the liquidity crisis has passed.

In terms of technical indicators, BTC remained within the rising triangle range formed after the recent big drop. The rebound started yesterday evening with the rise of U.S. stocks, but the strength was limited, and it was difficult to form a more powerful rebound in the short term. After wearing the Bollinger Middle Rail for 4 hours, the MACD bullish measuring column started to weaken above the 0 axes. The fast and slow lines have flattened, and the short-term upward momentum is insufficient. In the near future, it is still shock-organized. Parallel head up, volume matching, and breaking through the 4-hour potential double bottom neckline to suppress the high point of $ 5,950. Later, it is expected to test the previous low of 6400-6500. At present, the support below is the uptrend line. Today's limit is 4850. US dollar, the next 4-hour level is 4880 US dollars, short-term support to increase about 30 US dollars every 4 hours, the short-term operation can pay attention to these positions, the current overall maintenance of the triangle interval, waiting for direction choice.

相关 BTC and S &amp; P correlation reach record high

&amp;#x200B;

历史 BTC's historic one-day price decline coincided with the worst day in the US stock market since 1987. On March 12, the Pearson correlation coefficient between BTC and the S &amp; P 500 soared to an all-time high of 0.52, the previous record high of 0.32. This shows that the crypto asset market is increasingly connected to existing traditional markets and is more sensitive to external events than ever before.

Over the past week, the bitcoin price has responded to several key events, including President Trump's announcement of a 30-day travel ban between the United States and Europe, and the Federal Reserve's announcement to reduce the federal benchmark interest rate to 0.00% -0.25% Levels and more. Below is a comparison of the timing of some key events over the past week with the price of Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

BTC sellers seem to be mainly short-term holders

&amp;#x200B;

According to the data on the blockchain, the recent sell-off of bitcoin transactions has mostly come from relatively short-term traders and recent entry holders. At least so far, long-term holders remain bullish.

&amp;#x200B;

MeCoin Metrics' Supply Activation Index tracks how many coins that have not moved during a particular period of time re-enter circulation. On March 11, approximately 281k bitcoins that had not been moved within 30 days re-entered circulation, while only 4,131 bitcoins that did not move within one year entered circulation. This shows that the two-day trend on March 11 and March 12 involved bitcoin with little one-year long-term holders.

March 11 is the fourth largest peak in the number of unremoved bitcoins in the past eight years and 30 days.

https://preview.redd.it/pqdyx40v8fn41.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0961fe5006aff0f9dbc83875fbdd5d113674ab2f

Long-term holders have not wavered, and the number of Bitcoins that have not moved and re-entered into circulation during the one-year period has not increased abnormally.

[BTC MVRV index drops below 1](https://preview.redd.it/vsyi41oy8fn41.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37aadaeb9164832d4470b9e953193003d5df767b)

MVRV above 1 indicates that speculators value the market higher than holders, and MVRV below 1 indicates that holders value the market higher than current speculators. When the MVRV is lower than 1, it is not so easy for the holder to immediately sell for a profit.

&amp;#x200B;

MVOn March 12, the MVRV index fell to 0.5, the largest one-day drop since December 2013. It turns out that the period when the MVRV index fell below 1 in the past is also the best time to buy more Bitcoin at a discounted price.

to sum up

&amp;#x200B;

MetricCoinmetrics finally concluded that after a crazy sell-off in the past week or so, although the price of bitcoin has fallen sharply, multiple figures are reassuring. The sell-off seems to be mainly caused by short-term investors stepping on fear, and long-term holders have so far been relatively stable. At the same time, as Bitcoin MVRV dropped below 1, it seems to have entered the historically attractive price-sucking range.",1584533245,18,1

It's debt created out of nothing but just a few are allowed to do this.
They can create if for free and charge interest to others using it, what a lovely system of you own it.

By creating lots of it we thought we were doing well.
That we gained wealth.
But most of it is artificial, even our homes that are now way overpriced won't provide wealth because price will collapse.
Just look what the creators of fiat, remember they create it out of air,   have on their balance sheets as collateral, it's not funny money but hard collateral,  properties and real estate.
They don't care if real estate goes down for some 10 years or more, they got it for free, and time is on their side.
But we who borrowed the money for our houses have to pay it all back and the interest, doesn't matter to the bank if prices halve or worse.

Promised pensions won't be paid, well perhaps you get the promised amount but look at the purchasing power of it in a few, 10 and 50 years from now.....

Only sound money can fix this.
Sound money that is not controlled by a way bigger paper market that sets the price.

Bitcoin fixes all of this.
It still has to prove a lot and gain confidence of a big group of people. But it will be hard to stop this.

fkkum6,ItsSpeltGoogol,"What is your reason for buying\holding crypto, what is the end game for you?","I just cant see how BTC is any sort of revolution. Maybe as a holding asset that somewhat takes away from global growth, but not as a currency. People seem to think that decentralization is the end game, well it isn't if it can't support capitalism, and lending is the biggest part of capitalism I can think of, and I don't think I know much about economics at all, to be clear and honest.

All I know for sure is the only crypto I have used when crypto was under heavy fire in 2017, was xrp, unfortunately, but it worked very fast and very cheap. Eth and btc did not.
Lets lets say the US dollar crashes to the ground (which it seems maybe most crypto holders want), how is it going to benefit society if you really think about it. I honestly think the immediate transfer of wealth (if for example btc was suddenly the new world currency), would have to create an even greater global depression, one that would take decades to come out of as new ""banks"" would have to be formed to loan the new currency just for businesses or global economy's to operate, never mind the useless crap like unsecured loans, car loans etc.  Just think for example how farmers and transport alone would function.

I just wonder how many people have been bothered to think past ""cool idea, better get it while it seems cheap"". As an asset I kinda get it, it's cheaper and SO much easier to buy than land, stocks or even gold to an extent, but it seems it has no intrinsic value, just very shaky store of value for when physical assets can not be held for what ever reason. BTC seems like such a brilliant idea to come from a single(?) man, but it hasn't progressed enough and I don't think it can progress to a world currency. I think it's become a pyramid scheme of sorts for people who don't fully understand it, (they just like the idea of it, a lot like Marxism for example), and for the educated in macroeconomics and rich in fiat to take advantage of. If that's the case, open up, we can still all get behind it and speculate and trade, it doesn't change much. Well, this single post by a nobody changes nothing anyway.

![img](axgh9qjra7n41)

🔥This day will be remembered by the cryptocurrency community for a long time: market capitalization fell by 50% per day, Bitcoin also by 50% — the extreme price on the BITSTAMP exchange is $ 3850, Ethereum fell 55%, below $ 90. Losses of top altcoins per day reached an average of 60%.

Meanwhile, the employees of the top crypto exchanges didn\`t disappoint their users, but did as BitMEX: the Huobi and Bithumb exchanges encountered performance problems and users were unable to fulfill applications or go to the site. “Goodbye, dear deposit!” See you soon!”. Of course, similar problems were observed at the BitMEX website.

*To date, the performance of the platforms has been fully restored, but this is only now.*

**📍**What briefly happened?

📉First, the support line, which dates back to 2015, collapsed by $ 7500- $ 7300, after which the price for several minutes was below $ 6000 (all traders have already caught a long squeeze here). After 12-hour consolidation in the range of $ 5700- $ 6100, the price of the first cryptocurrency continued its free fall, updating the annual minimum below $ 4000.

**❓**Causes

🔍The big sale was influenced by the situation in traditional markets. Global financial indices fell by more than 25% in two weeks, and this was a record drop since 1987! Bitcoin used to show an inverse correlation with the S&amp;P 500 with minor drops caused by local problems. But today, when a full-scale catastrophe occurs in the stock market, Bitcoin is falling along with the stock market and even overtaking it due to its small capitalization and low liquidity.

Obviously, investors don’t perceive cryptocurrencies as a defensive asset, and sell when problems arise, as well as to pay off margin calls in traditional markets. The decline in bitcoin to the levels of the beginning of 2019 instigated panic and a massive drain, which made the inexperienced crypto-traders even worse and the collapse continued even in their panic.

**💡**What to do next?

&gt;*📍If you are not afraid to form a long-term portfolio of cryptocurrencies, then you can think about starting to buy a much cheaper portfolio of altcoins and BTC.*

👉If you are a supporter of entering the market for short-term or day trading, we recommend that you wait for a clearer technical picture at least at 1 hour BTC timeframe. Since there is panic on the market now, the daily volatility has reached the limit at which it is no longer possible to trade. It is better to wait for this period in the 💰cash(fiat) and watch the market from the outside. A road to $3500- $2000 is also possible.",1584436879,2,1

The terminology of incorporating ""cash"" into the name makes people more accepting from the get go.

I believe in terms of widespread adoption BCH has an advantage due to this marketing ploy, and when dealing with the masses or lowest common denominator, if we what widespread adoption then we need to target biases. Take the federal reserve for example, in no way is this a federal organization, however the majority of people believe this to be exactly that and have faith and trust in it. 

I think this point should be kept in mind. Bitcoin is associated with volatility, get rich kick schemes and vagueness by those we need to adopt it in daily life. I believe these same people will see BCH cash as the ""cash version"" or "" evolution"" of bitcoin, something that holds authenticity and authority, that is  in some way ""cash"" or linked/backed by cash. I believe we would be naive to forget about the psychological, emotional and biases held by the people.

Thoughts?

Could this come down to a marketing battle someday? When attempting to get mass adoption surely marketing will come in you play...

Take the federal reserve for example, in no way is this a federal organization, however the majority of people believe this to be exactly that and have faith and trust in it. 

I think this point should be kept in mind. Bitcoin is associated with volatility, get rich kick schemes and vagueness by those we need to adopt it in daily life. I believe these same people will see BCH cash as the ""cash version"" or "" evolution"" of bitcoin, something that holds authenticity and authority, that is  in some way ""cash"" or linked/backed by cash. I believe we would be naive to forget about the psychological, emotional and biases held by the people.

Thoughts?

Could this come down to a marketing battle someday? When attempting to get mass adoption surely marketing will come in you play... 

How could we get bitcoin to be more widely adopted. I've noticed a change already from "" digital gold"" to "" The Currency of the future!""

fjtyyg,rambamthxmaam,"Newbie 2.0 - In-depth questions and thoughts (warning, long post)","Hello all, this is my second time posting about this on Reddit. Since my last post I've done a ton of research, reading and understanding about the technology, philosophy and history of Cryptocurrencies (CCs). I hope the following questions will help anyone who's about to make a sensible, and responsible, investment as the markets are tanking (IMO its a good time to invest). So, for some Reddit, and life, karma.. I hope I get some sound advice/answers:

1. I am Canadian, but my base is in Germany. I was wondering which is a better exchange to use? A Canadian one vs. one in Europe (or Germany). I researched about taxation on any gains or income from CCs and they're pretty much the same, maybe a little more lenient in Germany, so its not a major issues IMO. Is it better to stick to a Canadian-run exchange? In case needed, do I have any protection as a Canadian citizen from fraud, theft or foul-play from these exchanges?
2. I've looked into different wallets to use. I figured that since I am not making any monster investments then a Cold wallet for hoarding (long term investments) and Hot wallet for trading makes sense. I will ""go slow"" by investing progressively as the markets and news unfolds. So, which is the best Hot and Cold wallet to look into? I deduced that a Ledger and Trezor are the most used, but has the ""Man in the Middle"" issue been resolved? Which brings me to the next question:
3. Are they any up-to-date articles or source that speak of new and updated technologies behind the CC world? I found that most of the articles or sources I read are 2 or 3 yeas old and I guess in the tech world that's ancient. Which channels are best to follow? Which educational programs or courses are best to sign up, or pay into? I heard that there are groups in msging apps like Telegram that one can join to stay up-to-date in real time with news and developments.
4. What is the future of CCs with all this talk about taking over the Public Domain? Seen lots of articles about how US congress are trying to pass bills which, in simple terms, privatize the internet? Doesn't that completely chatter the core principle of CCs?
5. Finally, my biggest mind-tickler.. should I invest in completely decentralized or semi-centralized coins? To be honest, my objective in investing is not just for money. I also am bought into a future of pure privacy and a decentralized system. Our current system is outdated, I have a strong intuition that its about to change and maybe with all this crisis thats happening, it could just just be enough to expose the obvious flaws, which will in turn pave way for the future of CC. But, I also doubt that the current financial giants are going down without a fight. Any insight on this would be great!

I will be posting this on different subreddits to see what I get back..

Stay safe, stay decent. Wishing everyone the best.",1584398330,5,1
fjtse4,Real_mindbender,IMHO,"Everybody please stop spamming f5 on coinmarketcap, stop glorifying BTC, stop dooming BTCs' store of value proposition and for the love of god stop comparing BTC to the equity market. 

EVERYTHING is selling off right now and rightly so. People are gathering cash to pay for living expenses and i advice everybody to do the same, the entire western world is about to go into a quarantine. Businesses will close down, people will lose jobs and most importantly your fellow human beings  will be sick and hospitalized. This is the time to be practical and to take care of your family and loved ones, respect covid as a disease and it's economic consequences.

 Get some cash on hand. Fiat is now as valuable as ever, enormous sums of money are vanishing and we will enter a period of hardcore deflation. 

If you flip the chart, the USD gained 50% in the last week vs BTC, the USD gained 12% on the US equity markets today and i do not see this stopping in the near to mid term. 

I hate paper money as much as the next guy but right now be realistic and smart. Your DCA money is better used elsewhere in the coming months. 

With all that being said, i firmly believe that BTC is the endgame here. After a period of deflation comes hardcore inflation, social unrest, rioting (hopefully non violent), possible bank bail ins and bail outs, main street paying the bill and getting fucked as always. - In this environment BTC and precious metals will thrive and act as the most viable solution. People will finally open their eyes to what this community have known all along, the central banks and its monetary policies  is socialism for the rich enslaving the remaining 99,99% of the worlds population. When this will happen nobody knows, but i think this whole crisis will result in a brighter future for our kids and grandchildren. Stay safe, be smart and be patient !",1584397668,6,4

So far I have checked out Cred (pass, trying too hard to cozy up with US regulators, says US clients can’t borrow based on their collateral for *six months * which is a deal breaker for most I would imagine.  

I have personal experience with Nexo.io which is in all but name a Swiss Bank account, pays great interest on stables (8%) and a great lending service allowing you to withdraw up to 75% of your bond in USD at under 6% if you 1.) hodl nexo tokens greater than the default 11-12% APY for the interest discount and 2.) deposit a bond that is 51% BTC/ETH &amp; 49% Stables (again, US regulations) but ny main qualms with that service are that the advertised fiat payment options (especially the withdraw/spend ones) are not even close to as far along to their release dates as advertised. The nexo credit card for insurance, like nearly all other crypto to plastic offerings, appears to be essentially vaporware, and the USD credit line withdrawal to US bank accounts does not seem to be up and running either (so no ACH out either).

Nexo is a legit company to be clear, you can still withdraw your available credit line in Tether USD, but none of these services as far a as I can tell, will report positive payment information to the three major credit bureaus in the US, which to me is the main draw for applying to receive credit if any kind is the credit score boost from paying it off in full, because my score is trash but I want to own a home at SOME point so..

Anyone know of any crypto-backed lending solutions that will report information to to the 3 major United States credit bureaus ?  If you have a referral code too I will most definitely meet whatever deposit/lending mínimums would be needed to unlock a reward. Thanks guys.",1584957114,4,1
fnh8fr,tincock,"Noob technical question about wallets: If electrum didn't exist in 10 years, would I still be able to recover a wallet with my 12 word seed phrase?","Thanks in advance for your patience. I am curious about the way that electrum generates wallets using 12 word seed phrases. First of all. Do I need to rely on electrum existing in the future (and being compatible with the operating system of the future) to be confident that I could restore a wallet using my seed phrase? Does electrum use some sort of universal protocol for wallet generation? I see something about 'Segwit' when I make a new wallet. What is that? Also, can I be sure that the wallet is being created with enough 'randomness'?  When using bitaddress, for example, It requires input from the user (mashing random buttons and scrolling the mouse) to randomly generate an address. Is it a problem that electrum doesn't use this step? Thanks again.",1584956402,2,1

BTC-E was sized by the FBI (thanks, I lost 50% of my coins) because of some BS excuse and they steal the money of honest people, they did not care.

fo1di0,fancy_block,Why We Need a Decentralized Wallet？,"When we enter the block chain field, the first thing we often do is to buy coins. While buying coins has become the first demand for blockchain, there is actually a more important demand, which is where we should place with the coins we buy. Some people say that after you buy a coin, just put it on the exchange. Is that really reassuring? Let's take a look at a few facts from the past.
In February 2014, about 800,000 bitcoins were stolen from the Mt. Gox exchange.
In January 2015, about 19,000 bitcoins were stolen from the Bitstamp exchange.
In August 2016, hackers stole 119,756 bitcoins from the Bitfinex exchange.
In July 2017, hackers stole 153,000 pieces of ethereum from the Parity exchange for about $32.6 million.
In September 2018, Zaif, the Japanese digital currency exchange, announced a $59.67 million loss from a hacking attack.
In November 2019, $48.5 million was stolen from the Upbit exchange.
These are just a few examples of larger sums, and there more exchanges are stolen each year indeed.
History tells us that putting coins on the exchange after buying them doesn't seem like a very reassuring decision. So, where can you rest assured? The answer is decentralized wallets.
I think there are three requirements that we need to meet when we use decentralized wallets.

Transaction requirement

As mentioned above, the transaction requirement is our first requirement to enter the blockchain. First, we need to convert legal currency into digital currency, and a good decentralized wallet must meet this need. But we need more than that. Sometimes we need to trade one digital currency for another, and that's where the role of an exchange comes in.
Decentralized exchange at present, but due to the trading depth and user experience ,they are not the first choice of the high-frequency traders. If a centralized exchange can be integrated in a decentralized wallet. This allows direct trading, meeting the trading needs of traders, and even matching orders from mainstream exchanges, allowing you to get the trading depth of multiple exchanges in your wallet and place orders at the best price. This not only satisfied the simple transaction demand, but also exceeded the expectation.

Security requirement

The security requirement is just what we need to use the decentralized wallet, and it is also the real embodiment of using the block chain technology. If security can not be guaranteed, we don't even need to use the block chain technology. The decentralized wallet is based on the underlying technology of public blockchains, which can export the private key. If you hold the private key in your own hands, you will truly master the blockchain assets. In this way, even if the wallet business fails, it will not affect our assets. Moreover, a reliable decentralized wallet must be open source and will stand the test of the industry.
Also, is the security requirement really just asset security?
With the development of DPoS consensus mechanism represented by EOS, coin play an increasingly important role in blockchain. Coins are not only assets, but also symbols of power. In the event of Steemit community not long ago, the exchange randomly used the coins placed in the exchange to vote, which caused a serious community crisis in the Steemit community and finally caused the fork of Steemit. The incident not only had an irreparable impact on the Steemit community, but also had a huge impact on trust in the exchange.
A good decentralized wallet can solve this problem, and when we put coins in a decentralized wallet, the coin's rights are in our own hands. EOS, for example, we can use the EOS vote for the node, or voting rights granted to pool to reap the benefits, it is worth noting that the currency is still in our wallet account, we will just confer voting rights to them, they are not able to use our assets. We get the vote benefits while the asset are still safe, it's very important.

Application requirement

The emergence of ethereum has opened the door to a new world of smart contracts, which means we can do a lot more than just trade in the blockchain, like DeFi, like games. This adds another dimension to our requirements.
The implementation of these requirements must rely on the underlying account, without which many things we can not do, even the door can not get in. Therefore, it is particularly important to have a public blockchain account in our own hands, which is our key to the blockchain world. Decentralized wallet can meet our management needs for public blockchain accounts. We can log in and experience various dapps by the account in decentralized wallet. These are not available to us by centralized exchanges, and only decentralized wallet can meet our needs.
Due to reasons known to all, some blockchain network are not so easy to create the accounts, even need a certain cost. EOS, for example, the operation of the EOS needs certain network resources, and network resources need to EOS, which means there are not convenient in operation. A good decentralized wallet can let we simply create our own accounts and solve the problem of operation.

With all that said, is there a decentralized wallet on the market that meets our needs? The answer, of course, is a decentralized wallet I'm using myself, the TokenPocket.
This wallet is a decentralized wallet that meets our transaction requirement, security requirement, and application requirement.
TokenPocket has a convenient legal currency trading channel, which can be directly converted into digital currency through alipay ,wechat or bank card. Moreover, the built-in TP exchange integrates with the mainstream exchange, so you can easily exchange your coins and send them to your account while obtaining the trading depth and the best trading price of the exchange.
In terms of security, TokenPocket is an open source decentralized wallet that you can export the private key, hold the private key in your own hand, and easily vote on the node without worrying about the harm to the community due to the misappropriation of the voting rights. And the wallet is integrated with a variety of pools, we can pledge our voting rights to gain benefits, while the coin are still in the wallet. Everything is the feeling of power in the hand.
TokenPocket is also very friendly to new users. If you don't already have an EOS account, you can buy it directly through paypal, alipay or wechat. TokenPocket also has a humanized solution to the resource problem of EOS account. After EOS1.8 released the resource payment function, TokenPocket launched a smooth mode, which can get a smooth EOS account experience by paying little fees. Moreover, TokenPocket has cooperated with many dapps, which makes it convenient to log in various dapps with a wallet account and experience the real blockchain world.

From March 26 to April 8, TokenPocket will hold an anniversary celebration activity. You can enjoy 20% discount if you buy a main network account such as EOS, according to the current price of EOS as long as less than 1 dollar. The transaction fee is as low as 50% discount. During the activity, login TokenPocket, enter the resource smooth mode, enter the exchange page, enter the general package code ""TP2ZN"", you can get 50TPT resource fee for free! A limited number of 10,000.

Dunno where this question belongs but here goes: As a personal project, I am writing computer code (python) to determine what the bitcoin price needs to be for my current bitcoin holdings to break even. I have written the code that strips data from the csv files (That part is easy enough). I just need to figure out the math behind working out the break even point. 

E.g. (using made up numbers): 

transaction 1: 0.001 BTC at 14000 AUD per BTC

transaction 2: 0.001 BTC at 14500 AUD per BTC

transaction 3: 0.0002 BTC at 10000 AUD per BTC

It just means that you can buy the factory during its bankruptcy proceedings. Therefore, giving money to Boeing amounts to protecting its existing shareholders and bondholders.

What exactly is the value in doing that?

It won't save jobs. There is no reason to believe that the new owner would lay off less or more staff than the existing one.

Most of the Fed's multi-trillion money printing currently goes to preventing existing shareholders and bondholders from being replaced by new ones.

What exactly is the social benefit in doing that?

I am very pro Bitcoin, but to me this seems like a glaring hole in the possibility of it ever being widely adapted. The vast majority of people need a loan to start a business or a mortgage to buy a house. But if Bitcoin were to ever be adapted then we couldn't operate off debt. How will people start businesses? How will hundreds of millions of people just some how make money appear out of thin air to pay for a home upfront?

Within a week, U.S. stocks melted twice, and crypto digital assets such as Bitcoin plummeted. This seems to indicate that the direction of global financial markets in 2020 will be extremely unstable. In this situation, traditional financial investment methods are not the most valuable means of financial management. AiOption Blockchain Binary Options Platform provides a new direction for financial investment, predicting the rise and fall of encrypted digital assets such as Bitcoin in a fixed period of time to obtain income.

Recently, AiOption, a professional blockchain binary options platform, announced that it has received tens of millions of dollars in financing.

If the transaction is expensive enough and before confirming it. The miner would get in contact with the sender with an encrypted  platform (the hashtag of the conversation is the Tx address by which both can find each other)

The platform could be as simple as tick-based interaction. You get a notification by the miner that you sent $x million worth of BTC. Would you like to confirm? you'd just tick to confirm, and there would  be an option to tip the miner for this extra confirmation service.  There will be no direct chatting but rather an option-based interface.

In this way, we did not compromise the anonymity of crypto and we added another layer of confirmation.

What do you guys think? I'm sure there are plenty of flaws in the idea but I think we need some sort of an added confirmation layer. My friend left crypto after his incident claiming it is complicated and money can be easily lost.",1585229399,31,1

fp8grp,jennifermiu,Is the bitcoin bubble about to burst?,"**Hi. Here is the BitOffer Analysis:**

Firstly, a financial bubble can be defined as “an increase in asset prices that can’t be justified by its fundamentals.”

So, an economic bubble is trading in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value. In our financial history, we have example of a typical bubble: Dutch Tulip Bulb Mania 1636-1637

How much of a bubble is Bitcoin? This is hard to know, as bubbles are often conclusively identified only in retrospect, once a sudden drop in prices has occurred.

As of now, several things are clear: bitcoin fundamentals are rapidly increasing every year, as there are thousands of brilliant open-source developers and contributors who are working hard on improving the Bitcoin ecosystem daily. On the other hand, Bitcoin certainly checks some characteristics of a bubble but it also has experienced numerous speculative boom and bust cycles (Bitcoin bubbles) in the past. Bitcoin is the only speculative product that has fallen to the bottom and been restarted several times in human history and it is a young asset class which go through numerous price bubbles.

Bitcoin is to altcoins, just like the US dollar is to emerging market currencies, except that the Bitcoin Open Miners Committee cannot unilaterally increase supply to offset the relative increase in demand.

Made me wonder why he would do that if the banking sector is frozen, withdrawals restricted, bail-ins ongoing and ATMs blocked.

Once banks are unusable that's literally where bitcoin steps in. You cant effectively conduct commerce with silver coins in the digital age. How are you going to pay your power bills and internet subscriptions? Let alone your software subscriptions etc. Mail in a few silver coins to Microsoft for your Office subscription? 

There will come a time where the boomers have protected their wealth with gold and silver but wont be able to partake in commerce, but with banks unusable and fiat crumbling the only way to conduct commerce and live will be by using bitcoin. Thats when all those boomers will try to buy bitcoin with their stacks of shiny yellow rocks.

Gold and Silver may be great for immediate protection during a deep financial crisis or inflationary depression, but coming out the other end as the world moves towards a new resilient financial system built on open source global software protocols bitcoin will be far more important to own.

Not only will bitcoin win short term because it is more scarce and more usable as money in the digital age, but it will also win long term for the same reasons. Perhaps Gold ends up relegated to becoming a safe haven from quantum computing attacks against bitcoin.

Gold: Always a potential short term safe haven but never the main means of commerce.",1585207686,12,1

Dear Soldiers, Airmen, military family members, retirees and Veterans,

It has been an honor to serve you amid the global disruption caused by COVID-19. As the virus spreads, the Army &amp; Air Force Exchange Service is taking precautions to protect the health and safety of our Nation’s heroes. But we need your help.

Studies show that paper money and coins can harbor bacteria and viruses long after they change hands. We are asking Exchange shoppers to help in the fight against the transmission of COVID-19 through increased reliance on bank-issued credit and debit, MILITARY STAR® or gift cards instead of cash. Please note that cash-back and check-cashing transactions may be unavailable during this time.

While some Exchanges may transition to a card-only environment as local needs dictate, we ask that shoppers minimize the use of cash regardless of location. Customers in need of cash transactions or services can contact their local Exchange to inquire about the status of such transactions at their nearest location.

On behalf of the Exchange, thank you for joining us in the fight against the spread of COVID-19. We are in this together!

Sincerely,

Jim Jordan

fr7xm2,mimblezimble,Designing a formula to limit the amount at risk with a peer-to-peer counterparty,"When you trade on a p2p (peer-to-peer) market, the platform will escrow the bitcoins traded. That is a good protection but it is not failsafe. The buyer of the bitcoins could still try to fraudulently charge back from Paypal (which is notorious for that problem), the banking system, or other payment providers.

A bitcoin-buying counterparty is less risky:

1. The more trades he has executed successfully
2. The longer he has been trading on the platform
3. The larger the amounts he has been trading successfully
4. The more difficult it is to reverse payments in the fiat-payment method
5. possibly other reasons

It would be useful to design a formula based on these criteria to warn the bitcoin seller that he is taking too much risk in accepting to sell too large an amount of bitcoins to a buyer with a given profile.

Another problem is the dispute resolution procedure.

There is no failsafe method for the buyer to provide conclusive evidence that he has made a payment. The only payment providers that I know of, which readily allow an external moderator to verify that the seller has been paid by a buyer, are companies like Western Union and Moneygram.

The banking system does not readily allow a third party to provide a particular transaction number to a public website in order to check if the transaction was successfully paid or not. Solid fiat payment confirmation would certainly be possible, and not even hard to implement, but the banks do not want to provide that service to their customers. 

Lack of payment confirmation complicates the trade, and not just the trade in bitcoin. Paper fiat currencies and fiat banks are incredibly inefficient, as they fail at providing even this most trivial service. 

So, how does a moderator in an multisignature bitcoin escrow transaction actually know whether he should side with the buyer or with the seller?

The reason why the BTC&lt;-&gt;fiat exchange, and even commerce in general, are so hard to secure, is caused by the incredible technological inferiority of the fiat banking system.

Besides a formula to limit the amount at risk, what other duct tape, iron wire, and other workarounds can we dream up to mitigate the problem?",1585497039,0,1

Zhang Jian, founder of Chinese crypto exchange Fcoin, revealed in a [post](https://fcoin.zendesk.com/hc/zh-cn/articles/360043503273-FCoin%E7%9C%9F%E7%9B%B8?from=timeline&amp;isappinstalled=0) On February 17. Zhang Jian's ‘[Truth announcement](https://fcoin.zendesk.com/hc/zh-cn/articles/360043503273-FCoin%E7%9C%9F%E7%9B%B8?from=timeline&amp;isappinstalled=0)’ seemed to put a bomb in the market. Before that, because the team lost contact for many days, the scandal of the team's dissolution was already rumoured for several days. Now, after the scandal that ""FCoin may not be able to pay the 7,000-13,000 BTC"" broke out, the only illusion left by investors is finally broken.

In July 2018, Fcoin began the community-based governance. Last October, FMEX, a contract trading platform owned by FT ECOLOGY, officially launched. However, the FMEX daily volume fell from the day of launch, which was astonishing. Coincidentally, in the same month, the public chain project aelf was also involved in rumors that the aelf team had dissolved the wechat community, which indicates that the team might be facing dissolving.

As it turned out, however, the decentralized cloud computing blockchain network project, aelf, wasn't dissolving, but attempted to return to the community by playing down the influence of the founding team.

FCoin, on the other hand, which claimed to be community-based governance, eventually collapsed because of Zhang Jian's team's terrible decision making, and has again raised questions about decentralization and community governance. Is it a false proposition to give back to the community? Should blockchain projects really be decentralized?

# Giving back to the community = Escaping with money?

Communitization was once regarded as the biggest ""Feature"" of FCoin.

Over the past year, FCoin has set up Social Committees, Basic Regulations, Community Partnership System, Community Discipline Supervision Committee, Community Organization Departments, and Professional Committees that cover a wide range of talents. Together with the collective decision-making + Division of Labor and Cooperation Mechanism formed by the Social Committee, it seems that FCoin's decision-making has basically achieved community-owned and community-driven.

Judging from the completeness of the mechanism, FCoin stands out among all the blockchain projects/teams on the market. However, it was not until FCoin crashed that people realised that this platform, where decision making is handed over to the community and community governance is implemented, has had a serious payment crisis for a long time. But this fact was not known to the community, leading to the outside world believing that FCoin was functioning properly, and there was no omen for the final collapse.

It makes you wonder: Did FCoin really give back to the community? Over the past two years, following the large drop in the blockchain markets, many projects were nominally ""de-centralized"", but in reality, were simply exit-scams. After such things happen over and over again, people have concerns about the team's loss of contact and giving back to the community. However, the ultimate collapse of FCoin, which advocated community focus, undoubtedly puts a big black spot on community-owned and community-driven projects.

There is a reason why investors continue to accumulate doubts. Last May, ONO, a blockchain project, was shut down and its founder was accused of starting a new business. However, the founders later publicly responded that the project is still ongoing and they were working on the ONO innovation model, which is expected to be launched in December.

But until now, we haven't seen any new developments in the project, and the founder has long disappeared. Even if project decentralization is seriously stigmatized, in the crypto world, there are many projects that fulfill the dream of giving it back to the community.

# Why do people still believe in decentralization?

BCH's Infrastructure Funding Plan have been the hotly debated. the proportion of Miners' donations are also updated with community recommendations. and miners and developers can also vote on and participate in decisions-making about proposals that affect their vital interests.

Last month Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, a well known project, said in public that from a technical perspective, Ethereum is certain to survive because of the number of well coordinated developers. However, from the social perspective, he is not very sure. BUTERIN's statement also shows us how important a founder can be in a blockchain project. 

During the second half of 2019, aelf was involved in the rumors. On October 21 last year, several wechat groups whose name including aelf suddenly disbanded. Due to the endless occurrence of exiting with money in blockchain projects, investors began to worry about whether the aelf team has dissolved.

However, the follow-up situation proves that the decentralized cloud computing blockchain network project is not dissolving, **but was trying to return to the community by downplaying the role of teams.**

We found ‘aelf community’, a WeChat official accounts platform, keeps tracking aelf project's progress. While there had been rumours that aelf had disbanded in the last quarter of last 2019. But in fact, during this period, aelf has been providing regular updates of the progress about its R &amp; D and ecological construction to the outside world.

For example, the day after the rumor spread, aelf announced that it would launch the public test with awards for the aelf Enterprise 0.8.0 beta. On Oct 29th, aelf Enterprise was officially listed on Google Cloud Marketplace. Up to now, it has launched on Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Cloud Azure and Huawei Cloud platforms, and has become Amazon AWS and Huawei Cloud Technology partners, providing a more efficient, convenient and high-quality development environment for enterprise users (supporting multi cloud operation). Besides, Team members also continue to make their voices heard in international media or events.

On the other hand, aelf is also promoting its technology’s R &amp; D. From the GitHub code base of aelf, we can see that the code development of aelf has been steadily active since the second half of last year.

Another perspective, from Dec 2019 to Feb 2020, aelf successively released aelf Enterprise V0.9.0 and aelf enterprise V 0.9.2. It is known that aelf Enterprise, a blockchain commercialization solution featuring ""Independence, Efficiency and Security"", can be used by all industries involved in value transfer to build the underlying blockchain. It is especially suitable for solving the problem of high cost of maintaining credit in business cooperation scenarios such as aviation, tourism, financial services, real estate, logistics, etc.

In addition, aelf seems to have some achievements on theoretical research. On 17 Feb. 2020, aelf officially launched the aelf Economy and Governance White Paper, which describes the various roles and interests in the ecosystem, including the rights of production nodes, candidate nodes, investors, developers and cooperation rules. 

Decentralization is not without a bright future. The founder of Bitcoin disappeared for a decade, and bitcoin operated normally for that time. Ethereum has successfully built a prosperous ecosystem, which is not only the credit of Buterin and the Ethereum foundation, but also the credit to the tens of thousands of ecosystem participants such as developers, miners, token holders, etc.

We don't deny that there are a lot of blockchain projects that are secretly taking investors’ funds in the name of community and decentralization. Now, with FCoin falling in this fundamental crisis, ""Give it back to the community"" is once again ridiculed by the public. But in fact, compared with the teams that boast to ‘Give it back to the community’, they are actually often still centralization.

Rome can't be built in a day. It's probably the safest way to gradually give up decision-making power and move towards community-based governance. At present, we do see a lot of blockchain projects, still groping for a properly motivated, sustainable way to do business, and firmly practicing the initial desire of decentralization.",1585467788,4,1

I'm currently working on an application that utilizes calls to the bitcoin-rpc service (via bitcoin-core).  I noticed that sometimes there are transactions that when you call decoderawtransaction you will receive a list of VOUTs that have a value greater than 0 (meaning not nulldata) yet don't reference the destination address. 

&amp;#x200B;

In particular, i'm talking about a VOUT like this: 

{

""value"": 0.00010000,

I’m trying to deposit via debit card or ACH. But both are saying “you can only withdraw your funds (including the equivalent crypto) from ACH and debit card deposits after 10 days”.

Wtf? This means every time I want to load from my bank to send to someone else I have to wait 10 days? Since when does it even take 10 days for this anyways? Maximum clearance I’ve ever heard is 5 days (usually 3). Seems absurd. 

Is there a way to circumvent this with an alternative means of funding account other than ACH or debit card so that I can immediately send? Only way I can think of is using say local to have someone else send to me and I send them via some other means. But I don’t want to do this yet. What happened to the mantra that “debit is the same as cash”? 

About wire transfers: my bank charges large fee ($25) each time. Does anyone have experience using Transferwise for it? Does it reduce this fee significantly? It’s domestic (USD).

fqu1pe,BitcoinCanSaveUsAll,How could it be?,"How could it be that Bitcoin, (the first truly finite asset in human history) whos competition is fiat currency, accurately be expressed in USD (or any other fiat currency) when the USD is the world's reserve currency?  I mean think about what just happened this week. The amount of US dollars that was created out of thin air in front of the entire world with no regard to the masses and the hyperinflation this will reign in was just put out there for everyone to see front and center. And what did the price of Bitcoin do in USD? Well if you look at all the statistics (UTXOs increasing, the halving right around the corner, etc you would naturally assume that the value in US dollars went through the roof for bitcoin. But of course that's not the case.

I firmly believe that this is due to the fact that the same entities that control the US dollar production (banks) are also in control of the major Bitcoin exchanges (aka the on and off ramps to the Bitcoin world). They control the u.s. dollar value of Bitcoin by various tactics including having technical issues when the price of Bitcoin gets outside of their control, putting into place maximum withdrawal limits on their exchanges, relying on the fact that the masses are still unaware of what Bitcoin is and how to take physical possession of the Bitcoin in a way that is secure , and many others such as rehypothification, commingling, bots which trade back and forth on their exchanges, large buys on OTC markets which don't influence spot markets coupled with government backed future markets going short, the list goes on and on.

Guess what? At the end of the day there are only 18.x million bitcoin in existence. Once the collective societal light bulbs go off they will lose all of their abilities to mislead people into thinking that there is any correlation of bitcoin to any of the markets which are pegged in US dollars!  This will become clear as day when people understand that those US Dollars which are trying to express the value of all assets around the world are literally infinite (which was just confirmed this week by POTUS).

How could it be that we continue to go on working for fiat currency that can be created (inflated) by someone at a whim while we sell our entire lives for them and pay taxes when they can just be created like that?!  It's something that has no real value of any kind other than what they say that it does. Well I believe that Bitcoin is the answer and I will continue to buy and HODL while holding my own keys for as long as possible regardless of whatever the price does in USD. I don't care if it goes down in US dollars to zero I will buy all of them! This is in my view the only opportunity we have as a society to break free from the control of these power hungry, technology quashing, self interest serving human rights violating, war morgerers.

fqrqfm,Megaskreth,An interesting tactic that governments could use to save/transition their economy and save their people.,"If governments were smart they could ease their people into Bitcoin by accelerating their acceptance and using their fiat liquidity to push the price up while people dip their toes in and as more and more people onboard and more governments, institutions, corporations etc. start accepting crypto there will be less and less need for people to dump back into fiat which will make the price more and more stable. Over time as the fiat becomes lesser in value the governments can hold onto more of the cryptocurrency that people pay them for taxes. This could in theory allow governments to actually start paying off the debts they've amassed over the last hundred+ years without borrowing more and more. If they could just get over themselves they could use this tech to actually break free from the central banks. Correct me if I'm wrong but this seems the most logical way for us to utilize this tech to better the world. They could create their own tax coin network that could link with other blockchains and allow for them to harvest their own tx fees from other networks by requiring corporations to register their blockchain wallets and monitoring those for tx and charge a small percent per tx be paid in their tax coin. This could be instant and allow for efficient tax collection and allow for real time stream payments to governments and reduce their need for lots of bureaucracy. They could charge exchanges very small fees per tx and allow for them to stop income taxes altogether since they wouldn't need to borrow from central banks.",1585426952,8,4

Given the current economical situation, here is my theory on the next ATH of Bitcoin (and maybe other alts):

The ultimate viability test for Bitcoin as a safe asset will be its behavior during a future recession/depression. If stocks will retrace and Bitcoin will stall or even grow, pleople will suddenly see it as a safety belt for heavy drops in the markets. Bitcoin's eventual resilience during a global bearmarket will validate it as a serious alternative for portfolios' diversification and suddenly all funds, from retailers to big hedgers will admit that not having some Bitcoins in there is a greater risk than having. They won't have to love it or to become maximalists, but to just allocate a tiny percentage of their portfolios as an extra hedge for rainy days.

On the other hand, if Bitcoin will retrace down along with - say - SP&amp;500/DOW etc., it will be regarded as a growth and speculative asset instead of a safe haven/hedge.

If my idea is valid, the end of the next recession will be the leading indicator for the next Bitcoin rally

We'll see. All I dream is Bitcoin remain relatively stable during the next financial crisis. If it will even grow during those times, this will be a bonus and a crucial step to the moon.",1583677162,14,1

ffckgf,WorkingLime,"Venezuela update. Last week 375 BTC (lowest since march 2018) were traded using LocalBitcoin which is 241,895,000,000 Bs. Minimum wage is around 6 USD per month. One BTC is 617,000,000 Bs. (Bolivares). AMA.","This week there was a drop in the trade volume using LocaBitcoin (two weeks ago was around 500 BTC per week)

These volumes are only measured using Localbitcoin (LBTC) using their API (Coindance). Big part of that exchange come from Venezuelans that live abroad and send money to their families, miners, people that get paid in cryptos (freelancing) and even the own government. It is around 2000 BTC per month.

Other exchanges and other trades were done, but no way of measure them.

Today exchange rate is around 1 USD = 73,000 Bs. (Official rate is almost the same)

Minimum wage (which is earned by a big chuck of the population, not like other countries) is 250,000 Bs. wage (less than 3 USD) + 200,000 Bs. food bonus (less than 3 USD) PER MONTH.

Biggest bank note is 50,000 Bs. which is around 0.75 USD. You need to use debit and credit, bank transfer, cryptos and USD to pay anything.

Here in Venezuela situation is really hard, some people dont believe that amount is the minimum MONTHLY wage. I work and earn more than that (anyway, the amount is really low, I'm sure with that amount I would be living homeless in Colombia, Peru or Panama for example), usually get some donations from redditors and do some freelancing work (translating mostly) and it is really hard to keep up daily.

Run your own node, dollar cost average bitcoin with your discretionary income , and as soon as possible move your BTC into your own wallets.

ffca22,Gr33nn,"BTC, my story so far"," BTC is a story of disobedience, liberation, greed a story of dreams hopes and fears a story of mystery filled with facts and lies. A humble beginning lead to an explosion of opportunity. Satoshi reminds me a bit of Jonas Salk and his vaccine... A gift to the world that reflects our own nature.
I'm not trying to convince you all, I feel like a crazy prophet, or maybe like Diogennis walking naked in the streets of Athens holding a lantern in the daylight looking for REAL people. I do the same at work ( I work for big oil Corp) instead of the safety moment I present facts about the coin and I know people think I'm nuts and I let them go back on FB and online shopping carts and Instagram posting pics of their food but at least I tried... 
Our generation has been penetrated by a HUGE black cock, no lube we just bent over and let them Fuck us all day long and we smile, make another selfie and if we hear somebody screaming we look the other way. We just OBEY...
I don't come from money and my parents sacrifized a lot for me to get a good education but I saw my country being destroyed, sold, raped and rediculled. I saw my dad at the age of 65 being humiliated and betrayed. From a succesfull businessman they reduced over night to a beggar. My mom at the age of 55 forced to a new career as a cleaner working for 3€ per hour just trying to help my family to go by. No respect, no dignity they just wait to die. And for what ?? They haven't done anything wrong, they haven't taken any loans they haven't spent money on clothes, cars or luxuries they were just fucked... Now they are just empty cells waiting to die... I left my country and went to study to the rich North Europeans with work experience, a BSc and a MSc in business and economics. I was laughed on my face by highschool graduate recruiters for being Greek and repeatedly asked to to pay them back, why we don't pay taxes and all the media propaganda they had served on the dinner table next to their potatoes and cabbage. I started working as a mail man, a trash collector a warehouse cleaner having no house, being taking advantage in every turn, they tried to screw me any chance they had, me the penny less hard working guy who had a dream to study, live and work in this country. 
I was never bitter, big smile, open hugs and ready to work 2-3 jobs at the same time to support my self and my parents. Never complained, never slept more than 3-4 hours never spoke back to the irony and abuse even from people I was calling friends. 
Fast forward 11 yrs later... From 2009 to 2020....
I am working for a big petroleum corporation making 100k, haven't bought anything more expensive than 500$, living with roommates in a student house, never eat out. I usually have 0 expense Monday to Friday. Shop on weekend, prep all my meals at home, healthy and cheap. Don't buy coffee and all these little expenses that people around me consider musts in the daily routine and only travel by bicycle.  
I cannot keep money in the bank because the maximum until recently was 20k for more than that u have to pay extra tax, for 20k I get 20€ return per year...cool!
What BTC has to do with all that ? Back on 2011 a friend mentioned to me BTC for the first time and attract my attention... The reason was not the potential, the investment, the things I know now.  It was a way to buy high quality drugs from Silkroad... I forgot to mention that I LOVE drugs... Weed, Charlie LSD, Mushrooms,MDMA and the list goes on and on... I'm am not an addictive personality so I guess I'm lucky, I can just abuse themanytime I want and then go cold Turkey until I'm in the mood again...So we were getting coins buying shit online 1€=1Btc more or less and life was great. 
A few years later and having established connections I had stopped with Silkroad but still has a few coins forgotten in the wallet.
Long story short, I sold em on 2017 for around 100k$. Couldn't believe my luck as I thought them as a bubble, a scam or whatever. When I was on holiday with BTC money I had a lot of free time and started reading about the accident that offered me all that money... And then I realized that the coin is the BOMB (I am not going to go to deep analysis here pls contact me if u are interested for sources where u can do your own research. I'm more than happy to help).
Today after putting 90% of everything I have, including 60% of my salary every month accumulating more coins, trading a bit but mainly holding I could just stop working tomorrow and have enough to live for the rest of my life, I'm frugal and I could even leave money to charity. I keep going though, maybe I'm greedy maybe this journey has not been completed yet. I strongly believe that BTCs value will increase by a lot based on the technology, adoption, huge investments on the project. It is the way to go forward from socioeconomic point of view, same as the beginning of the internet but this time we control the game, we play the music, we the people, we HODL we mine, we prove our work, we are transparent and clean we are gonna be bigger than them, bigger than the banks, bigger than their influence, we are gonna be free at last!",1583672763,0,1
ffbzhs,nick-bravo,"""Have you thought about trading cryptocurrency futures to take a negative position on bitcoin?"", Warren Buffett: ""No, I get into enough problems with things that I think I know something about, why in the world would I take a long or short position of something that I don't know anything about?""","Excerpt from an interview:

Reporter: ""Have you thought about trading cryptocurrency futures to take a negative position on bitcoin?""

Warren Buffett: ""No, I get into enough problems with things that I think I know something about, why in the world would I take a long or short position of something that I don't know anything about?""

Yet, in the same interview, Buffett also states that: ""In terms of cryptocurrencies, genereally, I can almost say with certainty that they will come to a bad ending.""

And further that: ""We don't own any, we don't short any, we'll never have a position in them.""

These statements are contradictory. He says that he doesn't understand it, yet he claims that he can say with certainty that it will have ""a bad ending"" (whatever that means). Still, he would shy away from taking a position.

Has he formed somewhat more of a consistent opinion nowadays and expressed it?

ffa5f1,eayollie,looking on some explanation on lightning network,"I'm looking for a brief explanation of the lightning network and payment channels in general. I've been following the topics and I think I am a little bit confused in my general understanding. 

From what I understand is the lightning channel is established between two nodes and essentially you let your transactions be double signed. And there's also some kind of routing option to use intermediary hops to transact with somebody you don't have a direct connection with, and eventually you bring those double signed transactions to bitcoin to make the ledger update your balance.

Now what I'm a little bit confused about is the terminology and what is what and how it works:

\- what is a channel exactly? Is it a tcp/ip channel that is directly connected to somebody else's node or is it something more abstract  
\- when you want to participate in the network do you actually fund your node or do you fund a channel?

Can anybody give me some brief explanations on the basics of this topic? For your reference, I have a background in software development so feel to call things what they actually are.",1583658522,38,1

1. Block reward hits 0
2. Miners go offline because they can't profit
3. Difficulty adjusts accordingly
4. A small fraction of previous hashpower is capable of maintaining profitability
5. Btc is now much less secure because fees on a 1mb block are far smaller than block rewards

fc8bhz,Creepycranfield3,Middle Men.,"Hi you’ve all heard the phrase bitcoin does away with Banking middle men, in fact Bitcoin can or is touted as a way to also do away with other middle men.

Personally I don’t like middle men, they’re scavengers, sharks, vampires sucking money in fees from the desperate public who often don’t have a choice.

So let’s take a look at middle men, employment agencies the scum of the earth middle men, facts are at one time there would maybe only have been a few large companies who practiced in this field but now there are thousands and thousands, and the more there are the more wages in the market place for the workers become suppressed or they may even drop.

Next there are post your construction job web sites where the company take fees for passing a clients number onto a trade professional, money for nothing middle men, vampire bloodsucking the wages out of people pockets.

So we can clearly see society has more middle men now than at any point in history because it’s been made available by technology through fancy websites and tools to make these things less seamless.

And the biggest point to this is that the public LOVE THEM, they can’t get enough of middle men, even governments love them because they take the strain and work load especially in the jobs market away from them the government.

Can Blockchain fix middle men?
Can Bitcoin fix middle men outside the Banking sector?

So I see a world different to the be your own bank!

I see a world where the public like middle men, they’re deluded that it’s easier, cheaper and less hassle.

Is Bitcoin so easy to sell to a public with that mind set the public have, even if it has no chance of fixing the ills of MIDDLE MEN completely throughout society, and can only fix the greed of middle men bankers is that change.

I personally can’t see the public on mass buying in to Bitcoin as they’re lazy and until you really look you don’t see it.

Middle men begone! But I doubt it anytime soon.",1583132690,13,1

They've informed me I should first go to a bitcoin ATM, and then I can use either my cash or card to purchase bitcoin, then go to the bitcoin ATM account and have things settled.

My main concern is I don't know how this works at all, and what the odds of being scammed are and how they can just run off with my purchased bitcoin?

Is there a way to recover the wallet?

fc0xpq,grimeflea,Coin Anonymity,"Something I’ve read little scraps about here and there is the risk of having anonymous coins.

Does anyone have any real experience or knowledge on what can happen if you by non-KYC BTC?

I realise if you buy p2p you might not know if you’re getting tainted coin, but besides that, let’s assume you get clean anonymous coin, what are the real risks?

I’ve read about someone saying they had a bank account frozen after they cashed out anonymous coin, because they couldn’t prove a valid identifiable purchase through an exchange. Is this really likely?

I’ve also heard that exchanges can pick up if you have tainted coin and could block you from trading with them, so that you’re left to go back to a p2p system. Any truth in that?

I guess long term, if you want to steer clear of potential trouble where the IRS or HMRC  or another tax body could (in future) track your transactions, it’s best to go with a reputable KYC exchange and trust you’re getting clean coin that you can prove you own legitimately?

HMRC launched a contract this year for someone to help them develop a means of tracking users and transactions so they can identify tax fraud, laundering and other illegal activities. So it appears to me it’s best to start out playing by the book, even if you don’t think you’ll do anything with your coin for 10+ years.",1583097886,6,1

fczv0c,5RMiller,Bitcoin - Markets Correlation,"Sitting at home, watching the markets and bitcoin, cruising reddit,  and was just thinking, What if...

Bitcoin is behaving like the stock market because it's beng treated by its users like a digital commodity rather than a safe haven, right now at least.

The massive pullback in markets, the possible threat of a recession without a V shaped recovery. Whatever the reason may be that you think the markets were/are dropping - covid19, over leveraged options traders, was to far from long term averages, was a long time coming,  any other reasons... 

Bitcoin did not act as digital gold or any kind of safe haven  when the markets fell. Does that mean it's not Digital gold, I would say No it does not mean that, but also Yes it does. What if Bitcoin followed the markets down because not enough people are CURRENTLY using bitcoin as a store of value vs the number who are over leveraged trying to trade it so its acting exactly how people are using it instead of how it was ""intended"" or how it may work in the future some day.

Alot more people today use and know about bitcoin in a worldwide perspective and this is positive. Still, just the other day I asked a friend if he knew anyone who had any crypto they wanted to sell me, he told me I was the only person he knew who delt with it. This got me thinking, first of all, that I need more friends, second of all, maybe the numbers arent big enough yet of people who really ""believe"" in bitcoin, let's face it for bitcoin to succeed as a store of value and not a commodity it needs belief not more speculators looking to convert their massive gains to fiat after selling to a greater fool. 

So of the people who do currently use bitcoin, out of 7 Billion on earth, aparently none live around me, but how many are actually using it like they would if they were to buy gold. Not trading it daily or weekly or monthly looking to lock in gains, or waiting for it to moon like buying thier favorite low cap stock. I mean actually purchasing it with the intention being to hedge, like they would gold, is it 10%, 20, 50, 80% of bitcoins daily buyers? You, the 1 person who took your very valuable time to read this barley understandable post, Why did you buy it?...Were you in on it back in the day because you believed it was the future of money, did you hear about it on the news in 2017 and think,  ""I like big gains"", did you know about it much earlier but didnt actually get involved until you heard it on the news?, be honest. My story is the last one, I knew about it very very early from playing World of Warcraft, had some bitcoin when it was worth next to nothing, lost it or sold it, I dont remember and then didnt pay much attention to it again until 2014 and then again in mid 2017 when I started buying...

My GUESS is, more than half of the people who currently hold any amount of bitcoin got in because they want to make $, who doesn't want more $ ? and the plan is to make their amazing gains and cash out to fiat, even if they've been waiting 3 years for those gains. The problem is the more people who are introduced to Bitcoin because of its price moves and astronomical price targets (that's just what gets clicks) the more will look at it similar to investing in a stock or commodity, just a digital one that their crypto news site says is going to 100k, who hoo - guaranteed money!!!!

My thought is this, maybe instead of people putting labels to bitcoin like ""digital gold"" or ""store of value"" or the ""future"" of money/payments, and telling others, THIS is what bitcoin IS (as if they somehow have this special knowledge) Bitcoin should already have proven that's what it is because that's what everyone uses it for.

Bitcoin to me at least, seems to be figuring itself out as things go along, the more people use it as a store of value,  the more stable it would get, but at the moment the more people that are using it to speculate on highly leveraged exchange accounts, the more it will behave like the stock market. I'm not saying it will stay this way,  bitcoin in its life has flip flopped around with no certain signs as to what it will eventually be, but if it stays stuck to market action like it is now, and the markets don't have a V shaped recovery, does any believe the bitcoin/usd price wouldn't crash with it?

fdm3zq,208_nate,Making a short film that needs to be accurate!,"Hey everyone! 

This seemed like a good place to start. My brother and I are filmmakers and are writing a short that plays out as follows (skip to the end for the problems we're running into).

•Main character is left $100 dollars of Bitcoin in his uncle's will. 
•He's not technical but is so broke he has to figure out how to cash out
•He realizes his uncle actually bought $100 of Bitcoin in 2010 and it is now worth MILLIONS
•Because he's not technical he struggles to figure out how to access it 
•When he does access it he trusts a bad website and gets scammed out of the coins. 

2-3 MINUTES

QUESTIONS:

1) In 2010, when the uncle would have purchased, were there wallets? If so, was it complicated to access. We are finding conflicting info online

2) What are the main ways people have lost their coins? Like, scams, bad addresses, etc. I have Crypto and anytime I've transferred them it gives me a heart attack

3) if there's a good website or blog that could lay out the technical history for us that'd be incredibly helpful.

fdk5yy,blevok,"I got tired of using a spreadsheet for calculating DCA, so i made an android app","I'm a hodler, and i made this for my own personal use, but half way through i realized it could be useful to others that do DCA, and with just a little more work i could make it store worthy, so i went ahead and did it.  
It's free, with no limits on time or the number of things it can store, but i did add some extra features for purchase so i could maybe make a few bucks from it. More about that in a minute.  
  
Here's a play store link: [DC Averagizer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blevok.DCAveragizer)  
Sorry no iphone or windows version right now.  
  
It's not that i hate using excel or anything, it's just that my DCA buys have become less exciting and more of a standard procedure when i see a dip. I don't spend all day looking at charts anymore, and i don't need to over complicate things. I just wanted the quick convenience of a dedicated app.  
  
I did look for other apps in the store, are there are a bunch, but none of the ones i tried were very suited to crypto. They were cluttered with other investing features, and only showed 2 decimal places, among other issues. So i figured the only way to get exactly what i want is to make it myself.  
  
So this app does one thing and one thing only, it calculates my DCA and stores the info for all my crypto buys and sells. And it always shows all values to the eighth decimal place.  
I made two sections. One for doing quick calculations with just the price and quantity. And another ""portfolio"" section that stores all the relevant info, like coin name, ticker, currency, buy/sell dates, and a note section in case i want to enter what exchange it's on or what wallet it's stored in.  
  
I know most of the free world loves dark themes, so i made the default theme be dark. But i'm no artist, so if you think it looks god awful, i added other theme options as a ""pro unlock"". I made bitcoin and ethereum themes using some of their official colors, and i also made a theme customizer so you can make it look however you want.  
And the pro unlock also includes backup and restore, because i don't want to loose all the data if i get a new phone or have to reset my phone.   
  
As far as security, there really isn't much to worry about, because it's not meant to store passwords, private keys, credit card numbers, or anything else like that. But just to be perfectly clear, DON'T STORE YOUR PRIVATE KEYS IN THE NOTES. Always be safe and smart with your keys, passwords, etc. There's no reason to store that stuff in an app like this, it's just a calculator.  
  
And while i've got your attention, i just want to say that you should never store private keys or seed words digitally, and never take a picture of them. Especially if you use a ledger/trezor. The point of a hardware wallet is that the keys are never exposed to your computer and it's viruses, the keys only exist on the internal circuitry of the device and on paper as a backup. Typing those words into a computer/phone defeats the whole purpose of using a hardware wallet in the first place. (i'm very security conscious, so feel free to chat me up about that if you want. i won't consider it thread hijacking or anything)  
  
Okay back to the app. If you use the backup feature, then obviously it will need storage permission, but you can revoke that permission right after you save your backup and it will not affect the app in any other way. And it will only ask for that permission if you actually try to use backup/restore.  
  
Again, i started this project for my own personal use, and it does everything i need it to do, but if any of you decide to check it out and find an important feature missing, just let me know and i'll consider updating it. And of course if you find any bugs, i'll try to fix them asap.",1583357560,9,1

fdjqdl,eleanorcwhite,Building Ergo: UTXO vs Account,"Ergo  takes the most secure and best-established features  of Bitcoin and  implements advanced new cryptographic features on its  rock-solid  foundations. This series explores the choices we have made in  creating  Ergo, with the first article unpacking the advantages of the  UTXO  model.

When you’re dealing with  financial value, you cannot afford to take  chances. Every architecture  decision in a cryptocurrency platform has  implications. While there are  different ways to solve the same problem,  some solutions are better  tested and more reliable than others.

Like  Bitcoin, Ergo uses the ‘UTXO’ (unspent transaction outputs)  model,  rather than the Account model used by platforms like Ethereum.  There  are a number of reasons why we have made this choice, but first  it’s  worth explaining a little about how the UTXO or ‘Box’ model works.

Most  people think that the balance of an account is a simple number  that is  updated when you send or receive funds. This is the obvious way  to  approach the problem; after all, it is effectively how money works in   the real world. Your bank account has a balance that is increased or   decreased when different transfers are made in and out. This is how the   ‘Account’ model operates: your balance on the blockchain is altered by   transactions to and from the account.

How much dough?

The  UTXO model, pioneered by Bitcoin, is quite different. You can  think of  this a bit like a person holding a series of lumps of bread  dough.  Their balance is the sum of these lumps, or UTXOs. Lumps can be  divided  or combined, before they are sent to a new address, but you  always  know where they came from. For example:

Alice  has 100g of bread dough (100 ERG). She breaks off a lump of 75g  and  gives it to Bob, keeping 25g of ‘change’ for herself. Charlie has 250g  of dough. He breaks off 150g and gives it to Bob,  keeping 100g of  change for himself. Bob breaks 20g of dough off the 150g lump he  received from Charlie, and  combines the resulting 130g with the 75g he  received from Alice. He  gives the total of 205g to Dave, keeping the  20g change for himself. Dave now has 205g of bread dough, which used to  belong to Charlie.  Before Charlie owned it, 75g used to belong to  Alice, while 130g used to  belong to Bob.

In  the UTXO model, ‘lumps’ of coins can be combined and divided, but   unlike bread dough, they aren’t mixed together. You can follow the   history of funds right back to the coinbase transaction in which those   coins were first mined. That’s very different to the Account model,   where the balance of each account is simply changed. (You can, of   course, check the blockchain to make sure the Account says what it   should, but that’s not intrinsically necessary like it is with the UTXO   approach.)

Why UTXO?

The  UXTO model has several implications. For a start, each object is   immutable – lumps of coins cannot be ‘edited’ like an Account balance is   edited when a transaction is made. The balance is calculated from the   transaction history, right back to the point those coins first came  into  existence.

That makes  security much simpler, because either a UTXO exists in the  form you are  expecting, or it does not exist at all. With the account  model, you  need to carefully check that the account you’re dealing with  is in the  state it should be (and developers typically don’t do that  properly).  This also makes UTXOs more friendly for offchain protocols,  like  sidechains and the Lightning Network.

Accounts  make it easier to store the ‘state’, but easy doesn’t always  mean  better. With Ergo’s extended UTXO model, state transitions are  more  explicit and so they are cleaner – there are no unwanted surprises.  It  might be a little bit more burdensome to deal with, but it’s a lot   better and more straightforward in terms of security.",1583355878,2,1

fgegrq,Lumin8_Crypto,Crypto Algorithm Trading – To Algo Or NOT To Algo. That Is The Question?,"I have spent a year and a half working on a Cryptocurrency Algorithm. This Algorithm gives trading signals for buying and selling Cryptocurrency. The questions are when should you follow the Algorithm, and when should you ignore the Algorithm? How can you make the right decision? Trading with a Cryptocurrency Algorithm is a bit like following the weather report. The weather report is not always an accurate measure of what the weather will do. A weather report is an educated guess as to what will happen outside. A trading Algorithm is programmed to consider specific information before making a recommendation. Understanding what the Algorithm measures and the weaknesses of the Algorithm can help you make wise decisions about when to follow and when not to follow an Algorithm.

fge5g6,SimpleSwapExchange,Bitcoin and Market Volatility,"## What is volatility?

Volatility is a statistical measure that helps to evaluate how secure some asset is. It shows the change in the asset's price when it raises or falls to fast, too often. The higher the volatility the harder it is to predict price change, so the asset becomes less desirable.

## What is Bitcoin volatility?

Cryptocurrency is being influenced by a lot of factors. Thus users are able to witness price fluctuations. The phenomenon of volatility exists in the crypto market as well as in the traditional market. For the traditional assets there is the Volatility Index, which became available for Bitcoin as well. 

It is said that Bitcoin has high volatility, which means that its price changes very fast for a wide range of reasons. There are several reasons why the crypto market, and Bitcoin market in particular, is so volatile:

* **Crypto market is young**

There are no enough participants on the market now. Mass adaption will make it more stable.

* **Low liquidity** 

Liquidity shows the number of participants that are buying and selling the asset, and how easy it is to participate in the process. In comparison with the traditional market crypto market liquidity is low. 

* **Lack of regulation**

The Crypto market is poorly regulated. On the one hand, it is a good thing. This is a direct consequence of decentralization. On the other hand, this makes the crypto market more unstable.

* **Speculation**

Since there is no regulation, the crypto market is available for speculation.

Because of high volatility Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies, in general, is good for short-term investments. 

## What is market volatility?

Market volatility is up and down price movements. The market reacts to various factors, such as a change in international relations, including political negotiations, pandemics, etc. The traditional market is regulated and parties that regulate it are interested in maintaining its stability. So long-term investors can benefit here.",1583848436,2,1

Yes! No more scam coins.. 

I don’t buy them either, but maybe we finally see this after the corona scare is gone? This could last until the end of the year (or beyond, but highly unlikely). This may be something we just have to learn to live with, or it will go away like SARS.

&gt;Rishi Sunak has announced a £30 billion package to tackle the economic impact of coronavirus in his budget, including the abolition of business rates for small businesses and a £1 billion government-backed loan scheme. The chancellor said that the government would “protect our country and our people” as he described [Covid-19](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/coronavirus) as the “key challenge” facing Britain today.

fgxhah,Material_Brick,Coinburrow perpetual Algo Launched," The Australia-based exchange said Wednesday in a blog post that its new “Perpetual Algo” feature provides leverage up to three times or ""3x"" for individual investors in 30 countries and 23 U.S. states, including the lucrative New York market. The leverage is also available to institutional traders in 44 states and Twenty Five countries.

The 3x leverage matches C’oinBurrow’s previous margin offering from 2017. CoinBurrow, led by Analyst Allyssa Sosa, briefly offered margin trading at the time, but suspended the service later in the year. Executives had been signaling since early 2019 that they were considering reviving the effort.

The resurgent push by Coinburrow comes as competition heats up among the world’s crypto exchanges, and the biggest players are scrambling to attract customers and transaction volumes with new digital-token listings and features like better trading technology, more leverage and more-secure custody options.  

“Perpetual Algo” has been one of our most requested features,"" Coinburrow said in the blog post.

Several big non-U.S.-based exchanges, including Binance, BitMEX and Deribit, offer leverage of 100 times or more on futures contracts and other derivatives, but many of those offerings are off-limits to American customers. While U.S. traders can get leverage to buy regulated bitcoin futures contracts on the CME and Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt division, those venues require special accounts to trade commodities.   

Leverage is considered risky in trading because it boosts the chances of losses alongside the enhanced potential for gains. 

In an example of how Coinburrow’s new offering will work, traders could put $2999 down and continue up to $10000 of bitcoin from the exchange for trading with bitcoin perpetual Algo, increasing the potential size of the bet to x2-x3 worth of bitcoin. If bitcoin’s price climbs by 33 percent, traders would double their original investment.    

In the blog post, Coinburrow said the perpetual funds can be used to trade other cryptocurrencies, in addition to tripling-down on a single digital asset like bitcoin: "" If deployed as part of a responsible trading strategy perpetual trading algo doesn’t just increase your position in a specific trade but can also help diversify your portfolio, allowing you to hedge or arbitrage across multiple positions without depositing additional capital.""

Coinburrow is notable because it is one of only a few big cryptocurrency exchanges based in Australia., submitting to the nation’s strict regulations in exchange for access to customers from the world’s largest economy. Started in the early years of the crypto industry in 2017, Coinburrow has long been used by cryptocurrency newcomers as an “on-ramp” into bitcoin and other digital assets from dollars and other government-issued money. The company now claims to have more than 30 thousand users.

With the economy suffering the effects of covid-19 and a potential massive global slow down, we are in no position to handle a reduction in the money supply.  Delaying the halvening and keeping the reward at 12.5, will provided much needed stimulus to the economy, and is in line with what other smartly managed currencies are doing--such as the FED lowering interest rates 50 basis points.

In short, having a rigid money supply schedule that can be known with absolute certainty, provides too much uncertainty, with no central-planning tools that can be used to address coronavirus or other threats &amp; needs that present to our economy.

fhgggy,Bitcoin_Business_com,Bithumb has stolen 2 BTC from me by market manipulation all the evidence enclosed -," 

Let's get started: 

10.03.2020 (day before yesterday) 

I log in to the BH Global app and want to check the market. 

I'm looking at the trading pair BTC / USDT - why don't I have to explain why I think the market seemed to go down and thought about switching to BTC in USDT. 

All of a sudden the app hung up and I couldn't log in anymore! I tried it very often again, but it didn't work (email notifications from Bithumb all available). I always got the message Login failure, contact support . 

I wrote the support by email to avoid this! This was the first time I needed this support and reports about it. (Emails as a copy available)

I tried to log in further on, also sometimes via the website, but neither of them worked! 

At noon I was unfortunately scheduled for meetings and was waiting for an answer. 

I got it also hours later from ""Anna""! 

She said that the login works. I tried it and it worked again -&gt; 

BUT MY BALANCE... it was missing over $15,000!

I wrote to the support again, answered her email. She wanted to have screenshots where the login didn't work and didn't even react to my message that 15.000$ were missing. There was no email reaction until today... (Emails all available) 

I took another look at the market and discovered something in the recent trading history! And now it is getting exciting!!!

A market sell order for 3.8 BTC in total, the equivalent of which was 14252.97 USDT. 

How does that work? 

I looked in and discovered a small position of 2 BTC, which was sold for 0.5 USDT.

Here is the screenshot (4 pieces of the whole order). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

![img](g3oj4arjv8m41)

&amp;#x200B;

![img](6yrt3z3kv8m41)

 

The Market Sell order takes the last Buy order automatically. 

How does this happen here ? The times are all the same, even the seconds!

Before and after are trades. If there is no liquidity, it can happen on a bad exchange, but on Bithumb?

AND IN THE TRADINGCHART THE TRADE IS NOT VISIBLE EITHER!

fhg5zd,cyberneticsneuro,Thoughts from a Hodler class of 2013,"Throughout my time in Bitcoin, what I've always been struck by is how you guys are independent thinkers. The mainstream finance world says we're crazy and ignores is, but we understand some first principles and are able to think for ourselves and see the vast potential of this new technology. And we've been right over and over again so far.

It's a great quality to be able to see through propaganda and laziness, when the crowds tend to only pay attention to one another and move in flocks. 

Back in late January, I had that same 'bitcoin' feeling when I first learned about the coronavirus and its first principles. Since I'm in science and my girlfriend is in medicine, I had some good resources to do a  lot of digging. Bottom line is it does not look good, as a lot of you probably also know. 

I'm still hodling, even though the price will likely do some unexpected things, because I'm not a trader and because I have no idea what could unfold here. As an uncorrelated asset designed to thrive in crisis, it has a good shot at doing well. Obviously there are basic questions of risk mitigation but accepting those, I will continue to hodl. I still believe in the fundamentals, and after seeing the governments of the world perform so poorly over the last month, my faith in decentralized governance is greater than it has ever been at any time. 

But that's not why I'm writing this post. I'm writing it to remind/warn you guys about the importance of your health and the health of your loved ones. Don't let them dismiss this incoming tidal wave. I am shocked by how many people around me still don't get it, even very smart people. With a 2 week incubation period, not enough ventilators, etc, we more or less know how this is going to play out.

fhfk5t,anon517,Why Price Doesn't Matter and What Safe Haven Means: Bitcoiner Prescience is Second to None,"A lot of people have noticed that some of the most knowledgeable Bitcoiners have been talking about the risks and dangers of the COVID-19 threat far earlier than most other people. This prescience is a reflection of a deeper understanding of the problems with current societal, financial, and government structures.

True Bitcoiners understand that governments cannot be trusted. They fail, either through corruption or bureaucracy or complacency or ignorance. They are unreliable. And this includes the financial system when tied to government, in the form of money printing. They understand that they are responsible for themselves, to validate the chain with a full node themselves, to not trust anyone else - because of cheating, lying, and general unreliability of others.

If you observe news and politics, you see that a huge number of people in society are just now complaining about a lack of preparation and a poor response by government. Twitter is full of people complaining about Donald Trump and the CDC and debates between Republicans and Democrats. But Bitcoiners never trusted the government to do a good job in the first place.

Bitcoin, as the hardest asset in the world, can create confusion with people who don't understand the difference between price and safe-haven attributes. The ones who are ""confused"" are not actual Bitcoiners, but rather, mostly ""traders"" who are looking to make a quick buck. These are the so-called ""weak hands"" and ""investors"" and they create a large amount of volatility on top of what is the ""base price"" of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is NOT a safe-haven against short-term volatility. Nor, is it a safe-haven against irresponsible trading practices, weak hands, and panic selling. However, it remains the BEST safe-haven against government and societal failure.

And that failure is what we're observing now. Governments are scrambling to ""save the economy"" by destroying the currency. Large scale bail-outs are incoming. Huge amounts of debt, borrowing from our children, and our children's children. On top of that, government response has been lackluster at best. It has been criminal, at worst. Distrust in government will only propel a new system, perhaps an overhaul of a system that has completely failed. A return to principles, separation of money and state. While businesses rapidly adjust to the COVID-19 situation by instituting work-from-home policies and clear communication, government schools are responding extremely slow and in confusing/conflicting ways. Governments are not well-suited for fast response times in emergencies. The bureaucracy, red-tape, and lack of overall incentives result in the problems being exposed now.

Bitcoin is a safe-haven from a failed government fiscal policy. And Bitcoin's ""base price"" reflects the sum of value of all those who understand that issue - which is guaranteed to grow over time (which is what makes it safe). It is easy to make this claim of guarantee, because people once they understand how bad the system is, will be HIGHLY unlikely to return to trusting the government economic system again.

So, just to repeat, I am not concerned at all by the volatility. Once all the selling is done, we'll know what the real base price is. The price, above the base, is just noise. It's a large pool of a ""fluff"" of users who don't care about how governments fail us. They just want a quick profit. Bitcoin is a long-term game. It's growth and success is almost as inevitable as the government's consistent ability to drop the ball - over, and over.",1584016113,8,1

I went on Binance to buy some crypto.

Seeing the price had come way down today it seemed like a good time to jump in.

Looked  like Binance could not sell me Crypto but provided partner links so I  chose the first one called Simplex. Proceeded with verification and the  transaction. The result was that they took 15%!!!!!!!!

On  further research it was on me to not equate the BTC amount they showed  as being far below the amount I was buying. I did not see that and the  FEE RATE was not shown anywhere. I realize I am not getting anything  back but feel this was a surreptitious and dishonest way to take  advantage of noobs.

I  do not care if it was a 3rd party, I hold Binance responsible. I  figured out how to withdrawal my currency to a wallet and I will never  use Binance again as I feel I was taken advantage of and just came here  to share my story.",1584087496,9,1

One well-known alternative security model is SPV. This model supports verifying payments without requiring access to the entire blockchain in exchange for trusting Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) miners to verify the history and a stronger non-partitioning assumption. However, this means that if an attacker is able to overpower the network's PoW hash power, it can trick SPV nodes into believing fabricated transactions are valid for as long as the attacker overpowers the network.”

fhuoo7,jchang23,Reason why it's dropping is the same reason Gold is,"I work in the financial sector, in the past few weeks people have been trying to raise serious cash in anticipation of investing in assets that have been seriously battered. 

Think of someone that invests in bitcoin long term. At these prices, they might decide to sell other things to pour more money into bitcoin or wait for an entry point they are comfortable with.

The same happens in all assets. 

As soon as people feel the worst is over, all this cash on the sidelines will come rushing in in a short period of time.

A good example was the 2016 election. People went to cash leading up to it. For most a win for Trump meant a rising market and a Clinton win meant a declining market (please don't turn this into politics, just the way it was seen by many investors). Once Trump won, all that money came rushing in.

Interesting to note, with the recent market decline, we are almost back to Jan 2017.

When people try to come up with complex reasons why Gold, BTC or some other asset right now is selling off, they are overthinking it. During any major decline in stocks you have investors re-positioning their cash, this is when new levels of wealth are reached for the smart money and new levels of poorness for people that just don't know.",1584077208,21,1

fhtqyk,OtheDreamer,Swimming - The Macroeconomic Potential of Bitcoin,"I've been talking recently about [how appealing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/fez43t/the_macroeconomic_appeal_of_btcs_lower_relative/) bitcoin is from an investor standpoint, since it has relative value and volatility to neutral goods that are dependent on many factors. It has exceeded my expectations.

Tonight has already remarkably displayed several things in relationship to macroeconomic trends. Tonight's about Asia. People of all nations have the potential to [make a lot of money.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/fhjhuy/investment_time_is_almost_here/)

The *true potential* of cryptocurrency when it's implemented on a global scale, is quite possibly a **stabilizing force** to any one nations economy--just  as any one nations economy can stabilize bitcoin, in the event of a single nation's economy failing. 

This is really interesting because it's *fueled mostly by the little guys*...not the big guys. The whales will always set the movement trends, but the little fish can make money by swimming with them. 

What I mean is this...

**In the event of single nation economic crisis:**

 * Whales can *""swim""* away from their nation's currencies by liquidating cryptos into something more neutral or valuable. 

 * This triggers the sells, which is also when the little guys should be selling using one of their wallets. Over time it should always be at a premium from when they bought it.

  * This concept is what I mean by *""Swimming""* which, some people might have also described as ""psychotic volatility"" 

  * Really though, it is a means for mass little fish to make raise their wallets at the same time as the whales

* Whales from other currencies can swim towards the nation in trouble by swooping in when the coin price is low, thereby triggering the little fish to start buying with them

  * For the little fish, they just keep ahold of their wallets...and follow the whales until they change direction

  * Little fish can buy with one wallet, sell with another

  * The more wallets the little fish have the faster they can swim

My above scenario is only talking about if one nations' currency is failing. Tonight is important because Asian stock markets falling will also drag down bitcoin. Tomorrow evening we'll find out for certain how the coin will react in the short run if multiple nations are failing. 

It's a two way street though...",1584072212,0,1

fi5w0i,noobmaster5711,Questions answered: “wHaT do yOU thINk tHE pRicE wilL bE?”,"The beer flu just started spreading in India, states are going or planning to go down in lockdown as I am typing. The economy is shit here and the political parties are only interested in fighting over religious fuds rather than address an incoming threat as one. Indian population has quite a chunk of uneducated and poor people who earn minimum wage and cannot stay home in a lockdown; not eating would kill them faster than the virus. People claiming that the virus cannot survive a hot climate should know that the virus becomes ineffective in transmission but that is not a problem here since we have such population density. Look at Iran, it is literally and desert and the virus is still taking a toll.Most of the US companies outsource their work to India since labour is cheap here, imagine the losses the US stock market will take let alone the Indian markets. This shit is only the start, the tip of the iceberg is yet to come. I bet it’s dropping to $2k in a week. Tell me you’re not convinced.

I've seen many people bashing bitcoin for being bad store of value, lets look at few facts here:

* Bitcoin is the only representation of free market today, every other asset is traded mostly by derivatives in the stock market, which are keeps on being pumped with newly created dollars by the fed,
* You can't halt bitcoin trading, it's being accessible to people choices 24/7, unlike the stock market that could be halted for 15 mins so insiders can make some OTC trades in order to provide liquidity so the price won't continue falling.
* The fed does not pump dollars (your taxes) to keep bitcoin from crashing, unlike the stock market which is the main thing Trump cares about and takes it as the representation of the economy.

Final conclusion guys, for me, I've been in the game since 2014, since then I've seen much, learnt much, and read much.

As of right now, I'd suggest all REAL bitcoin HODLERS to remember why they have firstly invested, and stick to the plan, I know it have been harsh days, but making portfolio changes based on what you have read on reddit makes the situation even worse. And if it's really hard for you, get off the net for few days.",1584222334,74,1

fipn1h,graydoggames,"Am I the only one who has 0 intent to sell any of my bitcoin under $100,000 USD?","People said bitcoin would never break $1. Then they said it would never hit $100. Then they said it would never hit $1,000. Then when it crashed back to $200, people said it was going to die. When it hit $4,000, people said it would never hit 10k, then 20k.

Now that's it's at $5k, people say it's over. It's not unreasonable to think that, within 5-6 years, bitcoin will have another spike (or two or three). It's not unreasaonble to think the 100k barrier will be broken some day.

With that in mind, is it crazy for me not to want to sell any of my bitcoins under $100k? People say I should sell some if it hits 20k again, or at 25k, 30k... I'm not interested. Really waiting for it to be much higher. Who would I sell for 25k in 1-2-3 years when I could sell for 100k+ in 4-5-6 years?

Right now, the entire bitcoin market cap is less than Tesla. It's 6% of the newest QE by FED. It's 5% of Apple. And that's counting bitcoins that are gone for good. 

I think bitcoin is worth more than that. I sincerely believe more than 100B has been, or will be shortly, invested in bitcoins. Think about all the miners, electricity, transactions fees... This has to amount to billions per year.  People are investing for the long term. Even big funds are starting to grab it. There will be bitcoin ETF soon. 

Also, have you tried to send money overseas recently? The only way I know of is credit card and a) it's riddled with fraud b) 5%+ transaction fee, strict limits and money can be frozen for 180 days.

I am currently sending money to people I know overseas using bitcoins and its fantastic.

With money you exchange physical notes and coins for goods and services but with debit cards no physical exchange takes place: you tap a card that you return to your own wallet, creating psychological illusion of services and goods recieved for free. 

With that being said, I wanted to ask you all how does the lacking tangibility of bitcoin effect the  psychology of hodlers? Does it make us more susceptible to manipulation and FUD? 

Do you guys value the Bitcoin itself or the associated wealth that you would like to exchange it for one day? I think this is a problem with Bitcoin.. If you hold  gold, you love the gold and treasure it in a way that you simply don't with Bitcoin. At least that's my opinion.

fiowbq,negus_nagast,"Price decline, what’s next?: My take","First off - bitcoin price crashed, but this wasn’t a bitcoin crash. Probably every liquid market on earth has declined following the recent panic and bitcoin was no exception. 
Even Gold which is a much more widely accepted safe haven asset experienced massive declines. 

Please remember, this does not mean that bitcoin holds no value or has lost every single fundamental that attracted investors and the like before this, or that it will not rebound in the medium to long term. 

Also, do I think price will decline further? Yes, I do. When the true extent to the viruses prevalence in the USA becomes public, entire markets will experience further declines, the almost certain recession will also mean markets might trend lower in the medium term. 

Don’t forget fortunes are made in times like this, 
I liquidated half of my holdings at around 6k and intend to buy back in at $2k-$3.5k levels. This will almost double my holdings.

fioufo,DeltaFreq,What keeps derivative market prices in line with spot market prices?,"If BTC/USD on Binance drifts below BTC/USD on Kraken, then an arbitrageur can transfer USD to Binance, buy cheap bitcoin (pushing the price up), transfer that bitcoin to Kraken and sell it (pushing the price down) for a quick profit. Thus, there is a natural mechanism incentivising market participants to keep prices aligned. On Bitmex and other derivatives platforms, this mechanism does not exist. You transfer in bitcoin, then buy or sell contracts, which cannot leave the exchange. It would seem that there is no hard incentive to keep prices in line with spot markets, aside from the general expectation that the prices will align. What am I missing? In theory, couldn't a derivatives market's price of an asset drift away, with no hard incentive for traders to bring it back in line? 

(Note: this question is inspired by the fact that an excessive percentage of bitcoin liquidity is on derivatives exchanges rather than spot. This means that if people really want to exit to USD, which they can only do on spot exchanges, then there might not be enough order book liquidity to absorb the sell pressure, creating excessive volatility that would not have occurred if the liquidity had been on spot exchange instead. This may explain part of the flash crash of the last few days.)",1584217337,4,1

The thing is, my yard is a total dump. And now I have this shiny new birdbath, with the keys to my life savings buried under it, sitting around trash, broken car parts, and dog shit.

Should I reconsider? I like the idea of putting the steel plates I punched my keys into under my mattress, but I’d want a firearm, and that scares my wife. We have 6 kids.

Is birdshot the answer? Will that kill the assailant(s) but not penetrate the wall, leaving the kids safe asleep?

I need to get the basis down before I can rest sound. My life savings took a hit with this price crash, and the last thing I need is my birdbath getting scoped out by the neighbors and losing everything or worse a home invasion that I’m unarmed/unprepared for.

Is there a recommendation for best firearm(s) for protecting your keys from home invasions? Whether it is protecting your keys from afar (shooting out of your bedroom window a distance away at the thieves trying to dig up your birdbath) or for scenarios where you are protecting the keys yourself (sleeping in the same room as your keys).

The thing here is that in times of panic everyone will try to liquidate positions on everything and become as liquid as they can out of fear. What is the most liquid asset out there? Money! They will sell their btc for usd to become more liquid when panic hits. 

It's not rational, it's Fear. When we feel fear, we seek safety. 

Is bitcoin liquid? Not by a long shot. I can't buy medicine or food or even repurchase any other market asset with it after the crises subsidies.

This is reason we should push for adoption and not merely a Store of Value narrative. If this this here becomes liquid because it's money (and for the love of God, some crypto ought do it) then people will flock to BTC in times of panic.

If we’re trying to shift the currency to BTC, it doesn’t matter what the USD value is. 1BTC is always 1BTC there’s still only 21 million coins (probably closer to 18.5 million due to blockchain loss). Technically this is still a hedge against fiat. It’s just so early still, so we can’t peg it to any other store of value. 

We need to collectively figure out what the value of 1 satoshi is. Maybe 1 satoshi will = a hamburger, cup of coffee, etc.

Remember, the inception of Bitcoin stemmed from the 2008 financial crisis. It’s birth led to a beautiful world with promise of decentralized future. 

This is the first chance to see an established Bitcoin decide its future against the system it was built to defeat for these exact reasons. If I had to make a bet as to whether BTC would rise against the crashing economy, then I would say yes. It was built for this exact purpose. Now may be the time to see $100k


Let me know what you guys think please. I think this is a very interesting topic and want to hear your opinions. I think they will approach 10k at the same time and BTC will power through and surpass DOWJ once and for all. Not sure if DOWJ will hit 10k but it is most definitely a real possibility.

fkeciz,johnmcgeechan,Why do you think socialism is BAD ?," what   I find most amusing about Americans - one of the many things actually,   is that they have a visceral dislike of socialism, because they have   been brainwashed to believe that all socialism is BAD. The reason they   are given this message, is because true democratic socialism would see   the resources much more evenly distributed, benefiting the average Joe   at the expense of the very wealthy. Thus the very wealthy ensure that   the lie is maintained ,through the media, newspapers, Fox News etc  so   that the average Joe has a Pavlovian reaction to even the word   socialism..and yet..you are literally seeing socialist policies taking   place in your country all the time to benefit the already very wealthy.  
Your   military expenditure is socialism for the defence industry. TARP was   socialism for banks. This massive bailout is socialism for business. Tax   breaks are socialism for corporations. And who picks up the tab ? But   just suggest that maybe a little bit of that socialism could be used  for  universal healthcare or for statutory holiday,sick pay and maternal   leave, enjoyed by much of the rest of the developed world and watch  how  quickly the average Joe demand THEMSELVES that this socialism  should not  be permitted.

fk80wl,SimpleSwapExchange,What happens to miners if BTC price falls?,"Undoubtedly, the first ones to suffer from changing price are individual miners and mining firms. Nowadays the situation has its own peculiarities because of the upcoming Bitcoin halving.

In order to survive halving miners have to upgrade mining equipment. This comes from the necessity to change all the indices, such as hashrate, the consumption and cost of power. Otherwise, mining will not be profitable anymore. Thus miners take their time to prepare for the event. Most of them have started around half a year ago.

Right now the situation is complicated by the downward price trend. This price drop makes it highly unprofitable for a lot of players to stay on the market. There is a possibility that if the price does not change the trend, some of the mining firms will have to shut down. Also if the price goes further down in the nearest weeks, we may see some miners to quit already. First of all, this is going to affect smaller miners who do not have enough facilities to wait out the current situation. However, miners who feel threatened by the circumstances may consolidate.

fm2gnw,quary1993,"vTrader, the Romanian crypto exchange platform","&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1zv8vks44wn41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48cbf309ce42b401ff4426e3e7baefea555f2627

&amp;#x200B;

Our main focus is to make the interaction between the user and the platform as easy as possible so that anyone could exchange cryptocurrencies, no advanced crypto/blockchain knowledge needed.

Another thing that differentiates us from other crypto exchange platforms is our team. All three co-founders are experienced developers, which is why vTrader is a very robust platform, fully integrated with the blockchain networks of the cryptocurrencies we trade, and with a high level of security.

Thirdly, unlike other crypto exchange platforms out there, *we address the liquidity problem*. This is a common issue in current cryptocurrency exchanges, yet a serious one as it can lead to platform failure. If the platform does not have a critical mass of users, when someone places an order to buy/sell at market price (or even below) and no one responds, they lose interest in the platform. We avoid this by ensuring the liquidity of exchange pairs through a system that automatically completes orders close to the market price, with orders placed by users of a considerably larger exchange platform: [Bittrex](https://international.bittrex.com/).

Last but not least, *we also focus on providing excellent customer support*. We strive to be available 24/7 for our users and answer any questions about the platform, process, or team that they might have.

# Strong focus on security — vTrader uses cold wallets to protect in case of cyber attacks

When you are “playing” with people’s money, you want to make sure that the highest security standards are met. And these are not just empty words; let me give you a concrete example.

Let’s say an attacker deletes the exchange transaction database. What will happen next is that transactions will be rebuilt from the blockchain. The attacker will not gain access to funds because *we keep all money on cold wallets and Bittrex*, and our users will have their accounts intact within hours.

vTrader has several layers of security that ensure customer safety:

* we use Cloudflare and Google reCaptcha services for protection against DDoS and Spam attacks
* we keep customer data on a database with limited external access to prevent theft
* we perform automatic backups at regular intervals to prevent data loss
* funds and cryptocurrencies are stored in cold wallets, and their private keys are not stored on the server; even if a hacker gains access to the database, he will not be able to gain access to the private keys.

# Cryptocurrencies you can exchange on vTrader

For now, our users can trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, Monero, and Dash. The reason we chose them is that they are all in the top 10 as trading volume. Moreover, they have been audited by many trusted companies in the crypto community, so they are very secure.

# vTrader KYC process is ensured by a fast, tiered verification

There are three types of transactions you can do on vTrader: deposits, withdrawals, and orders (exchanging one cryptocurrency for another).

Our KYC verification process also has three levels. When you are signing up on our platform you are, by default, at *level 0*.

To make cryptocurrency deposits, we will ask for your address (*level 1*).

To make deposits/withdrawals in EUR or crypto withdrawals, we will ask you to send us a photo of your passport/ID.

This tiered verification only takes minutes to complete. One thing to keep in mind though: our platform is available only for EU citizens.

# Future plans

As I have previously mentioned, we value our customers’ feedback so our priorities and feature development will depend on their opinion and wishes. Hence, we don’t have a definite Roadmap. However, there are three strategic directions we want to focus on this year:

**1. The social component**

Our biggest wish is to bring cryptocurrencies to the masses. Therefore, we have invested a great deal of time to optimize the user experience so that our platform is easy to use by anyone.

The first social feature we have implemented was *vouchers*. Any user can issue vouchers for people they want to invite on vTrader. When they create their account, the balance is credited automatically with the amount of the voucher.

Next, we want to launch our own iOS and Android apps. The main purpose of these apps will be FREE cryptocurrency transactions between users.

**2. Trading tools**

vTrader is a cryptocurrency exchange platform, not a trading one. However, we want to help our users by providing a minimal set of trading tools that are easy to use.

The first tool we want to implement is **Stop Loss (SL)**, a tool that will help users limit their losses. Let’s say you bought $3500 worth of Bitcoin and you don’t want to lose $500. If you set up the SL at $3000, your request will be automatically executed when the market goes down.

Stop Loss also has a counterpart, **Take Profit (TP)**. Using this feature, users will be able to set how much they want to earn and the sell will happen automatically once the market reaches that value.

**3. Adding new cryptocurrencies**

At this point, we don’t rule out the possibility of implementing new tokens in the future. However, we will only support projects that really deserve our trust.

A native token is also a possibility in the future, but we are currently focusing on infrastructure, security, and mobile apps.

HOW do bitcoins even work if I'm wanting to buy some to make purchases with them?

The site I'm wanting to order from doesn't convert USD to bitcoin whenever the bitcoin option is chosen for payment, so I'm confused since I have no visual idea of the amount they'd want me to pay. Which is why I'm assuming if I want to make a purchase of $39 then I'd just buy $39 worth of bitcoin?

Then a couple weeks later, the price collapsed – $150. Oh no, the world is ending!

I panic sold, and was afraid to reinvest for years.

Eventually I came back around and regained my confidence.

Now, the reason I will never sell is that $300 price bitcoin panic sell.

I learned the lesson that when you invest in bitcoin, it’s almost guaranteed you will “lose” money at some point...

But as long as you HODL, you don’t realize the losses.

I wish I’d never sold my $300 bitcoins. I still see the receipt for that sell on my Coinbase app and cringe. I’m sure many of you have a similar story.

And I have a feeling these seemingly HUGE dips right now will seem as insignificant in 4 years as the $150 collapse seems now, in retrospect.

How long is it going to take to achieve all three options in one place?... I think using your phone with a simple app (like Venmo or Cashapp to send money) to use all three options is the final step of mass adoption.

flv1gu,chillnch,Morphtoken has 10 confirmations for my BTC and is ignoring my messages that were sent after the fact. Are they out because of coronavirus?,"Have done trades off and on with morphtoken and about an hour ago did one that confirmed quickly. It hit 3 confirmations and morphtoken status page still said ""waiting for deposit"" which made me think something is wrong because it usually says ""waiting for confirmations"" which it did after my BTC hit 5 confirmations. So while watching that it eventually went to ""trading"" and now my BTC has 6 confirmations and it still says ""trading"". In the past (like 2 days ago) it would say ""processing withdrawal"" at this point. I have messaged them using the little chat icon on the status page a few times over the 40 minutes after the 3 confirms and still no monero, I have emailed them after the 6 confirms and still no monero. I have not seen this behavior from them before. Are they going out of business or have they become scammers all of a sudden? Or are they not in the office or whatever because of coronavirus?  I did the trade 2.5 hours ago and the status page has been stuck at ""trading"" for 2 hours 15 minutes.  I have sent messages in email and in chat and no reply, no monero, nothing.

fjpi5s,CryptoFull,Learn once and for all: Whales are in control!,"Note: I'm sorry for the English, I'm using Google translator to get this message across.

&amp;#x200B;

You don't know me, because I'm new here on the forum, but I know the stock market since we can buy shares at Home Broker through the internet. Since then I have always done graphic analysis in countless actions around the world.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also in the cryptocurrency market since the beginning, so I have experience to say what I am going to talk about now.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am going to say will not please many, but I am not here to give candy to any child. Truth hurts! So if you are a person of courage, hold on!

&amp;#x200B;

Let's just talk about Crypto, because that's what interests everyone here, especially Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all: Stop trying to guess what will happen to Bitcoin. This is impossible, learn once and for all that the probability of Bitcoin reaching 1 dollar or 1,000,000 dalors in a few months or years is the same. Do you know why? Because the ones who ""lead"" the Crypto market (all cryptos) are the whales. They decide when this Crypto will go up or down. Get out of your heads that the Crypto market is totally linked to the stock market! NO! IT IS NOT CONNECTED. The whales that make this ""connection"".

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly: Right now you are saying ""What is this idiot talking about? If the Cryptocurrency market does not keep up with the stock market, why are all Cryptos falling with stocks?"" I already answer you: DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENTS! Yes, this answer may seem strange, but anyone who understands a little about buying and selling Crypto and Stocks knows that no one invests their wealth in just one asset, but in several, perhaps dozens! What is happening with the Crypto market is simple, the whales are selling everything (stocks, cryptos, bonds, gold, dollars, etc.) to buy more in the future, this is NORMAL, in the whole market this happens. So this ""link"" that you believe Bitcoin has with the stock market is actually made by a minority that has thousands of Bitcoins in their wallets, and they force the market wherever they want. They are currently pushing it down, so they don't miss the opportunity to buy more bitcoins in a few days. Think about it: A whale that sold 10,000 btc's at $ 4,000 each, he can buy 40,000 btc's if the value of the btc reaches $ 1000. This is increasing his Cryptocurrency wealth by 400% with the same money. And you are making it happen, selling Bitcoins at an undervalued price.

&amp;#x200B;

Thirdly: Analyze the charts, and see that it is impossible for the bitcoin market not to be manipulated, there is no possibility of an asset falling $ 1000 in a few minutes. This can only happen if 1 or 2 people sell a large amount of Cryptos causing smaller investors to scare and sell their cryptos to them at much lower prices.

&amp;#x200B;

And lastly, yes, you can doubt it, but the vast majority of whales are in Russia, China and the USA. The Chinese mine an immense amount of Cryptocurrencies daily, and they want to become the owners of this market, but they will only be able to force others and sell the cryptocurrencies they have. And how do you achieve this? Making investors afraid! The fear factor is the emotion that practically cancels the reason in your brain, in other words: Covid-19 is a perfect weapon to cause this fear.

&amp;#x200B;

With money you can buy everything, including big media around the world to help spread this fear across the planet!

&amp;#x200B;

I am not claiming that Covid-19 is a scam, but they are giving it far greater importance than it should.

&amp;#x200B;

The Chinese government has done this in the past, it is doing it now and it may do so again in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, you can criticize, but criticize rationally, do not be like people who let themselves be carried away by emotion and do not use reason to debate!

&amp;#x200B;

But once I'm sorry for the mistakes in the language.",1584382451,12,3

The last time the Fed did an emergency rate cut was during the 2008 financial crisis.

Over the last two weeks, they have undertaken two separate emergency rate cuts that have totaled 1.5% and brought us to 0% interest rates.

So pretty unprecedented actions taken by the Fed.

Oh, and the **Fed also cut reserve requirements for thousands of banks to zero**.

The Fed added in its statement that it “is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals.”

Here's what I was thinking:

Why don't they invent a number that's not positive or negative and then change the interest to that?

But wait a minute, that does exist.

The imaginary numbers.

If you imagine a 2D plane, the real numbers are on the horizontal and the imaginary numbers are on the vertical axis.

Although that sounds too complex...

OK...oh...well how about a quantum interest rate?

**Maybe there's an interest rate but maybe there's not...**

**That's it: Schrödinger's Interest**

That's too complicated, the masses would never...

Wait a minute...

That's it!

This would correspond to the S&amp;P 500 at around 1500-2000.

Amazingly, [Goldman Sachs now agrees](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-15/goldman-sachs-warns-s-p-500-might-not-bottom-until-2-000?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google).

This is quite the U-turn from December 2019, when they said a downturn is unlikely over the next several years, and [stopping just short of saying that the U.S. economy is recession-proof](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/31/goldman-sachs-is-saying-the-economy-is-nearly-recession-proof.html).

Quite similar to 2007, and their stance that the [economy will recover by mid-2008](https://www.cnbc.com/id/22101808).

In the words of Mark Twain:

People, after perhaps initially bartering briefly (before realizing the pitfalls of bartering), seek a reliable medium of exchange.  Bitcoin initially tanks (as it has) but at some point shortly after hyperinflation, it becomes the reserve currency with an astronomical USD value which is meaningless, but is the reserve nonetheless.

Recently I started using Tether again because I had to concede, USDT has the liquidity I need to trade.

My question is, as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates and prints Trillions of dollars in stimulus money, what happens to the value of Tether which afterall is based on the value of USD?  My second question is, if the US Dollar faces a hyperinflationary event  will Tether's value remain stable?

fn3ms3,yankthrough,An analogy for Bitcoin as a medium of exchange,"I see the argument a lot that lack of adoption is driven by Bitcoin not being a widely accepted medium of exchange, and that we need to spend Bitcoin instead of hodl or else it will vanish into obscurity. In light of the global pandemic, I thought of an analogy that might strike a chord with some of you.

Let's say you have been stocking up some food to be better prepared for lockdown or supply chain disruptions. You have fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as packaged and canned goods. Which food do you eat first? I think the obvious answer is you eat the fresh food, the food that is going to spoil first, or at least favor it heavily, because if you only eat the canned goods then by the time you're hungry for the fresh food it will be spoiled already.

I think the same thing happens with money. Hard money like Bitcoin is similar to canned goods in this analogy, as it will retain the value for much longer than something that was already starting to spoil the day you got it.

Why would someone spend Bitcoin when their paper money is actively spoiling and losing value? As long as someone else is willing to accept your soft money in exhange for something you want, it is in your best interest to spend it first. Then when all the soft money is spoiled and you can no longer find someone willing to exchange for it, you can starting eating into your hard money.",1584899067,17,1

fmxy7y,yorick111,I'm in doubt,"Quick background:

I'm into bitcoin since 2015 or so. Got really into it in 2017 and took all my profit in december 2017. Bought myself a car and now am back in since january 2019.

But now i don't really know what to do. 

Should i hold? should I take profit now i still have some.

I really lost trust in the world economy and all the corrupt en controlling systems. That's why I believe bitcoin is worth having since it was made for this. In the crisis of 2008 someone made up bitcoin to have an alternative to the regular system. Now with the oil and corona crisis i think bitcoin is mature enough to be a real alternative and safe haven. These are the 'told you so' moments for the bitcoin believers as they see people struggling under the recent events. The global economy is starting to fall apart, it just couldn't go on like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, what real value does bitcoin have. I can't buy a bread with it. And even if i could, i have a hard time letting my precious bitcoins go because they could be worth more tomorrow. Or not?   
I have also concerns about the whales. We think bitcoin is some sort of predictable but if some whales transfer big amounts of bitcoin, it has a big effect on the price. About a 1000 people own 40% of all bitcoin... .  I don't want to depend on something so fragile. I also read an article about a huge untouched wallet. Maybe the private key is lost, maybe it's a guy in prison... we don't know. All this really scares me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in constant doubt if i should trust in bitcoin or not. The idea behind it is amazing. F the system, power to the people. On the other hand it is just so fragile due to the people with a lot of power within the bitcoin scene. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys also have doubts or are you 100% pro. Guess no one in this corner of the internet will be 100% against... Thats also something that bothers me. If you are in doubt about the whole bitcoin thing, you can start reading articles. But this does not help at all because they are often writen by pro or con bitcoin people. You just read the articles you want to believe. 

Just wanted to get my thoughts out. I would like to see what you guys think about this.

My income isn't permitting much but with becoming more frugal as a side effect of my BTC education I can periodically put a little bit aside. Getting in at the last bottom helped as well. 

With the recent global developments, I have finally decided to try and buy some land in the countryside to relocate my family there. The problem is, that would mean having to sell (most of) my BTC. As I put a lot of effort into acquiring it and hardening my belief in its purpose while doing so, it is very hard for me to push the sell button. Of course, there are also the potential gazillion X scenarios to consider...

Anyway, the current plan is to wait out the coming halving scenario with the hope of a solid pump and sell (partially) then.

fnqj2h,Bright_Charge,We’ve been working on a new product release for a year and want to hear your opinions on the product. Read on for product information and our vision for hardware wallets.,"TL;DR Key features of Cobo Vault 2nd gen we are going to launch:
* QR code air-gapped
* Totally open source: Including firmware of the Secure Element
* PSBT support and compatibility with other wallets
* Fingerprint authorization to prevent password leak
* Detachable battery to prevent battery corrosion and AAA support
* Bitcoin-only firmware option

Hey r/bitcoin! I'm Lixin, a longtime Bitcoiner and creator of Cobo Vault.

I come from a background in the electronic hardware industry, and experienced one of my products being featured in Apple Stores around the world. Although my interest goes back to 2010, my career intersected Bitcoin when Discus Fish (CEO of Cobo) invited me to help build Cobo’s hardware product line. Discus Fish is also the co-founder and CEO of f2pool, one of the largest mining pools currently in the world, and one of the earliest advocates of bitcoin in China.

Back in 2018 we built our 1st generation Cobo Vault hardware wallet. As we had strong ties to miners in China, we naturally designed the 1st gen with them in mind. For those who are not familiar with the mining industry in China, mining farms are nearly always built in very isolated places where there is very cheap wind or water electricity. As the miners would take their storage into these isolated regions, we needed to maximize the durability of the device in addition to its security. We used aerospace aluminum rather than plastic and made it completely IP68 waterproof. We also gave it a hardshell metal case you can put it in, which is IK9 drop resistant and passes the American military durability test MIL-STD-810G.

As for the electronic components inside the device, in order to maximize security, we made it as  air-gapped as possible with QR codes. We see this as an important choice because USB cables and Bluetooth are not transparent and have a bigger attack surface. With QR codes you can see exactly what is going on and do not have to connect to a laptop which could have malware on it. QR code interaction needs a camera and a more complicated system which needs to be supported by high-level chips.

All these come with a cost, and the 1st generation isn’t as accessible for average hodlers. For more details on the product, visit [here](https://cobo.com/hardware-wallet).

Things changed last year when I went to Bitcoin 2019 and talked to lots of hodlers in the States. I found that 95% of them don’t care about durability. I asked them if they were afraid of their home being flooded or burned down in a fire. The answer is - yes, they are afraid of these things, but see them as very low possibilities. Even if something were to happen, they said they would just buy another HW wallet for 100 dollars. From these conversations, it became more and more clear that the position for miners and hodlers is totally different.

After coming back from that conference, our team began the almost one year journey of designing our 2nd gen product. It compromises on durability but doesn’t compromise on security. 

We designed the 2nd gen product all around a normal hodler’s needs.

Obviously hodlers share some common needs with miners:

* Hodlers want a more air-gapped solution so we took the legacy of QR code data transmission between your hardware wallet and the companion app from the 1st gen rather than using USB or Bluetooth.
* A Secure Element is the strongest wall of protection from physical attacks. The 2nd gen will also have a Secure Element.
* Some hodlers may touch their hardware wallet once every several months. With this time period, the battery could be a significant weak point. * The 2nd gen also continues the legacy of a detachable battery to prevent battery corrosion damage. In case the battery dies someday, 2nd gen will also support AAA batteries.
* The 2nd gen also keeps the 4-inch touch screen. A touchscreen significantly increases ease of use - you don’t need to suffer from tiny buttons and little screens anymore. It also significantly lowers the possibility for human error, which is one of the biggest reasons that people lose their assets.
* Continued other features like the self-destruct mechanism, which prevents side-channel attacks, and Web Authentication, which prevents supply chain attacks.

If you'd like to read more about these features, check out our blog posts [here](https://medium.com/cobo-vault).

* Aside from these legacies from the 1st gen, our 2nd gen product will have some other big improvements:
* With our 2nd gen we will open source the whole codebase when we launch in late Apr - including the firmware of the Secure Element. We are the first hardware wallet - also maybe the first electronic product with SE - to have open sourced the firmware of the SE. With the open source firmware code, you can see: Random number generation/master private key generation/key derivation/signing process all happens within the SE and your private keys never get out of the SE (maximizing protection against physical attacks).
* At the Bitcoin 2019 conference half the hodlers I met told me they own multiple hardware wallets which they use on the go. So we added a fingerprint sensor you can use to authorize your transactions without typing in your password. No need to worry about surveillance cameras when using your hardware wallet in airports.
* We will also support PSBT (BIP174) so that the device will be compatible with 3rd party wallets like Electrum or Wasabi Wallet in case people have need for using Cobo Vault with their own node or coinjoin. Also multisig between Cobo Vault and other wallets will be realized to prevent single point failure with a single brand of hardware wallet.
* By sacrificing the durability of the device and its aluminum body/protective case and waterproof rating and lowering production costs, we successfully controlled the price under 200 USD. We wanted it to be at a price point most people in the community would see value in. 

Personally, I am a bitcoin maximalist and also a big fan of the KISS principle. We will also release a BTC-only firmware version for people who want to minimize the codebase for less of an attack surface.

Thank you for reading until here. More details like final price would be released later when we officially release the product in late Apr. Any suggestions or questions are welcome.

fnpuan,eleanorcwhite,Introducing Σ3 – ErgoMixer,"*The project uses Ergo’s Sigma protocols to enable  efficient, trustless mixing of funds, enabling a high degree of privacy  while ensuring security is not compromised.*

*ErgoMixer command-line demo tool along with detailed technical description can be found at* [*https://github.com/anon92048/ergo-mixer-demo*](https://github.com/anon92048/ergo-mixer-demo) *.*

Ergo’s Sigma protocols can be used to create many interesting and  exciting DeFi use cases, with greater simplicity, efficiency and  security than other smart contract platforms offer. Created by one of  Ergo’s community members u/anon92408, Σ3 (‘Sigma Three’) is a powerful  mixer that works by pooling funds and enabling participants to spend  them without anyone knowing who made the transactions.

## How does it work?

While understanding the full operation of the mixer will require some  in-depth knowledge of cryptography, the root concept is fairly simple.  (For those who want to learn the details, you can find out more in the  white paper.)

Participants send coins to a pool, and these can be spent by  different members. However, the use of Sigma protocols – specifically  ring signatures – means that it’s impossible to know which member spent  them.

Take the simplest case of a pool in which a ‘box’ of coins can be  spent by either Alice or Bob. Either Alice or Bob can sign a transaction  and move the coins, but no external observer will be able to tell which  of the two signed it. This is different to multi-signature  transactions, in which (say) 2 of 3 participants have to sign a tx; with  multi-sig, it is known which two do the signing.

Thus anyone observing from the outside would have a 50:50 chance of  guessing whether Alice or Bob moved those coins. But that process is  iterated, over and over again, with different users. After many rounds,  with many users, it’s effectively impossible to know who owns the coins.  Still, the coins never leave the control of their original owner –  there is no risk of lost funds.

## ErgoScript

This process can be implemented natively on the blockchain, as is the  case with ZCash. This has a similar process hardwired into the  blockchain – which works, but imposes limits on the blockchain.

It would be possible to implement something similar with Ethereum,  since Ethereum has Turing-complete smart contracts and any computational  task can be executed. But it would be clunky and inefficient, and the  result would be expensive and possibly risky.

Ergo allows this kind of use case to be implemented easily, using  Sigma protocols. ErgoScript includes native support for all the  cryptographic and blockchain functionality required to create Σ3 on the  Ergo chain, securely and efficiently.",1584990523,1,1

fplp8g,JoeyBlackTie,An update to the BTC ATM I had put in my business...,"Hey everyone. Back in mid December I had a Bitcoin ATM put in my shop and posted the great news to the sub. It was well received before I guess the ATM posts started being looked upon as played out.

In the comments I mentioned that if you guys wanted, I would be more than happy to post some stats on how well the ATM was doing. I'll have you know I did some super diligent tracking the first month, but then afterwards it was looking as though I found a buyer for the shop and my priorities shifted. I don't have those hard numbers right now and I'll explain why at the end, but here's the general idea of how these ATM's do in the day-to-day...

- Almost everyone has heard of bitcoin, almost everyone has no idea what it's about or how it works.

In the beginning a lot of people asked about the ATM. I told them it was for bitcoin and I even tallied if I deemed it to be a positive, negative, or indifferent reaction. Most people were indifferent. There were a handful of negative reactions, and after probing it turns out they either sold their bags long ago in a correction, or sold at what they thought was the top. A notable interaction I had with some customers was this pair of women who were young and looked/talked like the last sort of person you would imagine talking about BTC. When they opened up on it? Wow. They basically had the kind of mini debate on the topic that was extremely insightful on the base level. The kind of back and forth you would find even on here when relating to the future of bitcoin as money. I was really impressed hearing it, because it gave me hope that the every day person has the capacity to embrace it.

- ATM's are scam central.

Someone commented in that last post over how popular these ATM's are with scammers. I was naive in thinking it would be a once in a while ordeal. NOPE. 90% of all the traffic the ATM gets is people getting scammed. Over the last few months it's gotten really easy to spot who's getting worked and who isn't. Here's the crazy thing...THEY DON'T LISTEN. At all. I've tried every possible method. I've tried pleading with their sense of logic. I've tried accurately telling them HOW they're being scammed without them telling me details. I've tried being on the mean side to snap them out of it. In the last 3 months I have only managed to successfully thwart one attempt, and that was by literally pulling the plug on the ATM. It was crazy. There was this old man...had to be in his 70's...on speaker phone with the scammer that was telling him what to do. It was so obviously a scam that I was pleading with this guy not to do it. He ignored me completely as he followed the instructions on the other line. Before he got the chance to put money in I unplugged the machine and told him to pass me the phone. Immediately after hearing that the scammer hung up and I finally was able to talk some sense to the guy. That's it. The only victory I can claim. Every other person thoughtfully listened to me and proceeded to feed the machine anyways. What's worse is how they ALWAYS say they're gonna try it once just to see and they won't be back....and they ALWAYS come back. The most common victim is older men in their 40's-60's, all helping their out of country/state girlfriends that they have never met. Other notable scams are the put x amount in and get double back, pay x amount for the supplies you need for this new job you're starting, and the ever popular bail bondsmen/IRS payment to avoid arrest (that was the old old guy's scam). It's so frustrating that now, when a new one comes in, I'll tell them that if they don't listen to my advice, that i will not lift a finger to help them in any way. Doesn't matter....they just keep coming back in as the scammer slowly juices them.

-There is hope

While the majority are love sick men that throw their money away until they're broke/fed up, there are SOME people that get it. They don't put in much, but they put some in every chance they get. I even have 2 or 3 people that understand exactly what bitcoin is and put some serious money in. Interestingly enough, the majority of the ones that get it and are using the ATM how it's meant are women. I help these people in every way i can, making suggestions and giving tips where applicable. Also, the simple presence of the bitcoin has its own affect. People see that it's not just some thing they see sometimes on the news. It's in their face and out in the real world. It's sparked conversations with people that simply needed a tiny push to believe it's not going anywhere. I even got one lady to buy a full bitcoin (i can only hope she listened to my advice on holding strong, because it was before the major correction a few weeks back)


Conclusion-
These ATM's and how they're used show a clear sign that to the everyday public, we are nowhere near close to mass adoption. But they are getting used, and every day it's in my store, it shows the everyday public where the future is heading. Unfortunately I don't have those hard numbers for you because as of yesterday, my business was closed by the health dept due to COVID-19 (Smoke shops are not considered essential). Sure, I could go back into the store and get those numbers, but I got much bigger things on my plate to worry about. My landlord has chosen to stay silent and use the property manager as a buffer to give vague answers as to what I'm liable for. As of today still no word. So yeah...kinda mega screwed for who knows how long in how I'm going to pay my bills. That is, unless of course I want to sink myself in debt with some SBA loan that will take far too long to even hope getting approved for (I tried applying for one when i opened over 8 years ago and the process took months, only to be declined). Now that I am ripe with free time, I figured i would take some of it to finally give some of you the info I promised. Be safe out there and wish me luck in not going under.

WHY THE FUCK would you leave that much on coinbase. and WHY would u open a text asking for verizon phone number authentication WHILE ALSO leaving that much money on coinbase... UGH

if you take this shit seriously you have to treat it like a legitimate form of investment. you don't see people going: ""how to double all your value in stocks by clicking this email!"" yet there are so many people in this BTC community falling for BASIC and OBVIOUS scams. its sort of ironic considering these people want bitcoin to be taken seriously yet they think it's this weird anomaly to other investment types where there are these secret random tricks and ways to double down or make way more than everyone else overnight. if these tricks worked everyone would be doing them. if these tricks worked it would also mean bitcoin is a fucking joke.... get my message?

The contract has been opened long and short, and the advantage of using leverage has been quickly accepted by users in the currency circle. The contract transaction volume quickly exceeds the spot transaction volume. Because of the use of leverage in the contract, the use of funds has been increased, and the risk has also increased exponentially. Compared with the spot, no matter how the market changes, the currency is always in, and when the contract loss exceeds the margin and the position is closed, you There will be nothing.

When some friends started playing contracts, they were careful and had low leverage. As the yield increased, the awareness of risk control began to weaken, and the leverage went from 10 times, 20 times, and even 100 times. When the contract is covered, the loss cannot be stopped in time, and the margin is continuously increased, resulting in greater losses.

Contracts have a serious impact on the quality of life. Many people hold contract slips, tossing around at night and not sleeping at night.

Contracts not only make you lose money, but also make you lose your life. Who can retreat from the contract?

After the contract, who can take over? Binary options featuring easy-to-use, high returns, and short cycles are coming.

What are the characteristics of binary options?

First, it is easy to get started. AiOption is only bullish or bearish. 90 seconds is a delivery cycle. Based on the baseline, guess up or down. Get started quickly.

Second, the funds are small. The maximum funding limit of AiOption is 500u, which protects the user's assets to the greatest extent and avoids a single large loss.

Third, the returns are high. AiOption uses a dynamic odds mechanism to easily double assets.

Fourth, the cycle is short. Each round of AiOption is 90 seconds. Orders can be made at any time and delivered in time without affecting life.

Lightweight, flexible, high-return binary futures are becoming the new darling of the market!

1. **Donations in crypto on behalf of WHO (the World Health Organization)**

Scammers claim they collect donations in crypto to fight coronavirus. They impersonate WHO. The best way to deal with this kind of scams is to go to the official [WHO website](https://www.who.int/) and check all the information there.

It is important to know that similar scams appear in different countries. The scammers impersonate local health organizations, provide fake information, and ask for donations. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Coronavirus websites**

These websites provide mostly fake information, some tests to find out if you are infected, and then ask for a donation in crypto. Remember that there’s no way to test yourself on virus online, and be attentive about donations.

Now it is extremely important to double check all the emails received or apps before set up. Remember that information about donations is usually posted on official websites of health organizations. Stay safe!",1585145513,1,1

fop7yp,jacksontoledo,I need help and advise please...,"Hello Guys, 

I am building a website so I can teach people in Spain about Crypto in which is a subject no very common here and many belief is for criminal, buying drugs and you know the rest...

The idea is to keep simple but to the point, I am choosing Ledger Nano X as main Hardware wallet because it is cheaper than Trezor and Mobile Wallet I do have to in mind BRD or Exodus. I would like to know your opinion on which one to choose. Please note this is mainly for beginners but also I do not want to compromise security. To he honest, I am using Bread Wallet for so many years but Exodus looks nice. 

Also, I need to choose 7 Coins because I like the number 7 Jajaja but I would like to be the best in the long term. BTC - ETH - XRP (I know don't kill me but is fact jajaja) ADA and what else?.

The idea is to introduce people into Crypto but make it easy, secure and chain their mind about this world. 

Any advice will be welcome and if there is anyone that know how to use word press and is willing to help will be cool. 

Thank you so much for your time.",1585138234,2,1

Should I sell my ETF Index Funds at today's market rate, and hold in currency to avoid the upcoming market losses as a result of further quarantine business losses and real-estate market collapse?

fqncy8,Monchkrit,Monthly Bitcoin Sales,"Toward the end of each month there is a sale-off of certain coins. Is that due to miners who need to sale coins to pay electricity bills? It would be nice if those costs were fixed so that miners could sell coins at regular intervals to keep the market flat, but I suspect that isn't possible since electricity costs probably depend on transaction volume over time. It seems like a monthly drop in bitcoin cost should be viewed as part of our investment in the bitcoin infrastructure for at least the next few halvings, and not a place for shorting the market or a reason to sale with what appears to be a demand trend. If this is true, demand hasn't actually dropped. After the few halvings when the market is more liquid and more people use cryptocurrency for regular commerce there will be enough cryptocurrency market use so miners can make enough money from transactions they won't have to sell coins to pay the electricity bills at the end of every month.

Am I totally wrong about my understanding of how this system works, and am barking up the wrong tree? I have looked at the last two years worth of data and it holds true cryptocurrency based on computational proof of work are sold at the end of every month.

I'm a fellow beginner that has decided to invest some spare cash during these troubled times in bitcoin..

I have read some, started investing at first with revolut due to how easy it all is only to come to realise I don't actually own anything but tokens. 

Decided it was time to buy myself a hardware wallet. Got myself a cheap ledger from the official website. 

Once I tried actually buying some bitcoin from websites it showed on the ledger live software using my revolut card only to realize I actually couldn't.

Stopped trying in fear of getting my account blocked as some had gotten in the past. 

Now I ve read about bitcoin ATM machines, even though their rates are awful.. thing is, Ireland is on lockdown at the moment, and I highly doubt I could find an accessible btc ATM at moment... 

Any advice on how to manage to buy some bitcoin without getting into any trouble?

Now I realize it seems kinda click-baitish but from my extremely novice perspective, the strategy seemed to make sense. The guy shows huge gains in the video so I figured I'd try it out myself in the backtest feature of gekko. I tried it first with bitcoin, then etherium and then finally with nano because everyone seemed to be recommending it. They all made (sometimes enormous) losses.

Is the strategy is just faulty or am I doing something wrong?

First I have got to say that Cex.io isn't terrible when it works. It's an absolute POS when you run into a problem. The customer service is a bunch of pre written matrix copy and paste BS, the people themselves don't have a clue what they're doing, and the main concern and complaint is never addressed by the CS Rep. As a side note, I've had problems with Coinbase regarding customer service, but never to the point where I have had with cex.io. Here's the gist of it. Feel free to comment and I'd appreciate any advice.

I purchased an amount of BTC, which went through after a few attempts because at first the didn't even have the correct phone number to send my security code to, which was a hassle to get resolved in and of itself. Problem is the phone number that was incorect was never even removed.

Fast forward with numerous failures and having to go back and forth through the fluctuations of BTC while trying to purchase and fix the other issue.

Pro: No problems with the amount I purchased (when it finally went through) and I do like the way they don't have such a small limit like Coinbase if you're first starting out. So I make the purchase with Cex.io and everything seems well. I then send it to an online wallet, which works mildly OK. There was a slight issue with emails sent by cex.io and the wallet confirmation on Cex.io's end, which of course they refuse with their reasoning being quote, ""Could you be so kind and explain what error was on our side? There is nothing that might goes wrong.""

I already began to become worried just reading this reply as it's poorly written and was followed by three more matrix responses. I then need to send the rest of the coins to the site and when I do I get the standard email verifying where I want to send it. Turns out the confirmation was off and the coins were sent to an expired wallet number. So I then begin to freak out on my end because I had clicked the confirmation email from Cex.io and the process had already begun. They had sent my coins to an expired wallet ID due to an email sent by them while I was going through the fiasco of the deposits and phone numbers in the first transaction.

My biggest question is that is there a way Cex.io can retrieve those coins considering they were sent to an expired wallet? I can't imagine a company as large as Cex.io would not have access to their data, as well as mine, and to be able to see and confirm that the coins were indeed not sent and be able to return my money or coins. There has to be a way, right?

My problem through all of this is not only their lack of support, whether it's live chat, which they got rid of, their lack of coherent CS through email, though it's clearly matrix replies, or their non ability to do something that seems like it should be simple. Am I SOL in this situation, or do I have some recourse on the matter. It's not an ammount of money that I want to part with.

TLDR: Problems with Cex.io and their inability to resolve an pretty important situation involving them sending an email for sending confirmation to an expired wallet, all the while attempting to resolve another issue in essentially the same email thread causing confusion and extreme frustration.",1585549902,3,1

And here is an article from Folding@Home for more details: https://foldingathome.org/2020/03/15/coronavirus-what-were-doing-and-how-you-can-help-in-simple-terms/


I've created a r/Bitcoin Team for COVID19 protein folding, our team number is **238758**. add this into the GUI by clicking ""change ID"" when you start mining/folding.

I have been mining proteins now for the past week, its fairly easy to setup, but you do have to allow for express install on windows. custom installing is too much of a headache. once it's installed, it opens up a Firefox (Brave browser doesn't work, go figure) GUI where you can set how much CPU/GPU power you want to have dedicated to helping solve/folding proteins. You can use your CPU or GPU, and you can adjust the settings to have the program only work when you are idle or not doing anything. 

The COVID19 project is under the ""All"" category within the GUI.

If you have any spare computing power please try this altruistic distributed computing experiment. Folding some proteins in virtual for the benefit of a COVID19 vaccine is very much in the spirit of early Bitcoin mining. And I feel it would make Satoshi proud to know that the little community he seeded grew into something that would be brave enough to take on the monsters of this world, in more ways than one.

They think the virus wil come out and go away.  [Dr. Michael Osterholm, who has researched these type of infections, cautions that this may only be the beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZFhjMQrVts).  This means that ppl may need more liquidity in the future and will sell anything to get it!!!  Rather than take everyone's advice on buying the dip, ask yourself, ""How much liquidity do I have to handle emergencies over the next year?""  STAY AWAY if you aren't ready to handle a POSSIBLE EXTENDED DECLINE (in ALL markets, not just bitcoin)!!! Job losses are around the corner, so buying every paycheck may be foolish if your job is lost and you suddenly need CASH to pay the bills.

Traders are clueless about this virus and REALLY SHOULDN'T BE advising to dip buy because they have NO IDEA if this is a dip, or if all of this (in ALL markets) will be extended declines and what the long term impact of this virus will be.

Whats everyones thoughts?,"So I'm pretty new to this space but been watching bitcoin for a while now and with its pretty big drop I think now might be the time to look to start investing in it. I have a bit of money saved up and I think I might start to put some of that money into bitcoin over the next few months. Is this a good strategy? Or do I wait for lower prices as I think it could continue to sell off as global markets get hit by this virus? 

Also I was watching a video this morning on how to best buy bitcoin and came across this one. Would you say this is a good way to buy bitcoin on this tutorial? My friend said not to use Coinbase so was looking for other alternatives. Also can someone talk me through the hardware wallet thing he was talking about, I found it a bit confusing?

I was recently contacted with a job offer with this description.

1. Our client from your country submits a bitcoin purchase request to us.
2. We provide him with a customer support agent's bank account details for the payment.
3. Our client transfers the payment via his (her) bank account and notifies us.
4. We inform you by phone and email that the bitcoin purchase transaction has been made. And send you an email with the bitcoin purchase information and client's bitcoin details.
This operation will require from you to withdraw the money at your bank branch and to be fulfilled at the bitcoin ATM machine in your city to the given details.

I was working a customer service job and had been for almost a decade. After seeing the ""Global Integrity Marketing"" ad, I started trying new things more often to try and help myself financially. I got into a mindset of accepting failure and a willingness to at least try. Really the idea that doing anything, even a little, is better than inaction, helped the most. I tried and learned lots of things over the last 3 years. From light Linux coding on masternodes, to sales development, to real estate. 

After trying several things and learning what I like and what I don't like to spend my time on, I finally found the things that's really getting my juices pumping! I'm about to embark on a decade of financial growth that would never have been possible if, weirdly enough, I hadn't clicked a random ad I saw on Facebook.

fht6ct,vitaminBTC,Crisis of Trust,"The behavior of this market is unusual in many ways, in that the normal correlations of stocks to bonds are not there, or any safe haven assets. It is all dropping together. 

What this shows is a lack of confidence in any particular asset. Everyone is taking their ball and going home. They have no place to put their trust into, what with our Bankruptcy King president on the helm at the absolute worst possible time, Lagarde throwing Italy and the cohesion of the EU under the bus with a single phrase, and an overall lack of trustworthy leadership anywhere in the world. 

So how will this crisis of trust resolve?

If you ask me, you put it where there is no trust necessary. No trust is necessary because possession is easily verifiable, transaction irreversibility is understood, and no one can print willy nilly to their hearts desire, and reach into your pocket by doing so and pulling out purchasing power from your wallet. Throw in a monetary policy that is transparent and hard coded from inception that everyone understands and can trust won't change tomorrow or in 10 years.

The fundamental crisis of the moment is completely and squarely a trust-centric crisis. 

Once people start to stick their heads out of their bunkers, after this crazy hurricane has blown past and begin to take stock of the lessons and next moves, there is only one system designed to specifically counteract this precise doom-and-gloom scenario from ever even being possible to exist.

fl71ft,financeoptimum,"From Chaos, Comes Order","I feel it is important to discuss what is happening at the moment.

We're gonna break this down into 4 parts...

Let's start with the virus.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 1 - The Virus**

Now, this virus.

First of all, I just want as a disclaimer to say that it's important to rely on official sources of information regarding the virus since they would never lie to you...

OK, so what's up? Well, here's what's up:

This virus is the trigger for the biggest power play we've seen since 2001.

This is a perfect excuse for an economic crash.

This defers responsibility from those who are actually responsible and blames it all on this virus.

It also accelerates the inevitable trend towards a cashless society, and the much desired Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

We've had [Christine Lagarde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chHnk6lSc5A) (former head of the IMF and current President of the ECB) and [Mark Carney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPgWAWNyqMU) (former Governor for the Bank of England and current UN special envoy on climate action and climate finance) speak on digital currencies.

We've had reports from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The BIS is essentially the Central Bank for Central Banks.

Coincidence is a funny thing (just ask Larry Silverstein...):

In 2019, 1200 CEOs left their positions. That was a record year.

In the first month of 2020, 219 CEOs left. A new record.

On the topic of CEOs...

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2 - CEOs and Stock Buybacks**

The financial metrics which incentivise executives have become far removed from operating performance.

As an example, [here is a story from the end of 2014.](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-buybacks-pay/)..

This summarises perfectly what has happened!

The main source of demand for equities has been corporations (i.e.stock buybacks).

And this makes sense, incentives drive human behaviour. Pretty simple.

Now, *this* is the really infuriating part.

These corporations now want bailouts.

By the way, this will happen.

And just like '08, profits are privatised and losses are socialised.

The Airlines, which feel they are entitled to bailouts, [spent 96% of their free cash flow on stock buybacks over the past decade](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/airline-bailout-coronavirus-share-buyback-debate-trump-economy-aoc-2020-3-1029006175).

Now they want a bailout. Ridiculous!

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3 - Encryption and Privacy**

While all of this is going on, the US Government has been sneakily trying to remove end-to-end encryption and it's been [working it's way through Congress](https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/12/21174815/earn-it-act-encryption-killer-lindsay-graham-match-group).

This concerns the EARN IT Act.

The premise of the bill is that technology companies have to earn Section 230 protections rather than being granted immunity by default, as the Communications Decency Act has provided for over two decades.

If the EARN IT Act were passed, tech companies could be held liable if their users posted illegal content. When internet companies become liable for what their users post, those companies *aggressively moderate speech*.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 4 - Practicality**

Central Bank Digital Currencies are inevitable.

The NSA created the SHA-256 algorithm in 2001.

The NSA could of stopped Bitcoin early on if it truly wanted to (51% attack for example).

Why NOW allow a decentralised network of value transfer to develop, whereas previous attempts were snuffed out?

Well, going back to central banking: how about a centralised Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) that will allow a greater level of control, can facilitate negative interest rates, easier collection of taxes, etc.

For this to work, you need to usher it in gradually such that people have a decentralised alternative (i.e. BTC) and the mass public is more receptive to digital currencies more broadly. So BTC is the gold and CBDC is the ‘new fiat’.

The current situation is pretty chaotic.

But... ORDO AB CHAO

Suppose the current Bitcoin price is $5000 and I have $2500 on my account. I could just buy 0.5 BTC, but instead I would like to **open a long margin position with 3x leverage**.

So I do New Order, Intermediate, set Leverage to 3, and I buy 0.5 BTC. What happens now? Is the $2500 reduced from my account balance, and 0.5 BTC added, and the trade remains in my 'Positions' tab? Or is it something else, to reflect that my 0.5 BTC is 'locked' in this margin trade while the position is open?

Then suppose the Bitcoin price goes up by $500. **Am I correct in thinking that my (unrealized) profit is now $750, because my position is 0.5 BTC at 3x leverage?**

Now suppose at this point I want to close the trade i.e. take profit. From what I understand I have then to do a counter trade, i.e. do a margin trade in the opposite direction. So in this case I margin sell 0.5 BTC (regardless of what leverage) and then what? **Am I now left with $3250 and no BTC in my account, and no remaining open positions?**

fk6ju2,mr9714,Why Bitcoin is King,"Let's all provide our reason(s) for why Bitcoin is better than all other altcoins. No emotions, only logical reasoning why Bitcoin is better than all altcoins. I'll start by providing my 3 main reasons:  


Preface: Transaction speed isn't the main point of interest for me. Personally, I want money that cannot be inflated, and the only way that is possible is if no one controls that money, and not one entity should have majority control in keeping that network secure, because with one central securing entity, you go after that entity and the security of that network is compromised.   


If you want fast transactions, use your debit card or paypal, they're nearly instant. So if you're like me, then security and decentralization are the only important factors. 

  
Reason 1: Bitcoin is the only uncontrolled money/truly decentralized - Any altcoin can be swayed in the desired direction of its main proponent/ central controlling party (increasing supply, lowering security, censoring others from using the network, forking upon command etc..). But not bitcoin as there is no one party with majority control, i.e nodes and miners are from around the world with no single central authority. The high hashrate is the result of many community members, large and small, all vying for bitcoin.   


I believe the main proponents of other altcoins mine their own network even if it's not in their own financial interest to do so. I believe they do this to show their network is secure with the hope of building confidence in their altcoin. What happens if one day they lose interest in their network or are tired of mining at a loss?   


....And in the case of POS, don't forget there are those like Vitalik and company who have majority stake and would therefore by default have central authority to make big decisions, even if the majority of participants don't agree with them.

Reason 2: No central point of failure -  every altcoin out there has an entity behind it, that if coerced enough, could compromise the security of its network. But with bitcoin, since there isn't a single party behind it, who are you gonna go after?   


Reason 3: (but certainly not the least important). Limited supply - there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins. In order for this to be safeguarded, we have to have the presence of reason 1 and 2.

If you've been following any of my postings over the last week at all--you would have known that bitcoin's price was going to drop below its ""melting point"" and begin trading with mass volatility. That volatility (the differences between the highs and lows) fluctuates proportionally to several economic and non-economic variables. 

The biggest fluctuations have been caused by bitcoin scammers who have been manipulating the volatility of bitcoin on a large scale, to sometimes triple or quadruple their coins over 12 hours. 

Coinbase is the most popular crypto-exchange, and is the #1 place for people to get scammed out of their money.

I plan to elaborate on why this is more, later--but if you ARE going to invest in bitcoin in the next few weeks...my only recommendation is to use a different exchange. One with less people and simultaneous transaction volumes.

fjista,OtheDreamer,Hunting Kaiju and Whale Watching,"In the next 1-2 months I intend on publishing all of my findings regarding cryptocurrency manipulation, identifying the cyber actors responsible, and how people can make money in the short run (through high velocity crypto-trading) and in the long run (by buying and hodl'ing at discounted prices)

The first thing that needs to get out of the cryptocurrency waters, are the cyber criminals manipulating the currents. They've been doing for years with bitcoin mixers and getting away with it. It's now possible to identify WHEN they double (or triple or quadruple) their coins, and it can be correlated to the mixers themselves on the dark web. 

My only hope is that governments will step in soon and take quicker action to regulate bitcoin. My country, the United States, has the [Crypto Currency Act of 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/fiwd5e/whats_in_the_crypto_currency_act_of_2020/) which I fully support and would go even further on.

**What is a Kaiju?**

* **Whale** - A large investor of crypto currency, that has the capability of setting movement trends (up or down)

 * **Kaiju** - A cyber criminal with a large amount of crypto currency, who makes money off scamming others out of their coins

What does this mean?

Margin trading with high leverage doesn't just magically create more Bitcoin out of thin air just so you can get rich quick. It's a trap. If you get liquidated, you're finished.  

And from what my veteran day trader friends are telling me, there are still far too many idiots who still haven't learned their lesson after the recent mass liquidations of longs. Many are likely desperately trying to win back what Bitcoin they lost and will likely lose more. What recently took place can be best summed up as the Bitcoin holdings of thousands of greedy idiots being lost to a small handful of whales.  

Bitcoin's usage case isn't determined solely its technology, as admirable as it is. If its users keep moving all their holdings from spot exchanges and wallets to margin trading platforms and losing it all to a tiny minority of whales, there's just little hope for the future.

So what I did about a month ago just to get my feet wet and go through the process was sign up at coinbase and bought $50 worth, now valued at $30.

My intuition (could be very wrong) is telling me that with everything going on bitcoin may become valuable in the future and I'd like to buy more.  Thinking bout investing 1-2k.

So I think I haven't done things as well as I could, but ok for just investing 50 bucks.  From reading around it seems that Coinbase is not really loved around here, mostly just because of their fees, could someone point me in the right direction of a company that is better for what Im looking to get started with?

Also I keep seeing that you should not just leave your money in coinbase or wherever.  Not really sure what coinbase even is, is it like a broker?  But people say you should get a hardware wallet and have full ownership or something over your bitcoin.  Can someone recommend if I should do this and the best wallet for me.

I'm not just looking for recommendations to blindly follow though, as I'd like to understand for myself, so I'd really like for someone to point me to resources for where I can learn more.  Most newb material doesn't really get into where I am now though, its more of the history and understanding what bitcoin is and most say try coinbase, so I think I need slightly more then the most newb materials.

fnlri8,BIT_TEAM,New trading BIT.TEAM opportunities,"New trading BIT.TEAM opportunities

Currently, many crypto trading platforms are facing difficulties since the global traditional markets’ fall has influenced even the crypto industry.

Even despite the global economic difficulties there are still effective ways to trade cryptocurrency with BIT.TEAM.
 
Alternative trading opportunities for crisis times.

According to media, all of the markets are collapsing by the COVID-19 pandemic which is constantly growing. Governments are trying to improve the situation, so they boost economies by lowering interest rates and making citizens support payments. But as it turns out that’s not enough to save the economy.
Economies are collapsing one after another, companies are bearing considerable losses, and a lot of once rich enterprises are now on the verge of bankruptcy.  
When it comes to crypto, Bitcoin has failed to meet the investors’ expectations as a storage asset which is able to preserve the value in times of crisis. Anyway, it isn’t so much the Bitcoin itself as it is our fault.
None of the cryptocurrencies including bitcoin are backed by gold or by oil but they are backed by our confidence and trust. If this decrease happens again, this means that we do not trust enough.

But in any case, crypto market will recover, and all of the digital assets will start to go up. The point is, it won’t happen right away. 
So what should traders do at the time of inflation and economic recession? 

 
P2P crypto transactions
 
Р2Р (peer to peer) transaction - is an exchange of crypto assets that occurs directly between users without intermediaries.
In terms of trading, the implementation of a peer-to-peer networks mean that buyers and sellers now can negotiate prices of coins and tokens. 
At the core of P2P technology lies the decentralized approach which implies direct interaction between people.
And besides, this approach describes a computer network architecture (joint use of P2P files) in which each node can act as a server for other users and may also be used for digital currency trading.
P2P exchanges enable market players to make transactions directly with one another without third party necessary for making deals.
Standard crypto exchanges are companies that serve as intermediaries between parties and get their profit from fees. On the contrary, the P2P exchanges let parties make transactions based on pre-programmed software not requiring third parties.
This alternative approach has a number of comparative advantages. In general, P2P transactions are a good example of the philosophy of decentralization.

P2P deals on exchanges
 
Let’s see how basic crypto transactions work. People who want to sell bitcoins indicate the amount and price. All these orders are moved into an order book. Then a buyer who wants to purchase crypto searches for a suitable offer in the order book, or if there are no such offers creates his/her own “purchase order” stating the terms of the deal.
The exchange matches orders according to price where possible, and processes transactions. 
Such operations may take up a lot of time - from about 10 minutes to several hours.
 Fiat money remittances are even more time-consuming (in some cases, they take up couple of days). In order to speed up the process, the exchange acts as a trusted intermediary: it confirms all the deals even if the actual transactions have not been finished yet.

P2P-exchanges offer a different approach.
 
Every time there are matching orders for buying/selling the exchange’s software connects buyer with seller so that they could make a direct deal without third parties.
 Nevertheless, intermediaries may be involved as arbitrators in the settlement of disputes but no third parties’ participation is needed in standard deals by default. It is the software that matches traders in a decentralized way.
 
Benefits and examples

P2P-exchanges offer a high tolerance of transaction censorship, they are cheap to use, private and safe. 
All benefits of decentralized exchanges arise from the absence of one major company that takes full responsibility. Such company would guarantee some advantages but it would also serve as a point of failure, and each of its errors would have a negative impact on the whole system. 
Today there are a great number of P2P platforms that enable users to receive maximum safety, convenience and freedom. These are the world-known crypto trading platforms such as BIT.TEAM. Describing itself as a P2P platform it gives an opportunity to operate such crypto assets as:
 
BTC
PZM
BIP
LTC
ETH
BCH
USDT
BTT
 
Another benefit of this platform is a wide choice of international digital coins and means of payment that simplifies the transaction processing.
The issue worth special attention is the systems of payment. Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Payoneer and most of Russian, Ukrainian and other countries’ large banks  will easily make any transaction.
There is also a referral system BIT.TEAM which allows traders to get bonuses from their partners’ deals within the service.
 
Conclusion
 
When we speak of the “Proof of Stake” algorithm crypto assets, we speak of new opportunities, and the popularity of such assets proves their capability. But the choice is yours.",1584977106,0,1

This semester I’m graduating from my university, and now I’m all into writing thesis. My topic is Event analysis and their impact on prices of chosen cryptocurrencies. 
I have already built a regression model for prices of Bitcoin, and now I lack data in order to perform analysis. I need daily transactions and supply of Bitcoin. 

I found multiple websites with needed data, but in many cases there are only graphs and no possibility to download actual data (numbers). I download CSV file from blockchain.com website, but it all I got in that file were just days😭

In case you have this kind of excel files, or at least know where I can get daily transactions and supply, please comment here

&amp;#x200B;

I have been doing some research for the past couple of weeks, and I am having a hard time figuring out the current landscape of the BTC payment options. From my understanding you can either:

1. pay directly with BTC
   1. no major merchants (Walmart, Amazon, etc.) accept this from what I am aware
2. Go through a third party payment processor
   1. I have not found one that I am comfortable with because they don't seem to be very well established yet. Can someone point me to some payment processors that I should check out?

Please let me know if I got something wrong, and help me to make my first purchase using the Bitcoin!",1583975538,6,1

I did the math between farming runescape unicorn horns on multiple accounts and mining bitcoin. I could do about $20 an hour in RuneScape gold or farm only 3 bitcoins a day. I left the setup running 24/7 for two years. I’d have been a multi millionaire if I did bitcoin instead of RS. Instead I make $10 an hour after graduation and can’t afford a computer at all, haven’t had health insurance in 4 years, and have to ride a bike to work because I could afford the property taxes on my car and had to sell it for parts""

There’s media that wants to say bitcoin isn’t a safe haven because it goes down with the stock market. I come back with that bitcoin will continue to run ignoring all that.  

While the price people trade falls due to the global markets tanking at the moment bitcoin still runs.

I’m sure most of you feel the same.

Bitcoin is not a company that is weak that would normally not survive because a stock or business is losing revenue.

This is a bad storm.

Later on this will be a time to look back on as a good deal perhaps. I mean there’s a lot of a good deals actually at the moment.  Good deals everywhere in a bunch of categories of the investment.",1584059963,1,1
