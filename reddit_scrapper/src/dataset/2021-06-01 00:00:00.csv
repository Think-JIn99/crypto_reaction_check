nrfgin,Leader92,Hardware multisig wallets are insecure? Please give your opinion.,"[How nearly all personal hardware wallet multisig setups are insecure](https://shiftcrypto.ch/blog/how-nearly-all-personal-hardware-wallet-multisig-setups-are-insecure/)

TL;DR

Ledger and other major wallet manufactures do not provide a way to verify your xPUB on demand. Therefore, you may have a 2-3 multisig wallet on electrum connected by 3 hardware wallets, but since xPUB cannot be verified, a compromised computer can replace your xPUB leaving you either locked out of your coins (the attacker has the other xPUB) or coins being sent to the attacker's wallet (they replaced your non-verified xPUB with theirs)

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? They claim that single wallets are more secured than multisig, I've always wondered why the richest bitcoin wallets do not use multisig, except Bitfinex.",1622732224,10,1

# IN 2020, THE VALUE OF BITCOIN SOARED BY 300%

On 8 January, the value of [***Bitcoin***](https://cashessentials.org/glossary/bitcoin/), the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency peaked at over $41,000 for the first time. It has since lost $10,000 in a characteristic swing of volatility. Over 2020, the price of bitcoin soared over 300%, with the price of many other cryptocurrencies also rising sharply. Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency grew by over 400% in 2020. The market capitalisation of Bitcoin amounts to over $700 billion.

 

The rise has sparked interest from speculators and investors in search of quick profits in times of economic uncertainty. In October, PayPal enabled its customers to hold Bitcoin as well as other virtual currencies in their digital wallets as well as use it to pay merchants who accept Paypal transactions. However, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey cautioned over Bitcoin‚Äôs use as a [***payment method***](https://cashessentials.org/glossary/payment-method/). ‚ÄúI have to be honest, it is hard to see that Bitcoin has what we tend to call [***intrinsic value***](https://cashessentials.org/glossary/intrinsic-value/),‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt may have extrinsic value in the sense that people want it.‚Äù

Regardless of how it is used, Bitcoin is consuming more and more energy. Without a centralised authority, the [***blockchain***](https://cashessentials.org/glossary/blockchain/) technology ‚Äì the underlying technology on which Bitcoin is based ‚Äì rests on a ‚Äúconsensus mechanism‚Äù to ensure trust across the network. In the case of bitcoin, consensus is achieved by a method called ‚ÄúProof-of-Work‚Äù (PoW), where computers (or miners) on the network compete with each other to solve a complex mathematical puzzle. Once the puzzle is solved, the latest ‚Äúblock‚Äù of transactions is approved and added to the ‚Äúchain‚Äù of transactions. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with new bitcoins and network transaction fees. The energy use of the bitcoin network is therefore both a security feature and a side effect of relying on the ever-increasing computing power of competing miners to validate transactions through PoW.

# AN ENERGY CONSUMPTION EQUIVALENT TO BELGIUM

[In 2017, it was estimated that a single Bitcoin transaction would require as much energy as the weekly consumption of an average American household](https://cashessentials.org/news/energy-guzzling-bitcoin-not-so-environmental-friendly/). Three years later, the energy demand is three times higher and this has become a serious concern due to its impact on global warming. [A new study by Alex de Vries](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629620302966?via%3Dihub), a blockchain expert at PwC and founder of Digiconomist.net, finds that a conservative estimate of the annual electrical energy consumption of Bitcoin amounts to 87.1 TWh as per September 2019, equaling the energy consumption of a country like Belgium.

The [Digiconomist](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption) website provides a Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index with real-time data on the estimated energy consumption and environmental impact. It estimates that the footprint of a single Bitcoin transaction generates over 300 kgCO2 (equivalent kilos of carbon dioxide) and requires 633 kWh of electricity or the equivalent to the power consumption of an American household for 21 days.",1622731236,19,1

Typically, volatility declines during consolidation phases, encouraging buyers to return, albeit briefly.

Bitcoin is above the 100-period moving average on both the hourly and four-hour chart as the corrective phase stabilizes.

On the daily chart, the relative strength index (RSI) is rising from oversold levels which could keep buyers active towards $42,000 resistance.

A decisive breakout above resistance would yield an upside target around $45,000.

Bitcoin was trading around $39,300 at press time and was up about 5% over the past 24 hours.

I can literally see the real life application here... let's say you have a food truck and you accept payment through those apps.


Only downside was when I send back BTC to my wallet(on chain) it cost me 13000 Sats which I don't think is major problem(in real life, I don't think consumers are gonna send it back to on-chain often)

They still need to buy bread, gas, pay for school supplies for their kids, hire a plumber to unclog the sink, etc.

Energy wise it is very inefficient but expense wise it really is not and that can somehow justify or equate for the energy usage.

In all Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in nature is very inexpensive compared to the financial system.  Because in the financial system you need to pay support staff, IT staff, infrastructure cost, customer service staff, LAWYERS and LOBBYISTS, and finally the FAT CAT CEO and GREEDY SHAREHOLDERS who takes the biggest pie.   You can blame that transaction fees are high but the monetary cost of not needing any of the following above makes a valid argument as to why it is better to pay into a large pool of verifiers vs. paying a corporate entity and its FAT CEOs. 

cryptocurrency itself in nature if done properly can run on its own independently pretty much forever without the need of ""institutional staff"".  The system is also a build in trust vs. in financial system you have to hope that the banks and everyone else have your best interest in mind, how many time have banks locked people out of their accounts due to dubious accusations.

So this is completely fine - people have been investing in startups for a long time and this appears to be just another way to do this. Arguably a better way that going down the Angel investment route which is famous for not really having a liquid market. But what I find somewhat confusing/strange is that these distributed applications work with a currency, say ETH, but this currency is also the share capital for the business. I guess conceptually there's no reason why people couldn't use share certificates to purchase items and with the nature of coins for these businesses this makes it very possible. But this seams like me starting a new business and only having the product/service be available for purchase via my share certificates?

So, I'm wondering whether I'm just not getting this. Or this is what is going on.

Because, if this is the case, you've got all these alt coins that a re more like buying shares in a startup but then are also used as the currency for the startup.

Maybe more importantly, why wouldn't a second layer solution offering the features that these alt coins offer but transacting in BTC be better? I mean why have smart contracts that only transact with a currency that is basically share capital for the smart contracts (ETH?). It would seem that a second layer solution would be better except that the current alt coin approach provides the funding to develop the solution.

Not sure if I'm being clear here.",1622717318,2,1

ntmzwu,Lejitz,There are potentially huge US tax and reporting implications if El Salvador makes Bitcoin legal tender,"On its face, it‚Äôs obviously great for Bitcoin if El Salvador adopts it as its legal tender. There are, however, nuances in the internal revenue code that make this news much bigger than most realize.

Most know that when trading foreign currencies gains must be reported and are taxed.  But Section 988(e) carves out a *de minimis* exception for ‚Äúpersonal transactions‚Äù where the gains do not exceed $200.

This is intended to allow travelers to transact in foreign currencies without all of the burdensome reporting requirements.

So far, Bitcoin has not qualified for this exception.  Under IRS Notice 2014-21, the IRS opines that Bitcoin is ‚Äúproperty‚Äù and not a ‚Äúcurrency‚Äù because ‚Äú**it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction**.‚Äù  There is a good argument, though, that once Bitcoin is ‚Äúlegal tender‚Äù in El Salvador, it will qualify for US individuals as a ‚Äúnonfunctional currency‚Äù (under Section 988), allowing individuals to forgo reporting gains on small, daily transactions‚Äî‚Äúpersonal transactions.‚Äù

In other words (**tldr**), if Bitcoin is legal tender in El Salvador, US citizens could possibly freely transact in Bitcoin, as a ‚Äúnonfunctional currency,‚Äù without a need to report gains of less than $200.

That‚Äôs potentially huge news for retail US citizens, but **there is also huge news for US Bitcoin businesses.**

Most US businesses use the US dollar as their unit of account for bookkeeping and reporting.  However, there are cases where businesses operating primarily in foreign jurisdictions use a foreign currency‚Äîthe unit of account does not have to be USD.  The unit of account used by the business is the ‚Äú**functional currency**‚Äù of the business and, perhaps, even an individual (see Sec. 985 IRC).  If a business‚Äôs ‚Äúfunctional currency‚Äù is a foreign currency, it does not have to bother with gains/losses related to USD fluctuations.

Again, under Notice 2014-21, Bitcoin cannot qualify as a functional currency.  And, again, this could change if El Salvador adopts Bitcoin as legal tender.

**Final tldr** If Bitcoin becomes legal tender in El Salvador, IRS Notice 2014-21 may become partially null, relieving US individuals and business of huge tax and reporting burdens, paving the way for Bitcoin to legally and easily be used as a currency in the US.

ntmhae,Not_creative_enough0,An opinion on how FUD is making BTC go sideways rn,"Heads up, I'm just a month old wallet in the crypto space who wants to share a piece of my mind so go easy on me.

So I mentioned a couple of days ago in the daily discussion group that rn, there's a lot of FUD (from tweets, news, Elon, YT influencers, etc) going on. And that the reason why there's a symmetrical triangle pattern on BTC might be due to the whales and miners accumulating (causing an upward trend) while the shorters and panic sellers keep selling (causing the downward trend). 

But I've been thinking, why can't some of the big bois (HFs, institutions, and billionaires) short the F out of BTC inducing more panic selling and another huge crash and buy lower? They cant and they won't. Why? Cuz another GME/AMC situation might happen and they wouldn't wanna take that risk. So, how can they bring the price of BTC lower without taking any risk whatsoever? Through the spread of FUD.

Let's say their first step to induce FUD is by spreading it on the mainstream news channel. Half of the new dumb money will believe that shit and another half won't.
2nd step, shake up the other half that didn't believe. How? Through influencers. Ofc some influencers spread FUD for a living. But for those who aren't keen on spreading the FUD, how to make them hesitate and spread that hesitation to their followers? 

One, short BTC every time someone like Elon tweets or china spreads FUD. The more tweets/news gets posted, the less of an influence they will have over time. However, in the process, agitation and hesitation grow. The market will go sideways. People will WAIT for confirmation. And this ""waiting"" isn't good. Soon this waiting can turn into more hesitation and then ultimately into fear when the chart's structures and price actions are looking iffy. This in turn will cause fewer people to buy and more and more sellers to enter the market. Once the bears take over... it's game over. The whales' objectives will have been reached. They will control the price of BTC till they decide on their terms to start the bull run. They'll make a killing and a majority of retail investors will either just hold the bag, turn away from BTC, or do the signature ""buy high and sell low.""

Now that I thought from the perspective of the big boys, what can retailers do? Do we keep buying while they keep selling and shorting? My answer is yes. No big dick macho el macho red bull + cereal for breakfast type of energy. Logically, the same thing with GameStop will happen if they decide to MEGAshort BTC. Additionally, instead of going all in, DCAing regularly is fine. The only issue is the ""waiting"" for that extra few percent gains. 

Since 2013 and 2017, BTC has been a retailer's thing for the most part. It's only recently that more whales came in for the fiat gains. The fundamentals never changed. The history, the charts, the Fib retracement lines from 4 years ago never changed. Inflation is here; the US dollar will fall in value (meaning 1 btc = more dollars cuz the D got weak). Salvador recently legitimized BTC as a payment method NATIONWIDE. Companies worldwide are investing in it and incorporating BTC into their business models.

Just for a few grand, you're gonna let the bears take over? FR? Don't be dissuaded by public opinion cuz sooner or later more countries will do the same until the day arrives where it would be weird if a country does not transact with BTC. Guys greed and timing is the worst thing we can do in this market. I'm not trying to spread hopium, but resolve and steel.

In summary, DCA into BTC and crypto in general, avoid spreading FUD and getting affected by it, and stop being greedy for the extra few percent gains by timing BTC and ""waiting"" for it to fall.

However, it also breeds an echo-chamber filled with false narratives and does not provide someone who is new to crypto a fair understanding of what they are looking at.  


I will bring up one example that I find especially puzzling.

Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy announced on May 18th that they just spent $10.9 million to buy 229 bitcoins, at an average price of $43,663 per bitcoin, including fees.    
This was touted around the Bitcoin community as an assurance ""Look, the smart money is buying"" etc. What I saw was a company that spent 2.25 Billion dollars on Bitcoin over the past year spent another 10 Million (0.44% of their total invested capital, it barely moved their average acquisition cost of   $24,450 per bitcoin) as a desperate attempt to bring some positive news in what they knew was a down trending market in order to protect their 2.25B of assets. Quite cheap actually. 

They did NOT buy another 10M worth of Bitcoin because they thought it was a sound investment at 43k USD, apart from acting as a Bitcoin promo piece. 

I did not see a single YouTuber or post talking about this as a major alarm of what was most likely coming, instead they were too busy selling the hype. 

For what it is worth I appreciate that MicroStrategy did what they did, at least they were willing to put 10M on the line to protect their investment. But the way it might have dragged new retail money into Bitcoin at that point in time is a bit sad all things considered.   


I have no idea if Bitcoin is going up or down next, I am a huge believer in the blockchain technology and I have no doubt that it will be an integral part of our future, but to enter this space without accepting that any market can and will be manipulated is na√Øve. Most of us can not afford to be that na√Øve and I implore you all to talk about Bitcoin in a more nuanced way when you introduce it to people in order to have them pumped about the tech, and not the potential monetary upside, that should be a bonus.  


I have been studying the bitcoin graph for hours daily (for years) and it is clear as day to anyone who has any technical background in trading that we are in a highly manipulated environment at the moment. I personally believe that Bitcoins market cap will be too big to manipulate to this degree in a not so distant future but until then we need to accept the reality of the situation and not blindly tell people what to do with their money when we bear none of the responsibility.   


I hope that Bitcoin will endure, because we need an asset class like it and I would prefer if the first attempt was successful rather than have to wait another decade for the inevitable.",1622988263,15,1

2. Create A Bitcoin Wallet.

There are hundreds of Bitcoin wallets in existence, but the best wallet for beginners is Exodus. Exodus allows you to store multiple cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and is available for Apple, Android, and Windows devices.

Just search up Exodus on the App Store, Google Play Store, or visit Exodus.com for Windows devices.

Another reputable wallet with similar features is Trust Wallet.


3. Choose where you‚Äôd like to purchase your Bitcoin.

If you‚Äôre purchasing Bitcoin for the first time, Changelly is probably the way to go. Changelly offers a variety of convenient payment methods including credit card, debit card, and Apple Pay. 

Changelly also compares multiple providers in order to find the best exchange rate for you.

To get started, you‚Äôll need to copy your Bitcoin address from your Exodus Wallet and paste it into Changelly, so they know where to send your Bitcoin to. Once you‚Äôve copied your Bitcoin address, you can use the link below to purchase Bitcoin.

But Brian Estes from Off the Chain Capital, who is a Bitcoin Bull and does some great research came up with this stat:

In 2013: A 60% stock 40% bond portfolio would have given you a 11.5% return.

The same year (a year where BTC went parabolic): A 58% stock, 40% bond 2% btc portfolio would have returned 128.9%.

In 2018: 60/40 portfolio would have give a -5.6% return.

The same year (a year where BTC was down over 70%): 58/40/2 portfolio would have returned -6.8%.

So as you can see adding 2% btc to the portfolio gives a big upside in the good year, but only just over 1% more loss in the down year.

Another stat he produced was over 5 years:

For the 60/40 portfolio the max drawdown was -21.64%

On the 58/40/2 portfolio the max drawdown was -21.51%

Adding 2% btc did not make the portfolio more volatile.

In conclusion, over 5 years:

60/40: 7.74% return CAGR.

58/40/2: 10.06% return CAGR without anymore risk added.

This may not look like a big deal but for fund managers if they realise they can gain over 2% a year without any more risk it is a big deal, especially when you take in to account the power of compounding returns over many years.",1622977604,5,1

However, the world of crypto can be a daunting one. Where do you go to buy crypto? Which types should you invest in?

Fortunately, we can help you. In this guide, we‚Äôll go over the best ways to safely buy crypto ‚Äî and without a struggle at that!

# What to Look Out for When Buying Crypto

When you‚Äôre searching to buy crypto, you generally want to head to a trusted platform like Coinbase or [Crypto Exchange](https://www.assetinvesto.com/2021/06/investing-in-crypto-what-to-know-about.html). These are vetted groups that manage your funds safely and securely. They generally have good customer service and even provide some education when it comes to trading.

That said, be careful in your search. There are loads of scam exchanges and fake traders out there. All of them sport convincing copy to try and get you to give them your money. Of course, there are valid ways to trade one-on-one with users if you don‚Äôt want to use an exchange. But make sure you do so via an escrow service, rather than a random online trade.

If you don‚Äôt want to use the internet, you *can* buy crypto at a Bitcoin ATM, assuming there is one in your area. While these are few and far between, heading to one can save you many risks. However, be careful when at a machine. Spending time there signals to others that you‚Äôre involved in crypto. Being involved in crypto comes with the stigma you have a lot of money. Any bad actors around might catch wind of this.

If you use an ATM, head there quickly, do your business, and leave. It‚Äôs similar to using a traditional ATM. Don‚Äôt make yourself known. Maybe bring a trusted friend or family member to help ward off any thieves.

# What to do When You‚Äôve Bought crypto

Once you‚Äôve used any of those above methods to [buy cryptocurrency](https://www.assetinvesto.com/2021/05/top-cryptocurrency-2021-by-value.html), it‚Äôs time to store it. How? Well, there are many ways to do so ‚Äî each of varying degrees of safety.

If you‚Äôve bought on a crypto exchange, you can easily store your assets on the platform in its online wallet. However, there is an inherent risk to this. If the exchange goes under or is a scam, your assets might be gone forever. That, and the platform always has a risk of being hacked. While an online wallet is great for a short time, you don‚Äôt want to hold assets there for long.

If you‚Äôre planning to hold long-term, hardware or paper wallet is the best way. A hardware wallet is basically a USB stick with a screen on it that can safely store your crypto. What‚Äôs great about this is the wallet isn‚Äôt connected to the internet. When it‚Äôs not plugged in, no bad actor can gain access to your assets. They‚Äôd need the wallet itself to grab them.

This way, you‚Äôre also putting the security of [your assets](https://www.assetinvesto.com/2021/03/new-trends-in-finance-digital.html) into your own hands. You can place the wallet in a safe or safety deposit box, and rest assured.

There‚Äôs also the paper wallet method. This involves printing a QR code onto a sheet of paper ‚Äî one that stores the keys to your assets. Most people create a paper wallet then laminate and bury the sheet. Considering these assets are only accessible via scanning said QR code, there‚Äôs no risk of theft here.

That said, if you lose or even tear that sheet of paper, there‚Äôs no way of recovering the assets. It‚Äôs also a pain to trade or manage this crypto otherwise. Only use a paper wallet if you plan to hold it for a very long time.

Now you know how to buy and store your crypto assets safely. As always, do your research before investing and know what you‚Äôre getting into. That way, you can head into the crypto space while minimizing risk.",1622977561,2,1

What if BTC did become a widely accepted and acknowledged transaction for all the bad things in the world e.g. organised crime, dictatorships, international smuggling rings, tax evasion schemes? At the moment of course the relationship between BTC and any of this is (from what I read) very low, and very much overplayed by mainstream media.

But what if it did become the go-to choice for all the corrupt regimes in the world, and the organised drugs/illegal activities? Would the demand &amp; buy-in from these stakeholds replace and overtake the current institutional players? Would the mining operations up-root from fiat-countries to BTC-countries? Would we have a world divided between the BTC and non-BTC countries, and if so how would the geopolitics play out? What impact would it have on BTC supply &amp; demand?

There simply seems to be an incentive to do it if you have your own cryptocurrency or CBDC that you want to take its place. And since it only cost $17M per day to wage this war, and that you would likely win the moment you attacked, then there is an incentive to develop a competing currency that you hold a metric fuck ton of and eventually do this attack forcing everyone to switch to it making you rich af when the dust has settled.

And it gets worse. Because the raw cost to attack Bitcoin will not go up significantly anymore, in fact it may go down. But even if price keeps doubling, and fees per block keep doubling you are never going to reach a cost to attack that could deter a truly determined group to do it it seems.

The things working against such an attack is if BTC adoption becomes so widespread that ending it would be detrimental to yourself. But this is somewhat of a paradox because if BTC isnt safe until people adopt it, why would people adopt it?

There is also another potential solution where larger interests and even individuals keep hashrate at hand to mobilise and mine at a loss during an attack, and then it would just be a matter of time to see who quits first. The malicious miner, or the honest miner. But this doesent seem ideal in any way either.

So in my opinion more research needs to be done alternative consensus mechanisms, for example proof of stake since it seems to scale better with marketcap in terms of raw security which is the most important aspect going forward imo.",1623250099,29,1

Forming a strategy to handle the crypto market volatility","**About your author: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&amp;A service to online courses, from books to our weekly**[ **Moonshot Monday**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/weekly-podcast/) **podcast. Visit us at**[ **www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

That is the question on the minds of many crypto investors right now.

If we must indulge our own question we have to point out that it is too early to say. The average length of a bear market is 289 days or 10 months, although the crypto winter lasted a few years. However it does seem we could be headed for a bumpy ride over the coming months. One telling sign is that naysayers are receiving more coverage than optimists with price forecasts of bitcoin as low as $16,000. Gone are the days of the $100,000 and $500,000 bitcoin price predictions. 

Another sign is from something called the ‚ÄòFear and Greed Index.‚Äô As the name suggests the index measures fear and greed inherent in the crypto market.  It has a value from zero to 100, where a value of zero means ‚ÄòExtreme Fear‚Äô. Last month the index was in the green for ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô with a score of 73. Last week it was at 20 representing Extreme Fear and this week it is down at 13.

These signs would suggest sentiment is at an extreme low. So is it really too early to tell if we are in a bear market or a more appetizing dip? I am sorry to have to tell you the answer is not a satisfactory one. No one has a clue. 

There could be two scenarios. The first one is that the market will find a comfortable bottom and growth will resume, continuing along the path of the bull run, a run which started in May 2020. The second scenario is the market continues its downward spiral for some time to come. The truth is no one knows what route the market will take, not even Elon Musk.

**Who gives a shit anyway?**

I saw a post on Twitter this morning which said, ‚ÄòWhat is causing these dips?‚Äô The reality is, who gives a shit‚Ä¶

This novice investor has missed the point. Do you think Warren Buffet is examining his stock price on a daily basis? The answer is a resounding no. He focuses on what is in front of him now. He makes decisions for the long term confident that the future will look after itself. And it usually does. 

We have to take the same attitude. If we believe that cryptocurrency is the future then we must make long term investment decisions which means buying into quality projects with fundamentals. You then become less interested in the vagaries of the market and more concerned with ensuring you are invested in the best projects. If you are taking the alternative approach of investing in projects which could be classified as a fad, like the memecoin phase we are going through right now, then I can understand why you are checking your portfolio on a minute by minute basis. If you are making money following this strategy I am pleased for you. But don‚Äôt delude yourself, you are not exactly investing in what many of us consider is the future, Web 3.0. If you believe blockchain is going to take over from the internet a dip or a bear market is irrelevant to you. As they say, quality always floats to the top in the end. 

**Join us on** r/MoonshotMonday **for lively debate and quality investment ideas.** 

**Looking at the positives**

We are in a far better place than the early investors back in 2018. Don‚Äôt forget bitcoin went as low as $3,100 then. However the future isn‚Äôt bitcoin. Bitcoin was a starter for 10. Already bitcoin‚Äôs dominance is down to 41%, that has further to go. Someone recently described it as being the AOL in the early days of the internet. And we think they are spot on. The future is altcoins. And investors who have the foresight to invest in altcoins are in the right place because the Amazon, Google, Facebook of the Web 3.0 world haven‚Äôt been discovered yet. Or if they have, there is still time to get in on the act. 

It is the pioneers who have the arrows in their back. It won‚Äôt be a smooth ride but investing in altcoins is still only a minority game. The big money is still to be made. 

**Words of wisdom**

We must try to ignore the market volatility and focus on buying into quality projects which we believe are solving a real world problem. Avoid the metoo projects and the memecoins. Focus on the famous inspirational words of Baron Rothschild, ‚ÄúBuy when there‚Äôs blood on the streets, even if the blood is your own.‚Äù That translates into buying quality assets below their true worth. A quick look at many of the leading crypto projects shows that their values are significantly below their all time highs. If you have faith in these projects then now is the time to buy.

Here is a quick sample of a few quality projects comparing their current prices to their all time highs:

ETH   -45%

THETA   -47%

LINK   -57%

MATIC   -49%

DOT   -59%

COMP   -65%

**Concluding remarks**

The important question isn‚Äôt if we are in a dip or a bear market, it is, have we invested in quality projects at realistic valuations? The winners have still to be decided. It is highly likely that in a few years time bitcoin will no longer be the most valuable cryptocurrency. It is also perfectly possible that other chains will take over from Ethereum or at least be offering a viable alternative. The winners will be the ones which embrace mainstream adoption choosing to focus on easy to understand user interfaces. The average Joe is scared away by DEXs and the various DeFi apps doing the rounds. This will change as technology advances and as developers start listening to marketeers rather than the other way round.

The winners will be the projects that embrace the mass market.  When aunt Polly can find her way round Uniswap without pulling out her hair that will be a strong indicator we have arrived. But in the meantime this is a great time to search for the projects that will make that breakthrough. They are still out there.

Krugman 1998, ‚ÄúThe growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in ‚ÄòMetcalfe‚Äôs law' becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005, it will become clear that the Internet‚Äôs impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine‚Äôs‚Äù 

We should stop listening to nobel prize winning economists when it comes to Crypto currency. In every industry there's a consensus, a status quo that will fight to keep non confirming ideas out of their industry, because obviously, if the 'experts' don't agree with it, how can it possibly be a good idea. The problem is that revolutionary ideas often come from the outside and are often radically different from whatever expert consensus is at that time. Economists and experts bashing bitcoin is basically a form of peer review - experts disregarding bitcoin because it doesn't fit in their narrow view of the field. 

""While peer review works most of the time, it militates against those harbouring original, even revolutionary, ideas. Yet it is these ideas - lonely furrows ploughed by brilliant individuals against the mainstream - that change science, spur new technologies and create wealth. Examples include the laser, the transistor and the deduction of the structure of DNA.""

We should not be looking at 'experts' to help us on this journey of creating a decentralised finance system. These experts have been schooled and conditioned to think in a certain way.

In my opinion BTC is limited in it's current form as a currency because of volatility. If you have something which rises 200% per year......then you why would you ever spend it for day to day basis knowing that same btc will be worth more 200% or more next year? Or lower by 50% next month?

I think the price will stabilise in \~10 years. But imo btc is not ready yet. What happens to BTC if this becomes a flop? More FUD like when tesla decided after all it would not accept BTC. 

It will be a big blow to BTC. One which might take a very long time for us to recover. This is what I fear.",1623246785,5,1

nvwfnh,kwaker88,Fiat based system is slavery of the mind,"Throughout human history, humans have enslaved each other through physical labor - slavery of the body. 

People get so worked up about this - rightfully so - but what about the slavery of the mind?

It's not as easy to realize to we're slaves of the mind. It takes a further line of rational thinking. People in power want you to want what they have - celebrities flashing cars, mass consumerism, social media. They want you to work as much as you can to obtain it. They target our greed, lust, and gluttony. They advertise that fiat money will help you obtain these things. This is why we're so vested thinking in terms of USD.

But if they can control USD, that means they can control you.

This is why the price chart of Bitcoin doesn't matter. It goes up, down, sideways. If you are emotionally distraught at the price or overly excited in terms of fiat - which is something someone controls, you are a slave of the mind. In my honest opinion, that is worse than being a slave of the body.

nvw6hg,Mikrotik2,Gresham's law in El Salvador and Bitcoin as world's monetary standard.,"What's Gresham's law?    


""The law states that any circulating currency consisting of both ""good"" and ""bad"" money (both forms required to be accepted at equal value under legal tender law) quickly becomes dominated by the ""bad"" money. This is because people spending money will hand over the ""bad"" coins rather than the ""good"" ones, keeping the ""good"" ones for themselves. Legal tender laws act as a form of price control. In such a case, the intrinsically less valuable money is preferred in exchange, because people prefer to save the intrinsically more valuable money.""  


And once people of El Salvador understand the ""intrinsic"" value of bitcoin, eventually bitcoin will accumulate and disappear from circulation.  Is this a bad thing? nop! in fact it is the beginning of bitcoin as a true store of value. And as countries turn bitcoin into a currency option as well, beyond a store of value, it will only be a matter of time to become the world's monetary standard.",1623245953,12,1

I don't talk about my investments with anybody in my life who isn't an investor, so it can get a little comfortable in my echo chamber. I feel bad for those who are so scared to adopt crypto because in a few years they're going to wish they did (or they're not going to have a choice anymore).

DarkSide hacks the Colonial Pipeline and demands payment


Colonial Pipeline succumbs to demand and pays millions in bitcoin to DarkSide


DarkSide begins moving the bitcoin they received through a variety of wallets


US law enforcement begins using various tools to monitor the on-chain transactions


DarkSide eventually moves the bitcoin into a wallet or exchange account that US law enforcement has jurisdiction over
US law enforcement gets a warrant and demands the wallet provider or exchange business to turn over the bitcoin


The wallet provider or exchange business complies with the law enforcement demand in an effort to remain in good standing



Summary:

because the original reports suggested FBI were able to hack a private bitcoin wallet and retrieve the ransom paid to the hackers of the Colonial Pipeline. Means the FBI can break bitcoin crypto. Not good.  

But the reports turned out to be that the hackers used a rental cloud service to store the BTC so the FBI just issued a subpoena to retrieve the service and thus recovered the BTC. But didn‚Äôt actually ‚Äúbreak‚Äù BTC like originally thought.",1623242311,0,2

They gained experience, and more importantly, identity. Young people would kill for that level of stability. 

Nowadays, people will enter the job market at the age of 30 without any prior ""real adult job"" experience, no pension plan, and minimum wage. They've worked their asses off, studied for a decade+ compared to that of their parents... 

They had to dumpster dive for groceries and wear whatever they could find in a thrift shop. They probably worked as cleaners, bartenders, prostitutes, etc. whilst going through a curriculum twice as complicated as anything their parents ever had to read. 

Anxiety and depression is the new norm. Everyone has an eating disorder, drug addiction, and suicidal state of mind. Many of them never had a childhood.

Millennials gave the best years of their life to a system of inflation that in return made everything unaffordable to them. Millennials want to die. Gen Z is Patrick Bateman with multi-coloured hair.

....

Your parents bought a house in their early twenties. That house had easily tripled in value by the time they sold and bought their second house. They each had a car. Back then you could put your money in the bank and it actually paid interest. Nowadays, it likely costs you money to even open an account and the fees are out of control.

On top of that, the capitalism that once fueled tremendous growth has since turned into hypercapitalism, also known as modern-day slavery. As the economy changed so did the underlying incentives, with entire industries changing their modus operandi... every single appliance, piece of clothing, or furniture you have bought in your life has likely been R&amp;D'ed from the perspective of a Planned Obsolescence framework. Samsung and Apple have both been to court and fined for self-destruct mechanisms in their smartphones. 

It's like playing in a rigged casino. Also, the ice caps are melting and it's somehow all your fault, you stupid stupid millennial gen z piece of worthless...

...

Apathy has set in... to the point of the elite being able to get away with anything. The Panama Papers revealed that the Queen of England has been funneling money out of Britain for years and yet this obvious treason has somehow not even resulted in further investigations. On top of that, Prince Andrew is an obvious pedo and [no one is talking about Epstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gGBijjigEk), who somehow managed to strangle himself just as the cameras went out.

o0e36g,FineNobodyXYZ,Which countries will still have zero crypto/BTC sale tax in 2022...?,"Hello, there are currently several countries where (at least as individual) you dont pay taxes for selling your bitcoin (zero taxes)... These currently are: Germany (after 1 year of holding), Austria (i think; and the conditions should be the same as germany), Slovenia, Portugal, Belarus, Singapur, (Switzerland(?))... And few others... Besides these there are (i believe) countries that you pay zero taxes on ""capital gains"" in general, this means you shouldnt pay any taxes on BTC sales either... (Im not sure about this and im not sure about which countries are these)...

But i have other question: All these countries mentioned are ""crypto tax heavens"", CURRENTLY (!), in the year 2021... If one is looking to possibly sell BTC in the next year - 2022, which countries are a ""safe bet"", that they still WONT tax BTC even in 2022...? For example i think i read this:

\- Belarus should be safe in this regard since they plan to change/review the BTC sale tax laws, BUT (!) they plan to do it in 2023 (so 2022 should still be safe(?)).

\- Portugal - The fact that you dont pay taxes for BTC sales is a mere ""accident"" here as far as i know and their government is simply a litte bit ""incompetent"" and ""behind"". The fact that you dont have to pay is just ""temporary"" and i read a lot about new laws that WILL TAX crypto are comming probably in 2022... SO in 2021 it should be still safe, but in 2022 not so much (?) (!)...

 \-(I think) I have even read about Germany possibly looking into taxing BTC in the next year (years?)?

\- I heard the same about Slovenia...

&amp;#x200B;

1) My questions are simple -  Which countries are somewhat a safe bet for NOT taxing BTC sales even in 2022...? (As far as one can predict the future of course...)

2) And secondly, which countries (that currently dont tax BTC) are quite likely to start tax it in 2022  (Portugal...?)

o0dtlb,Crypt0Senpai,I've known Bitcoin since 2013 but I was skeptical to invest in it.," I mean, let's face it. Back in those days, bitcoin is not yet popular in Canada. The idea of investing online is taboo and prone to fraud and scams. So can you blame me for being skeptical?

Seven years later, When Conora started (I'd say Conora because I like how it sounds), I came back researching about bitcoin because my friend keep bugging me to invest in it and give it a try. My philosophy in life is that working 9-5 doesn't make you rich but at least you have something you can put on the table and I'm good with that. So I said, ""okay I guess I'll try and there's no harm in trying it at least once"". So did plenty of research and I was shocked to see how many people have become millionaires either publicly or secretly by investing in it! I became obsessed with bitcoin and then a realization hit me that I shoulda, woulda, coulda invest in Bitcoin when I had the chance. It's a shame really. If only I can turn back time to the good old days. :( I've set up my netcoins account recently and I'm just hodling now hoping for a big break one day.

 Well, it's better late than never, I guess. Are there others here who have a similar regret like me?",1623762092,30,0

Theses websites are not to be trusted with your money, if you or someone you know has an account with them. ** 

So I heard of a trend on TikTok; people use screenshot apps to look at random screen captures of various users and sometimes you know they find something worth of content. *(Like screenshot of old school web games they had forgotten, creepy pictures or some stuff like that)*



So, I went on [this website](https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html). Basically you can type almost anything at the end of the url to find a random screenshot that was saved by a random user of that app.

Very soon, I stumbled upon a [screenshot](https://prnt.sc/152gnwi) of some credentials for a bitcoin wallet. The [website](https://btc-ex.org/) seems legit at a first glance. The credentials work, and you find yourself inside the bitcoin wallet of someone named *James Greenberg* **(fake name, fake email account)**. The account has close to 1.0 BTC and some ETH (if I remember correctly, I've found this two days ago).





After an initial rush of excitement thinking I had found a small fortune just like that. (Huge red flag!) My brother helped me realise this was fake.

Here's the scam:
&gt;*Trying to withdraw from this account asks you to pay a small commision fee to some BTC wallet address to process the transfer. It says the commision will be paid back in full in the BTC transfer. Obviously it won't and you'll never receive anything in your crypto wallet*





After a little investigation, I've found that the website was flooded with these kinds of pictures in one [form](https://prnt.sc/152gnwf) or [another](https://prnt.sc/152gnwh). With my personal favorite being [this one](https://prnt.sc/152gnwb).

The nature of these scams help uncover the real nature of these website. **They are not to be trusted with your money, if you or someone you know has an account with them.**

Brock Pierce has been in the digital currency space since arround 2003-2004. He was running the biggest digital currency marketplace online, with 100 000 people working with him and generating over 100M yearly revenue.

He runs for president as an indepenent candidate. Really take a look at him.

I am very new to this, but I have issues connecting to my bitcoin node. It drives me crazy and I don't know what I am doing wrong.  


My node works and is reachable, I am running bitcoin core on win10. Recently I have downloaded Sparrow wallet and I want to connect to my node when I will do my TX. But it just does not work and I am helpless.  


My config file looks like this:

\#RPC general setting  
rpcuser=&lt;user&gt;  
rpcpassword=&lt;password&gt;  
rpcport=&lt;port&gt;  
server=1

\#RPC IP setting  
rpcbind=&lt;remote device ip&gt;  
rpcallowip=&lt;remote device ip&gt;  


When I try to fill in info, I type Username and password. Then there is BTC Core URL:port to fill and I have tried everything. IP4, IP6 with correct port. But I just cant find my node. What is wrong? Node is 100% reachable on bitnodes... nothing works.

Bitcoin Mining Company Bitfarms to Commence Trading on Nasdaq Next Week
The mining company Bitfarms has revealed the firm will commence trading on Nasdaq Global Select Market starting on June 21. The firm claims to process 1% of the global hashrate and with ‚Äú99% green hydroelectricity.‚Äù

Bitfarms Renewable Operations to List on Nasdaq Global Select Market
The Canadian bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms announced on Thursday that the company will be listed on Nasdaq on Monday, June 21. The company is already listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and leverages the ticker ‚ÄúBITF.‚Äù

For the Nasdaq listing, the company will utilize the same ticker symbol. According to the announcement, Bitfarms has obtained DTC eligibility which essentially means shares can be deposited through DTC, the largest securities depository in the world.

‚ÄúListing on Nasdaq is an important achievement for Bitfarms and is a significant milestone following multiple years of development and achievement by the company,‚Äù Bitfarms‚Äô founder and chief executive officer Emiliano Grodzki said during the announcement.

‚ÄúWe started this company four years ago with a clear belief in the institutional adoption of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining. This belief has guided us as we worked to build one of the largest Bitcoin mining operations worldwide,‚Äù Grodzki added.

Bitfarms‚Äô website says that it currently operates 69 megawatts of energy and dedicates around 1,420 petahash per second (PH/s) of SHA256 hashrate. The rate of Bitfarms‚Äô facilities located in Quebec turns out to be around 1.42 exahash per second (EH/s).

Bitfarms operates bitcoin mining plants in the Quebec regions of Farnham, Cowansville, Sherbrooke, Saint-Hyacinthe, and Magog. Bitfarms is not the only crypto mining company getting listed these days as Hut 8 Mining was also approved for Nasdaq listing earlier this week.

However, Grodzki details that Bitfarms will be the largest publicly traded miner, in terms of hashrate and operations nearly all powered by green energy.

‚ÄúWhen Bitfarms begins trading on the Nasdaq, it will be the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miner in North America using greater than 99% hydroelectric renewable electricity,‚Äù Grodzki remarked.

Statistics, at least according to both firm‚Äôs websites, shows Bitfarms has a bit more hashpower than Hut 8. While Hut 8 consumes 109 megawatts of energy, the firm‚Äôs mining operations in Medicine Hat and Drumheller, Alberta dedicate around 1,073 PH/s of SHA256 hashrate to secure the Bitcoin network.

o2olf9,Squeaky-Bed,I got SIM-Swap attacked again! despite having a PIN and a note in my account saying not to allow anyone to access or change my account unless I am physically present at the store with drivers license in hand! T-Mobile.,"It's been almost a year since my SIM card was hijacked for the first time.

Thankfully, We noticed it early (my wife and I), we acted quickly And dodged a bullet.

That   day, And after resetting all my passwords and adding 2FA's on every   account that allows it and removing my phone # from any service that   uses it, I called T-Mobile.  And I asked them to put a PIN on my account   AND leave a note in there to only allow changes if I am personally,   Physically present at the store and have my ID with me.

They obliged and things were somewhat quite until last month.

I   wake up one morning to an E-Mail saying someone is trying to reset the   password for my main E-Mail address. I look at my phone and I had   service and everything looks fine so I didn't think much of it.

I   figured, Maybe it's the same asshole from last time because they keep   trying every now and then and every time I login I see a couple of new   IP addresses attempting to reset the account.

A   couple of hours later, A T-Mobile Employee calls and says to let me   know that someone tried to access my account again, So naturally I   freaked out and explained to him what had happened before, So he puts me   on hold then a few minutes later, He back tracks in an attempt to calm   me down or whatever and lies to me saying not to worry, They did a   little more digging and it's not what they thought it was and that it   was an automated thing that they had put on my account since the   previous incident, and that they had to reset manually and they forgot.   And that nobody tried to access my account.

It   didn't make sense to me at all and I didn't know what to make of that,   But he kept reassuring me that everything is fine so I went along with   it.

Today,  I get a letter in  the mail saying that on that same day the employee  called me, someone  gained access to my account, Ported my line to a  different carrier, And  accessed my CPNI data (Customer Propriety Network  Information),  Including calls made and received on my phone #. And that  he changed  the PIN on my account.

So  now,  The hackers have even more personal info about me and it's  floating out  there thanks to T-Mobile. And I am only hearing about it  from T-Mobile  because they are required by law to tell me :|

According   to them, They already took care of it, But they ""Encourage me"" have to   call and update my PIN, Password, E-Mail security and financial and   other accounts. So clearly it's not as simple and harmless as they made   it sound on the phone :(

I  am  pissed off and worried this was allowed to happen again. And I am   certain that if I didn't overhaul my personal online security and create   new E-Mails and cunt proof my account's I would have been taken to the   cleaners since the attack happened overnight and I didn't know or   notice until I woke up. I am now getting a new phone number with a   different carrier for sure.

I am posting this here to warn people to not trust phone service providers **even when you have taken all the necessary steps to protect your account** because they are **incompetent** **AND** **negligent**. And will not have your back when shit hits the fan.

Don't   wait until it happens to you, Be proactive and protect yourself.  Google  SIM-Swap attack and take all the necessary steps to prevent it  from  happening to you.

This is a copy of the letter:

This allows the government to dedicate more resources towards increasing their power. As the US government continually imprisons Bitcoin entrepreneurs like Arthur Hayes and Ian Freeman, how can any Bitcoiner expropriate more to the government than what is legally required?

If you did this last year, you would have had aprox 0,8756 BTC this time around! Which are now worth : 28,739$

""They're finding out now that their bubble's done coming!""

""They're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!""

""Their mouths will hang open a minute or two,

Then the Bitcoiners in /r/Bitcoin will all cry Boo Hoo!""

""That's a noise,"" grinned the Troll, ""That I simply MUST hear!""

So he paused. And the Troll put his hand to his ear.

And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.

It started in low. Then it started to grow.

But the sound wasn't sad! Why, this sound sounded merry!

It couldn't be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!

He stared down at /r/Bitcoin! The Troll popped his eyes!

Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!

Every Bitcoiner down in /r/Bitcoin, the tall and the small,

Was ""shilling""! Without any profits at all!

He HADN'T stopped mainstream acceptance from coming! IT CAME!

Somehow or other, it came just the same!

And the Troll, with his troll-feet ice-cold in the snow,

Stood puzzling and puzzling: ""How could it be so?""

""It came with out Greenspan! It came without France!""

""It came without baidu, or Chinese finance!""

And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore.

Then the Troll thought of something he hadn't before!

""Maybe bitcoin,"" he thought, ""could be a wealth store.""

""Maybe bitcoin...perhaps, is worth a little bit more!""

And what happened then? Well...in /r/Bitcoin they say,

That the Troll's small brain Grew three sizes that day!

And the minute his brain didn't feel quite so tight,

He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light,

And he bought up some coins! And some months of Reddit gold!

Last month China's cabinet, the State Council, said it would crack down on cryptocurrency mining and trading as part of a campaign to control financial risks.

The day will come when a united crypto community will publicly and peacefully stand against government's trying to restrict/block it's citizens from transacting in peaceful cryptographic code on decentralised and open networks.

I'm a user of their product since the early days. They have always delivered a great product, building a bridge between fiat and crypto (especially Bitcoin).

Bitwala recently re-named themselves to Nuri and partnered with Solaris Bank to and Celsius to provide an interest account for Bitcoin and a standard bank account with a bridge to a Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet.

So far so good. A few days after renaming Bitwala to Nuri I received an email with tons of questions, here are some of them:

Don't trust banks.

I want to add an additional warning regarding their interest account (or any other interest account like Blockfi, Celcius and co.).

Terms of service of Bitwala (now NURI):

&gt;**Special risk factors for the Crypto Interest Account**  
&gt;  
&gt;Investing cryptocurrencies via the Crypto Interest Account is associated with significant risks. The risks described below can occur individually or cumulatively. For the customer (""investor"") there is the risk of total loss. The order in which the risks are presented does not provide any indication of the materiality of the risks, either in terms of their probability of occurrence or in terms of their impact on the investor and his claims.  
&gt;  
&gt;The further risk information on cryptocurrencies in ¬ß 8 of our General Terms and Conditions ([https://www.bitwala.com/de/terms-of-service/](https://www.bitwala.com/de/terms-of-service/)) must be observed.  
&gt;  
&gt;**1. No deposit insurance**  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no statutory or voluntary deposit insurance for the cryptocurrencies invested via the Crypto Interest Account. In the event of a default by Celsius Network Limited (Celsius Network), no payments will be made to the investors by third parties (e.g. a deposit protection fund (‚ÄúEinlagensicherungsfonds‚Äù). Bitwala GmbH (""Bitwala"" or ""we"") also does not provide compensation in the event of loss of the cryptocurrencies used and does not accept any other securities.  
&gt;  
&gt;**2. Bankruptcy of Celsius Network**  
&gt;  
&gt;The investors bear the full risk of the bankruptcy of Celsius Network. Celsius Network is the sole debtor of the investors' claims to the agreed income and repayment of the amount of cryptocurrencies used. Whether Celsius Network will be able to fulfil the due claims of the investors in the future depends solely on the success of its business activities. If Celsius Network becomes illiquid (e.g. in the event of bankruptcy), the investor will suffer a total loss of his investment as well as any income already earned but not yet disbursed.  
&gt;  
&gt;**3. No participation, co-determination or control rights**  
&gt;  
&gt;Investors have no rights of participation, co-determination or control with regard to the business activities and business strategy of Celsius Network. Investors cannot verify whether Celsius Network conducts business activities that will enable it to service the claims of investors from the Crypto Interest Account in the future. The business activities carried out by Celsius Network may result in further risks for investors. As investors do not know the business activities of Celsius Network in detail, they are not in a position to verify these potential risks. Celsius Network could make decisions that could have an impact on the investors. The investors have no possibility to influence the business activities of Celsius Network. This also applies to the use of the cryptocurrencies provided.  
&gt;  
&gt;**4. No state supervision**  
&gt;  
&gt;Celsius Network is registered as a Money Service Business (""MSB"") with the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a unit within the US Department of the Treasury that collects and analyses information on financial transactions in order to combat national and international money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes. Nevertheless, Celsius Network and its business activities are not subject to extensive government supervision. In particular, there is no guarantee that registration with FinCEN will meet German standards of comparable governmental supervision. There is therefore no state or other protection for investors against misuse of the cryptocurrencies provided.  
&gt;  
&gt;**5. Application of foreign law and prosecution abroad**  
&gt;  
&gt;The legal relationship between the investor and Celsius Network is governed by US law / the law of the United Kingdom. Investors may not be aware of the law and may therefore not be able to exercise their legal position under the respective laws vis-aÃÄ-vis Celsius Network or not exercise it properly. Claims of investors against Celsius Network must be asserted in foreign courts. For investors this may mean higher costs and difficulties in enforcing their claims.  
&gt;  
&gt;**6. Price and earnings volatility**  
&gt;  
&gt;The investor bears the risk of exchange rate volatilities with regard to the cryptocurrencies provided by him. The price of cryptocurrencies on corresponding trading platforms can be subject to high volatility. The investor has a claim against Celsius Network for repayment of the amount of cryptocurrencies provided by him plus the agreed income. This entails the risk that the cryptocurrencies provided by the investor may have a lower value at the time of repayment than at the time of transfer to Celsius Network.  
&gt;  
&gt;The interest rate for calculating the returns on the cryptocurrencies provided is subject to weekly changes by Celsius Network. Medium- or long-term planning with regard to the amount of income is therefore not possible. For the investor, there is the risk that the interest rate will decrease after the cryptocurrencies have been transferred to Celsius Network.  
&gt;  
&gt;**7. Tax risks**  
&gt;  
&gt;The current tax treatment of the income has not been conclusively clarified and may also depend on the individual tax treatment of the respective investor. It cannot be ruled out that the tax authorities and courts may adjust or change previous tax assessments on the treatment of income with cryptocurrencies. It is also not clear whether the previously applicable principles for the tax treatment of trading in crypto-currencies can be applied to income from the Crypto Interest Account.  
&gt;  
&gt;Note:Bitwala does not provide investment advice to the client. Bitwala does not verify whether the Crypto Interest Account is a suitable investment for investors in view of their personal investment objectives and financial circumstances. Bitwala also does not provide any corresponding recommendations. Bitwala also does not conduct a reasonable assessment as to whether the Crypto Interest Account is appropriate in view of the knowledge and experience of the investor.

Lightning could work to exchange currencies, for instance Litecoin and BTC. So, then what about Liquid?

Liquid is not quite as safe as on-chain but it is safe enough for reasonable amounts. So what if people could accept Liquid channels with a slight surcharge to account for the slightly larger risk. If that surcharge is less than than what can be made from fees then it could be a good deal. Also, the surcharge can be a constant which makes things a lot simpler.

This would make it feasible to rebalance the network cheaply and onboard lots of new clients.

o6x7oy,_kr_saurabh,After Years of ASIC Manufacturing Canaan Expands to Bitcoin Mining in Kazakhstan,"Canaan Inc., the crypto mining rig manufacturer based in Beijing, has announced the company plans to mine cryptocurrencies in Kazakhstan. The company says that the firm‚Äôs next-generation Avalonminer mining rigs are already deployed in the world‚Äôs largest landlocked country.

Canaan Joins the Bitcoin Mining Fray
The publicly-listed company Canaan (Nasdaq: CAN) has revealed the firm is entering the fray of bitcoin mining with its own self-operated mining business. Canaan is one of the oldest bitcoin mining hardware manufacturers in the world as it was founded by Nangeng Zhang in 2013.

In the company‚Äôs earliest years it created FPGA miners dedicated to Bitcoin‚Äôs SHA256 consensus algorithm. Fast forward to today and the company is one of the top application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) makers, up there with Bitmain, Microbt, and Ebang.

A recent wired.co.uk report highlights statements from Didar Bekbauov, founder of the Kazakhstan-based Xive, when he said last April that Chinese mining companies have been regularly seeking out plots in the country to set up shop.
On Wednesday, the Beijing-based company revealed it will be leveraging its Avalonminers to mine bitcoin in Kazakhstan. The move follows the firm opening up an ASIC mining rig service center in the transcontinental country.

The announcement on Wednesday explains that the move to start mining bitcoin after expanding the company‚Äôs manufacturing process is ‚Äúthe next logical step.‚Äù The entry into the field of mining will ‚Äúoptimize its revenues, as well as strengthen its inventory management and supply chain capabilities,‚Äù the company states.

‚ÄúWe believe that our self-operated bitcoin mining business will help us improve our financial performance as well as expand our business scope and customer base,‚Äù Canaan‚Äôs founder Zhang stated during the announcement. ‚ÄúAs we integrate more industry resources into our operations, we believe this business segment will enable us to revitalize our mining machine inventory, shield us from bitcoin volatility, and ensure our inventory sufficiency during market upturns.‚Äù

A few of Canaan‚Äôs manufacturing competitors have been in the mining space for years, specifically Bitmain. The China-based mining rig company Bitmain has been operating a pool called Antpool since 2013. Today, Bitmain‚Äôs Antpool is one of the largest pools dedicating hashrate to the BTC chain.

Canaan says it will also benefit from taking full advantage of the availability of its ‚Äúin-stock mining machines to be actively deployed in its mining operations at low electricity rates, thus maximising its computing power at that time.‚Äù

‚ÄúOn the flip side,‚Äù Canaan concluded, ‚Äúwhen market activity is elevated, the mining business will also benefit from putting the processing capacity of older machines in use. The net result will be a considerable improvement in inventory planning and supply chain optimization throughout the year and unaffected by the price of bitcoin.‚Äù Canaan added:

What do you think about Canaan‚Äôs entry into the field of bitcoin mining after manufacturing mining rigs since 2013? Let me know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.",1624525862,5,1

o6x5hf,_kr_saurabh,What do you think ?,"The decision by El Salvador was a big decision with far-reaching implications for its citizens. However, it is possible the decision could significantly impact individuals subject to the United States Internal Revenue Code. All US guidance issued to date have correctly pointed out that bitcoin is not the legal tender of any jurisdiction (see FIN-2013-G001 and Notice 2014-21). This statement will soon not be true!

The US government has used the legal tender distinction as a way to apply a different set of rules to ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù currency compared to ‚Äúreal‚Äù currency. It has been the government‚Äôs view to date that ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù currency, a term that currently encompasses cryptocurrency and bitcoin, is property and the taxation rules related to property apply. The question being pressed by El Salvador‚Äôs decision to adopt bitcoin as legal tender is does El Salvador‚Äôs decision have any impact on how bitcoin is treated by the IRS?",1624525563,4,2

&gt; ""Financial watchdog ""bans"" crypto exchange Binance from UK""
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	The UK‚Äôs financial watchdog has ordered Binance to stop all regulated activities in Britain and imposed stringent requirements in a stinging rebuke of one of the world‚Äôs biggest cryptocurrency exchanges.
&gt; 
&gt; The intervention by the Financial Conduct Authority in recent days is one of the most significant moves any global regulator has made against Binance, a sprawling digital asset firm with subsidiaries around the world. The exchange has until Wednesday evening to confirm it has complied with the watchdog‚Äôs demands, and removed its advertising.
&gt; 
&gt; The intervention is a sign of how regulators are cracking down on the cryptocurrency industry over concerns relating to its potential role in illicit activities such as money laundering and fraud, and over often weak consumer protection.
&gt; 
&gt; The FCA also this weekend issued a consumer warning against both the Cayman Islands-registered Binance holdings company and Binance Markets Limited, a London-based affiliate that is controlled by chief executive Changpeng Zhao and is overseen by the UK regulator.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúBinance Markets Limited is not permitted to undertake any regulated activity in the UK,‚Äù the FCA said, adding, ‚Äúno other entity in the Binance Group holds any form of UK authorisation, registration or licence to conduct regulated activity in the UK.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; The group did not immediately respond to a FT request for comment, but has previously said it ‚Äútakes its compliance obligations very seriously and is committed to following local regulator requirements wherever we operate‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Binance Markets Limited is not approved under the FCA‚Äôs cryptocurrency registration regime, which is required for UK groups offering digital asset services.
&gt; 
&gt; The entity had applied to become a registered cryptocurrency company with the regulator, but pulled that application last month according to two people familiar with the situation. The watchdog confirmed the application had been dropped ‚Äúfollowing intensive engagement from the FCA‚Äù.
&gt; 
&gt; The FCA‚Äôs focus in deciding whether or not to approve such applications is based on a review of controls and practices to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
&gt; 
&gt; Binance is one of the most important operators in the fast-emerging crypto market, offering a wide range of services to customers around the world, including trading in dozens of digital coins, futures, options, stock tokens, as well as savings accounts and lending. It recorded crypto trading volumes equivalent to $1.5tn last month, according to data from TheBlockCrypto.
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; As part of the FCA‚Äôs actions, the regulator ordered Binance to display by next Wednesday on its website that, ‚ÄúBINANCE MARKETS LIMITED IS NOT PERMITTED TO UNDERTAKE ANY REGULATED ACTIVITY IN THE UK.‚Äù Binance Markets Limited also must ‚Äúsecure and preserve all records and/or information‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ. relating to all UK consumers from its systems‚Äù and halt any advertising and financial promotions.
&gt; 
&gt; Binance Markets Limited was established a year ago as part of a plan by the broader group to launch a UK-focused exchange, Binance UK, which would have been ‚Äúring fenced‚Äù from the wider global operation, according to public documents and the two people familiar with the matter. Although the FCA has restricted Binance from offering services in the UK, British citizens can still access Binance‚Äôs services in other jurisdictions.
&gt; 
&gt; London-based Binance Markets Limited had permission from the FCA to provide consumers with investment services in traditional currencies, something Binance achieved by purchasing a financial company that was already registered with the regulator. The transaction was approved by the FCA last June, according to public documents.
&gt; 
&gt; The FCA‚Äôs decision comes after Japan‚Äôs Financial Services Agency warned last week that Binance was conducting unauthorised trade in cryptocurrencies with Japanese citizens. It is the second time the FSA has warned about Binance after publishing an identical notice in 2018.
&gt; 
&gt; Germany‚Äôs financial watchdog warned investors in April that Binance had probably violated securities rules over its launch of trading in stock tokens, something the exchange tried unsuccessfully to appeal against.

&amp;#x200B;

Isn't  on-chain data not the full universe of transactions? 

&amp;#x200B;

  for eg. Example 1: we have 10 users each holding one distinct BTC address. They all use Binance CEX (Centralized exchange)  to buy/sell BTC. once they deposit their BTC into Binance CEX and start buying /selling BTC, the trail does dark as these Transactions are not on-chain meaning we don't see their UTXO created prices and realised prices. 

 Example 2: Similar to Example 1 , but instead of depositing BTC, they deposit Fiat (USD) in Binance CEX to buy BTC. any buy/sell txns are on CEX so on chain data does not actually capture each user's realised Profit and Loss 

&amp;#x200B;

How do we then account for these user's (as per example) Unrealized Profit and Loss if we don't see their on-chain behavior since all the trading they do is on a CEX ??",1624785874,3,1

At this age, I'm not legally allowed to administrate a business or invest so I just try to grasp as much acknowledge as I can. Be it finishing 2 investing books a week or using my paper trading account to test out new strategies. I also recently started a finance blog site.

 $BTC is getting so much press nowadays and is popular than ever. This gets me tremendous FOMO every time as it's gonna take me 4 MORE YEARS to really get started with investing. I've begged my parents several times for a custodial account but I'm in 10th grade and it's a very crucial year as I've got exams on the way so I'm unable to get a custodial account.

 Right now, I just have 2 income sources. 8 months ago, I tried flipping a guitar for a profit (I produce music too, so I've got a good knowledge about music instruments)  and made 80% profit.

I created a snowball effect with this and reached from $200 (saved up pocket money) to $6K just off flipping.

I recently also started a [finance blog site](https://www.affordassets.com/blog/) and that pretty much sums up my ""income streams"".

oay3y0,maxbaguette,I'm seriously pondering making a move abroad to a btc legal tender nation. Who has has this on the cards?,"Ok, I've spent alot of time recently delving into what it would take to get to South America. 3 btc for permininent residency in El Salvador. Paraguay apparently with .2 btc and you can get permininent residency. Or be a Bitcoin entrepreneur in Salvador and get perm residency. Plus the costs of travel and hotels etc untill I'm settled

It dosnt come without the risk like been a gringo etc and potential crime against yourself however the positives are remarkably impressive.

I've been seeking work in crypto for a month now. Applied for a few jobs at NFT marketplaces for a verification and support role as I'm good with computers understand the space well. I can code html, CSS and some PHP but to really embrace Bitcoin/crypto I need that more extensive experience in coding. Solidity, python, JavaScript etc.  I've set a horizon of 2 to 5 years to make the move, till then, hodl, work my ass off whilst staking sats and make connections with others who are deadset interested. 

I would far prefer Paraguay over el Salvador,  chilli is the safest by far and uraguay has Europe vibes but alot more expensive to live. 

I honestly see the future is bright in this region as Bitcoin becomes more and more adopted by the continent which we are slowly seeing happen. 

It's like been a missionary I guess. I honestly love and believe in what the tech can do. I believe this aligns alot with my values and to help others if I can in these countries.

oaxmc9,VeronZ76,Will other countries adopt Bitcoin as legal tender after El Salvador‚Äôs move?,"
El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. In a time where Fiat currencies are devaluing because of inflation, this is a pretty smart move. It's no secret that cryptocurrencies are becoming extremely popular in third-world countries. If this keeps up, Bitcoin may be able to destroy Fiat in its entirety. 
 
Now, it's only a matter of time before other countries follow suit in adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. It's yet the time where a developed country hasn't adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. The United States, The United Kingdom, and other powerful countries still rely on Fiat. Imagine what will happen if they decide to abandon Fiat in favor of Bitcoin. It would decentralize the global economy. 
 
Do you think other countries will follow El Salvador's decision of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender? If not, why? Your input will be greatly appreciated.",1625060636,3,1

oaxk53,ty_rex,Thinking about going all in on $MSTR as a pseudo-Bitcoin ETF. Disprove my logic.,"Hi Everyone,

First of all, I am a crypto holder (just BTC &amp; ETH), and I don't have any more cash to buy the dip.

However, as an investor I have money in stocks as well obviously.  My investments in stocks are all in low cost, total market index funds (Boglehead strategy).  They're doing fine (\~15% return this year or something, idk), but fuck it.  I'm a young single dude, so I can afford to take some risks right now.  I want to YOLO it all on a high risk high, reward bet.  That said, I'm considering selling all of my stock investments, and putting it all on $MSTR for the second half of the year to ride the bull run back up past the $100K mark we think BTC will hit.  

The charts for $MSTR seem to track BTC very well, so I feel as though if BTC crushes like we think it will, then so will $MSTR and the other pseudo-Bitcoin ETF stocks like $MARA and $RIOT.

$MSTR opened at \~$650, so a ride to ATH's at $1,315 would be a 100% gain.  Can probably get it in the $500's or maybe even $400's if we dip again, which would be a 120%+ gain if it matched ATH's.  If we believe (which I strongly do) that BTC will crack $100K, $MSTR could crush to $2,000+.

Also considering $MARA, and $RIOT as other ""Bitcoin ETF's"", but I like $MSTR cause of Saylor.

Call me crazy.  Disprove my logic.  I want to hear the arguments against this.  Mods, sorry if this isn't the right sub for this.  

Thanks!",1625060430,72,1

I replied ""of course I did."", knowing that he (as an old fashioned-, retired-, stock guy who likes to argue) was starting an argument about it. He started ranting on how it is just one big scam and ""all those other bitcoins"" (meaning altcoins red.) are even more so. And they have no real value or use, now or in the future. So I asked why he was thinking that, giving the fact that his statement was so absolute. The poor man based his assumption on just one (!) article in the financial times, ""and other articles"" but he couldn't clarify which ones. He also stated that he never seen any blockchain is use in practice. So I started to explain what blockchain does and what the difference is between different coins or tokens. He simply replied: ""if you believe that, than you are a believer and just as well join a church"". With those kind of arguments, you can basically never lose one..

oauqz3,max_tinker10101,"Fools! Bitcoin is going to fail, you've been warned!","Don't be angry at me. I'm here to help you understand because most of you are stupid enough to fall for this scam. 

First of all, Bitcoin is not a store of value! A store of value has to.. surprise! actually, store value over the long term. Bitcoin's value fell by 50% between April 14 and June 22! Is that what you call a store of value? Wow! What a great new form of money! Imagine getting paid your salary and watching it lose 50% of its value over two months. What type of idiot is going to use this as money?  

It's really not that hard to understand, Just type ""store of value"" into Wikipedia if that helps. The first sentence reads: 

""A **store of value** is any commodity or asset that would normally retain purchasing power into the future and is the function of the asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be *predictably* useful when retrieved.""

Is there anything ***predictable*** about Bitcoin? *Fools!*

In order for something to function as money, it has to gain a large network effect of people willing to exchange their labor and time for it. This is never going to happen with Bitcoin because it SUCKS! it's unstable!

What's more, Bitcoin doesn't scale! it's like 6 tx per second max. World currency my ASS! It's like saying let's fit a million people on a tiny wooden boat, this boat is the future! How stupid can people be? Why would anyone want to pay 60$ in fees just to buy something? The fees only get worse as more people use the coin at which point it becomes a useless expensive piece of crap.

What's this I'm hearing? You, think Lightning is going to save Bitcoin? ok, let's do some monkey math. The population in the US alone is 328.2M. A Bitcoin block can contain a maximum of about 3,500 tx per block. So if we wanted to open a single channel for every person in the US it will take around:

***328,200,000 / 3,500 = 93,771.4285714 blocks.*** 

***Let's divide this by the number of blocks in a day (6\*24 = 144), so:*** 

***93,771.4285714 / 144 = 651.19047619 days = 1.784 years!!***

Yes, in order for everyone in the US alone to open a Lightning channel for themselves it would take 1.78 years! And that's only a single channel for every person. For Lightning, you also need to close and rebalance channels all the time. Basically, this is not even close to being realistic. 

Lightning also comes with so many complications and vulnerabilities (routing issues, channel management, liquidity, flood &amp; loot attack, etc.) that the only way it can work is if it becomes a mostly custodial system with a few big players who route and manage all the payments on everyone's behalf. What a stupid solution! This is not even Bitcoin anymore it's the *F\*\*\*ing banking system!* except it's worse because you need to quickly convert the volatile crap back into stable dollars to buy anything. What a load of BS!

I also hear a lot about Bitcoin being ""decentralized"" and outside ""government control"". What the heck are people smoking? You do understand governments can easily shutdown exchanges, shutdown big miners, make accepting Bitcoins in shops illegal. All of which could potentially wipe out the ""Bitcoin economy"" if you can even call it that. Sure, people can continue running some version of Bitcoin on their stupid home PC's but then it's just passing useless tokens around and pretending it's money like little kids who play with their power ranger toys.

Some people claim that Bitcoin is a store of value simply because it's scarce, like Gold! and would therefore appreciate in value over the long term.

So let's think about that... Bitcoin is valuable *because* it's a store of value and it's a store of value *because* it's going to be more valuable in the future as people realize it's a store of value *because* they can sell it to new people who understand that it's valuable *because* it increases in value *because* it goes up forever... WOW, that's some circular monkey logic indeed!!

Do you know what else is monkey logic? PONZI schemes! Yes, Bitcoin is a giant decentralized Ponzi where all the old investors are shilling and lying to newbies so they can dump on them and make easy m$$$y! 

Just like any good-old Ponzi, it all comes crashing down in the end. You have been warned!

Also, saying Bitcoin is anything like GOLD is just dumb wrong. Gold is a real physical element on the periodic table and has real uses in the economy including jewelry, electronics, and medicine. Bitcoin is just a computer game for passing tokens that wastes a lot of energy. Fools!!  

Now that I think about it, this is probably the worst scammy part about Bitcoin. Not only is it a cheap pump &amp; dump, but it also wastes massive amounts of energy and electronic hardware to run itself. If Bitcoin had any real-world utility maybe the energy use would be justified. But the reality is it's far from being the definition of money and is really just a system for transferring gambling tokens around. 

Bitcoin will eventually die (yay) as a result of all this wastefulness. The high energy usage is something that gets noticed outside of Bitcoin delusion land. Smart people in society are not going to tolerate a giant Ponzi that consumes the energy of an entire country. Regulations and heavy taxation of miners will start being introduced. China has already started banning miners. The public with the help from the media and Elon will become more aware of this energy-wasting scam which will drive more social pressure to not use Bitcoin so the environment can be saved. 

This is the beginning of the end for Bitcoin. As your financial adviser, I recommend you sell all of it now!

Also, watch out for communists, and don't forget to filter your water. cheers!",1625050059,41,1

IMO that is no longer the case. I remember when Bitcoin had a changetip bot and it was possible to send micro payments.

Is this even possible anymore or are we just accepting that Bitcoin is now only a store of value and no longer digital cash?

I hear everyone talking about HODLing and never spending. Why?

Apart from the ""brand"" and it having first mover advantage what makes Bitcoin so special?

nq52cb,AwfulWaffler,BTC is forever changed. Stop whining and take advantage of it.,"**TL;DR:** The BTC market has undergone a fundamental change and we are never going back to the world of a year ago. This was bound to happen. But the fundamentals of the technology haven't changed, and Whale Dominance of the market is NOT the same thing as centralization. So get used to it, and adapt to the new environment!

Okay, now the long version:

A lot of us got involved with Bitcoin for philosophical reasons. Most of us who have been around for more than a year, I'd say, got involved with BTC because of what it offers in terms of freedom from the state, freedom from centralization, privacy, opposition to fractional reserve banking and inflation, etc.

You can all these old-timers the ""Philosophical Bitcoiners.""

And you can count me in that group. I got into BTC because I got sick of the government and big corporate interests screwing me over every few years with recessions, bailouts, tax laws that benefit the wealthy over the working man, etc.

But I always knew the ""whales"" would come, that eventually our own success would draw the wealthy over to BTC and they would begin manipulating and dominating the markets. In [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/nnxssa/we_do_the_work_they_take_the_profits_some/) I explained how and why whales let us, the Philosophical Bitcoiners, take all the risk and do all the investing in building out this platform. Now that the whales have entered, we have to understand the shift in circumstances.

I see a lot of people whining about the current state of affairs, complaining that people don't invest in BTC for the right reasons any more, that folks are just buying BTC to try to get rich.

And yeah, thay annoys me as well. I WANT people to understand BTC, understand what makes it fundamentally different from any previous financial instrument in history. But the whales, specifically, don't care about ANY of that.

They fetishize BTC in the way they fetishize all commodities. That is to say:

When whales invest in Ford, they don't give a shit about the cars. They just want the stock to go up so they can make more money.

When whales invest in gold, they don't give a shit about the shiny rocks. They just want the price of gold to go up so they can make more money.

When whales by a company, they don't care about the workers or the customers. They just want the profits to go up so they can make more money.

This is a fundamental aspect of any market that allows people who have accumulated billions of dollars to enter -- because this is the only way to accumulate billions of dollars!

Look at the assets that are being disclosed belonging to Bill Gates. The man owns more farmland than anyone else in the USA. You think he knows anything about farming? You think he cares about farming? He owns a private jet company. You think he bought it because he's passionate about aviation? You think he runs his ""foundation"" because he actually gives a shit? No, they're all wealth accumulation vehicles which fetishize the commodities, activities, and philosophical underpinnings of whatever sectors Billy boy has entered.

Such it is with BTC. These financial institutions like Black Rock and Goldman Sachs and whatever other billionaires and corporations are getting involved don't give a shit about the philosophy and promise of BTC, they are entering the market because they want to make more money. This should come as a surprise to nobody, and everybody should see that things will never go back to the way they were, because the billionaires can throw their money around and manipulate the media to their own advantage, and there's nothing we can do to stop them.

That said, I'd like to push back against a few narratives I frequently see around here:

1. Whales manipulating and dominating the market is **NOT the same thing as centralization**. Centralization would mean that these entities can actually control the RULES of BTC. In order to do that they'd need to control 51% of the nodes and 51% of the hash rate, and the chances of that happening are extraordinarily slim, even for billionaires, because of the brilliance of BTC's design.
2. BTC is not ""dead"" because of manipulation by whales. In fact, right this very moment is probably one of the last times in history you'll be able to enter BTC with a good chance of benefitting the most as a smaller investor. You can ""ride the whales"" up, knowing that they're going to want a return on their investment.
3. The whales aren't trying to ""kill"" BTC because they're ""afraid"" of it. They see it as an opportunity to make more money, and they WILL make more money with BTC. The smart banks will get in and turn it to their advantage and sucker people into ""buying"" BTC with their proprietary virtual wallets, BTC-""backed"" derivatives and financial systems will start to crop up, and all kinds of shell games will be played to con normal average people who don't understand the philosophy of BTC into thinking they own BTC when they don't. This will drive the price of BTC up without really benefitting the ""suckers."" We're already seeing the embryonic form of this kind of shit with things like ""Binance Chain"" and Robinhood's BTC ""investment,"" etc.

The fact is, if you understand BTC, you will be able to take advantage of all the same benefits we always have. You will be able to really and truly own it, as long as you alone have the keys. The government can't seize it from you if you can keep your keys secret. It will always be anti-inflationary. It will always be decentralized. Nothing about the fundamentals has changed.

The only thing that has changed is that the price can be manipulated by whales (who will generally prefer to see the price go up over the long term) and a lot more people will be using it who don't understand it (which is just the nature of literally any currency or asset... most people who use fiat money don't understand fiat money, but that doesn't stop them from using it).

So, does it kinda suck that whales have entered BTC? Does this fundamentally change the BTC environment? Yes. But this is the cost of growth within the capitalist system. As long as individuals and corporations are able to accumulate billions of dollars this is always going to be the case. But BTC can't be fundamentally corrupted and sabotaged from within like the stock market and fiat money, which is a distinction we should all be aiming to leverage.

As always, don't invest more than you can afford to lose, and best of luck.",1622582742,60,1

üî∫Introduction

Velorex (VEX) is a decentralized finance token built on the BEP-20 platform. At Velorex we aim to facilitate global adoption of our cryptocurrency by introducing Debit cards and Smart Wallets that dynamically interact with a variety of Web3.0 and related programs within our block-chain from 2022 onward.

Currently, our primary focus is geared towards the implementation of the VEX token into a real world application in the form of essential innovative decentralized services. This will be realized by the 'VEXchange' which is being developed concurrently and will enable our users to experience low cost, high speed purchasing of products &amp; procurement of services through the global online marketplace while providing a decentralized payment gateway, transfer protocol and asset storage capability for VEX token.

üî∏ Some basic info:

üî∏Name: VELOREX

üî∏Symbol: VEX

üî∏Decimals: 9

üî∏Max supply: 500.000.000

üî∏Market Cap: 7M+$

üî∏Target price for upcoming months : 0.5$/VEX

üî∏Target price for EOY: 1.00$

üî∏5$ IS EASILY ACHIVABLE ESPECIALLY WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN COMING UP, AND SO MUCH USE CASES FOR VELOREX.

On top of that, by allowing the project to mature and grow in value during the locking period, we will ensure significant progress can be made on the utility of the project as well. We are still hard at work on the development of the Velorex debit cards and ATMs, rest assured.

Our Technology Makes It Work

Lixin replied that they were waiting for inventory and would get back to me. 

Today, I received this email:


&gt;Hey Jonathan,
&gt;
&gt;Hope this email finds you well.
&gt;
&gt;You may have noticed that I am using a new email to contact you.
&gt;We have just relaunched Cobo Vault as a new brand Keystone.
&gt;
&gt;And here is the reason behind the relaunch - https://twitter.com/BitcoinLixin/status/1399701832167923713
&gt;
&gt;Would you fill this form so that I can send you a sample device? https://forms.gle/eKrYjLNa8MZ551BB7
&gt;
&gt;Please let me know what else I can do on my side. Really looking forward to our collaboration!


* Twitter following: 465
* New website: literally exact copy of the Cobo website, minus the ""Custody"" options: https://keyst.one/
* Same photos, but different logo on the website
* *No mention on Cobo's website of changed branding, etc.* 

So, either...

* Lixin legitimately is splitting off from Cobo, with the rights to the hardware wallet, is selling a legit device, and just needs influencers to help get the word out because this transition is brand new (best case scenario)
* He got a hold of their supply chain and is selling grey-market knockoffs of the device (second best case scenario)
* Someone is trying to get the address information / phone number / etc of people who are likely to hold lots of Bitcoin (second worst case scenario)
* They will actually send a ""knock off"" device that LOOKS like a Cobo Vault, but is an elaborate ploy to steal private keys. 


Back when I emailed, actually found that Cobo had some devices in their FBA warehouse, and ordered one... but cancelled a few hours later because I didn't feel like I could trust the integrity of a company run entirely in the CCP, after the scandal around Huawei and CCP pressure to monitor through their hardware. So you better believe I'm not going to put large sums into a ""keystone"" wallet I've never heard of.

With that said, I'm a bit curious to see if this checks out. On Medium, he wrote a blog post explaining why he's leaving (company back-burnered hardware projects to focus on other things), and on Twitter, he alleges that he has purchased the rights to the Cobo Vault: https://twitter.com/BitcoinLixin/status/1399701832167923713. 

I'm tempted to give them the address of my shared workspace and just see if something shows up...!

TLDR:

What's  the point of being able to transfer crypto in a matter of minutes  across the globe if you still need fiat to pay for majority of services,  therefor you need an exchange which means you most likely need a local  bank account / credit card. So essentially banks and fiat currencies are  largely in control, until we can pay in crypto for groceries, or have a  crypto debit card that doesn't require a bank?

Or am I doing it wrong? What's you optimal strategy to get away from fiat as a digital nomad?

Long story:

I'm a senior software engineer with 3 passports, leaving for extended periods of time in different places.

I'm holding crypto from 2016 as an investment. This process started because  I was considering to re-balance at some point into other investments  that require cash.

I have Coinbase  account that I've created back in Europe years ago that can only send  fiat to a confirmed bank account in the EU. (This comes with 25% cap  gain tax.)

Since I have a bank  account and 0 capital gain tax in the country of my current residence, I  tried another exchanges. Non can transfer in local currency, some of  them can't even transfer to the country's banks. And in general I  constantly faced some issues and limitations.

Then  there is Kraken, that wasn't even able to validate postcode during  registration, so it has being already a week of back and forth with  their support to just complete the KYC. (BTW, Good luck with KYC  requirements to all nomads with your bills having the name of the  landlord)

I'll obviously manage, I already have 1 phone screen worth of crypto apps, so eventually will find the optimal one.

It  wasn't such and issue in US and EU. But isn't the major role of crypto  to help developing countries' citizens? Should I tell local grandma  whose fiat currency devaluated 20% last year to go get a binance  account?

I guess my question is,  with all these projects advertising how you can transfer crypto in a  matter of minutes across the globe... banks are doomed... crypto =  freedom.... what's the point if in majority of cases you need to convert  your crypto into some fiat to actually spend it? What's you optimal  strategy to get away from fiat at this stage?

Or  it just means that until payments in crypto are as easy and accessible  as payments with cash or visa we are stuck with our shitty banks?",1622712306,23,1

Clients have begun to ask to pay in the form and we have realized we need to evolve with the nature of our clients,"" says Dara Kaplan, President and Co-Founder of Wunderlich Kaplan Communications.

&amp;#x200B;

If an inflation based currency encourages people to spend, then consumption is incentivized.

&amp;#x200B;

If the market incentivizes supply to meet demand, and our economic model encourages people to consume more, and since people want their wealth to grow, then it also encourages constant growth in industry as people invest expecting to beat inflation.

&amp;#x200B;

If constant \[indefinite\] growth implies unsustainable growth, then inflation based currency is bad for the environment.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, a fixed supply currency which encourages people to save rather than spend is good for the environment.",1622708156,7,1

nr6ttq,xcryptogurux,The Federal Reserve has discontinued the weekly release of money supply data and you should be very worried,"In 2006, the Fed decided to abort publishing the M3 stock, dismissing it as ""irrelevant and not being part of monetary policies for a long time""

But the truth was, M3 was increasing at a much more alarming rate (nearly 2x) than M2 following the dot-com bailouts in the early 2000s. Just as the Fed and pro-administration pundits habitually make sure to focus on whatever consumer price measure increases the least to play down inflation, the Fed wanted to divert public attention towards a money supply measure which was increasing at a relatively lesser rate at the time - the M2 stock.

We all know what happened 2 years later. 

Now fast forward 15 years, this is what M1 and M2 look like

&amp;#x200B;

[M1 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/uu489cywuz271.png?width=1167&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=228f277cf10f073b536140e25ce9ffa87edef693)

&amp;#x200B;

[M2 Money Stock](https://preview.redd.it/5ambkp70vz271.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=684238dad9f8178843e5bebb2239b572bef6dd63)

As you can see, M1 stock, which is all the loose money in active circulation plus your checking bank deposits, is melting faces and going to the moon!

**M1 has risen from $4 trillion to $18 trillion from March 2020 to February 2021.**

M2, which is M1 plus savings deposits and funds, is up as well but not as much. This is a clear indication that people have been forced to abort saving/investing.

Both these metrics are a bad look for the economy. So for the time being, the Fed has stopped the weekly release of this information while they figure out how to spin this in their favor just like they did in 2006. Again, we know what happened 2 years later.",1622702311,308,1

nshqwb,MrAcademics,What am I buying ?,"Hey guys, new to crypto here. Wanted to ask a question I haven‚Äôt found a clear reply to this far and please just treat it as me trying to learn more. 

Happy to be corrected in any context :) 

My question is ‚ÄòWhere is the ‚Äòvalue‚Äô coming from?‚Äô 

I‚Äôve always asked this and the answers have ranged from ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt get it‚Äô to ‚Äòwhere‚Äôs the value in fiat‚Äô to promises of a utopian future etc but in all honesty the main value in any given coin appears to be via speculation at present. Would I be correct in assuming that we are just buying X$ equivalent of a coin and hoping it becomes a utility in the future that people rely on and thus having amassed a (hopefully large) amount of it. That this makes us a holder in a valued commodity ? 

Is this the correct way to view it?",1622847203,35,1

A non profit or can be started where they pay people in satoshis for their recycled materials. The average cost is $0.017/half oz aluminum cans. That‚Äôs almost 50 sats right now. Instead of dollars going back in to the system start putting sats in. You can also pay the employees in bitcoin. 

Bitcoin whales and miners would be incentivized to donate to this for tax breaks and to keep the sats flowing so the price keeps going up. 

A lot of homeless people do this. Just think if you paid them in satoshis. A lot of homeless people have cell phones. This would also help them not use it for drugs. They‚Äôll be more incentivized to save, and if they do save it they can actually afford to lift themselves back up on their feet.

nshg13,shitoshi-nokamoto,I will help you onto lightning by giving away bitcoin. Seriously.,"Lightning Network get a lot of fud even here in this sub. I suspect a lot of you guys haven‚Äôt yet actually tried it. It really is a lot easier than i think most people expect, and here is me trying to prove it. 
I suspect that the big hurdle right now is that you have to move your coins onto the lightning Network, so the idea behind this post is actually giving away MY satoshis so you do not have to do this to experience lightning. Hopefully some other experienced lightning-users will join me if this ends up a costly adventure. (Please lets keep this thread  focused on giving people the first experience with lightning)

HERE‚ÄôS the plan:
-Go download Wallet of satoshi. This is a really really easy lightning Wallet. It IS custodial, but ignore that for now

-post your adress/qr here, it would be cool if you added your country, but no pressure. I will send you some sats as soon as I can. I will answer you when i do,  with the amount and the cost of the transaction. IF someone else wants to join me, just send sats, and answer the post in the same way.

-when you recieve the sats, congratz! You have bitcoin in the lightning Network. Find a friend, pay it forward.

-Should you choose to explore this further, go download breez Wallet. You now have a non-custodial Wallet, and you can create an invoice (recieve via invoice) for yourself and pay from Wallet of satoshi and my sats. No risk, its someone elses money. You have now made your first transaction and is probably starting to Get it.

-With the sats well placed in breez, go to the apps-section from the top left corner. Pick the lightning roulette app,  fund with 20(!) sats (press ¬´open in Wallet¬ª), and gamble HALF of your deposit. Then go to the menu and press ¬´withdraw using webln¬ª, and watch your remaining sats return to your breez balance. How cool is that?

-now: IF you want to experiment with moving YOUR coin onto breez, you have to make an on-chain transaction(recieve via btc adress) but breez assumes that you want any bitcoin on the lightning Network, and any recieved coin wil be on lightning. There are fees. 

-go read about lightning Network!

-Lets keep this going: when you are done, if you can, return as many satoshis back to me as you can, that way i can give them to more people, and we give them the same experience. 

my adress is: lnbc1pst42zdpp58f6spuwjsyrw8jzzdfh3hpex374y0ef5ml7k4s4uvg93yv89g0dsdqu2askcmr9wssx7e3q2dshgmmndp5scqzpgxqyz5vqsp5smweq3kektryvkrv5ml56duxghrkcep5klazeyy0p5u40z0pev8q9qyyssquky5m9a8x0e5p7mq9af56za5vjrsywc3djpwfsxrcxyealmsz7ljf0uc8nyd3j3x6aud34u0n8jzxpegxvxvlljy2emw5rvp27a2v8gp5t6q26

https://www.coindesk.com/biden-administration-crypto-regulation-hints

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/28/government-and-industry-push-bitcoin-regulation-to-fight-ransomware.html

Whether or not it will succeed is still up in the air, but IMO its likely.

So my question is if govt does regulate bitcoin, in that scenario bitcoin would be like all digital cash and would be recorded, just like any credit card transaction, you would be able to walk into any gas station, store or website and use Bitcoin instead of the dollar.

But the big question is, dosent that defeat the whole purpose of bitcoin, a currency that is ""free from government, company or bank regulation"" ?

Just a question i have been wondering about recently, 

Moreover, with the nation wide coin shortage, is the govt just trying to phase out cash transactions? I mean, before bitcoin, cash king because you could use it without the govt's prying eyes.

Any info / thoughts on the matter would be interesting.",1622960757,8,1

So, how did the FBI recover this Bitcoin?

To the best of my knowledge this is happening right now with Bitcoin:

Some Wall Street type players have joined in recently. And they are not completely aware how crypto works, but have decades of market-manipulation experience.

After Elon Musk‚Äôs tweet, they got short position because technically it is bearish.

What surprised them is crypto loyalty (especially bitcoin) and more and more holders buying these dips as they can afford. On chain structure shows constant and consistent moving of bitcoin off of exchanges to holder‚Äôs wallets.

Institutions are now at risk of their short positions getting rekt.

So they are protecting it with market manipulation. Now the question is, who is stronger. Holders or huge money. If it was forex or stocks, huge money would win immediately. This is crypto. 

However, this is why I warned of increased wick (brief move) down risk. Because if institutions will make a move, they will make it through market sell. Since there is so much bullishness in BTC, they will lose and the price will go quickly up. 

If they realize they are beaten, the move up will begin soon, and directly, with no slowing down. I don‚Äôt have too high opinion of those guys and I would be surprised they know they are beaten.",1623115010,31,1

So, to me, (based on the amount recovered, and ambiguous wording, covered by a definitive media title) it seems they're taking out domestic ransomware developers and totally failing when it comes to the money stolen from the pipe boiz. Anybody with a big brain please post an opinion.

Its strict as hell here. Cant even mention any other cryptos which i think is insane.

  
That being said, during my temp ban, i head off into other subreddits and the hate that bitcoin get is INCREDIBLE.

There's one, in particular that carries the name bitcoin but is traditionally called by its shortened version of BTC and the shit that goes on over there is mind Blowing.

  
They pretty much hate on bitcoin every chance they get.

And i mean EVERY chance they get.  


Sometimes it really feels like jealousy.

Even in the ""Ranked Number 2"" forum, you get hate....all the way down to REAL sh1tcoins.

Its almost like an obsession.

I guess im asking, what is up with all of the hate?  
They can buy Bitcoin just like i can...so whats the deal? 

They cant get a whole one?

Who cares?  


Do they think Bitcoin is somehow going to disappear because they whine about it on their subreddit?

After we log off...every conspiracy theory, insult, and memes that are negative against bitcoin wont change the fact that Bitcoin is still where it is today.

Its still the best performing asset of the last decade :

Bitcoin Performance in its first decade (this includes traditional stocks) :

It is still ranked worldwide among nations :

Just how big is Bitcoin? (Scroll down the list until you see Bitcoin--and remember, these are NATIONS)

And these are the big companies that have bought bitcoin :

Big Dog Investors:

[https://bitcointreasuries.org/](https://bitcointreasuries.org/)

And yet you STILL have people that will talk shit about bitcoin knowing FULL well, that if the roles were reversed, theyd be saying the same thing.

Again, i dont know weather its jealousy, or they missed out early on but the hate is almost comedic at times....  


While im not a bitcoin maxi, im a bitcoin major because i DO hold a few other cryptos that i believe in, but at the end of the day, having BTC since 2017, im not going anywhere...so when they call ME delusional, i cant help but laugh sometimes.",1623111749,59,1

Did they seize BTC whenever the known wallets tried to move it from their wallet to another and basically highjack the transaction before it could be written into the blockchain?

The rest of the world must watch as El Salvador becomes free of the USD and all it's economic hitmen; the enrons and halliburtons.  Suddenly this little ""hole"" whose poverty the west props itself up on via usury and the USD, becomes first world in quick work.  Easy to pay back your usura loans when converting some of your btc back to USD at 300k/coin.  Other countries will be forced to take note.  ""They can't just -- just convert their currency to ours and pay us back with it!""  De-colonizing the 20th century financial imperialism.  

This is that *adoption* thing we have all been cheering for.

OPEC did the same thing to us when they realized oil &gt; USD.  We were up in the middle east's ass selling them bad loans for pork-barrel projects and then suddenly they grouped up and got us by the balls.  Now, Saudi says jump, we say ""how high?""  They say ""create a civil war in Syria so EU will be stuck on our oil and not Russia's gas,"" we call it ""ISIS.""  Wonder what kind of favors the US and the EU noose it swings from will be doing for early bitcoin adoption nations like El Salvador in 10 years.

A good but dated summary of the West's third world usury practices can be found in the book titled ""Confessions of an Economic Hitman.""",1623239381,3,1

Looking for a proper way to accept crypto from clients. Some of them willing to pay using Bitcoin, some of them ETH, USDT etc. I know that there are hardware wallets like ledger that can have apps installed for these coins, but after reading some reviews when people lost their funds I'm seeking for a better way. Maybe I will just create a Linux (Tails) cold wallet for Bitcoin and then just create a watch wallet on my windows PC.

The problem is that Electrum on Tails only supports Bitcoin. So is it OK to accept funds into Binance and then just convert them to Bitcoin, and move to my cold wallet? Or I need to install for each coin a separate wallet? This sounds like an overkill. The Ledger on the other side supports multiple wallets.

nvsevc,economicsdesign,What is the missing piece of all token economies these days? Building resilient designs," 

We need to build resilient economies because we are designing systems to be run by a decentralised community. The economy needs to be resilient because there is no ""off switch"" to press like there is in a centralised governing community.

The more resilient an economy is, the safer that economy is.

# People, Systems, Civilisation

Systems that we design are propagated by simplifying all the complexity down into some basic rules.

A question that needs to be answered is: ‚Äúresilience to what and for whom?‚Äù Making something resilient is going to impact something else as there are always trade-offs in systems.

People are adaptable to situations such as disasters. What we are doing is to build adaptive systems that capture people‚Äôs adaptability. It is tougher to build resilient systems purely from the engineering perspective because they might not be able to account for the changing environment. We call these incomplete contracts economic.

However, we can add aspects of resilience or adaptability into the design of a system or economics. For example, pairing machines to aggregate data with humans, who can make better decisions based on the mountain of data. The biggest benefit is to create these adaptable systems to take advantage of the strength of both machines and people.

Machines can make some decisions or aggregate decisions to turn qualitative or quantitative stuff into a more digestible format. Humans are great at adapting the information produced. Machines and humans can work together to leverage the best of both strengths.",1623234046,0,1

I understand what blockchains are and bitcoin as well but how do i actually get into bitcoin? As these are permanent ledgers, i want to fully understand the implications of utilizing Bitcoin before i actually step into the ring.

If there is a good resource for me to check out let me know! [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org) gave me a decent overview but I have deeper questions.

It seems as if the crypto is attributed to a wallet, which is attributed to an ""address"". Can anyone expound on this?? Id like to keep myself as anonymous as possible and maintain my privacy. That being said, how do i secure my wallet? Can i have access to the same bitcoin/crypto and have both a desktop and mobile wallet, and then an air-gaped copy of my wallet?

&amp;#x200B;

Which wallets do you guys like, and obviously i wont be able to buy an entire bitcoin so ill have to buy pieces, what sort of nuance does this add to the situation?

These are just some of my initial thoughts and questions, thanks for any resources and advice in advance!

Edit: 

What's something you guys wish you would have done when first getting into Bitcoin (besides buying earlier lol)?

As such, I am hoping to better understand some details I've researched but failed to retain. Please excuse my ignorance as there might be some gaps in my knowledge.

\- Where does the widespread acceptance and adoption of the lightening network fall into BTC's hierarchy of necessities? Will off chain transactions be required for scalability? Why hasn't this network become the norm? Is there a downside to implementing it?

\- Will BTC always stick with POW? I understand there is somewhat of a fallacy surrounding BTC's massive energy consumption, but as an environmentalist myself, is changing to less energy dependent system going to detract from what BTC has to offer?  Would changing to POS or a different validation system hurt BTC's efficiency, value, or adaptability?   


Side note: As far as those who resist a change away from POW as changing to a different system would be straying to far from the tech's original form -  I'd prefer not to get into a conversation of BTC dogma. This is more a question of logistics rather than ideology.",1623621250,10,1

What would be the economic effects of a fixed, deflationary currency. Could this create a new form of mercantilism in the modern age? 

For those who don't know what mercantilism was, it was an eighteenth century economic theory centered around the scarcity of wealth (particularly gold). The idea was that because there was only a fixed amount of gold in the world, global trade was a zero sum game. In order to win this game, a nation had to export more than it imported, thus hoarding more gold and having more wealth than other nations. 

So, if Bitcoin is the world's store of wealth and there's only a fixed amount, could you see this causing a revival of mercantilist economic theory? Perhaps states and institutions might start to hoard as much bitcoin as possible and it could lead to extreme economic protectionism, tariffs, and limit free trade? 

I'm honestly just thinking aloud here and don't have a fully formed opinion on the matter so I'd love to hear some more perspectives! Thanks!",1623620643,46,22

and active from block 709632, it is a good idea to upgrade [the full node to 0.21.1](https://bitcoin.org/en/releases/0.21.1/) since it is the first version fully supporting taproot.

The final activation will not happen until November but it's now time to be prepared. If you don't upgrade, the old nodes will consider the taproot transactions as ""anyone-can-spend"" so they will continue to work but without validating their correctness.  

It is also a good idea to upgrade wallets to versions that support new taproot bech32m address format.

I am a seller of apartments in Bulgaria. I would like to sell apartments with cryptocurrency such as BTC and/or ETH. Here are my two basic questions:

If I receive a payment of 1 BTC for example. The commercial tax in my country is 15%. Does this mean that I should pay 15% of this 1 BTC if I sell it, even though the price has not changed? 

For example, if I sell 1 one-bedroom apartment for the price of 1 BTC with a price of 50,000. When I sell the BTC should I pay 15% of 50,000? Or if for example the price increases to 60,000 and I sell, then I only pay 15% on the 10,000 increase. 

I understand that this question can be rudimentary but would really appreciate any help regarding these question or any other helpful advice for selling products with crypto.

The [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-whoissn-13) The currency began use in 2009[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-NY2011-14) when its implementation was released as [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-Antonopoulos2014-9):ch. 1

Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Mining). They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services,[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-15) but the real-world value of the coins is extremely volatile.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-:1-16) Research produced by the [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge) estimated that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a [cryptocurrency wallet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_wallet), most of them using bitcoin.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-CU2017-17) Users choose to participate in the digital currency for a number of reasons: ideologies such as commitment to anarchism, decentralization and libertarianism, convenience, using the currency as an investment and pseudonymity of transactions. Increased use has led to a desire among governments for regulation in order to tax, facilitate legal use in trade and for other reasons (such as investigations for [money laundering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering) and [price manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation)).

Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, the large amount of electricity (and thus [carbon footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint)) used by mining, [price volatility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)), and thefts from exchanges. Some economists and commentators have characterized it as a [speculative bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_bubble) at various times. Bitcoin has also been used as an investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-:1-16)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-CFTC_bitcoin-18)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-19)

The word *bitcoin* was defined in a [white paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper) published on 31 October 2008.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-paper-6)[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-ageofcr-20) It is a [compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(linguistics)) of the words [*bit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) and [*coin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin).[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-btox-21) No uniform convention for *bitcoin* capitalization exists; some sources use *Bitcoin*, capitalized, to refer to the technology and [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) and *bitcoin*, lowercase, for the unit of account.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-capitalization-22) [*The Wall Street Journal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal),[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-23) [*The Chronicle of Higher Education*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicle_of_Higher_Education),[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-24) and the [*Oxford English Dictionary*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-btox-21) advocate the use of lowercase *bitcoin* in all cases.",1623743498,3,11

There's few days left to close above $43k as the BTC daily death cross looms. There's suddenly a spur of positive news all over the place, Twitter, news outlets, even Australian news (which is almost unheard of). Just a couple of weeks ago, there were FUD articles like there's no tomorrow. Now everything is about adoption and 'bullish' sentiments. I don't buy it.

Do you think the media, which is basically owned by whales, is doing you guys a favor by telling you the bull season continues? It almost seems like they're gee'ing you on to FOMO in.

Also, would there be any downsides, beyond the memory problem, of actually implementing such a change?

I'm aware of the possibility to take care of those things on a second layer, but maybe when hyperbitcoinization at some point occurs, it \*could\* make sense to be able to settle smaller amounts than 1 satoshi on the main chain, right?

This Ponzi needs to be shut down by the government immediately for environmental concerns.  If you own any Bitcoin, you are destroying the planet rapidly.

U.S. President Joe Biden‚Äôs tech advisor, Tim Wu, is a millionaire in bitcoin, Politico wrote in article this week, quoting his personal financial disclosure. The declaration has been provided to the publication by the Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Columbia University, which requested the document from the White House.
According to the disclosure Wu owns between $1 million and $5 million in bitcoin (BTC) as well as between $100,001 and $250,000 in filecoin (FIL), the cryptocurrency of a platform that offers decentralized crypto storage services. The official information also reveals that Wu‚Äôs bitcoin investment is the largest holding in his financial portfolio.

According to inside sources quoted by the publication, authorities have dropped earlier plans for a blanket Bitcoin ban in favor of classifying cryptocurrencies as an alternative asset class.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India will reportedly be tasked with overseeing crypto regulations in the country in collaboration with the finance ministry.

These inside sources also claim that Parliament will debate a comprehensive crypto regulatory bill during the Monsoon Session beginning in July.

nwwm1n,cryptotraderscomm,Why it still isn‚Äôt too late to invest in Crypto?,"People felt it's too late to invest in bitcoin when it touched $100.

They felt the same way when it touched $ 1000

And they still feel the same way today. So here I have listed out three reasons you can reassure yourselves that you aren't late for the ride. Yet.

I believe the majority of cryptocurrencies currently listed won‚Äôt be around in 10 years. If you look at a historical snapshot of the market from even 5 years ago, you‚Äôll notice a lot of coins on the top 100 list that don‚Äôt exist anymore. While I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too late to get in, it‚Äôs inportant to be careful with what exactly you get in with.

I wrote a pretty lengthy article about my crypto strategy, and why it‚Äôs not too late a few days ago. Even in the short time since then there have been new developments that make me believe we‚Äôre still early in this market.

**Institutional Investors are coming**

Institutional money follows Individual interest. I believe that in 2018‚Äì2020 we‚Äôll see a huge wave of institutional investment in cryptocurrency. Institutional investors are hedge funds, family offices, and other sophisticated investors.

These investors bring lots of capital, and the potential to significantly increase the total market cap for cryptocurrencies as a whole. Theyve been hesitant to enter the space, mainly due to a fragmented trading landscape and lack of liquidity (beyond the ideological reasons some stay out). Yet, there‚Äôs been an increase in tools and resources for sophisticated investors to use. Companies are creating liquidity providing options, and developing trading terminals more similar to what you find on Wall Street than a typical traders exchange.

**Blockchain adoption is increasing**

The type of business showcasing their technologies have also changed drastically. Companies like Microsoft, IBM, and Deloitte all have booths some form of Blockchain ideas on their drawing boards, and some have already deployed them for use.

**Bitcoin dominance is down**

One of the most important elements in constructing my trading portfolio is the bitcoin dominance percentage. This number represents the % of the total crypto market cap that Bitcoin represents.

When dominance is up, I move more of my investments into Bitcoin, and the opposite when it goes down.

BTC dominance has been slowly declining as more and more altcoins enter the market. Ethereum opened the floodgates by making it so easy to generate ERC20 tokens, and now practically anyone can put a token out.

This means more cryptocurrencies will come in to compete than ever before. I strongly believe that competition is good for any market, and the same way I think many coins won‚Äôt be around in 5‚Äì10 years, I also think there will be plenty coins on the top 100 in that time that we‚Äôve never heard of before.

Basically, tldr:

Institutional money is getting in now, they wouldn‚Äôt enter a market about to burst.

Companies like Microsoft wouldn‚Äôt be investing their time and resources into something they thought would disappear.

Competition amongst crypto companies will spur innovation and new coins will shoot up the ranks.

The crypto revolution is still in it's infancy!",1623354438,12,3

ny1dwe,lina0425,The Bitcoinization of El Salvador,"A few days ago, El Salvador declared bitcoin as its legal tender.

The decision was controversial.

Most of the crypto community has expressed support for the new law, but traditional media and financial institutions have not.

Banking giant JPMorgan Chase commented on the ""Bitcoinization of El Salvador"" in a recently published study.

The banking institution compared the ""bitcoin law"" passed by the country's Congress to the country's dollarisation process in the early 2000s.

""The move does not appear to be driven by stability concerns, but rather growth-oriented, and it is difficult to see any real economic benefit from using Bitcoin as a second form of fiat currency,"" the JPMorgan report notes.

El Salvador is seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund for a credit program.

According to Bitcoinist, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele met with financial institutions on June 10.

The International Monetary Fund has expressed concern about the new law because of ""economic and legal issues.""

On that note, JPMorgan added that it could jeopardize El Salvador's negotiations with financial institutions.

So the report is skeptical about the ""stereotyping"" of bitcoin as legal tender, but there is no doubt that El Salvador could start a continuing trend.

The JPMorgan report suggests that ""if this is the start of a broader trend toward the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in a number of similar small countries, then regulatory action could become complicated.""

Like MicroStrategy, the first publicly traded company to add bitcoin assets to its corporate coffers, many believe El Salvador could have a domino effect.

Countries with dollarized economies and large populations need rapid and cost-effective remittances.

According to a Reuters report, Benoit Coeure, representative of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in a Central American country like El Salvador was an interesting experiment.

Coeure, however, clarified that the BIS shares the International Monetary Fund's concerns about bitcoin and believes the cryptocurrency has not yet passed its ""test as a means of payment.""

He called cryptocurrencies speculative assets and called for more regulation.

Former BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes has paid tribute to El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin in a controversial blog post.

He thinks it's too early to say the global payment system is over, but he sees the potential for Bitcoin to benefit the people of the country.

""It's not a fait accompli that sending bitcoin in small amounts is cheaper than the existing solution.

The truly revolutionary outcome would be for Salvadoran domestic workers to demand wages in bitcoin.

Early morning as always horizontal, and this pattern, morning went continued to fall, but note that the pattern of early fall, continuity is poor, continuity is good, is very weak, but four hours of rhythm, in the strong rising situation, so early retreat, can only be due to shock.
Down, be sure to pay attention to the early uptrend, that is, the double top position, the key resistance near 36000.
This is close to the previous double bottom. According to the proximity principle, in this pattern, either the price is not near the previous low or there is a high probability of a break.
But there is a point to try, today's daily rhythm, continue to look at the bottom of the recovery, the bottom of the recovery limit position is around 618, which is 33800.
Then it is recommended to sell short 35900~36100, stop 36700, target 34700, then cut the position and move the stop around 33800~ 344000.Blows 33800 to 344000 are long, targets 34700 to 35200.

nxzr23,chuck_portis,Bitcoin/Crypto Geo-Arbitrage," Hey guys,

Is anyone here doing active geo-arbitrage with crypto/fiat pairs across different fiat currencies? The Korean premium spent a few weeks above 10% this year. I'm also aware that the premium in South Africa has hit double digits multiple times this year.

I am going to start writing about crypto geo-arbitrage on Medium and Reddit more often. I just posted my first article on capital controls: [https://chuckportis.medium.com/thoughts-on-currency-controls-81f5729c137f](https://chuckportis.medium.com/thoughts-on-currency-controls-81f5729c137f)

Geo-Arbitrage is a space I've been following since the China markets went crazy in 2013. Back then, you had prices in China sitting 20-30% higher than USA for weeks. It was an insane time. Tons of people were exploiting it. Unfortunately I didn't have the proper setup at the time. You really need to have your ducks in a row (banking, business, etc.) ready for when the premium appears. Trying to set it up after the fact means the premium could easily evaporate by the time you're ready.

I'm also curious about some of the more obscure fiat pairs. Places like Africa, South America, etc. I've seen some pretty crazy premiums in Nigeria:

[https://localbitcoins.com/country/NG](https://localbitcoins.com/country/NG)

You'll see Nigeria has a premium of like 20-25% above USD rate. Not a country I have experience with, I know that some places like Argentina, the government sets the exchange rate. You'll never actually be able to sell ARS for the government rate. So the arbitrage opportunity isn't real, it's really just highlighting the difference between the government rate (which is untradeable) and the real rate.

Anyways, just a feeler right now, looking to hear your experiences on crypto geo-arbitrage and would be happy to connect with anyone who is focused in the space.",1623476900,2,1

nxykv6,ajaykfr,Bitcoin Protocol! Bitcoin at $200K by Year‚Äôs End?," 

# Bitcoin at $200K by Year‚Äôs End? Some Crypto Options Traders Make a statement.

Some bitcoin options buyers are making outlandish wagers, making a bet on a rally to a six-parent fee thru 365 days quit while the cryptocurrency keeps to conflict following ultimate month‚Äôs 35% drop.

According to statistics provided with the aid of Levitas, the dominant cryptocurrency alternatives exchange Deribit noticed a complete of 425 bitcoin (BTC, -3.84%) call option contracts, with a strike fee of $200,000 and an expiration date of Dec. 31, alternate arms on Thursday. That strike fee is sort of five times the contemporary diploma.

A call desire is a spinoff agreement that offers the client the proper however no longer the responsibility to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined fee on or before a particular date. Theoretically, shopping for a call at the $2 hundred,000 strike expiring on Dec. 31 is a bet that the cryptocurrency will end the year above that diploma.

While the change length is incredibly small in comparison with similar gambles that CoinDesk has included in the beyond, the wagers are nevertheless interesting for several motives. To begin with, the $200,000 name options represent an extended-term guess, with an expiration date a complete six months away.

And due to the fact the alternatives are to this point out-of-the-cash (strike well above the spot marketplace fee), they may be extraordinarily cheap, currently buying and selling at 0.018 BTC ($698) on Deribit.

That makes the alternatives the equivalent of a lottery price ticket: Buyers stand to lose just $698 according to a lot if the marketplace doesn‚Äôt pass better till Dec. 31. But the option would theoretically benefit a large fee if the bullish mood returns to the market.

Such low-threat gambles are usually discovered in the course of bull runs. For instance, traders piled into the $eighty,000 name alternative in March, while bitcoin was on a robust upward trajectory and trading at highs above $50,000.

Bitcoin rose to an all-time high of nearly $65,000 in April, however, the rate has due to the fact that tumbled and now seems to be consolidating underneath $forty,000. At press time, the largest cryptocurrency became converting fingers at around $37,500.

Recently, the marketplace has been packed with doom and gloom. However, of all of the alternatives indexed on Deribit, the $one hundred,000 name is the maximum popular, with an expiry-wide open interest of 9,000.

Broadly talking, but, the alternatives marketplace has a bearish bias, highlighting persistent fears of a more profound decline. The one-, 3- and six-month put-call skews are currently returning high-quality values, indicating that places (bearish bets) are fetching higher prices (call for) than calls.

I've logged a case with nvidia, but the nature of the bug is not simple, so the helpdesk do not understand it, so will not take action.

I'm trying to garner some community attention toward this bug, in order to force nvidia to pay attention and fix it. While gamers have failed us (and themselves) on this front, I figure since this is costing you all money, you might care?

The aim of the game here is simply to get this in front of an nvidia engineer with the specialised skillset required to understand it. The engineer will see the issue and fix it. I just need to get past the wall at the helpdesk. I hope you can help.

This link should contain enough detail for you to describe the issue to nvidia: [https://imgur.com/a/iqnxq78](https://imgur.com/a/iqnxq78) (or just send them this link if you like)

Please consider that this process and the resulting graph are only a process to reproduce the fault - something the nvidia engineers need, in order to confirm this is real. The loss of performance is a tiny moment in time (around 2-10ms) which is not easily observed by the naked eye. This process and the graph are just 'highlighting' one symptom of the problem, for the purpose of proving the problem is back there somewhere.

nxwwgz,Jintor,With a hard wallet like nano or trezor: how the private key is transmitted from the usb stick to the software ??????????????,"I'm a programmer and have this question.

to give a ***analogy*** : http transmit data openly =&gt; it can be intercepted and seen

with https data is encrypted from 1 end to the other, so that a ""middle man"" would see only encrypted data...

but what about crypto wallets, what is the mechanism to read the data from the stick, can that step be vulnerable ???

To explain more:

let's  say I have a hard wallet (usb stick), when I want to do a transaction, I  have to open a software to perform that transaction.... I have to plug  the stick in my computer.

the software reads the private key from the stick to create the signature to do a transaction...

!!!! but can that software have security vulnerabilities and can my private keys be copied in some way ???

The  concern or question I have is related tho the fact that you do have to  plug your usb stick to the computer and use a software (that is  connected to internet) to do a transaction. there is still a mechanism  to ""read"" the private key from the stick.

can that process be hacked?

o1hb0k,kmms33,What Makes Bitcoin a Store of Value?,"
**A cup is not being useful when it sits in the cupboard, only when you drink from it. A bicycle is not useful when it sits in the garage, but when you ride it.** We can say that a bicycle or a cup are useful items, even when not currently in use, but it **is the ability to make use of them when needed that grants them this label of utility.**

Likewise, a broken cup or a bicycle damaged beyond repair ceases to be useful and becomes junk. This is because **value comes from utility** and not the other way around. A thing that loses its intended functionality loses its value. The broken cup may still find itself useful to the artist, but broken items tend to lose all worth and can generally be had for free‚Ä¶ many people even pay someone else to collect their junk from them!¬π

This article is about the ‚Äústore of value‚Äù myth and how those who promote it are blind to the gaps in their logic. Gold is considered useful as a store of value because people know with certainty that when the time comes to actually use it, e.g., to sell it or trade it (or smelt it or forge it), that there will be someone else to buy it with little enough fuss. **Gold is useful as a store of value because it is universally regarded as something that has value.** Gold has value, and it can be an asset, but it is not money.

Bitcoin is different. It was invented, described, and marketed as a new form of money. Its only function was to serve the needs of its users by being a better way to transmit value from one person to another. It was (and is) revolutionary because **it marked the first time in human history people could transmit any amount of value across any distance or any border without the involvement of intermediaries and regulators. For the first time in human history, a person could send fifty cents from Tokyo to Tanzania as quickly and easily as they drop spare change in the hat of a street musician.** In other words, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.

Cash is regarded as something of high utility. It can be used at virtually any store, or traded to virtually any person you come across in day-to-day life. There are few people who would walk past a hundred dollar note on the ground without stopping to pick it up. Cash is hyper-useful because, like Bitcoin, and unlike previous attempts at electronic money, it can be given to any person, in any amount, without any oversight or permission required. Bitcoin‚Äôs pseudonymous inventor **Satoshi Nakamoto bridged the gap between cash and electronic money by creating the world‚Äôs first form of electronic money that had all the same monetary properties as cash. But it was superior to cash, because it did not have many of the negative physical properties that can work against cash. It can‚Äôt be confiscated, torn, burned, counterfeited, eaten by rats, and it does not weigh anything or occupy any space.** Carrying $100,000 in cash or gold through an airport is risky, but with Bitcoin one can memorize a mnemonic phrase and walk around with $100,000 in their brain and no one can stop them.

More revolutionary still, **Bitcoin also had many of the properties that make gold valuable while shedding the properties that make it inconvenient.** Bitcoin takes the best attributes of both cash and gold and boils them down to their purest essence.

Like the cup in the cupboard and the bicycle in the garage, cash in the wallet or under the mattress is only ‚Äúuseful‚Äù insofar as it can be reliably useful at the time one wishes to use it. **A trillion-dollar Zimbabwe note held by an American is regarded as a novelty, not counted as cash-on-hand. Even a strong foreign currency held in cash will be regarded as less useful than the prevailing local currency, because it won‚Äôt be as widely accepted and one often has to carry it to a bank or a money-changer to convert it to a more useful form of paper. This doesn't happens with Bitcoin which is becoming widely accepted everywhere in the world.**

Do Bitcoin whales create any issues for its long term application as a currency/store of value/whatever you believe Bitcoin can/should be?

I understand we can eventually refer to Bits or Satoshis, but does the long term effect of a small group of people holding a majority of Bitcoin cause an issue for the health of Bitcoin?

Maybe it will eventually be more broadly distributed as people start to adopt Bitcoin, and large quantity holders take profits and sell (seems to come in waves, but it seems most will hold), but is the current distribution of Bitcoin amongst a few whales going to cause an issue with the long term outlook? Is it fair to expect a Bitcoin dump at some point, and how will that affect it if Bitcoin has been broadly accepted and all of the sudden it crashes as whales take profits (if they choose to)?

I find the question to become more relevant as the Bitcoin whales start to become large institutions, banks and companies, while normal people in the world are just living off Bits and Satoshis. Almost seems like there'd be a ruling class of early Bitcoin adopters (congrats to you) and large institutions but are there any implications in that scenario.

 But if I scroll down, under transactions, I can only see the test  transaction I make a few days ago. I can not find any info regarding  the new transaction I made today even though the total number of BTCs is  updated at the top of the app and the accounts.

If I go to BTC scan and search my address, I can see the total number of BTCs are correct.

Why , in Trezor Suite, there is no transaction info recorded? Should I be worried?

To aid in mass adoption of crypto in general, when doing odd jobs or anything where you‚Äôd ordinarily transact in cash under 100 dollars, let‚Äôs force whoever is paying to pay us in crypto, whichever it may be. 

Say a buddy asks for a ride and is willing to pay 10-20 dollars. Instead of accepting cash, agree to the deal only if they pay in crypto. 

If they don‚Äôt know how, kindly assist them with setting up an account and allowing you to watch every step of the way, as well as confirming the numbers with them before you send to your wallet from theirs. 

1. Don‚Äôt be a scumbag and send yourself 100 bucks in crypto while telling them it‚Äôs only 10 or 20 or whatever. 
2. Show them how the fees work as well. If you agreed to say 25 dollar payment, use enough out of the 25 to cover the gas fees for them the first time, while explaining how they work and letting them know they‚Äôll have to pay them per transaction. 


If you‚Äôre a kid in crypto, you‚Äôre probably more tech savvy than most adults. You can probably figure out how to download the necessary things to hold crypto. 

1. Pay each other in crypto for small amounts of cash. Say under 10 bucks if you‚Äôre a kid. Since you will need that cash in the short term just use small amounts. 
2. Tell your parents to give you gift money in the form of crypto. Forces them to use the technology and

It details ‚Äúthe actions administrative agencies plan to issue in the near and long term,‚Äù which provides ‚Äúimportant public notice and transparency about proposed regulatory and deregulatory actions within the Executive Branch,‚Äù the accompanying announcement explains.

Included in the agenda is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)‚Äôs ‚Äúannual regulatory agenda,‚Äù the agency independently announced, clarifying:

Some of the items the SEC will consider include disclosures relating to climate risk, corporate board diversity, and beneficial ownership and swaps. The SEC will also focus on rules relating to SPACs and short sale disclosure reform.

SEC Chairman Gary Gensler commented: ‚ÄúTo meet our mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation, the SEC has a lot of regulatory work ahead of us. I look forward to collaborating with my fellow commissioners and the dedicated staff to propose and finalize rules that will strengthen our markets, increase transparency, and safeguard investors.‚Äù

While bitcoin and cryptocurrency are not on the SEC‚Äôs regulatory agenda this year, Gensler has been talking about the need to protect investors and regulate cryptocurrency exchanges.

Last month, the chairman urged Congress to pass cryptocurrency legislation to protect investors, adding that cryptocurrency exchanges needed more regulation. In addition, the SEC cautioned investors about funds trading in bitcoin futures last week. So far, the agency has brought 75 crypto-related enforcement actions. Meanwhile, a growing number of companies are seeking approval to trade bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

One thing that sounds very interesting, though I can‚Äôt find much information about online, is **processing transactions through lightning channels**. For clarity, I'm not looking to be profitable or make money on fees; I just want to do a small part in helping the global financial ecosystem.

I have the following questions here that I‚Äôm hoping the community can help out with:

1. Can any lightning node set-up process transactions, or do I need a certain level of GB for the raspberry pi, Micro SD Card, SSD Card, etc. to have a better/realistic chance of processing transactions?
2. Does my lightning node need to be funded with BTC before it can process transactions? If so, do I need a certain amount of BTC on my node to have a real chance of actually processing transactions? Also, is there some sort of mathematical relationship between these two things (ex: if I have $1,000 BTC on my node, I can process up to $10,000 in transactions, but if I have $10,000 BTC on my node, I can process up to $100,000)?
3. Does anyone have recommendations (articles, videos, etc.?) for where to learn more about processing transactions on a lightning node?",1624006628,25,13

I strongly felt this was needed! All other currencies are getting upgrades. Smart contracts were feasible on ETH but not on BTC. With this upgrade set to roll out in November, it could be a game changer. Would love to hear out some opinions on the Taproot upgrade on BTC.

For those who have not heard about this upgrade, feel free to take a look at the Tradingview post. I have tried to break it down in a simple and concise manner!

* Why should I run a node? 
* What are the benefits for me and the project? 
* What can I actually do with a node? (something changes for me or it's just having the program running in the background).
* Would it be better in the current state of things that I run a Bitcoin node or a Lightning one?
* How the hell do I run a node in a Chromebook? (they now support Linux terminal, I'm really a noob at Linux so would need some kind of step-by-step guide).
* Running a node can fuck up my connection? (does it requires too much bandwidth?)
* Can I turn it on/off several times a day if I need to release pressure on my network or would that make the node pretty much useless?

I think that just for starters these are the questions that come to mind. The only thing I know for sure it's that it should be a pruned node since the Chromies have little storage. So I would also need to understand how to set that up.

If someone can point me in the right direction I would very much appreciate it. I already googled (most like DuckDuck Goed) it, and I can't seem to find clear info on this.

o2fxml,CrypticButthole,Bitcoin: Special Block Numbers and Their Hashes,"Don't get me wrong, every block in the Bitcoin network is as important as all others. But these block numbers are special. The first set is the first digits of the Golden Ratio. This ratio is found throughout the universe in a wide variety of things. It is based off the second set of special block numbers: the Fibonnaci sequence. Using the numbers generated by the Fibonnaci sequence, we can calculate the Golden Ratio.

These block hashes could have special interactions with eachother, based purely off the fact that they were generated for the blocks following the golden ratios digits, and the Fibonnaci sequence.

I am hoping to get others to help me look into these blocks and their mechanics to help determine how the Golden Ratio and Fibonnaci sequence interact with the Bitcoin Blockchain. Who knows, maybe there is a message in there somewhere.

The first few blocks and hashes to look at: The Golden Ratio.

Here they are.

I'm looking for a cold (or cold+hot) wallet that is able to keep separate accounts in some way. I manage a few different trading accounts and would like to store all of the assets, but I don't want them mingling. I.e. I'd like one part of the wallet store all coins for customer A, and a separate storage for customer B. So on... The trick is that multiple accounts may own bitcoin. I'd like to keep those amounts separate rather than the wallet creating one large bitcoin account. 

Is this possible? Or does each customer/account really need its own wallet?

Bonus question: would any of these mingle nicely with a trading terminal like 3commas? Meaning withdrawing/depositing the coins from that terminal rather than needing to log into each exchange independently.

I feel as though I'm asking for the impossible and improbable. I just need to the internet to prove me wrong or tell me my goals are dumb",1623986740,12,2

All I recall is him saying that the USB he gave me was Linux. I shoved a USB drive and the slip of paper he gave me into a drawer and promptly forgot about them.

Fast forward to now, and we're no longer really on speaking terms, but I could use some monies and I thought about this old thing. I am not educated in cryptocurrencies even slightly, and have spent about a week on and off trying to figure out how/what to do with this thing.

Currently, I have a USB drive that seems to be Linux formatted. It also acts as a boot drive. I also have a sheet of passcodes labelled Generation Seed, Password, and Receiving Address. 

I believe I have everything I need in order to do anything with what I have, but I have zero idea how to do it. I have a laptop set aside for playing with Linux. I just started a Coinbase account, but that doesn't seem to have the option I need. 

Anyone willing to lend a hand?

EDIT: Just to cut down on the number of replies, don't worry folks, I will not be giving out a shred of the password info or anything. From peeking at the rates that BitCoins have been trading at, historically, we may only be talking about a couple hundred bucks.

EDIT #2: Okay! Thanks all. I got it all figured out. Woo. You were all most helpful, I definitely had hit a brick wall after about a week of being mildly frustrated about it. Got things moved over to Coinbase where I find out that I am now the proud owner of... &lt;drumroll&gt; ... ... $137!

""Coinbase: We have received withdrawal request on your account from unrecognized device. If this was not you, click here: [\[](https://case131336-coinbase-com.web.app/)removed link from Reddit for safety\]""

I was in the middle of a conversation and was completely not thinking. I clicked the link, everything looked legitimate, and I didn't receive any warning from Google or Safari. I entered my login information.

The next steps are blurry, but I then received an email with a link that I clicked, and then provided the 2FA code code from my phone. Like I said, I was totally distracted when going through this and provided all the info. Within minutes, the entirety of my BTC (the only crypto I held) worth about $8500 was sent off to an unknown account.

I am horribly upset and embarrassed. I'm posting here to see what my next steps should be. I have contacted Coinbase via email, really wish I could get someone on the phone. I intend to file a police report both locally and with FBI/FTC.

Is there anything I can do? I'm going to assume this money is gone and lost but I'm just looking for advice. Thank you.",1624151793,363,11

o3p4k9,Cleverim2222,Dorsey: ‚ÄòSquare Is Considering Making a Hardware Wallet for Bitcoin‚Äô,"The cofounder of Twitter and the CEO of the payments firm Square, Jack Dorsey, has revealed his firm is contemplating creating a bitcoin hardware wallet in collaboration with the community. Dorsey revealed this in a tweetstorm and said he wanted to share some ‚Äúguiding principles‚Äù concerning this possible venture.
On Friday, Jack Dorsey tweeted about the possibility of Square creating a bitcoin hardware wallet and discussed a number of principles the firm is guided by when approaching the subject. The founder of Twitter and Square explained that what the company creates needs to be ‚Äúopen,‚Äù as he noted that ‚Äúbitcoin is for everyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúSquare is considering making a hardware wallet for bitcoin. If we do it, we would build it entirely in the open, from software to hardware design, and in collaboration with the community,‚Äù Dorsey tweeted. ‚ÄúWe want to kick off this thinking the right way: by sharing some of our guiding principles. Bitcoin is for everyone. It‚Äôs important to us to build an inclusive product that brings a non-custodial solution to the global market,‚Äù the Square CEO added.

Dorsey then gave those who have already pioneered the noncustodial wallet space props, and asked his Twitter followers what the ‚Äúbiggest blockers to get a non-custodial solution to the next 100M people?‚Äù Numerous people answered Dorsey‚Äôs questions and a few responses discussed hardware wallets with no iOS support.
‚ÄúiOS support. Trezor, up until now, still doesn‚Äôt support iOS for (good reason.) If you solve this solvable problem, you gain a huge portion of the market,‚Äù one individual responded to Dorsey‚Äôs Twitter thread.

‚ÄúCustody doesn‚Äôt have to be all-or-nothing,‚Äù Dorsey continued. ‚ÄúWe can probably simplify custody through ‚Äòassisted self-custody.‚Äô Assisted requires great product design: minimal setup time, relying on existing devices, and end-to-end reliability. How should we be thinking about assisted solutions?,‚Äù the Square CEO asked. He further added:
After Dorsey published his thread with about 12 different points, he said that Square and his team plan to ‚Äúcontinue the conversation.‚Äù He further noted that a dedicated Twitter account would be on the way and a Github repository, as well, if the firm decides to build a hardware wallet.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll update this thread with that information when we‚Äôre ready. Thanks,‚Äù Dorsey concluded.

Dorsey‚Äôs hardware wallet tweet has accrued tens of thousands of likes and retweets since he announced Square‚Äôs possible hardware wallet venture. The Twitter CEO also mentioned that layer 2 capabilities and Cash App integrations with the hardware wallet are also important guiding principles.
Meanwhile, after the hardware wallet announcement, Dorsey attended the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami this weekend and was heckled by a conference attendee over ‚Äúcensorship‚Äù and ‚Äúinterfering in elections.‚Äù

Raftaar, an Indian rapper, lyricist, dancer, TV personality and music composer, made headlines this weekend for being the ‚Äúfirst Indian artist to accept performance fee in cryptocurrency.‚Äù Raftaar‚Äôs real name is Dilin Nair.
The performance for which Raftaar will be paid in cryptocurrency is a one-hour virtual event in Ottawa, Canada, for a private group of about 100 people. It is scheduled for the second week of July.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been an ardent admirer of blockchain technology. I‚Äôve always wondered why artistes and managers alike haven‚Äôt explored the potential of this disruptive medium,‚Äù Raftaar opined. ‚ÄúNevertheless, I‚Äôve finally taken the baby steps in this direction and all the credit goes to my manager, Ankit Khanna for making this dream a reality for me.‚Äù
The rapper did not mention which cryptocurrency he will be paid in, however.
Khanna, Raftaar‚Äôs longtime business partner and manager, commented: ‚ÄúIn my opinion, music will be one of the first industries to be completely and thoroughly disrupted through the blockchain. The artist can now go directly to the public in every single way without the need of middlemen.‚Äù
Meanwhile, the Indian government has yet to announce its policy on cryptocurrency. A bill that seeks to ban cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, was scheduled to be introduced during the budget session of parliament but was not. There are now reports that the government is re-examining the proposals in the bill and is setting up a panel of experts to come up with new recommendations.",1624132408,2,5

Mary Barra, the CEO of General Motors (NYSE: GM), talked about the prospect of the largest automaker in the U.S. accepting bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Wednesday.

Referencing Tesla CEO Elon Musk stating last week that his electric car company may start accepting BTC again, Barra was asked whether GM will be accepting the cryptocurrency for payments. She replied:

There‚Äôs nothing that precludes us from doing that. We will be driven by our customers. Certainly, we want to make the whole buying and ownership experience as easy as possible. We will follow their lead.
When Tesla announced in February that it would accept bitcoin for payments, the GM CEO said that her company was not interested in doing the same. However, in an earnings call at the end of March, Barra softened her stance on BTC and said the company would consider accepting the cryptocurrency ‚Äúif there‚Äôs strong consumer demand.‚Äù She confirmed Wednesday that her company‚Äôs position on bitcoin has not changed.

Meanwhile, Musk said this week that Tesla will resume accepting bitcoin ‚ÄúWhen there‚Äôs confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend.‚Äù",1624129421,5,5

It cited issues with Bitcoin‚Äôs environmental impact and transparency as reasons why it will not support El Salvador move to adopt Bitcoin as an officially accepted currency .

‚ÄúWhile the government did approach us for assistance on Bitcoin, this is not something the World Bank can support given the environmental and transparency shortcomings, ‚Äù a World Bank spokesperson said.

The World Bank did note however that it can help El Salvador in other ways, including ‚Äúcurrency transparency and regulatory processes.‚Äù
Earlier on Wednesday, Salvadoran Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya said the Central America country had sought technical assistance from Banco Mundial (the World Bank).
Prominent Bitcoiners weren‚Äôt pleased with the World Bank‚Äôs refusal, but nor were they particularly surprised.

Bitcoin proponent Anthony Pompliano tweeted in response to the news that the ‚ÄúWorld Bank hasn‚Äôt figured out how to make money off Bitcoin.‚Äù

Samson Mow the CSO of blockchain development firm Blockstream, and creator of blockchain game Infinite Fleet, was irritated by the news ‚Äî and called for The World Bank to be made obsolete.
While President Nayib Bukele‚Äôs Bitcoin law has sparked a lot of excitement from Bitcoin proponents across the globe, it has also received a lot of criticism. Yesterday, economist Steve Hanke said that El Salvador using Bitcoin as a legal tender may ‚Äúcompletely collapse the economy.‚Äù

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is also not keen on El Salvador‚Äôs embrace of Bitcoin. Cointelegraph reported on June 11 that it may hamper negotiations with the IMF over a $1B loan to support the country‚Äôs economy.

IMF spokesman Gerry Rice noted the adoption of Bitcoin presents a number of financial, legal and macroeconomic concerns that require a ‚Äúvery careful analysis‚ÄùBut some companies are rushing to help. Athena Bitcoin indicated it would move quickly to provide Bitcoin ATMs across El Salvador. On Twitter today, the firm asked Bukele if ‚Äú1000 ATMs ‚Äù were enough, with the President replying in jest ‚Äú1,000? How about 1,500?‚Äù

Yesterday, El Salvador‚Äôs Minister of Labor and Social Welfare Rolando Castro denied claims that ministry had begun discussing the option to use Bitcoin for employee salary payments, noting that it was ‚Äútoo premature to talk about wages.‚Äù",1624127086,29,10

The odds of such an approach not ending well are too high,‚Äù the governor said.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey talked about cryptocurrency regulation Monday at the annual conference of financial trade body The City UK.

He was quoted as saying: ‚ÄúWe must, both domestically and working with international partners, ensure that we understand and respond to the public interest issues that arise here.‚Äù He said it will allow the Bank of England to protect financial stability while allowing innovation to happen ‚Äúin a world where the public interest is well defined and protected.‚Äù

Emphasizing, ‚ÄúWhat we cannot have is a world where innovation gets a free pass to ignore the public interest. The odds of such an approach not ending well are too high,‚Äù the governor detailed:
Governor Bailey has long been a critic of cryptocurrencies. Last month, he said cryptocurrencies are ‚Äúdangerous,‚Äù reiterating that they ‚Äúhave no intrinsic value‚Äù and ‚ÄúBuy them only if you‚Äôre prepared to lose all your money.‚Äù

He also talked about stablecoins, noting that they ‚Äúhave the potential to be systemic in terms of their importance for the financial system and its stability.‚Äù Bailey elaborated, ‚ÄúA key requirement will be to ensure that, unless the stablecoin is operating as a bank, the backing assets for stablecoins cover the outstanding coin issuance at all times.‚Äù

Moreover, the governor of the Bank of England warned against using cryptocurrencies for payments, stating:
Addressing the Bank of England‚Äôs work on a central bank digital currency (CBDC), he said the bank and the U.K. Treasury are weighing the potential of creating one. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to engage with users, the technology sector, to understand the potential for these things,‚Äù he said.",1624126944,13,4

o5x5ks,I_amNND,How to keep your Bitcoin safe ?,"**Bought crypto at a great dip. Now what ? How do you keep your coins safe ?**

Now that the markets are dipping, I felt this would be a good time to post about how to keep our crypto safe as we expect the veterans to pull in their friends and family into the crypto markets. This will help all the newbies navigate the security measures in cryptoverse.

&amp;#x200B;

* **ENABLE 2FA Authenticator everywhere. Use a separate email for crypto. Use google authenticator instead of SMS authenticator. NO QUESTIONS ASKED.**
* **You take it off the exchange. You do not leave your coins on the exchange.  "" NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS.""** The only times I leave coins on the exchange is when I know that I am looking to buy more coins in the next several hours. That way I avoid paying fees multiple times to withdraw from the wallet. But with coins like ADA , SOL, ONE where the fees is so low that it might even be worth getting the coins off the exchange even if you do intend to buy more coins in the next 12-24 hours.  **Alternatively, if you bought BTC or ETH/ERC-20 tokens,** you could possibly wait till your done accumulating for the session and then pay the fee at once to pull your coins out. Sure you have to pay the transaction fees but hey, that's the cost of doing business here.
*  ALWAYS do regular scans on your main computer which you use to buy/store your coins for malware and other threats. 
*  Never publicly reveal your holdings. Never trust anyone who reveals their holdings publicly either. They are either malicious or they are lying or they are just stupid. You do not need to associate with such people in any case.
*  Never use the email you use for your social accounts as your exchange's email. If you have made that mistake already, consider changing the mail or alternatively changing the account. Yes, it may sound extreme but it is worth it.
*  Do not visit shady websites from your main computer. Sure, you may have anti-virus but do not risk it. Especially avoid visiting illegal websites that stream shows, sports events and porn.
*  Do invest in a hardware wallet as soon as you feel it is worth it. BUT MAKE SURE that you buy directly from the manufacturer's website or from a very reputable retailer.
*  I would always suggest choosing wallets which have multiple assets storage over  storing your assets in separate chrome extension wallets. Particular example comes to mind with EXODUS vs YOROI when staking ADA. It might be an unpopular opinion but for those who do not own BOATLOADS of ADA, in my opinion, I feel it is better to use EXODUS even though you get 0.8% less APY. You can store multiple assets on the wallet. Just making the entire process easier. And incase you do own BOATLOADS of ADA, you should be using Daedalus wallet anyways. Just my opinion. Take it with a grain of salt.
*  FACT CHECK EVERYTHING. I have lost quite a bit (not crypto but in general) by not questioning people because I was afraid I would offend them. If they are correct, they will always be delighted to prove their point. 
* DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING. Double check whether you pasted the correct wallet address. Double check the authenticator code. Double check whether the girl you like is only into you for your crypto. Double-checking never hurts.

# Bitcoin consumes energy

It consumes massive amounts of power. Energy production causes pollution and burns finite resources.

# Bitcoin is expansive

It requires a large quantity of specialized chips and electronics for its mining operation. There is currently a chip shortage in the world. Electronic chips are needed everywhere for all industries especially the most critical ones.

# Bitcoin is universally expensive

The finite resources it uses affect us all. In the end, everyone has to pay a price to keep it running.

# Bitcoin is explicably expensive

It records everything, including the vast amount of 'wasted' energy used to mine the chain. Everyone knows about it, anyone can prove it, it's everybody's business to care.

# In Bitcoin dishonesty doesn't survive

A chain that is dishonest, corrupt, and benefits only a few will inevitably lose. Bitcoin externalizes its costs of operation, and thus, any dishonesty and corruption it may contain to everyone, forcing others to care. Only an honest and egalitarian chain can survive and be accepted in society.

# Seriously, Bitcoin is not a game

If you make it into one, you will be the target of everyone.

¬†

# Bitcoin is a truth machine

***Energy usage for Proof of Work is not a ""problem"", It's the main feature.***

The chain can only ever be honest, lawful, and useful for everyone because if it's not, it immediately turns into a liability for the whole world, and then it can only die. (like natural selection)

## Work is Truth

In the long term, the most worked on and 'surviving' PoW chain becomes its own best proof of the chain's legitimacy and utility in society due to the economic and social pressures it had to endure for its ongoing existence.

This powerful 'sacrifice' and 'acceptance' signaling is what makes the protocol a credible and convincing ledger of truth.

## Work fosters transparency, trust, and honest behavior

The large amount of economic activity required to be a Validating Node (Miner) in the Bitcoin Protocol means that such activity has a difficult time staying hidden or anonymous. This produces a system that contains a great deal of transparency on who is doing the validating and their proportional contribution to the chain.

SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) is the most *important* feature of PoW. The entire chain and its accumulated 'work' becomes simple to understand, and accessible to all; making it universally auditable.

## In Bitcoin, the 'work' is paid for by means of a unilateral contract, making it an open system

Bitcoin in its essence is a communication protocol that facilitates a distributed *unilateral contract* for building a *public and immutable chain of data*.

It is thus by its very nature an open and public system in which anyone willing to follow the rules can work for and get paid to do so.

This decentralized and open aspect of the protocol is what ensures its robustness and security overall.

## Work cannot be gamed, forged, or replicated easily. Information can.

Bitcoin's unique property is that it essentially merges something that is scarce and limited (i.e. work, time, resources) with 'information' which on its own and throughout human history, has always been susceptible to manipulation.

With PoW, information that is stored on a blockchain becomes as immutable as the scarce *resources* and *time* that were needed to build the chain. What you get in the end, is a public good that shares the same properties as any other tangible public good. Just like you can't create a fake 'Hoover Dam', you can't fake a widely accepted public Blockchain.

## The main value provided by Bitcoin is the 'data storage', not the Coin.

Proof of Work is the special thing that makes data stored in the blockchain more valuable than data stored conventionally. The immutability, security, and openness provided by PoW makes it actually possible to store the world's economic and legal data on a ***single global public ledger***. This can result in massive benefits for society and a large increase in economic and legal efficiency.

## Profit is the ultimate sign that a PoW protocol is producing real value for society

The block reward in every new block simply acts as an initial subsidy for the 'work' miners do. Only when the total *value in transaction fees* collected by miners is *higher* than the total *value of energy and resources* need to mine the blocks does the protocol turn into a net positive for the world. In other words, when miners turn energy into immutable data, charge for it, and make a profit; the energy isn't ""wasted"", it is *used* to produce something more useful.

Given that prices of crypto today (not counting stablecoins) probably fluctuate more than the vast majority of commodities/securities/whatever out there, why would anyone want to be readily paid in crypto for exchange of goods/services? I don't mean as a long term investment, since people obviously like to be paid in stocks of things they believe have a future. But if it's for something you'll need to spend tomorrow, doesn't it fluctuate way too much for that to be realistic?

Put another way, why would anyone want to be paid in crypto today if they expect to spend it on groceries the very next day, if that same amount could very well be worth 5% or 10% or even less tomorrow? Sure the upside is possible as well, but that obviously is not realistic at all as a readily-spent currency?

To have prices stabilize, there needs to be widespread adoption AND widespread spending of it as completely liquid currency. But if everyone is scared to start adopting it for fear of having no grocery money tomorrow, how would it ever work?

I get it if crypto is supposed to just exist purely as an investment vehicle. Extremely volatile yes, but high potential for growth depending on your belief. As stable cash? I just don't understand how that could ever work.",1624392705,16,1

SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) is the most \*important\* feature of PoW. The entire chain and its accumulated 'work' becomes simple to understand, and accessible to all; making it universally auditable.

&amp;#x200B;

\##### In Bitcoin, the 'work' is paid for by means of a unilateral contract, making it an open system

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin in its essence is a communication protocol that facilitates a distributed \*unilateral contract\* for building a \*public and immutable chain of data\*.

&amp;#x200B;

It is thus by its very nature an open and public system in which anyone willing to follow the rules can work for and get paid to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

This decentralized and open aspect of the protocol is what ensures its robustness and security overall. 

&amp;#x200B;

\##### Work cannot be gamed, forged, or replicated easily. Information can.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin's unique property is that it essentially merges something that is scarce and limited (i.e. work, time, resources) with 'information' which on its own and throughout human history, has always been susceptible to manipulation.

&amp;#x200B;

With PoW, information that is stored on a blockchain becomes as immutable as the scarce \*resources\* and \*time\* that were needed to build the chain. What you get in the end, is a public good that shares the same properties as any other tangible public good. Just like you can't create a fake 'Hoover Dam', you can't fake a widely accepted public Blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

\##### The main value provided by Bitcoin is the 'data storage', not the Coin.

&amp;#x200B;

Proof of Work is the special thing that makes data stored in the blockchain more valuable than data stored conventionally. The immutability, security, and openness provided by PoW makes it actually possible to store the world's economic and legal data on a \*\*\*single global public ledger\*\*\*. This can result in massive benefits for society and a large increase in economic and legal efficiency.

&amp;#x200B;

\##### \*\*\*Profit\*\*\* is the ultimate sign that a PoW protocol is producing real value for society

&amp;#x200B;

The block reward in every new block simply acts as an initial subsidy for the 'work' miners do. Only when the total \*value in transaction fees\* collected by miners is \*higher\* than the total \*value of energy and resources\* need to mine the blocks does the protocol turn into a net positive for the world. In other words, when miners turn energy into immutable data, charge for it, and make a profit; the energy isn't ""wasted"", it is \*used\* to produce something more useful.

&amp;#x200B;

\#### Understanding Proof of Work is essential for understanding why Bitcoin is valuable. Unfortunately, many people don't.",1624392315,0,1

o5vwkw,Frosty-Farmer-5503,Understanding Bitcoin Is A Superpower,"I first heard about Bitcoin in 2014 when a friend had me create a Coinbase account and sent me some. This one transaction would change my life forever, I just didn‚Äôt know it yet. I read the white paper, but 98% of it didn‚Äôt sink in because I wasn‚Äôt technically literate enough to understand it. I understood that it solved the double-spend problem and that that was significant, but tbh I just liked the rebellious vibes the community was giving off at the time. I put a few hundred FIAT coupons in, and waited for something to happen. Then btc went sideways for a long time. I wasn‚Äôt someone who regularly tracked markets of any kind, so I got bored pretty quickly and forgot about it. 

In 2017, when my wife was about to have our first child, the market went nuts. For the first time in about 3 years I remembered ‚ÄòI own some of that‚Äô. So I downloaded the Coinbase app and logged in to discover that I now had &gt;15k. My jaw hit the floor as over the next few weeks I watch my portfolio climb to &gt;20k. As euphoric as I was, my daughter was coming in less than a month and money was tight. To this day I credit my daughters birth as the sell signal, because I sold almost all of my btc for a deposit on a larger place to live and other costs that come with a newborn. I shit you not, a week later the dump comes. I breathe I sigh of relief and feel very smart for not good reason.

I still do not understand Bitcoin. Idk why, maybe it was morbid curiosity, but I stuck around and watched it slowly tumble. All the while consuming content. All the while believing fud narratives. ‚ÄúThe network failed‚Äù, ‚Äúdouble spend‚Äù, ‚ÄúChina cancels btc‚Äù, etc. 

About this time I started a job where I worked nights pretty much by myself. Between my wife and I‚Äôs income we were pretty comfortable(that btc head start really helped). I decide to designate the extra time at night to learning more about crypto. 

Yep, I said cryto, not Bitcoin. Because I still don‚Äôt understand bitcoin. I read up on some alts, and am forced to read up on bitcoin to learn what differentiates these alts from bitcoin. I still don‚Äôt get it. I buy alts. A couple make a decent return, most go negative. At this time I withdraw from the market completely. I‚Äôm still lurking here.

Something strikes me about the way people here are so certain that shitcoins are shit. The conviction is real. I start to dive into bitcoin with no skin in the game. Literally spend my weeknights teaching myself terminology so I can understand technical papers, reading about money, finding Andreas, reading the internet of money, the bitcoin standard, etc. 

Then it clicks. This is the future of money. I want to go all in. Btc is at 5-6k on the way down to 3. Wife is hesitant, but has watched me throw myself into this for the better part of a year. We decide to take 40k from an inheritance and put it all in. Btc is at 4K. I either have the luckiest timing, or satoshi himself was waiting for me to get my head around Bitcoin, because(again) a week or so later it shoots up to 8k. My wife thinks I‚Äôm a genius. It continues to climb. I keep reading.

Since then I continue to stack. Somewhere along the line I stopped checking price every day. Once I accepted btc as my inevitable exit from FIAT, the stress most newcomers associate with hodling miraculously dissolved. I am now immune to all fud. The conviction displayed here that initially drew me in, I now possess. What‚Äôs harder than diamonds? Because my hands have been forged in it.

Moral of the story? I know it can be daunting. The terminology, learning about legacy systems, comprehending the ramifications of a network like bitcoin. I still feel like a noob. I‚Äôm learning everyday. But once you‚Äôve gleaned enough to acquire this level of conviction, it won‚Äôt feel like work anymore. Your thirst for deeper understanding of the nuances will be unquenchable. Understanding bitcoin will be your superpower.",1624392152,29,1

The analyst says there‚Äôs also a ‚Äúmore fundamental reason‚Äù to why bitcoin prices have been dropping in June and how the month of July may see ‚Äúweakness‚Äù as well.** 

 **Best Case Scenario: $450K Worst Case Scenario: $135K**

**Five months ago, bitcoin (BTC) prices went parabolic and the value of the leading crypto asset seemingly was following the well-known stock-to-flow (S2F) model. At the time, the S2F creator said: ‚Äúbitcoin stock-to-flow model \[is\] on track‚Ä¶ like clockwork.‚Äù The price of bitcoin skyrocketed over $64K per unit but has since lost more than half that value.**

**At the end of April, Plan B remarked that the downturn was a ‚Äúmid-way dip‚Äù and stressed that ‚Äúnothing goes up in a straight line.‚Äù This past Saturday, Plan B further discussed the infamous death cross pattern in the BTC/USD chart and remained optimistic.**

**Then on Sunday, Plan B gave an update on his ‚Äúworst-case scenario for 2021.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúBitcoin is below $34K, triggered by Elon Musk‚Äôs energy FUD and China‚Äôs mining crackdown,‚Äù Plan B tweeted. ‚ÄúThere is also a more fundamental reason that we see weakness in June, and possibly July. My worst-case scenario for 2021 (price/on-chain based): Aug&gt;47K, Sep&gt;43K, Oct&gt;63K, Nov&gt;98K, Dec&gt;135K,‚Äù the analyst added.**

 **Of course, Plan B make sure that people read his tweet carefully when people asked if they should disregard his model. ‚ÄúPlease read my tweet more carefully,‚Äù Plan B replied. ‚ÄúI said this is a worst-case scenario, not a base case, let alone best case. I am still on the S2FX track for my base case. I have explained my personal (non)selling strategy in several interviews,‚Äù he added. Furthermore, someone asked Plan B: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the more fundamental reason?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúGreat question. I \[intend\] to publish later this year,‚Äù the analyst replied. Additionally, the popular bitcoin dubbed ‚ÄúParabolic Trav‚Äù said that he likes a bearish Plan B tweet and said ‚ÄúBullish.‚Äù Plan B also responded to Parabolic Trav‚Äôs statement and said:**

 **Plan B: ‚ÄòBitcoin Distribution Looks a Lot Healthier Now‚Äô**

**Plan B is a popular analyst and has more than 570,000 Twitter followers. The stock-to-flow price model has also grown in popularity during the last 12 months and it is referenced often in technical analysis. Plan B has been getting a lot more criticism in recent times since bitcoin‚Äôs price has been dropping lower. The sell-off, Plan B said this weekend, has led to better bitcoin distribution.**

**‚Äú60% of bitcoins sold in May-June were bought in March-April and sold at a loss,‚Äù Plan B wrote. ‚Äú40% was bought earlier and sold at a profit. Of total 18.7M bitcoins \~2,5M bitcoins are bought at**

The current upward pressure is around 33200-33000, and the lower support is around 31000-31500. When you enter the market, don‚Äôt expect too much rebound. Once the market shows a sharp decline, it will take one day to repair. Therefore, it is still the main operation to continue the short, and you can save it for future consideration for the time being. It is not suitable for buying at present. Rising, there is no need to blindly buy the bottom in a contrarian market, it is of little significance; Bitcoin operation strategy: 1. BTC price touches the empty near 33500-33400, stop loss 33950, the target is near 31500-31000, and the breakthrough is near 29000-29500; 2. The price of BTC touched more than 31000-30500, the stop loss was 29700, and the target was around 32500-32800

I sold it at 50k because overbullishness, greed and overconfidence that we will get to 100-200k by the end of the year. That was the best thing I could have done. I still believe BTC will retest prior lows and probably break it below, but I have stop buy set at the price I'm comfortable with, and I will take that stop only if the market sentiments and volume on the price pumps rises.  


On the other hand, my friend who has always been a diamond hands (held his crypto through the 2018 - 2020 bear market and did DCA) is now anxious and regretting for not taking any profits in this bull market, but rather he will probably have to wait for another few years to see some actual and significant profits.  


Taking profits is not paper hands. I'm not smarter than any of you. I just took out some profits . However, if you are at loss now, don't sell it but rather do DCA. Or if you want to cut your losses, there is also nothing wrong with selling now. But do you own research - Don't listen to the moonbois, read this subreddit ""new posts"" to see if people are overconfident/scared,/anxious/greedy or whatever emotion that might tell you the sentiment. It will probably play out the opposite of the sentiment.  


Currently people are encouraging each other to hodl, that we will soon se new ATH, people are taking loans to invest in crypto, invest all of their savings into it, posting every good news and trying to spark a FOMO fire but the price still drops and rises on low volume etc.

o7x1vy,alclab,Some of you need to read this.,"There is currently a BIG effort by governments (specially China and the USA) to try to kill or severly hamper BTC and other forms of Crypto.

Taking the money printing power away from them in currency and a store of value that is decentralized, unhackable, fast, reliable and universally accepted spells really bad news for them.

The current price drops are prodcuts of this (there are already many posts detailingf the massive shorts). We will see MANY more attacks in th efuture and a whole lot of FUD. (my ""classic"" financial news sources and analyses have been full of it the last week when they would't even acknowledge it's existence before).

If you put more money into it that you require for your daily life for the next 6 months or more, it's gonna be pretty rough. Reconsider just putting in what you want to save for HODLing for 2+ years.

Remember 1 BTC =1 BTC. If you believe BTC will hold it's value in the long run, then just forget about it. In 5 years you can check back and find you can afford a whole lot.

The news always focuses on the negative aspects for BTC but governments (specially CHina) has never liked Bitcoin.

The reality is:

* BTC is now legal tender in some countries with more to come.
* Financial institutions have invested in BTC.
* There is a much wider awareness of the ""common folk"" of what BTC is and they want to get into it but fear they are ""too late"" (spoiler, they're not).
* Companies are starting to buy BTC and other Crypto (mainly ETH) to hold as an investment and crucially as a store of cvalue to hedge against hgeavy rising inflation.
* INflation in the world is going to unseen levels in many couuntries due to so much printing and the effect of the USD on other currencies will create a domino printing effect. They can and will continue to print a LOT of money while BTC is only a finite amount hich is known to all.
* We are still at least 2 and a half years away from the next halving (which will increase the value even more).
* China banning mining is great news for everyone but the chinese miners.
* No one person or group has control of BTC supply (no one can create more).
* It has broken it's biggest obstacle: People have given faith and value to BTC in spite of it being ""just code"" and not a physical token created by a bank. The acceptance of BTC will not recede, it will only gain in time.

My point is: If you understand and think about it rationally, BTC has surpassed all the previous attempts and the facts are there of it's continued growth, acceptance and use. The previos gains in the year were proof of it and it will skyrocket once the conditions are set for it. If you can HODL for what you have, you will have done your future self an incredible favor, but don't invest what you need or will need in your daily life as that creates a lot of anxiety which makes people check like crazy and suffer a dip to 35,000 without realizing the valu it had just a year prior.",1624656660,13,1

JP Morgan interviewed their own investors and they said they would not buy bitcoin at 50k to 60k because of this stagnation of capital, the price of bitcoin will have trouble reaching back to 50k by December. 

Given bitcoin's supply inflation and the $2 trillion market cap mark, I could see the 100k mark taking another 3-4 years. For bitcoin to even reach 100k at the end, there has to be a large buy-in from wealthy retail investors and institutional support. Right now we are lacking significant institutional support and even though banks like Citibank have opened up crypto assets, it's still a long way off. Wealthy retail investors tend to be older and more cautious, so they are not willing to throw in their weight at 50k-60k after seeing the massive price drop in the last 2 months.",1624642825,12,1

o6vxya,pjman7,Please help me speculate on the 2021 Bull Run top. How would you calculate it using the data I provided?," 

As the Title reads I am trying to guess what the 2021 bullrun top for Bitcoin might be based off historical data.

This bullrun cycle is acting like the 2013 bullrun where where had 2 tops and 2 crashes. Based off 2013 and the top and bottom of the 1st top for 2021 I want to try to guess what the 2nd top will be.

Here is my data - I assume in my data that the bottom of the first top for 2021 took place the other day when bitcoin hit 28600 obviously if we go below that this weekend it would change the outcome.

The Known:

2013 Double Top

10-20-11 through 4-10-13 Bullrun top1 from $2.22 to $259.34 a 11,581.98% Increase

7-6-13 through 11-30-13 Bullrun top2 from $63 to $1163 a 1,746% Increase

2021 Double Top ??

12-15-19 through 4-14-21 Bullrun top1 from $3,122.28 to $64,895.22 a 1,978% Increase

6-22-21 through ??? Sept 23? Bullrun top2 from $28,600 to $$ ?? a ??% Increase

How would you use the data above to calculate the 2021 Bull run top?

the two numbers I have gotten is a $291,020 or $103,878.30

First is based off the % difference between the 2013 tops and use the 2021 Top1 to Calculate top2 there is a 348.66% difference from $259.34 vs $1163

Second is based off the percent difference of percentages based off 2013 top1 and 2021 top1 using that to find the percent of top2 and use that to calculate the 2nd top for 2021. which is a -84.9249% difference from 2013 top1 vs 2021 top1 so -84.9249% of 1746% is 263.211%",1624519696,20,1

I've spent about $400 over nearly 20 transactions with an average transaction greater than $20. My total bitcoin rewards equals 5,119 sats valued at $1.68 today. My total rewards percentage isn't even 0.4%.

It's easy to understand why when you review the probabilities associated with the latest wheel:

[https://blog.foldapp.com/fold-card-volcano-wheel-june-2021/](https://blog.foldapp.com/fold-card-volcano-wheel-june-2021/)

There's only a 3.1001% chance you'll receive a reward greater than 0.25% back on your purchase.

What am I missing here? Why so much praise when the only real benefit is that rewards, however insignificant, are valued in bitcoin? I genuinely want this card and team to succeed, but so far I am disappointed.",1624517081,8,1

These mechanisms allow the industry as a whole to adapt, grow and prosper, and all in a decentralized nature. The following guide breaks down the difference between a hard fork and a soft fork: [The Difference Between A Hard Fork And A Soft Fork](https://www.oobit.com/blog/the-difference-between-a-hard-fork-and-a-soft-fork/)

The biggest difference between a hard a soft forks is the backward-compatibility. With hard forks, the network is split into two and users need to pick which network they want to continue with. With soft forks, the network‚Äôs rules are updated but the chains can co-exist and older nodes (ones that have not updated) can still participate in verifying transactions. In soft forks, users are generally unaware of the updates and can continue to use the network and cryptocurrency as usual.",1624509813,0,1
o6tim1,bfeeny,Shorting should require someone to stake the coins,"In stocks and bitcoin, assets sitting on exchange can be made available by the exchange to others for shorting.  With some stock brokerages you can specify that your shares cannot be lent out, or you can put in a limit order at some ridiculous price level so that now the shares are locked up.  With BTC obviously you can move your money out of the exchange and into storage, but so many do not.

The process should be different.  For both stocks and for coins.  You should have to stake the asset to make it available, and then at least some of the interest should be paid to you for doing so.  Obviously these assets will not be available to you to trade while staked.

It seems like the honest way to do things.  Otherwise you end up with naked shorting and lots of shady stuff.  Because so much coin sits on exchanges, shorts will always be able to just sell, sell, sell, and bring the price down and then cover, rinse, repeat.  As long as there are people that will pick up these lower prices so the shorts can cover it will keep happening.  

The other problem is there is no buying momentum.  So you just have shorts shorting, and opportunistic buyers.  You could make the argument that coins moved ‚ÄúFrom weak hands to strong hands‚Äù, so eventually it will all come to a support level, but the reality is, whatever ‚Äúhands‚Äù bought the coins just keep them on the exchange in many cases, so they are just continuously available to keep being shorted‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..it never ends.",1624508848,6,1

o6rk1d,IDontUseRedditXD,Found this guy's flash drive and wallet.dat file in my house,"I asked my mom if she had any USB  drives laying around. She gave me one she says she bought for my brother  that he used for school. I plugged it in and sat there for a moment  wondering why there was a ""PS4"" folder (no one in my family has a  playstation), and also who this guy is (My family is white.) Then I saw  the dat file which I immediately recognized as a bitcion or crypto  wallet.

All the files are from  around 2016 which is when my brother started school. The ""immunization  record form"" is blank but it has a University of Maryland header which is the same school my brother went to. I guess somehow he ended up with  this guy's flash drive without realizing it and the drive, and possibly  this guy's crypto, has been sitting in a drawer in our house ever since.

Oh, and there's malware on it from a cracked game he torrented. I clicked on a folder and windows defender recognized  some scary looking malware to which I almost shit myself over. I'd go  through it more but would rather not have it connected to my computer  considering I don't know whose it is or how it got in our house.

Anyone know him tho

Today $ 1 USD = 3,179,435.00 Bolivar. Unlike other countries, Venezuela has actually embraced bitcoin because their national currency is worthless. 

Countries like China are trying to restrict bitcoin through crackdowns, though it is not illegal to possess it. They consider converting the yuan to bitcoin money laundering which is a criminal charge that can land people in prison. They are actually all in for blockchain technology, but only a central banked coin issued by the CCP. 

In this worldwide recession with rising inflation rates, its understandable why ppl are putting their money away into crypto, but the reality is that central banks are being threatened. They will try to influence the markets with the hope of bitcoin crashing.",1624757074,22,1

Hello ,

I've created this project inspired by the work of Einstein , Satoshi Nakamoto and the movie In time . a combination of a meme and a serious project to make Time a universal currency.

Official Time on mainnet : [https://time.market](https://www.time.market/)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/goznsg1ifp771.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad5624847b4f96d50933238bea847d9ee1889d7b

What is $TIME?

Inspired by the movie ""In Time"" , Time has become the universal currency, transferred directly between people or stored in ""time capsules"" ( wallets )

How ?

Time-keepers distribute TIME Every one elapsed day ( 86400 sec ).

They are incentivized by every second after a day expires. It's not about how much resources they use to mine but by how much incentive they may lose

Once the Time is distributed, the crowd can buy it from the Time Bank ( the time source ) then traded in secondary markets.",1624755174,0,1

Given the current positive trends regarding Bitcoin (institutions, financial elites and governments of small countries warming up to it) despite the China and Elon nonsense, I and many others project the adoption/desirability of Bitcoin as well as the (fiat) price of 1 Bitcoin to skyrocket within the next 5-10 years. By that point, you will have entered a small elite of super wealthy individuals who got there because they took a risk today; owning 1 BTC will put you in not be in the top 1% financially, but top 0.1%. 

It's only a matter of time before the current financial system (which is currently creaking off of the legacy reputation of the United States and US Dollar) grinds to a halt during this crisis period and we have to reinvent it entirely. I imagine the reinvention of the financial system will be one based on a digital currency that is limited in quantity and that no single government controls, with Bitcoin being the prime candidate.

$65k to $30k is the dip. Start buying and stop talking about the hypothetical lower price you‚Äôre going to buy at. Some broken record advice‚Ä¶ DCA.

Some people do leverage trading, as in used borrowed money in the hopes of amplifying their returns. As a collateral they must own at least 30% of the asset. This is called margin trading and some platforms can charge 6% interest. When the price of bitcoin goes down significantly and the borrower has no money or feels pressured, the borrower then has to sell all of their bitcoin.

Massive liquidations can happen due to large leverage tradings. In that same process, people who buy too high stand to lose over 50-60% of their money in a period of a week.",1624740252,18,1

I am guessing this will be a somewhat different post, and quite the long one as well. Hope you find it interesting and a nice addition to your own confirmation bias as to why Bitcoin is and will be lifechanging. Also, thank you for reading.

# First, a couple of caviats;

\- I am not a Bitcoin OG. I didn't know about it in 2013. I hated it in 2017. I FOMOed in 2018. I was surprised in 2020. And I love and understand it in 2021.

\- I am not a financial advisor, and I am speaking on behalf of the company I own which employs just south of 20 people.

\- We don't have a massive treasury and are inexperienced as a company investing in assets and other instruments

\- English is not my mother tongue, so bear with me.

\- Fuck you Elon.

In this piece I'll do my best and explain from a small corporate perspective why accumulating Bitcoin became part of the corporate strategy and unanimously accepted by the general assembly.

# Next, some background to who we are as a company

I founded the marketing agency back in 2017 and we quickly hired alot of people and attracted great clients. Our work is a combination of video production, copywriting, graphic design, web, podcast and everything social media. Basically, we are a marketing department that our clients ""subscribe"" to for 12 months with certain limitations for a fixed price. Our projected revenue 2021 EOY is about 2,5M USD.

We are known for being provacative, experimental and the ""go-to-place"" for small B2B companies to jumpstart their marketing game.

Again, our business model is not very scalable. It's human trafficking (it's a joke!!!) - we need one guy or gal to do some work, and that work can only be done so many times in a day. If we want to do more of that work, we need to hire a new guy or gal and so on. And if you don't have BCG or McKinsey in your logo - the ability to scale on premium price is very difficult as well. The avarage profit margin in Norway in our industry is about 3-4%. Eeeew. The ""only"" way to make big buck with this kind of business model is either scale massively on people, price or both. The cost that makes up about 85% of the total, is rent for office space and labour cost, so it requires alot to make that happen. It's very risky to scale an agency business with people if you don't have alot of cash on hand - which we don't have.

We've been in business like I said since 2017 and so far we have not made a meaningful profit yet. We have OK salaries, but that's it. We are smart, creative and driven people - so the salary, even though it is OK, it is not extremely good. And we do want to create a company that can pay out significant dividends to make up for the struggle of building, running and owning a company. With current model, that seems to be a stretch medium-term.

# The Pandemic Gave Perspective On Things

Like most other places, within a week from March 9th to March 12th of 2020, the semantics went from ""yeye, I don't care"", to; ""OMFG"". It literally turned most of our business upside down and was a really chaotic experience. The unthinkable paradox happened; everyone wanted to sell something, but none wanted to buy anything. Except fucking toilet paper.

Marketing, and especially external marketing consultants, is not business critical to everyone, maybe even anyone, during a world crisis. And obviously we faced a lot of pushback from our clients. So we are grateful that most stayed with us, but some left. Leaving our business extremely volnurable as we don't have the liquidity to simply shut down.

A few months in during the pandemic, my partner told me: ""Dude, Bitcoin just hit 30k"". We had been speculating somewhat back in 2017 and found crypto to be somewhat interesting, but at the same time a piece of shit idea. And I remember thinking to myself that we were going to see another meltdown like never before with crypto. But, then I started reading about it. I read about Michael Saylor, Tesla's purchase, banks recruiting experts, ETF's trying to be accepted, Queen Cathie Woods, white papers, Cointelegraph, Bitcoin Magazine and so on. Not only that, but our very own Kjell Inge R√∏kke (one of Norway's wealthiest) just put 60 million dollars in it and started a crypto company.

I am not the smartest guy in the crypto room, but these guys are - and now I was on my journey of juggling a struggling company during the pandemic, firing bad people and also putting in the first 1000 hours of understanding Bitcoin, the money system and how this will be adopted as a revolutionary technology 5-10 years from now.

And then I realized...

# Why Bitcoin Is Not A Risky Bet (for us)

I've done several bad hires - actually a couple to many because of my own naivity. During the worst period of corona last year we knew that we had 4 bad hires in our organization. That is pretty significant as we were only 15 employees at the time.

This might be a controversial line, but hiring **bad** people is a zero-sum game in which the employee is the winner and the employer is the loser. A bad hire is the true Rat Poison Squared as the faggot would say.

Now, most of you I assume live in the US and I live in Norway. Two completely different hiring/firing laws. In Norway, you simply can't fire someone ""just because"". Making the bad hire outcome even worse, since the process of firing someone that don't create any value for the company is a tedious process - time consuming, energy draining, lawyer fees and always a ""settlement package"" including minimum 3 months of salary. I know of entrepreneur peers that simply went bankrupt because of a few bad hires early on that just dragged the process so long that the company didn't have any liquidity left. And yes, I agree that the employer has a responsibility of not making those mistakes. But, come on bro.

The point I'm trying to make here is that if you have made a bad hire; it is like watching your stock go from whatever price to 0. It literally is a 100% loss. And the chances of getting even the slightest amount of value from a bad hire is also near 0%. Bad hire bad. Good hire good.

So I thought to myself at first in winter 2021. What if we trim our agency to become a truly premium business, work on upskilling people, and invest in what we already have and add a few seniors to our team, and then re-invest the hypotethically cost of bad hires in Bitcoin? Either we double in size and go from about 20 people to 40 and making 5M revenue with 10% margin and along the way waste a shit ton of money on bad hires. Because, trust me, bad hires comes with volume in recruiting. There is no way past it.

Or we invest and accumulate Bitcoin and dream about a 10x return within the next 4-5 years with alot less company risk, governance, stress and hazzle. I liked the latter idea so much that I wanted to pursue it as a core strategy for our company and change my role from being just a ""CEO"" to Master of Coin. A fun ego boost as well.

I needed to convince the group of equity partners and also the small board we have. And I'd like to share with you guys how I did it.

Researchers start by looking at the bitcoin network‚Äôs daily ‚Äúhashrate‚Äù‚Äîi.e., how quickly computers on the network can perform calculations. Then they make some assumptions about the computer equipment most miners are using.1 Throw in an estimate of average electricity prices and the latest price for bitcoin, and you can get an accurate, if imprecise, estimate of electricity consumption. The most reputable such estimate comes from the University of Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, according to which the global bitcoin network currently consumes about 80 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, roughly equal to the annual output of 23 coal-fired power plants, or close to what is consumed by the nation of Finland.",1624909592,20,1

If I had that much wealth, wouldn't I just start accumulating Bitcoin (yes I know there is risk, but let's be real, seems that the sentiment of Bitcoin is bullish as long as you HODL long-term 10-30-100 years).

I think the poor and underprivileged deserve a chance to improve their lives and I am not opposed to helping them out.  However, I am against Bitcoin because it's obviously a scam. 

Eventhough I don't really know how it works or how to use it, I have the feeling that it will not improve the world or make it a better place.  I think I know what it is enough to judge it without needing to learn about it because the name sounds simple. 

It's a coin on the internet. 

Eventhough I will never pretend to know how physics, neuroscience or chemistry work, I know how bitcoin works without needing to learn about it.  Eventhough I have no experience with decentralized systems, cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, or money itself, I have enough experience with scams and empty promises to know that Bitcoin is a scam.  

I do think I am smarter than most people. Most people don't believe in Bitcoin. I , like 99% of the population, think Bitcoin is a scam and only morons would buy it. Because we are smart, we won't get scammed.  

We don't need Bitcoin because it is not backed by anything. My money is backed by a government. I can trust my government because all governments are trustworthy and never print out too much money that will devalue our currency. 

This is why house prices have been the same for the past 100 years, and are affordable for everyone. This is how my parents bought this house for us 50 years ago. Now if we sell it, we can make half a million dollars. This is thanks to the government. 

Bitcoin is backed by what? It's backed by nothing. There is no government, no bank, no institution or company behind it. It's just a bunch of computers. Computers are untrustworthy. You can't trust a computer. Computers crash. They malfunction. You can trust the government because people are more trustworthy and uncorruptable.

And don't even mention the fossil fuels used by Bitcoin itself. This is just ridiculous. I don't want to be part of that. I don't want to contribute to destroying the planet. I consider myself a person who cares and protects the planet that's why I only use electric cars and eat organic. 

Eventhough I understand poor people can't afford anything because their savings get devalued every year, I think their problems will be solved once they get a real job and work harder. Then they can retire in the house their parents bought them and contribute to our cause by getting their own electric cars.

Why do we even need to waste so much energy on Bitcoin when we have banks? Banks don't use up fossil fuels. 

I have the feeling that the Bitcoin community is just full of greedy people who only care about making money. In my opinion, and in the opinion of almost everyone I know, only greedy people would buy something like that.

I don't have any experience. And I don't care about Bitcoin. It's irrelevant to my life. I won't use it and I don't want to use it.",1624908676,88,1

Firstly, on the Bitcoin 1 day chart, we see a falling wedge pattern getting formed. As we know the falling wedge is a bullish pattern. Yesterday, we broke above the falling wedge and today we are treating the top line of the wedge as a support. If we can confirm it as a support, the target for Bitcoin will be approximately $40,000. But before reaching $40K, there are a lot of resistances. The first resistance is at the level of $35,000 which has been acting as a resistance for the past few days. If we break above the $35k, then the 20 day simple moving average which is at $35, 750 will act as a string resistance. If we cross above that, then the 50 day simple moving average which is at $38k approximately will be the next hurdle before reaching $40K. And once we reach $40K, the 200 day Simple moving average will be the strongest resistance.

Secondly, on the Bitcoin 4 hours chart, we see a double bottom pattern getting formed which is also a bullish pattern. The neck line for this pattern is close to $35,500 level. If we break above it, then our target could be $40,000. But, as mentioned earlier there are several resistances before we reach $40K.

Lastly, on the Bitcoin Monthly chart, we notice that the level of $30,112 is a very critical support and breaking below it can take Bitcoin price to about $20,000. So, its very important that we close this month above the aforementioned price.",1624907155,0,1

Bitcoin.com Exchange is thrilled to announce the listing of SENT, being available to trade on the 23rd June 2021 at 10:00AM UTC.

Meanwhile, in five days the network‚Äôs mining difficulty change is approaching and it could see the difficulty drop over 20%.
Statistics show that bitcoin (BTC) miners are processing blocks a lot faster, as the hashrate has improved during the last 48 hours. On June 26, 2021, the network‚Äôs hashrate jumped back above the 100 EH/s zone.
The hashrate fell to 91 EH/s on June 23, 2021, following the crackdowns in China stemming from five Chinese provinces with the most recent being Sichuan. Between then and over the last three days, the hashrate has increased 9-13%The next mining difficulty drop is expected to happen in five days and at current processing power, it could drop around 20.57%. At the time of writing, the network‚Äôs mining difficulty is 19.93 trillion and the change could bring it to 15.83 trillion next week.
Bitcoin‚Äôs mining difficulty is essentially the measurement of how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target. When Bitcoin‚Äôs hashrate is high, the difficulty will increase, and when the hashrate drops like it did after China‚Äôs crackdown, the mining difficulty will drop lower. Therefore making it easier and harder to mine BTC with every fluctuation. Bitcoin‚Äôs network difficulty changes every 2,016 blocks or roughly every two weeks.

The top five bitcoin (BTC) mining pools on June 26, 2021, include Antpool, F2pool, Viabtc, Binance Pool, and Poolin. Those five mining pools capture 62.83% of the Bitcoin hashrate, while the rest is processed by 11 known pools and a 7.49% portion of mystery hashrate.
The next difficulty change seems to be pointing toward the largest mining difficulty drop in 2021 thus far. The network did see the largest difficult rise in 2021, with an approximate 21.53% increase, at block height 683,424 on May 13.",1624905423,4,1

oatsm0,Ssident3338,First decentralized blacklist. Are you tired of bots and scams?,"# Problem

## Front running bot

Bot and front-running bot is becoming an obsession of market participants crypto DEX. 

Especially for new tokens, every transaction that has the potential to increase the token price is caught by front running bots. Make investors lose money right after the trade. 

This makes investors afraid to participate in the DEX market, and it has hindered the development of the DEX market in particular and the crypto market in general.

## Hacking in DEFI

From 2018 to now, every year dozens of hacks occur with billions of dollars in damage to the community.

Since it is a decentralized application, these wallet addresses are all without anything to stop it. Current hacks are still happening daily, crashing projects and investors have lost a lot of money.

## Phishing projects

Phishing projects are also becoming increasingly popular. That also hinders the development of the whole market. Scam projects should not have appeared. Owners of scam projects after withdrawing money are still cavalier without anyone being able to do anything.

Blockchain is transparency, anonymity, but by no means fraud, hacking, and illegal profiteering. We need solutions to stop these things.

# Solution

We have implemented a solution and proposed to make it a new standard for ERC20, BEP20, ERC721 tokens, and exchanges, farming, games, dapps **Decentralized blacklist**.   Constantly updating and adding ""black"" addresses to the list is very expensive (needs a lot of transaction gas fees). And each project also needs to keep a close eye on the market developments of the hacks to be able to update in time, which is also a very difficult thing. Front running bots also need an automatic scanning and updating system to be able to stop them in time.

Unity is a strength, if a blacklist of addresses is centrally managed in a smart contract and other projects use them together, it will save a lot of costs, manpower, and data is also updated, continuously updated.

### üî• Bot hunter

Bothunter is our blockchain data collection and scanning system. We collect and analyze all transactions on famous exchanges like uniswap, pancake swap, ... and automatically detect the front-running transactions bot. (the list is updated here (link). this list will be automatically added to the blacklist in smart contract.

### üî• Report

Our website has a function to report phishing addresses, hacker addresses. People can visit here (link) and report those addresses. To be accepted, you need to provide enough evidence of the attack or Scams  

### üî• Manual

Our team always closely monitors developments of the market, press, news channels. As soon as a hack or scam occurs, the relevant addresses of the hacker, scammer will be put on the blacklist.

oatpe0,OpinionsAreUseless,All Money is an illusion.,"Money, Currency, Assets, physical gold or digital coins! 

Money in any form is never real, and never has been or will be.

Labour in kind for goods is civilisation! 

Overpopulation and globalisation of commerce has made people labour for a type of money! More people, more jobs, more jobs more specified areas of jobs. More specified areas of jobs means more jobs to manage those.

The only reason over-popularisation has a footing is because we allow it being forced on us. 
We have the land globally to produce endless amounts of food, we have the tech and transport to configure and easily work a global system of essential goods.

We have science that is so advanced we can produce lab grown meat. 

Politics and corruption have made it as hard as they can push to see how easy life could be and replace it with money.


Im no socialist or anything else. I enjoy logic, we need a globally agreed value of something to travel and trade, but it doesn‚Äôt have to have control by a few, or be classed as money of wealth. There really is a less than 1% of population globally who own over 99% of everything.

There is no poor nations, only nations that have been exploited by wealthier ones for their metals, minerals, or worse forced labour.

The world needs to change, and carbon neutral companies parading like bohemian gods won‚Äôt get the job done.

Nationalism is fine, pride is fine, anger is fine, in fact anything you have learnt beside self-preservation and the instinctual fear of imbalance, often a falling sensation, IS LEARNT!

Bitcoin couLd be the closest thing we have seen as yet to become anything close to a globally recognised, globally transferable at speeds unthinkable of wealth before ( aka gold being shipped across an ocean) 

The entire world has untold amounts of beliefs and traditional values. 

No one entity will ever control the globe. 
It has been proven throughout our history, time and time again. 

Fundamental shifts in humanity have happened almost regularly for the past 2000 years.
0bc/ad roman empire
500ad dark ages and confusion establishment of power from the lack kf roman control.
1000ad fuedalism
1500ad church control
2000ad - shit so far. Fear and self importance has got use fucked up.

This is a civilisation shift to a digital world. Do some looking. What was thought to be sci-fi star trek shit is becoming a reality for us at exponential rates.

In short, 
Bitcoin isn‚Äôt perfect, but what is?
It works and can be used without corruption by the 99% if the 99% of people wanted it to. Belief in anything is everything.

If you never see with your own eyes something you think is true, you are in belief of what has been told. 

The world is changing fast and we all believe in something in everything.",1625045437,17,1

I believe that in order for Bitcoin to be more valuable, you should be able to get more Bitcoin by investing in Bitcoin without relying on dollars.

Because I want to use bitcoins in the real economy, but when bitcoins decrease, I have to buy them again in dollars, so I don't use bitcoins.

Here's an example in dollars:

\- When you deposit money in a bank, you get 2% interest per year

\- When a stock rises by 50%, from $1,000 to $1,500

oapvee,lictlict,We need a Decentralized On-Chain Bitcoin Lobby.,"Serious proposal here...

Political and regulatory concerns are currently the biggest impediments to wider Bitcoin adoption. The problem is there are a bunch of geriatric gate-keepers that seem incapable of understanding Bitcoin, and they are standing in it's way. Typically an ""industry group"" will form lobby to address key issues, grease the right palms &amp; schmooze the right politicians and their ilk. Two examples immediately come to mind (if there's more please share).  The problem is that both of these groups represent ***Big-Crypto******^(TM)***  and not the average ***Bitcoin User******^(PLEB)******,*** ***and neither*** is focused on Bitcoin exclusively.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Crypto Council for Innovation**](https://cryptoforinnovation.org/) \- The Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) is a global alliance of crypto industry leaders with a mission to demonstrate the transformational promise of crypto and communicate its benefits to policymakers, regulators, and people around the globe.

   **SUPPORTERS** \- [Coinbase, Paradigm, Fidelity &amp; Square](https://cryptoforinnovation.org/#supporters)

&amp;#x200B;

[**Blockchain Association**](https://theblockchainassociation.org/) \- We are the Blockchain Association, a member led, member driven organization dedicated to improving the public policy environment for crypto networks.

   **MEMBERS -** [Exchanges, networks, software &amp; hardware manufactures](https://theblockchainassociation.org/members/) (basically everyone except Coinbase, Paradigm, Fidelity &amp; Square)

&amp;#x200B;

Since both of these lobbying groups represent ***Big-Crypto******^(TM)*** and not the average **Bitcoin User****^(PLEB)** ,  I seriously doubt they have your best interest in mind. I know everyone has some affinity with at least SOME of these companies, but they are still **for-profit** operations and they will lobby toward their own interests and goals, not Bitcoin's, and certainly not *yours.*

# How about creating a Decentralized Bitcoin Lobby that is:

**1.** **Funded by Bitcoin Users****^(PLEB)** 

\- Operations will be sustained via BTC donations from anyone 

\- Larger donations do not buy a louder voice or more control over operations

&amp;#x200B;

2. **Directed by Bitcoin Users****^(PLEB)**  

\- Only addresses donating more than *(x)* BTC can vote by sending 2 Sats for YES or 1 Sat for NO for any given proposal (we can argue about that threshold in just a bit) 

\- Only one vote per donor address (consensus reqs TBD by community)

&amp;#x200B;

3. **Completely Decentralized &amp; On-Chain**

\- It' is effectively a non-profit LLC run off cascading multi-sig smart-contracts

\- Hyper-minimal overhead (staff &amp; OPS budgets) needed, but basically only for paperwork  

\- Donor-votes determine the lobbying issue/agenda, and lobbyists (*whoever*) can apply to *champion* the approved issue/agenda for a given BTC reward. Donors must reach a consensus on awarding the job to the most qualified candidate per issue/agenda. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know there are a lot of holes, but there are smarter people that I here that could help fill in the gaps. 

Some unanswered question I already see are...

1. How do we limit voting to a unique donating-individual without needing KYC or some other de-anonymizing process?  How do we prevent someone from creating 1000 wallets and sending the minimum donation threshold from each to buy 999 more votes? 
2. How do we build consensus mechanisms to dictate the proposal of new issues/agendas to lobby  for that best represent the average *Bitcoin User**^(PLEB)* or Bitcoin's ethos at large?
3. How do we manage scoping, approval &amp; awarding of contracts to the best qualified candidates (lobbyists), and not to the lowest bidders, or an unfaithful actor? 
4. How do we create an LLC entirely run off Bitcoin smart-contracts (or another purpose-built block-chain) to manage a hyper-minimal full-time staff that relies on the donor-voting consensus to implement their job duties? 
5. How do we ensure decentralization, anonymity &amp; dedication to the plight of the average *Bitcoin User**^(PLEB)* *?*

I am but a lowly pleb, but I'm begging those smarter than I to make this happen. 

Call it the ‚Çøecentralobby...IDK.

oao5ov,Eco-Chamber,Is there a point of functional impossibility?,So to premise this post. I am a firm believer in Bitcoin and in the disruption or rather the ascension it has in the financial world. So my question is this and this is something I've been pondering about. As you all are very aware of; many Bitcoins have been locked in unreachable wallets or lost in destroyed laptops etc. With the rescent news of the passing of a Bitcoin billionaire one can imagine that now those Bitcoins are lost forever as well. So is there a point when there are too few Bitcoin that the population wouldn't find a functional use for the token? I am aware that Bitcoin practically can be divided into infinite amounts in Satoshis but then where does that leave any remaining Bitcoin and it's purpose on the planet. I've researched that atleast 25% of Bitcoin are lost so what happens if that number becomes 75% or such? In the future will the population just not find a use case for Bitcoin due to the low availability or will the holders of Bitcoin practically be in the Elysium space station above Earth and the non holders in the wasteland below?,1625022320,7,1

What are your thoughts on bitcoins price once the dust settles? Will it go back to what it was previously after the 2017 bull cycle and range around $5000 or will it range a lot higher this time around?

Most traded National Currencies for Bitcoin are **Tether (USD stable coin), Won (South Korea), and Yen (Japan).** Most of Tether volume comes from **China** because the direct purchase of Bitcoin is banned in China. **Euro and Pound**, however, only account for less than 6% of total Bitcoin Demand. 

**Conclusion: Bitcoin is mainly popular in Asia.**

So Why do Asians love Bitcoin?

The Answer is quite simple and intuitive.

Asians love Bitcoin because Asians love computers (digital). When the Mainstream media showed Bitcoin as actual gold coins, many Asians fell for this advertisement of ""Digital Gold."" It's similar to how many Asians prefer Anime (Bitcoin) over real life (gold). In other words, Asians are the ones who are mostly buying Bitcoin (Digital Anime gold) because they love digital and anime.",1622780661,4,1

I just finished buying up this dip, and want a place to keep my BTC and hold for decades while allowing it to work for me while growing in value. Earning APY on Bitcoin, in Bitcoin, seems like a no-fucking-brainer.

I know there are risks. Risk is a function of yield. But the risk I‚Äôm concerned about it is losing my actual Bitcoin - not market pricing or fluctuations. 

I understand BlockFi‚Äôs custodian is Gemini, and I understand Gemini is about as safe and secure as custodian services get. 

Am I unreasonable to think it‚Äôs fairly safe and low risk to park Bitcoins (plural) with BlockFi? I could do Celsius and Nexo, and split it all up - that would get me much higher yield - but both Celsius and Nexo are based in other countries and I‚Äôm concerned about regulation coming that may make my Bitcoin sitting on an international storage device a problem.

Has anyone given long term storage on a hot wallet, in an interest earning account, deep though? I‚Äôd love some perspectives.

Thanks in advance,",1622777269,37,1

By banning I mean closing down exchanges, stopping companies from accepting Bitcoin, and arresting/prosecuting anyone caught making transactions or holding Bitcoin, since they can't really ""ban"" Bitcoin. 

My questions stems from the recent Elon Musk fiasco and China banning the mining of Bitcoin as well as the crash relating to it. The crash clearly shows that the majority of the population is (pardon my language) completely stupid, as they blindly follow other people without doing proper research beforehand and if the U.S government bans Bitcoin like I explained in the paragraph above, the majority will just accept it and won't risk holding Bitcoin due to the fear of getting prosecuted. Won't this result in the U.S government winning as they can technically say that they didn't ban crypto, instead made it legal tender by creating their own ""perfect coin"" and are just banning the rest of the cryptocurrency because they might mislead people or some other similar excuse.

I have a friend that I believe has been catfished on a well known dating site called Hinge. They met virtually a year ago and he slowly got her involved in crypto. Long story short, he had her transfer BTC from her CoinBase account to this address almost a year ago. He said it was a mining site and that she would 10x her money in a year. They've had a ""long distance"" relationship and still have yet to meet. I keep telling her he's a scammer and that he's just out to get her money. I believe she is totally being blinded by his loving words and text messages.

npiwl6,SuineGeniuS,30k bitcoin low of 2021- Low price history of BTC- was this the best buy point we see?,"My food for thought is this- The low for 2021 could easily make sense to be in the 30k range for BTC.

There are tons of useful charts like stock to flow, Pi Cycle, The Puell Module, etc, but the best thing to look at IMO is the lowest price of bitcoin we have seen each year.  There are variables that are unpredictable that can throw a wrench in things, but if you stick with it over time, you should get to where you need to go.  

\*\*\*This isn't investment advice.  I'm just a regular Joe who loves Crypto and data.\*\*\*

So lets dig in to a very simple analysis of the lows of Bitcoin per year.

2012: $4

2013:$13

2014: $200-  These early years were pretty wild and as adoption is growing, some bigger swings occurred.  

2015: $162

2016: $365

2017: $780

2018: $3200

2019: $3360

2020: $7100-  Bitcoin was trending you could easily argue above this level until COVID-19 hit in March. True price fell just under $4000.  I am using the value of $7100 for this hypothesis.

2021: So far $30,001.51 May 19th, 2021.

If you go with the trend and say 2017 to 2018 low was 4x, then it is somewhat reasonable to believe that $7,100 x 4.1 = around $29,000 for a low in 2021 and 2022.

\*\*\*The true price Bitcoin reached in 2020 was around the $3800 mark, so if you used this method and 4.1x you would get $15,580 for a low price expectation.\*\*\*

Hopefully, this gets you thinking and helps you set plans and goals along with many other resources.  Do your own due diligence and if you plan to HODL, make sure you can ride out the ups and downs.  Just like COVID-19 was unexpected, anything can happen, and what would you do?

Some exchanges you can use to HODL and references are available here-

Using Metcalfe's Law on the number of daily active users for bitcoin we can see BTC is currently very undervalued and has a lot of future potential! Assuming we see 2.5 million daily active users on BTC near the end of the cycle which is pretty likely, we may see a BTC price above $300K!

[Future BTC Price prediction Using Metcalfe's Law](https://preview.redd.it/p4j5fc153k271.png?width=1401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7fd2bb63a39a9211f994ecd3bf44cdfe499dd40)

**Current And Historical Analysis:**

As you can see in the short term graph, the Metcalfe's law estimate for bitcoin dropped during the crash we had a few days ago, however, the Metcalfe's law estimate is starting to rise again indicating investor confidence in Bitcoin.

Furthermore, in the third image, you can see how the deviation has been trending closer to zero and even entered the red zone where BTC was trading higher than the Metcalfe's law estimate. Now however, the deviation is increasing suggesting Bitcoin is undervalued.

**o Guide To Graph:**

**- Orange Line:** BTC Price Estimate Using Metcalfe's Law  
The green and red shaded areas do not apply to the BTC price and the BTC price estimate using Metcalfe's law  
**- Blue Line:** BTC Price Deviation From Metcalfe's Law Estimate  
If the blue line is in the green, BTC is trading lower than the Metcalfe's law estimate  
If the blue line is in the red, BTC is trading higher than the Metcalfe's law estimate

Instead they might ask for email addresses to record contributions. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this approach but it suffers from some disadvantages. Chief among forgone opportunities is that the decentralized management of stake in the company has been replaced with centralized management of an email database.

A token can act not only as a mechanism to use the technology but as a controlling share in the company. This allows the company to further decentralize top level decisions by allowing shareholders to vote in proportion of their holdings.

The voting takes place on the blockchain and is immune to pre-blockchain corruption. In this way, the issuance of a token is the very opposite of a get rich quick scam.

If in doubt about anything, do not interact with the suspected scam. Which magazine offers key advice which really summarizes the issue: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt understand a cryptocurrency or an investment, avoid it. Do not hand over any money.

 **Abstract:** Bitcoin   and  its  underlying  blockchain  protocol   have  received  recently  significant  attention  in  the  context  of   building  distributed  systems  as  well  as  from  the  perspective  of   the  foundations  of  the  consensus  problem.

Motivated  by   this,  in  this  work  we  revisit  the  formal  security  of  the  core   of  the  Bitcoin  protocol,  called  the  Bitcoin  backbone,  in  the   presence  of  an  adversary  that  has  access  to  a  scalable   quantum  computer.  We  prove  that  the  protocol's  essential   properties  stand  in  the  post-quantum  setting   assuming  a  general   quantum  adversary  with  suitably  bounded  number  of  queries  in   the  Quantum  Random  Oracle (QRO)  model.  In  order  to  achieve   this,  we  investigate   and  bound  the  quantum  complexity  of  a   Chain-of-Proofs-of-Work  search  problem  which  is  at  the  core  of   the  blockchain  protocol.  Our  results  imply  that  security  can  be   shown  by  bounding  the  quantum  queries  so  that  each  quantum   query  is  worth *O*(*p*‚àí1/2)  classical  ones   and  that   the  wait  time  for  safe  settlement  is  expanded  by  a  multiplicative  factor  of *O*(*p*‚àí1/6),  where *p*  is  the  probability  of  success  of  a  single  classical  query  to  the  protocol's  underlying  hash  function.

ns91pz,ThreeD710,Bitcoin Trading Calls,"Hello Guys,

So over the last few months, I have been working on a strategy to trade BTC/USD or BTC/USDT. And finally last month I completed my work. My calls have a accuracy rate of about 60% and the risk:reward is 1.67. So basically out of 10 calls that I would provide, 6 would hit the target and 4 would hit the stop loss, and because the risk reward is 1.67, you can expect a 600% return on the invested amount after about 10 calls.

So this is the strategy, now the trading plan is described below.

So whenever I give a call to Buy or Sell, you can take a trade at 25x leverage with a target that would return 100% of the invested amount and a stop loss of 75% of the invested amount (i.e. you would lose 75% of the invested amount if the stop loss is hit). I would explicitly provide the target and the stop loss.

I truly believe in this strategy and I know it works. Every month you can expect about 4-6 trading calls.

Whenever my indicators align, I will post the call here along with the target and the stop loss.

Please upvote so it can reach the maximum people.

And follow me so that whenever I post, you get notified.

Goodluck my friends!",1622823756,1,1

nsw2o5,Elho,Some frustrations ... 'buy the dip' - 'get rich quick',"Hello fellow hodlers

I want this off my chest.

Don't feel bad if you ""did not bought the dip"". I mean, every time it dips you read headlines all over that you have to buy the dip. If you don't have the money to buy in, it's okay. Save a little, wait until the next opportunity. Don't feel bad if you didn't. We are not institutional investors. I understand it's a big difference if you buy an extra 100.000 dollars worth of bitcoin at 30.000 dollar or 35.000 dollar. If you are a hobby investor. Relax. Investing 50 or 100 dollar at 30K or 35K bitcoin is not that much of a difference... Don't let them youtube channels / tweets / whatever mess with your mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, on a dutch newssite they featured a podcast recently about crypto gains. Young investors stating that ""investing a couple of thousand""  in a promising coin can easily guarantee you big gains on a very short time ... Okay they are right. But don't go ""gamble"" on upcoming coins; Be happy with a steady, reliable gain on triple A rating coins like those in the top 10 of coinmarketcap. Don't get greedy. They even mentioned bitcoin being not ""interesting"" for investors; The momentum passed, not much winning opportunities. I mean ?? wtf? It's not that you invest 1K into cumrocket or whatever that it makes you a protrader. Be realistic. I don't think you are helping the community out in the long term buy endorsing pump and dump coins; Yeah, i'm also talking to you Elon.

‚ÄúThe idea that bitcoin is at the mercy of the ‚Äútechnology Code of War‚Äù that is to say, will be replaced as technological innovation continues to climb parabolically, assumes that parameters we hold for things like apps and social media apply directly to money. They don‚Äôt.

So before feeling confident that some 4 month old coin, one that‚Äôs never experienced a media onslaught, never been accosted by governments, never had powerful and rich idols public condemn aspects they don‚Äôt fully understand.

nstvwy,Agnora,The fundamental importance and difference of Bitcoin over other cryptos?,"Hello. 
I've been involved with the crypto world for many years. 
Recently, talking with a good friend who also is involved, he suggested that while Bitcoin holds many important aspects that are set in stone. Such as being the window that opened up the whole world of cryptocurrency and blockchains. It was created in a crucial time where the world experienced a major crash which affected many life's. Holds a core philosophy that goes against centralized economic power. And it was born from a dream of creating a better, more just and equal society where corruption , mafia like behaviour and lies lose ground on the long run.

Having said that, and being an advocate for BTC myself, my friend posed an important question that made me think.

While BTC has all of the above supporting it, the fundamentals of the technology and real use in the physical world are getting more and more outdated by the day. With all of the new blockchain technology that is rising thanks to BTC, we are seeing more and more projects that have superior and more complex technology that serve real world scenarios. 

My friend told me that BTC will eventually cease to be the number 1 cryptocurrency and possibly might lose its value in the very long run. And other projects that are much more complex and have multiple use scenarios (not only store of value, which I think is the big use for BTC in the long run), will thrive. 

Some examples:
- BTC was once considered private and untraceable , which is no longer truth. That market is already taken over by private coins that we all know are 100% private and untraceable. 

- BTC was once used for transactions P2P without much fee costs and quite fast. That is not the case anymore, and the more wallets use it for that purpose, the higher the fees and slower the transactions. There are multiple successfull cryptos that serve this function with residual fees and are extremely fast. So that market is also already potentially taken. 

- BTC cannot have dApps built on it. That is already taken by other big projects. 

Then there are multiple other technology's that are being developed for real use scenarios and that are being adopted by the day by company's, governments, etc.. 

I told him that the core values, store of value , security and historic importance of BTC will hold its importance in the long run. And it's true that it might lose the top 1 position, due to institutions , company's and retail investors allocating more money into other projects (because of real world use cases, day by day), but BTC will always be valuable. 

I'm not a tech person , I do not understand the technology on a language level, but I understand most fundamentals from most of the top projects. 

With all honesty , this is not a post that wants to shit on BTC, nor pump other projects (thats why I purposely didn't mention any other coins so I don't get accused of marketing for them).
I just want to understand more about this topic, and also if there's a strong case for BTC being the top cryptocurrency in the long run, I want to integrate it and have arguments when presented with curious observations, such as my friends. 

Thanks for reading.",1622893210,45,1

nsttr9,cascading_disruption,"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, by Satoshi Nakamoto, 2008 / explained","    why this paper?
      consensus with byzantine participants
        like SUNDR: signed log of operations, and forks
          if agreement on log content, then agreement on state
        unlike SUNDR
          agrees on a fork in decentralized manner
      more distributed than most systems -- decentralized, peer-to-peer
        identities of participants are not known, not even the number
      the agreement scheme is new and very interesting
      Bitcoin's success was a big surprise
    
    what are the technical challenges?
      outright forgery (easy to solve)
      double spending (hard, bitcoin does pretty well)
      theft (hard, bitcoin not particularly strong)
    
    what's in the ledger record?
      pub(user1): public key of new owner
      hash(prev): hash of this coin's previous transaction record
      sig(user2): signature over transaction by previous owner's private key
      (BitCoin is more complex: amount (fractional), multiple in/out, ...)
    
    transaction example:
      Y owns a coin, previously given to it by X:
        T6: pub(X), ...
        T7: pub(Y), hash(T6), sig(X)
      Y buys a hamburger from Z and pays with this coin
        Z sends public key to Y
        Y creates a new transaction and signs it
        T8: pub(Z), hash(T7), sig(Y)
      Y sends transaction record to Z
      Z verifies:
        T8's sig(Y) corresponds to T7's pub(Y)
      Z gives hamburger to Y
    
    only the transactions exist, not the coins themselves
      Z's ""balance"" is set of unspent transactions for which Z knows private key
      the ""identity"" of a coin is the (hash of) its most recent xaction
    
    can anyone other than the owner spend a coin?
      current owner's private key needed to sign next transaction
      danger: attacker can steal Z's private key, e.g. from PC or smartphone or online exchange
        this is a serious problem in practice, and hard to solve well
    
    can a coin's owner spend it twice in this scheme?
      Y creates two transactions for same coin: Y-&gt;Z, Y-&gt;Q
        both with hash(T7)
      Y shows different transactions to Z and Q
      both transactions look good, including signatures and hash
      now both Z and Q will give hamburgers to Y
    
    why was double-spending possible?
      b/c Z and Q didn't know complete set and order of transactions
    
    what do we need?
      publish a log of all transactions
      ensure everyone sees the same log (in same order!)
      ensure Y can't un-publish a transaction
      result:
        Z will see Y-&gt;Z came before Y-&gt;Q, and will accept Y-&gt;Z
        Q will see Y-&gt;Z came before Y-&gt;Q, and will reject Y-&gt;Q
        a ""public ledger""
      how to create such a ledger?
        ""Nakamoto consensus"":  longest chain rule
         Probabilistic guarantee, but a very surprising result when it came out!
    
    the BitCoin block chain
      the goal: agreement on transaction log to prevent double-spending
      the block chain contains transactions on all coins
      many peers
        each with a complete copy of the whole chain
        each with TCP connections to a few other peers -- a ""mesh overlay""
        new blocks flooded to all peers, by forwarding over TCP
        proposed transactions also flooded to all peers
      each block:
        hash(prevblock)
        set of transactions
        ""nonce"" (can be anything, as we'll see)
        current time (wall clock timestamp)
      new block every 10 minutes containing xactions since prev block
      payee doesn't accept transaction until it's in the block chain
    
    who creates each new block?
      this is ""mining"" via ""proof-of-work""
      requirement: hash(block) has N leading zeros
      each peer tries random nonce values until this works out
      trying one nonce is fast, but most nonces won't work
        it's like flipping a zillion-sided coin until it comes up heads
        each flip has an independent (small) chance of success
        mining a block *not* a specific fixed amount of work
      it would likely take one CPU months to create one block
      but thousands of peers are working on it
      such that expected time to first to find is about 10 minutes
        though the variance is high
      the winner floods the new block to all peers
      proof-of-work solves the Sybil problem -- your CPU must be real to win
    
    how does a Y-&gt;Z transaction work w/ block chain?
      start: all peers know ...&lt;-B5
        and are mining block B6 (trying different nonces)
      Y sends Y-&gt;Z transaction to peers, which flood it
      peers buffer the transaction until B6 computed
      peers that heard Y-&gt;Z include it in next block
      so eventually ...&lt;-B5&lt;-B6&lt;-B7, where B7 includes Y-&gt;Z
    
    Q: could there be *two* different successors to B6?
    A: yes:
       1) two peers find nonces at about the same time, or
       2) slow network, 2nd block found before 1st is known
      two simultaneous blocks will be different
        miners know about slightly different sets of new transactions, &amp;c.
      if two successors, the blockchain temporarily forks
        peers work on whichever block they heard first
        but switch to longer chain if they become aware of one
    
    how is a fork resolved?
      each peer initially believes whatever new block it sees first
      tries to create a successor
      if more saw Bx than By, more will mine for Bx,
        so Bx successor likely to be created first
      even if exactly half-and-half, one fork likely to be extended first
        since significant variance in mining time
      peers switch to mining the longest fork once they see it, re-inforcing agreement
      what about transactions in the abandoned fork?
        most will be in both forks
        but some may be in just the abandoned fork -- appear, then disappear!
    
    what if Y sends out Y-&gt;Z and Y-&gt;Q at the same time?
      i.e. Y attempts to double-spend
      correct peers will accept first they see, ignore second
      thus next block will have one but not both
    
    what happens if Y tells some peers about Y-&gt;Z, others about Y-&gt;Q?
      perhaps use network DoS to prevent full flooding of either
      perhaps there will be a fork: B6&lt;-BZ and B6&lt;-BQ
    
    thus:
      temporary double spending is possible, due to forks
      but one side or the other of the fork highly likely to disappear soon
      thus if Z sees Y-&gt;Z with a few blocks after it,
        it's very unlikely that it could be overtaken by a
        different fork containing Y-&gt;Q
      if Z is selling a high-value item, Z should wait for a few
        blocks before shipping it
      if Z is selling something cheap, maybe OK to wait just for some peers
        to see Y-&gt;Z and validate it (but not in block)
    
    can an attacker modify just an existing block in the middle of the block chain?
      and tell newly starting peers about the modified block?
      e.g. to delete the first spend of the attacker's coin?
      no: then ""prev"" hash in next block will be wrong, peers will detect
    
    could attacker start a fork from an old block, with Y-&gt;Q instead of Y-&gt;Z?
      yes -- but fork must be longer in order for peers to accept it
      since attacker's fork starts behind main fork,
        attacker must mine blocks *faster* than total of other peers
      with just one CPU, will take months to create even a few blocks
        by that time the main chain will be much longer
        no peer will switch to the attacker's shorter chain
      if the attacker has more CPU power than all the honest
        bitcoin peers -- then the attacker can create the longest fork,
        everyone will switch to it, allowing the attacker to double-spend
    
    why does the mining scheme work?
      random choice over all participants for who gets to choose which fork to extend
        weighted by CPU power
      if most participants are honest, they will re-inforce agreement on longest fork
      if attacker controls majority of CPU power, it can force honest
        peers to switch from real chain to one created by the attacker
    
    why mine?
      first txn in block pays miner
        miner gets 6.25 bitcoins (currently)
        it puts its public key in first transaction
        this is incentive for people to operate bitcoin peers
      consequences: arms race
        special hardware for mining to win
        pools of miners that collaborate
        energy waste
      ""selfish-mining"" attack 
        even if an attacker controls less (&gt; /1/3), it can pull of a ""selfish-mining"" attack
        a pool of miners keeps the next block secret after finding it
        when the remainder of the network catches up, the pool publishes the withheld block
        makes the pool's private fork, the public one
    
    validation checks:
      peer, new xaction:
        no other transaction spends the same previous transaction
        signature is by private key of pub key in previous transaction
        then will add transaction to txn list for next block to mine
      peer, new block:
        hash value has enough leading zeroes (i.e. nonce is right, proves work)
        previous block hash exists
        all transactions in block are valid
        peer switches to new chain if longer than current longest
      Z:
        (some clients rely on peers to do above checks, some don't)
        Y-&gt;Z is in a block
        Z's public key / address is in the transaction
        there's several more blocks in the chain
      (other stuff has to be checked as well, lots of details)
    
    Q: 10 minutes is annoying; could it be made much shorter?
    
    Q: if lots of miners join, will blocks be created at a higher rate?
    
    Q: why does Bitcoin extend the longest chain? why not some other rule?
    
    Q: are transactions anonymous?
    
    Q: if I steal bitcoins, is it safe to spend them?
    
    Q: can bitcoins be forged, i.e. a totally fake coin created?
    
    Q: what can adversary do with a majority of CPU power in the world?
       can double-spend and un-spend, by forking
       cannot steal others' bitcoins
       can prevent xaction from entering chain
    
    Q: what if the block format needs to be changed?
       esp if new format wouldn't be acceptable to previous s/w version?
       ""hard fork""
    
    Q: how do peers find each other?
    
    Q: what if a peer has been tricked into only talking to corrupt peers?
       how about if it talks to one good peer and many colluding bad peers?
    
    Q: could a brand-new peer be tricked into using the wrong chain entirely?
       what if a peer rejoins after a few years disconnection?
       a few days of disconnection?
    
    Q: how rich are you likely to get with one machine mining?
    
    Q: why does it make sense for the mining reward to decrease with time?
    
    Q: is it a problem that there will be a fixed number of coins?
       what if the real economy grows (or shrinks)?
    
    Q: why do bitcoins have value?
       e.g. people seem willing to pay $8,935 per bitcoin (on may 5 2020).
       may 9 2021: $56,812
    
    Q: will bitcoin scale well?
       in terms of CPU time?
         apparently CPU limits to 4,000 tps (signature checks)
         more than Visa but less than cash
       in terms of storage?
         do you ever need to look at very old blocks?
         do you ever need to xfer the whole block chain?
         merkle tree: block headers vs txn data.

    Q: could Bitcoin have been just a ledger w/o a new currency?
       e.g. have dollars be the currency?
       since the currency part is pretty awkward.
       (settlement... mining incentive...)
    
    weak points in the design?
      too bad it's a new currency as well as a payment system
      transaction confirmation takes at least 10 minutes, or 60 for high confidence
      flooding limits performance, may be a point of attack
      maximum block size plus 10 minutes limits max transactions per second
      vulnerable to majority attack
      proof-of-work wastes CPU time, power
      not very anonmyous
      too anonymous -- illegal uses may trigger legal response
      users have trouble securing private keys
    
    key idea: block chain
      public agreed-on ledger is a great idea
      decentralization might be good
      mining is a clever way to avoid sybil attacks in an open system,
        and ensure most blocks are created by benign peers

nstpry,cascading_disruption,"Awesome Bitcoin technical FAQ from MIT: a discussion between professor and students at ""Distributed Systems"" class / tons of useful Q&amp;As for new&amp;old to Bitcoin","If you find some mistakes or things that could outdated or think of extra Q&amp;As yourself, just post them below and I'll include them.

Q: I don't understand why the blockchain is so important. Isn't the requirement for the owner's signature on each transaction enough to prevent bitcoins from being stolen?  

A: The signature is not enough, because it doesn't prevent the owner from spending money twice: signing two transactions that transfer the same bitcoin to different recipients. The blockchain acts as a publishing system to try to ensure that once a bitcoin has been spent once, lots of participants will know, and will be able to reject a second spend.  

Q: Why does Bitcoin need to define a new currency? Wouldn't it be more convenient to use an existing currency like dollars?  

A: The new currency (Bitcoins) allows the system to reward miners with freshly created money; this would be harder with dollars because it's illegal for ordinary people to create fresh dollars. And using dollars would require a separate settlement system: if I used the blockchain to record a payment to someone, I still need to send the recipient dollars via a bank transfer or physical cash.  

Q: Why is the purpose of proof-of-work?  

A: It makes it hard for an attacker to convince the system to switch to a blockchain fork in which a coin is spent in a different way than in the main fork. You can view proof-of-work as making a random choice over the participating CPUs of who gets to choose which fork to extend. If the attacker controls only a few CPUs, the attacker won't be able to work hard enough to extend a new malicious fork fast enough to overtake the main blockchain.  

Q: Could a Bitcoin-like system use something less wasteful than proof-of-work?  

A: Proof-of-work is hard to fake or simulate, a nice property in a totally open system like Bitcoin where you cannot trust anyone to follow rules. There are some alternate schemes; search the web for proof-of-stake or look at Algorand and Byzcoin, for example. In a smallish closed system, in which the participants are known though not entirely trusted, Byzantine agreement protocols could be used, as in Hyperledger, or variants of it as in Stellar.  There seems to be an interest in general to move to proof-of-stake; ethereum is moving to PoS (https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/)   

Q: Can Alice spend the same coin twice by sending ""pay Bob"" and ""pay Charlie"" to different subsets of miners?  

A: Suppose Alice does that. One of the two subsets of miners is likely to find the nonce for a new block first. Let's assume the first block to be found is B50 and it contains ""pay Bob"". This block will be flooded to all miners, so the miners working on ""pay Charlie"" will switch to mining a successor block to B50. These miners validate transactions they place in blocks, so they will notice that the ""pay Charlie"" coin was spent in B50, and they will ignore the ""pay Charlie"" transaction. Thus, in this scenario, double-spend won't work.  There's a small chance that two miners find blocks at the same time, perhaps B50' containing ""pay Bob"" and B50'' containing ""pay Charlie"". At this point there's a fork in the block chain. These two blocks will be flooded to all the nodes. Each node will start mining a successor to one of them (the first it hears). Again the most likely outcome is that a single miner will finish significantly before any other miner, and flood the successor, and most peers will switch to that winning fork. The chance of repeatedly having two miners simultaneously find blocks gets very small as the forks get longer. So eventually all the peers will switch to the same fork, and in that fork there will be only one spend of the coin.  The possibility of accidentally having a short-lived fork is the reason that careful clients wait until there are a few successor blocks before believing a transaction.  

Q: It takes an average of 10 minutes for a Bitcoin block to be validated. Does this mean that the parties involved aren't sure if the transaction really happened until 10 minutes later?  

A: Yes. The 10 minutes is awkward. But it's not always a problem. For example, suppose you buy a toaster oven with Bitcoin from a web site. The web site can check that the transaction is known by a few servers, though not yet in a block, and show you a ""purchase completed"" page. Before shipping it to you, they should check that the transaction is in a block. For low-value in-person transactions, such as buying a cup of coffee, it's probably enough for the seller to ask a few peers to check that the bitcoins haven't already been spent (i.e. it's reasonably safe to not bother waiting for the transaction to appear in the blockchain at all). For a large in-person purchase (e.g., a car), it is important to wait for sufficiently long to be assured that the block will stay in the block chain before handing over the goods.  

Q: What can be done to speed up transactions on the blockchain?  

A: I think the constraint here is that 10 minutes needs to be much larger (i.e. &gt;= 10x) than the time to broadcast a newly found block to all peers. The point of that is to minimize the chances of two peers finding new blocks at about the same time, before hearing about the other peer's block. Two new blocks at the same time is a fork; forks are bad since they cause disagreement about which transactions are real, and they waste miners' time. Since blocks can be pretty big (up to a megabyte), and peers could have slow Internet links, and the diameter of the peer network might be large, it could easily take a minute to flood a new block. If one could reduce the flooding time, then the 10 minutes could also be reduced.  

Q: The entire blockchain needs to be downloaded before a node can participate in the network. Won't that take an impractically long time as the blockchain grows?  

A: It's true that it takes a while for a new node to get all the transactions. But once a given server has done this work, it can save the block chain, and doesn't need to fetch it again. It only needs to know about new blocks, which is not a huge burden. On the other hand most ordinary users of Bitcoin don't run full Bitcoin nodes; instead they trust a few full nodes to answer questions about whether coins have already been spent.  

Q: Is it feasible for an attacker to gain a majority of the computing power among peers? What are the implications for bitcoin if this happens?  

A: It may be feasible; some people think that big cooperative groups of miners have been close to a majority at times: http://www.coindesk.com/51-attacks-real-threat-bitcoin/  If &gt;50% of compute power is controlled by a single entity, they can double-spend bitcoins: transfer a coin to one payee, and then generate a new fork from before that transaction in which the transaction doesn't exist. Bitcoin's security would be broken if this happened.  

Q: From some news stories, I have heard that a large number of bitcoin miners are controlled by a small number of companies.  

A: True. See here: https://blockchain.info/pools. It looks like three mining pools together hold &gt;51% of the compute power today, and two come to 40%.  

Q: Are there any ways for Bitcoin mining to do useful work, beyond simply brute-force calculating SHA-256 hashes?  

A: Maybe -- here are two attempts to do what you suggest: https://www.cs.umd.edu/\~elaine/docs/permacoin.pdf http://primecoin.io/  

Q: There is hardware specifically designed to mine Bitcoin. How does this type of hardware differ from the type of hardware in a laptop?  

A: Mining hardware has a lot of transistors dedicated to computing SHA256 quickly, but is not particularly fast for other operations. Ordinary server and laptop CPUs can do many things (e.g. floating point division) reasonably quickly, but don't have so much hardware dedicated to SHA256 specifically. Some Intel CPUs do have instructions specifically for SHA256; however, they aren't competitive with specialized Bitcoin hardware that massively parallelizes the hashing using lots of dedicated transistors.  

Q: The paper estimates that the disk space required to store the block chain will by 4.2 megabytes per year. That seems very low!  

A: The 4.2 MB/year is for just the block headers, and is still the actual rate of growth. The current 60+GB is for full blocks.  

Q: Would the advent of quantum computing break the bitcoin system?  

A: Here's a plausible-looking article: http://www.bitcoinnotbombs.com/bitcoin-vs-the-nsas-quantum-computer/ Quantum computers might be able to forge bitcoin's digital signatures (ECDSA). That is, once you send out a transaction with your public key in it, someone with a quantum computer could probably sign a different transaction for your money, and there's a reasonable chance that the bitcoin system would see the attacker's transaction before your transaction. 

Q: Bitcoin uses the hash of the transaction record to identify the transaction, so it can be named in future transactions. Is this guaranteed to lead to unique IDs?  

A: The hashes are technically not guaranteed to be unique. But in practice the hash function (SHA-256) is believed to produce different outputs for different inputs with fantastically high probability.  Q: It sounds like anyone can create new Bitcoins. Why is that OK? Won't it lead to forgery or inflation?  A: Only the person who first computes a proper nonce for the current last block in the chain gets the 12.5-bitcoin reward for ""mining"" it. It takes a huge amount of computation to do this. If you buy a computer and have it spend all its time attempting to mine bitcoin blocks, you will not make enough bitcoins to pay for the computer.  

Q: The paper mentions that some amount of fraud is admissible; where does this fraud come from?  

A: This part of the paper is about problems with the current way of paying for things, e.g. credit cards. Fraud occurs when you buy something on the Internet, but the seller keeps the money and doesn't send you the item. Or if a merchant remembers your credit card number, and buys things with it without your permission. Or if someone buys something with a credit card, but never pays the credit card bill.  

Q: Has there been fraudulent use of Bitcoin?  

A: Yes. I think most of the problems have been at web sites that act as wallets to store peoples' bitcoin private keys. Such web sites, since they have access to the private keys, can transfer their customers' money to anyone. So someone who works at (or breaks into) such a web site can steal the customers' Bitcoins.  

Q: Satoshi's paper mentions that each transaction has its own transaction fees that are given to whoever mined the block. Why would a miner not simply try to mine blocks with transactions with the highest transaction fees?  

A: Miners do favor transactions with higher fees. You can read about typical approaches here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction\_fees And here's a graph (the red line) of how long your transaction waits as a function of how high a fee you offer: https://bitcoinfees.github.io/misc/profile/  

Q: Why would a miner bother including transactions that yield no fee?  

A: I think many don't mine no-fee transactions any more.  

Q: How are transaction fees determined/advertised?  

A: Have a look here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction\_fees It sounds like (by default) wallets look in the block chain at the recent correlation between fee and time until a transaction is included in a mined block, and choose a fee that correlates with relatively quick inclusion. I think the underlying difficulty is that it's hard to know what algorithms the miners use to pick which transactions to include in a block; different miners probably do different things. 

 Q: What are some techniques for storing my personal bitcoins, in particular the private keys needed to spend my bitcoins? I've heard of people printing out the keys, replicating them on USB, etc. Does a secure online repository exist?  

A: Any scheme that keeps the private keys on a computer attached to the Internet is a tempting target for thieves. On the other hand, it's a pain to use your bitcoins if the private keys are on a sheet of paper. So my guess is that careful people store the private keys for small amounts on their computer, but for large balances they store the keys offline.  

Q: What other kinds of virtual currency were there before and after Bitcoin (I know the paper mentioned hashcash)? What was different about Bitcoin that led it to have more success than its predecessors?  

A: There were many previous proposals for digital cash systems, none with any noticeable success. It's tempting to think that Bitcoin has succeeded because its design is more clever than others: that it has just the right blend of incentives and decentralization and ease of use. But there are too many failed yet apparently well-designed technologies out there for me to believe that.  

Q: What happens when more (or fewer) people mine Bitcoin?  

A: Bitcoin adjusts the difficulty to match the measured compute power devoted to mining. So if more and more computers mine, the mining difficulty will get harder, but only hard enough to maintain the inter-block interval at 10 minutes. If lots of people stop mining, the difficulty will decrease. This mechanism won't prevent new blocks from being created, it will just ensure that it takes about 10 minutes to create each one.  

Q: Is there any way to make Bitcoin completely anonymous?  

A: Have a look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zerocoin  

Q: If I lose the private key(s) associated with the bitcoins I own, how can I get my money back?  

A: You can't.  

Q: What do people buy and sell with bitcoins?  

A: There seems to be a fair amount of illegal activity that exploits Bitcoin's relative anonymity (buying illegal drugs, demanding ransom). You can buy some ordinary (legal) stuff on the Internet with Bitcoin too; have a look here: http://www.coindesk.com/information/what-can-you-buy-with-bitcoins/ It's a bit of a pain, though, so I don't imagine many non-enthusiasts would use bitcoin in preference to a credit card, given the choice.  

Q: Why is bitcoin illegal in some countries?  

A: Here are some guesses.  Many governments adjust the supply of money in order to achieve certain economic goals, such as low inflation, high employment, and stable exchange rates. Widespread use of bitcoin may make that harder.  Many governments regulate banks (and things that function as banks) in order to prevent problems, e.g. banks going out of business and thereby causing their customers to lose deposits. This has happened to some bitcoin exchanges. Since bitcoin can't easily be regulated, maybe the next best thing is to outlaw it.  Bitcoin seems particularly suited to certain illegal transactions because it is fairly anonymous. Governments regulate big transfers of conventional money (banks must report big transfers) in order to track illegal activity; but you can't easily do this with bitcoin.  

Q: Why do bitcoins have any value at all? Why do people accept it as money?  Because other people are willing to sell things in return for bitcoins, and are willing to exchange bitcoins for ordinary currency such as dollars. This is a circular argument, but has worked many times in the past; consider why people view baseball trading cards as having value, or why they think paper money has value.  Q: How is the price of Bitcoin determined?  

A: The price of Bitcoin in other currencies (e.g. euros or dollars) is determined by supply and demand. If more people want to buy Bitcoins than sell them, the price will go up. If the opposite, then the price will go down. There is no single price; instead, there is just recent history of what prices people have been willing to buy and sell at on public exchanges. The public exchanges bring buyers and sellers together, and publish the prices they agree to:    https://bitcoin.org/en/exchanges  

Q: Why is the price of bitcoin so volatile?  

A: The price is driven partially by people's hopes and fears. When they are optimistic about Bitcoin, or see that the price is rising, they buy so as not to miss out, and thus bid the price up further. When they read negative news stories about Bitcoin or the economy in general, they sell out of fear that the price will drop and cause them to lose money. This kind of speculation happens with many goods; there's nothing special about Bitcoin in this respect.

nsrqsd,ajaykfr,Bitcoin Review!,"Bitcoin makes use of the peer-to-peer latest technology to function without a crucial authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is done collectively via the community. Bitcoin is open-supply; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and each person can participate. Through many of its precise properties, Bitcoin permits exciting uses that couldn't be protected with the aid of any previous fee device.

Bitcoin (‚Çø) is a decentralized virtual currency, without a valuable bank or unmarried administrator, that may be sent from user to user at the peer-to-peer bitcoin community without the want for intermediaries. Transactions are verified through community nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public disbursed ledger referred to as a blockchain. The cryptocurrency became invented in 2008 with the aid of an unknown man or woman or institution of people the use of the call Satoshi Nakamoto.\[8\] The currency commenced use in 2009\[9\] when its implementation changed into launched as open-supply software.

Bitcoins are created as praise for a technique referred to as mining. They may be exchanged for different currencies, products, and services, however, the actual-international price of the coins is extraordinarily volatile. Research produced with the aid of the University of Cambridge predicted that during 2017, there had been 2.9 to five. Eight million unique customers using cryptocurrency pockets, most of them using bitcoin. Users pick out to participate inside the digital currency for some reasons: ideologies together with commitment to anarchism, decentralization and libertarianism, convenience, using the forex as an investment, and pseudonymity of transactions. Increased use has caused a choice among governments for regulation that will tax, facilitate prison use in exchange and for different motives (along with investigations for cash laundering and charge manipulation).

Creation

Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to function with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out together by using the community. Bitcoin is open-source; its layout is public, no person owns or controls Bitcoin and everybody can take part. Through a lot of its precise houses, Bitcoin allows interesting makes use of that couldn't be covered by way of any previous fee device.

The area name bitcoin.Org was registered on 18 August 2008. On 31 October 2008, a hyperlink to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System changed into posted to a cryptography mailing list. Nakamoto applied the bitcoin software as open-supply code and released it in January 2009. Nakamoto's identity stays unknown.

On three January 2009, the bitcoin community become created whilst Nakamoto mined the beginning block of the chain, known as the genesis block. Embedded inside the coinbase of this block changed into the textual content ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"". This notice references a headline posted through The Times and has been interpreted as each a timestamp and a comment on the instability as a result of fractional-reserve banking.

The receiver of the primary bitcoin transaction was cypherpunk Hal Finney, who had created the first reusable proof-of-paintings gadget (RPoW) in 2004. Finney downloaded the bitcoin software program on its launch date, and on 12 January 2009 acquired ten bitcoins from Nakamoto.\[28\]\[29\] Other early cypherpunk supporters have been creators of bitcoin predecessors: Wei Dai, creator of b-money, and Nick Szabo, writer of bit gold. In 2010, the first recognized industrial transaction the use of bitcoin happened when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz offered two Papa John's pizzas for ‚Çø10,000.

Blockchain analysts estimate that Nakamoto had mined approximately a million bitcoins before disappearing in 2010 whilst he exceeded the network alert key and manage the code repository over to Gavin Andresen. Andresen later has become the lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. Andresen then sought to decentralize manipulate. This left possibility for controversy to expand over the destiny development direction of bitcoin, in assessment to the perceived authority of Nakamoto's contributions.

According to CoinMetrics and Forbes, on 11 March 281,000 bitcoins have been sold through owners who held them for the best thirty days. This compared to ‚Çø4,131 that had laid dormant for a year or greater, indicating that the large majority of the bitcoin volatility on that day was from the latest shoppers. During the week of 11 March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken experienced an eighty-three% increase within the variety of account signups over the week of bitcoin's rate collapse, an end result of consumers seeking to capitalize at the low fee. On thirteen March 2020, bitcoin fell underneath $4000 throughout a huge COVID-19 pandemic associated market selloff, after buying and selling above $10,000 in February 2020.

In August 2020, MicroStrategy invested $250 million in bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. In October 2020, Square, Inc. Put approximately 1% in their general property ($50 million) in bitcoin. In November 2020, PayPal announced that each customer within the US ought to purchase, maintain, or promote bitcoin using PayPal. On 30 November 2020, bitcoin hit a brand new all-time high of $19,860 topping the previous excessive from December 2017. Alexander Vinnik, the founder of BTC-e, was convicted and sentenced to 5 years in prison for money laundering in France at the same time as refusing to testify all through his trial. In December 2020 Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company announced it has bought $a hundred million in bitcoin, or kind of 0.04% of its preferred investment account.

On 19 January 2021, Elon Musk located #Bitcoin in his Twitter profile tweeting ""In retrospect, it turned into inevitable"", which induced the price to in brief upward thrust approximately $5000 in an hour to $37,299. On 25 January 2021 Microstrategy announced it continued to shop for bitcoin and as of the identical date it had holdings of ‚Çø70,784 worth $2.38 billion. On 8 February 2021 Tesla's declaration that it had purchased $1.Five billion in bitcoin and planned to start accepting bitcoin as the fee for automobiles pushed the bitcoin charge to an all-time excessive of $ forty-four,141. On 18 February 2021, Elon Musk said that ""proudly owning bitcoin turned into most effective a bit higher than holding traditional coins, but that the slight distinction made it a higher asset to preserve"".

It was introduced in September 2020, that the Canton of Zug (in Switzerland) will begin to be given tax bills in bitcoin from February 2021.

Design

Bitcoin is primarily based on an elliptic curve called secp256k1 and encrypted with the ECDSA algorithm.\[95\]\[better source needed\] The equation for the Bitcoin secp256k1 curve is displayed style yy2=displaystyle xx3+7. Bitcoin has a proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that might upload help for Schnorr signatures.

Units and divisibility

The unit of account of the bitcoin system is a bitcoin. Ticker symbols used to symbolize bitcoin are BTC\[a\] and XBT. Its Unicode person is ‚Çø. Small amounts of bitcoin used as alternative gadgets are millibitcoin (mBTC), and satoshi (sat). Named in homage to bitcoin's creator, a satoshi is the smallest quantity within bitcoin representing 1‚ÅÑ100000000 bitcoins, 100 millionths of a bitcoin. A millibitcoin equals 1‚ÅÑ1000 bitcoins; 1000th of a bitcoin or 100,000 satoshis.

Blockchain

Data shape of blocks in the ledger.

The number of bitcoin transactions according to month, semilogarithmic plot.

The number of unspent transaction outputs.

For a broader coverage of this topic, see Blockchain.

The bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger that statistics bitcoin transactions. It is carried out as a series of blocks, Every block containing a hash of the preceding block as much as the genesis block\[c\] of the chain. A community of speaking nodes walking bitcoin software keeps the blockchain:215‚Äì219 Transactions of the shape payer X sends Y bitcoins to payee Z are broadcast to this community using without difficulty available software packages.

Network nodes can validate transactions, add them to their copy of the ledger, and then broadcast these ledger additions to other nodes. To reap unbiased verification of the chain of ownership each community node stores its very own reproduction of the blockchain.\[106\] At various intervals of time-averaging to every 10 mins, a brand new organization of accepted transactions, called a block, is created, brought to the blockchain, and fast published to all nodes, without requiring principal oversight. This permits bitcoin software to determine when a particular bitcoin becomes spent, which is needed to prevent double-spending. A conventional ledger data the transfers of real payments or promissory notes that exist aside from it, however, the blockchain is the simplest place that bitcoins can be stated to exist within the shape of unspent outputs of transactions.

Software implementation

Bitcoin Core is a loose and open-source software program that serves as a bitcoin node (the set of which form the bitcoin community) and presents a bitcoin wallet that completely verifies payments. It is taken into consideration to be bitcoin's reference implementation. Initially, the software became posted via Satoshi Nakamoto below the call ""Bitcoin"", and later renamed to ""Bitcoin Core"" to distinguish it from the community. It is also known as the Satoshi customer.

The MIT Digital Currency Initiative finances a number of the improvement of Bitcoin Core. The assignment also continues the cryptography library libsecp256k1.

Bitcoin Core includes a transaction verification engine and connects to the bitcoin network as a full node. Moreover, a cryptocurrency wallet, which may be used to transfer finances, is protected by way of default. The pockets permit the sending and receiving of bitcoins. It does now not facilitate the shopping for or selling of bitcoin. It allows users to generate QR codes to acquire payment.

The software program validates the whole blockchain, which includes all bitcoin transactions ever. This allotted ledger which has reached more than 235 gigabytes in length as of Jan 2019, ought to be downloaded or synchronized before full participation of the consumer may additionally occur. Although the entire blockchain isn't wished abruptly on account that it is feasible to run in pruning mode. A command line-based totally daemon with a JSON-RPC interface, bitcoind, is bundled with Bitcoin Core. It additionally affords access to testnet, a worldwide trying out environment that imitates the bitcoin predominant community the use of an opportunity blockchain in which valueless ""test bitcoins"" are used. Request or Regression Test Mode creates a non-public blockchain that is used as a nearby checking out surroundings. Finally, bitcoin-cli, easy software that allows customers to send RPC instructions to bitcoin, is also covered.

Checkpoints that have been hardcoded into the client are used handiest to prevent Denial of Service attacks towards nodes which can be, begin with syncing the chain. For this purpose, the checkpoints included are only as of numerous years in the past. A one-megabyte block size restriction became introduced in 2010 by Satoshi Nakamoto. This constrained the most community ability to approximately three transactions in step with 2nd. Since then, community potential has been advanced incrementally each thru block size increases and progressed pockets conduct. A network alert machine became included through Satoshi Nakamoto as a way of informing users of vital news regarding bitcoin. In November 2016 it was retired. It had come to be obsolete as information on bitcoin is now extensively disseminated.

Bitcoin Core consists of a scripting language stimulated through Forth that may define transactions and specify parameters. ScriptPubKey is used to ""lock"" transactions based on a set of destiny conditions. scripting is used to meet those conditions or ""unencumber"" a transaction. Operations on the statistics are achieved by using various OP\_Codes. Two stacks are used - primary and alt. Looping is forbidden.

Bitcoin Core makes use of OpenTimestamps to timestamp merge commits.

The authentic author of the bitcoin patron has defined their technique to the software program's authorship as it being written first to show to themselves that the concept of basically peer-to-peer digital cash changed into valid and that a paper with answers could be written. The lead developer is Wladimir J. Van der Laan, who took over the position on 8 April 2014. Gavin Andresen turned into the former lead maintainer for the software program customer. Andresen left the function of lead developer for bitcoin to work on the strategic development of its technology. Bitcoin Core in 2015changed into critical to a dispute with Bitcoin XT, a competing customer that sought to boom the block size. Over a dozen exclusive agencies and enterprise companies fund the improvement of Bitcoin Core.

Ok, look. I'm willing to admit, I'm that guy, the annoying guy who asks questions and annoys all the seasoned pros..  But..

I'm frustrated beyond measure. 

When my son was born in January of 2010, I looked into bitcoin as an investment for his future, and I didn't understand ANY of it. So, I noped out and walked. Now, I regret that every second of every day. 

Recently, I came into a bit of extra cash, I want to invest. I don't want to get super stinking rich, I just want a bit of security for the future. 

I have spent three days trying to learn as much as I can and I'm ready to scream. I'm SO lost, and unlike most here, I'm not all that book smart. I can't understand half the stuff y'all talk about. 

So, where I'm stuck is with two things. First, wallets. I created an account on Coinbase.com, and verified and submitted ID and all that. Then, I went to add funds so I could invest and buy a few Satoshis. Yay me, I'm learning.

Then, I discoveredPaypal only lets you cash out, not put cash in. Then I discovered that I couldn't add funds with Capital one, OR my Tangerine account. So, I have NO way to get funds into my account. So, I got the bright idea to use a Crypto ATM in town, a couple blocks away. But, I needed a wallet. So, google tells me to get Coinbase wallet. Check. 

get to the ATM, put in $20, and discover that there's a $3 fee, then the mining fee, so only $15 actually hits my wallet. a 25% loss off the hop? I'm doing this wrong. Not keen on losing a massive chunk of my capital every time.

So, how do I add funds to Coinbase if all forms of payment available to me are not accepted by Coinbase?

Second, now that I have a Coinbase wallet with $15 of bitcoin on it (just a ""test"" amount. I plan on adding more when/if I figure out what I'm doing) how do I manage/monitor it from a web browser in the event I lose my phone or it gets blown up by a shard of space debris or something? I had assumed I could link my CB wallet to my CB account, but nope. All it did was create a new wallet with a different address when I tried to link them.

As I said, I'm an idiot, I know this and accept this. But I am SO far out of my wheelhouse here, I just need some help. I'm asking those who know before I screw something up that I can't fix. 

Thanks for any help, and for trying to decipher my rambling.",1622880481,21,1

Ron Paul Wants to Legalize Bitcoin as Money to Compete With Dollar

Former presidential candidate Ron Paul discussed bitcoin as an alternative asset in an interview with Kitco News‚Äô Michelle Makori Wednesday. Paul is an American author, physician, and retired politician. The former congressman from Texas launched The Ron Paul Liberty Report in 2015 to bring ‚Äúprovocative opinion and analysis to the breaking issues affecting our lives and finances,‚Äù its website details.

When asked about his views on bitcoin, Paul said that he knows a lot more about precious metals being money than cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúI was fascinated with it for a long long time. But I‚Äôm also fascinated with what‚Äôs coming,‚Äù he opined.

The former congressman added that ‚Äúpeople ought to have as much freedom as possible to have choices.‚Äù He then describes a bill he introduced in Congress to ‚Äúnot only audit the Fed but also to get rid of the legal tender laws.‚Äù He explained that currently, the government will not allow anything to compete with the dollar on the national level, elaborating:

My goal is to legalize the competition and the people will sort it out. Freedom of choice will sort it out.

‚ÄúMy concern is that governments over centuries have been notoriously very eager to have control of the money. Believe me, they will not give up control of money,‚Äù he emphasized.

Paul was asked to elaborate on what he meant by legalizing the competition. He replied: ‚ÄúRight now, if you buy and sell gold, you get it taxed, they can do that. If you make a profit in bitcoin, you read stories about people being taxed on it. You can‚Äôt tax money, you don‚Äôt tax it. If you bought a dollar a year ago and it went down 10%, you can‚Äôt take a loss because your dollar lost value.‚Äù

Paul will also be speaking at the Bitcoin 2021 conference Friday. Regarding what he plans to say at the conference, he said: ‚ÄúI will argue more the case for the legalization of freedom of choice, and the people should make decisions and not the government.‚Äù

He acknowledged that some people are very enthusiastic about bitcoin and think that it is the only money that will exist, replacing the dollar. However, in his opinion:

I think the dollar is going to be around but it‚Äôs not gonna be worth much.

nta25y,Spare_Photograph,"My Bitcoin ""Manifesto""","I am a 50 year old white Gen X'r in the USA originally from Boston, Mass. I live a comfortable life as an IT systems admin for a large firm. I first entered Bitcoin a couple years ago for economic practicality reasons. I saw inflation coming and wanted a hedge. Later I would learn about the possible future riches with Bitcoin's scarcity which was a big lightbulb moment and I've also felt some FOMO.

For a long time I scoffed at Bitcoin and thought it was some millennial young man in his basement type of dream. I should have listened closer back in 2011 to Max Keiser and company... but that is all in the past. You can only change the future.

After this weekend's Bitcoin conference though I now HODL Bitcoin because I want to improve the world. This is no longer about the $ value.

\*\*Fix the money. Fix the world.\*\* 

Watching a young, somewhat 'unprofessional' Jack Maller speak so passionately about his work in El Salvador made me realize that Bitcoin is so much bigger than me becoming a millionaire. It is HOW to save the planet AND the people simultaneously. This is a ""\_\_\_\_ lives matter"" revolution that I can join and know it will truly fix something. In the future bitcoin world I envision people will no longer have their life energy and time stolen from them. The evil games that the rich play on the poor will be less effective. The Bitcoin protocol doesn't care about your sex, age, sexual preference, race, religion, trading, type of trade, or even your past criminal record.  It is the central banker mankind has always needed and wanted but never had. Until now.

Every environmentalist should realize how much bitcoin incentivizes green renewable energy, everyone passionate about sustainability of resources wanting to see the true worldwide price figured in,  everyone who wants to solve homelessness, unemployment, fair trade and affordable housing, everyone who wants to improve politics in EVERY country (not just your own), every businessman who doesn't want to struggle as hard, every student who wants to fight for fairness, diversity, every female who wants to secure property rights for women WORLDWIDE NOW and not through the courts, every revolutionary that wants to end war and the ""Military Industrial Complex"" should be joining us with all their passion......and I could go on.

THIS IS THE REVOLUTION of ALL REVOLUTIONS. If you REALLY want to make a difference, join our fight.  

I want a better world for my grandchildren. Bitcoin is the way to do this. This is why I HODL now. Ask me at what price I will sell you my Bitcoin for now? As Mastercard would say.... ""priceless"".

Be the change in the world you want to see and thanks for reading.

&amp;#x200B;

p.s. - Elon, you and I are the same age.... You are smarter than me on most tech issues and I still stand in awe of your achievements. IMHO you are always welcome as a part of our revolution and I'm not even certain yet that you ever left. I'm hoping you start to see this revolution the same way you do some of your other past fights with institutions and stand with Bitcoin all the way.",1622941567,62,1

nt8hi6,RussianRadium,I'm from El Salvador and I'm here to clarify some things about the BTC adoption recently announced.,"Hello, I'm from El Salvador so I'd like to give you all some information that might help you clarify things. I posted this in another thread and made some slight edits. 

First some info of the current zeitgeist in El Salvador: 

The president's party, Nuevas Ideas (New Ideas), was formed in 2018-2019 as a new alternative to the old bipartisan, marxist-left (FMLN) and ultranationalist right (ARENA) system that had controlled the government since the end of the Civil War in 1992. He won the presidential elections in 2019 with 52% of the vote (overwhelming majority) and just recently won the legislative elections in 2021 by a landslide (73% of the vote). That means that his party controls the Congress with 2/3 of the legislators, which are enought to pass any bill that they want, and in fact that's what they've been doing. 

His party is made up of mostly young professionals tired of the corrupt system that has kept the country poor and underdeveloped for the past 30 years. In just their first day in office they fired the Attorney General (who had been protecting other corrupt politicians) and 5 other magistrates, accused of being bought by the oligarchy to protect their economic interests. In just a month, the new Congress has approved unprecedented financing for education and infrastructure and has passed bills that make sure that the predatory economic elites that used to buy politicians in the past are kept in check. Many big infraestructure projects are expected to be approved by Congress soon, including the construction of a high-speed railway and a new international airport.

One of the biggest projects that the government is building is called Surf City, which is basically road, electricity and communications infrastructure along the coastline to help small businesses. In fact, for this very reason, the ISA decided to hold the World Surfing Games (which are happening until tomorrow) to qualify for the Tokyo 2021 Olympics in El Salvador. Bitcoin is already used by small businesses in this area, especially in El Zonte, which is one of the more popular beaches that gets a lot of international tourists.

I know most people used to have the notion that El Salvador was a dumpster fire, because we were. However, the country is going through huge change. Just yesterday the ex-mayor of San Salvador (the capital) was captured by the police and is awaiting trial for corruption and gang financing and also the ex-first lady was sentenced to 10 years in prison for money laundering. El Salvador is no longer on the top 10 list of most violents countries in the world (the muder rate used to be 12-15 homicides daily and has decreased to nearly 3-4 daily since Bukele took office) and our economy is expected to grow steadily too. 

Bukele (39 years old) is extremely popular, with an approval rating of over 90% during his second year in office. Mostly due to this forward thinking. You can see this with the data related to the pandemic. El Salvador is the Central American country with the lowest mortality rate (due to a massive revamp of our healthcare system), the lowest number of COVID-19 cases and the fastest rate of vaccine applications, having just surpassed the 2 million mark. The government also just launched a project to give laptops to 100% of the students of the public school system. The country still has massive challenges to overcome but I'm confident we are on a very good path.

The adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender is HUGE news for this country. I assure you that Congress will pass this bill. I couldn't give you an exact date, but the economics commission will probably receive all the papers this week. 

I'll try to answer any questions that you guys might have.

nunuy1,walloon5,When does Bitcoin become the World Reserve Currency; milestones to come,"Hi all,

Pondering it today, thinking about US trade, the size of US dollars held as a reserve currency, they seem linked.

I think the cumulative amount of USD used as a reserve currency is about $7 trillion. Falling off that, there's about $2.5 trillion in EUR, \~$1T in JPY, and about $1T in ""Other"" as reserves -- Source, IMF, Currency Composition of Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) -  [https://data.imf.org/regular.aspx?key=41175](https://data.imf.org/regular.aspx?key=41175)

Now there's not a super strong link between how much trade is really done in a given currency but it's connected. Example, China is a major world producer and you'd think more people would hold its currency in reserve but it's not the case.

Anyway, that means to me that bitcoin could come to dominate trade and still not be the reserve currency of the world supplanting the dollar for a long time.

Still, when I think about it, it seems like there is probably some level of reserves held proportional to world trade:

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/264682/worldwide-export-volume-in-the-trade-since-1950/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264682/worldwide-export-volume-in-the-trade-since-1950/)

So maybe once we have billions or trillions of dollars in trade, it will start to be more rational for countries to keep bitcoin reserves in their central banks?

Well we'll see. Anyone have some thoughts about how that rise might play out?

Seems like, to me, unexpectedly, after bitcoin flips gold's market cap circa $10-11 trillion USD, I thought the next heights to tackle would be real estate circa $100 T, but maybe it's world reserve currency that is the middle step? I am not sure.

Maybe world reserve currency will come last because central banks will fight to the bitter end.",1623100640,8,0

numt39,enter57chambers,"GALAXY DIGITAL ‚Äì an incredibly profitable, innovative crypto company that is trading at a huge discount to peer group ‚Äì SUPER VALUE PLAY","  

Just gonna put the **TLDR** up here ‚Äì Galaxy Digital (OTC: BRPHF) should gain up to 1,000% when uplisted and re-rated closer to Coinbase‚Äôs multiple. 

Putting you all on to the company that is going to be hands-down THE LEADER in the crypto space for years to come ‚Äì Galaxy Digital Holdings. DD below ‚Äì but this has the potential for an easy 5x in the next 12 months max. My last DD here was downvoted to hell because of illiquidity, but check the tape and you‚Äôll see it popped 50% since my post. This play is much safer, with a strong competitive advantage, incredible financials, exceptional management and multiple upcoming catalysts. Currently it just trades as a proxy to BTC, but the business is much more solid and high growth than most realize ‚Äì with almost no institutional or retail interest in the stock. 

GALAXY DIGITAL HOLDINGS (trades on the TSX under GLXY, OTC in the US under BRPHF) is an innovative and diversified crypto company. It‚Äôs run by Mike Novogratz, who is super smart and was a longtime exec at Goldman Sachs, running all of Lat Am for them. He pivoted to the crypto space and started Galaxy as the first full service crypto bank/services/hedge fund ‚Äì being a bridge for crpyto to the institutional space and encompassing investment banking/advisory, crypto venture capital, and hedge fund/market making operations. 

Already, Galaxy Digital is helping managing the crypto exposure for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley clients ‚Äì as the partner for their first institutional offerings. They recently acquired BitGo, the digital asset infrastructure provider, signaling their ability to offer a breadth of services no one else can. 

Upcoming catalysts are Q2 earnings ‚Äì where their earnings stability will be put to the test as well as potential uplisting to Nasdaq which Novo has been hinting at for months. Once this hits the US exchanges, it‚Äôll be part of every crypto-exposed portfolio and ETF, and I believe is the company with the biggest longterm prospects in the space. 

But the REAL BREAD AND BUTTER here is how insanely profitable the company is, and the pitiful multiple it currently trades at. THE COMPANY MADE OVER 1 BILLION DOLLARS IN PROFITS LAST QUARTER ALONE, and earnings growth is through the roof the past few quarters. *That is equivalent to Coinbase‚Äôs earnings last quarter.* Most of these are trading profits, and it seems they‚Äôve really hit their stride. Despite that, when accounting for all the fully-diluted shares, the current market cap is around $7 billion ‚Äì Less than 1/6th of Coinbase‚Äôs market capitalization. The P/E ratio comparison is even crazier ‚Äì Galaxy is trading at 5x earnings, while Coinbase trades at 45.5x earnings. See below for a detailed earnings per share comparison to Coinbase.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8re8jp06mw371.jpg?width=521&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d01b44c30930a71fe314e32936d444b9b8c79136

IN SHORT, ONCE GALAXY RE-RATES CLOSER TO COIN‚ÄôS MULTIPLES, THE PRICE COULD GO AS HIGH AS 160/SHARE ‚Äì a 1,000% return. 

There are some concerns about their earnings stability given the recent volatility in the crypto market, as well as dilution (they are issuing stock to fund their M&amp;A), but I think neither of those are real concern in the long term. 

Mike Novo is a true GALAXY brain who‚Äôs killed it in both traditional finance and crypto, and the company is printing money. The market hasn‚Äôt caught on yet ‚Äì get in now.

nr12qv,drytendies,"Relax friends, everything's going to be alright!","I know this is going to piss some people off but I just wanted to share my thoughts on soemthing that bugs me about the crypto community.

The trope (thats really not so much of a trope) is that people expect every fucking investment they make to 10x this year or it wont have been a success or its somehow a disappointment. 

In the grand scheme of things, if you did have to wait 4-5 years before things really mooned that would really be an insane return. If the average stock market return is around 10% then whats really to complain about? 

**When in doubt, zoom out!**

I know this post is pretty all over the place I just wanted to share my thoughts that yes its possible that we may not moon this month or next but we will eventually and if you hodl and dca in you will be rich! It's just really sad to watch some traders enter crypto, be down about 20% and then deciding it's not for them. I mean look, I get it; crypto's not for everyone but I think a lot of people get in as a get rich quick kind of thing and then cut bait the moment something seems like it wont pan out.

Because Im American I'm going to throw out a stat I heard, not sure how it applies to your country. Apparently, something like 50% of American's arent invested in anything!! Thats right NOTHING at all. Can you believe that? For many reasons I would assumed most obviously because of lack of funds? In my opinion its because of lack of knowledge. They probably just dont know or distrust the system or maybe lost a little money and decided investing wasnt for them

How does this relate to crypto?

I feel like the same thing is happening. I'm seeing the panic amongst many newbie crypto holders and I guess i'm just writing this because I want you guys to know that things will get better; they always do! We will moon eventually and you will attain that life changing wealth. You may just have to change your mindset. I've been investing in stocks for over 10 years and crypto on and off since 2017. I still don't think I know shit. Keep learning.

You really gotta understand the projects you invest in because if you dont, **FUD** will consume you! The people that understand what theyre invested in will buy up dips and the people who dont will always panic sell. thats just how the market works. Warren Buffet said "" The stock market is a device for **transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""** 

Also want to make one thing clear; I'm all for taking profit! Even though I diamond hand. I usually DCA out of my cost basis' up to 50-100% and then use that to re invest on dips. However, with crypto I've been holding a lot just because i invest consistently with my income.

I am because you are... This is the philosophy that Satoshi Nakamoto is vehiculating all around the planet further and further every year.

nqz8fj,Der_Ushi,Devaluation of the Lira and possible hyperinflation in Turkey,"So, i'm not usually a great critic of inflation and arguments from hurr durr conomics as in ""the fiat system is taking away my freedums"", but there is one particular event as of right now that, similar to Venezuela, could let people turn to Bitcoin and crypto out of necessity, for the lack of an actual functioning national currency.

That event is the refusal of Erdogan and his followers that he set up the turkish central bank with. Erdogan refused to lower the interest rates of the central bank as it would crowd out businesses that rely on the infusion of more money into the market.

That is done in an effort force economic activity and the jobs that come with it.

But with the prior lowering of production output in major western economies like turkey in the pandemic, the devaluation of the turkish Lira that comes with this this step will not lead to a lower exchange price for turkish goods and services, as those will need to be produced first.

Instead, turkish production companies holding Lira will simply not have the purchasing power to buy their raw materials on the international market to even get production going. This will be particularly problematic with natural ressources often doubling and tripling in price, now that producers are buying out markets to get started again with the lift of lockdowns in western economies.

This means that not just will the turkish Lira be devaluated in relation to it's market capitalisation, but the general output of the turkish economiy will stay low and most likely even lower in comparisson to pre-pandemic levels.

More currency in circulation, less stuff to buy in that currency. Both sides of the inflation equasion are affected. This is screaming hyperinflation.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/turkish-lira-weakens-past-8-77-to-fresh-record-versus-dollar](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/turkish-lira-weakens-past-8-77-to-fresh-record-versus-dollar)

Now, before the ban in Turkey, Bitcoin had a relatively strong distribution in turkey. It had a lot of miners and speculants looking for a quick buck. It could very well turn out that the turkish will, out of sheer nessecity will have to turn to alternative currencies and with that they will turn to Bitcoin and other crypto.

Now, i thought about trying to justify making money from the suffering of the Turkish people by speculating in Bitcoin, but i really do not feel compelled to say sorry. I simply don't like muslims, so i'm fine with them having to buy the coins that i mined for a price that will probably ruin them because they don't have a choice.

What i only wanted to say with that, really:

Prepare for another moonshot. A mejor industrialised nation is going into hyperinflation and billions of dollars worth of purchasing power of the turkish people could flow into crypto.",1622675886,18,1

e.g. this incredibly helpful website: [https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,3m,weight](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,3m,weight) the author has a donation address at the bottom which is hardcoded.  


From the address reuse article, it says that bitcoin addresses are more like 'invoices', so it makes sense why you want a new invoice for each transaction.

I'm confused why reusing the same address/invoice ID is less secure and can expose details of your wallet/finances. Surely even a single transaction can expose your wallet, and from there, someone could view your balance and previous transactions?",1622673079,4,1

nqvs6s,listmann,Where do you want to be financially.,"There are roughly 102 million people in the world in the top 10% financially, if they all bought bitcoin they would own at the most 0.20 which isn‚Äôt possible because there are thousands missing and companies that own hundreds of thousands. So if bitcoin ever has true economic value and use what do you think 0.5 BTC would be worth? I'm thinking if it does occur owning 0.5 would put you in the top 1% wealth wise. The trick is getting out before it hits $0 (if that ever happens). It‚Äôs going to be the best or worst financial gamble of your life regardless of which side you choose. I think it‚Äôs at least worth owning 0.2, or even 0.1 BTC don‚Äôt you? Why doesn't the nocoiners see it that way...",1622666463,54,1

nu5qlt,Wellas,I just need to rant for a moment about how unfucking believably cumbersome it still is to use crypto,"Everyone's talking about pancake swap so I thought I'd check it out.

Set up Metamask the other day and put like 50 bucks in to mess around.

Wanted to put in some more today but was out of BNB in wallet. Hey no problem I have some more BNB in my binance account, I'll just send it right over.

Oh hey Binance.us doesn't allow BEP-20 (whatever the fuck that is) BNB withdrawal. So even though it says withdraw BNB and receive BNB, they are actually two different things.  See, it's the same logo, but one is black and one is yellow.  So you try to send from one to the other and it just keeps telling you it's not working, but it doesn't fucking tell you why - so just keep guessing and googling.

K that's cool some googling tells me trust wallet can handle it, so I download TW and set it up.  K now I want to use more BNB than I have. So I can't buy BNB on my regular exchange, CB Pro.  No worries I'll just send over some BTC to Binance and buy some more BNB there.

K so transfer initiated and just had to wait a slick 30 minutes.  K kinda slow but whatever.

Alright now I just need to trade my BTC for BNB then send it to my new TW and then swap those bad boys for some CAKE and fuck around just like I planned to hours ago before all the videos and tutorials.  Sweet this is so fun and easy.

Oh hey, when I try to xfer the BNB I just fucking bought on Binance with BTC, it says I can't do that.  ""A portion of your assets have been locked and are currently unable to be withdrawn. Please check your USD deposit history to see exactly when this lock expires.""

Hmm k lemme check.  Oh yea I bought some BNB with fiat 5 days ago and I can't withdraw that for 5 more days.  That's cool, except that transaction has fucking nothing to do with the coins I am trying to transfer right now.  I am only trying to transfer the fucking coins I just bought with BTC, not USD, so why the fuck is all my BNB locked for 5 more days?

It's really fucking bullshit how I wanted to fuck around on PS and 3 hours later I have to just give up and fucking hope it's all sorted in 5 days. 

I'm not even new to this shit.  I have been sending crypto to different wallets for years and I am a tech savvy person- not a boomer.  And I still had to spend 3 fruitless fucking hours just trying to fund a goddamn wallet to fuck around.

When the fuck are all you programming coding fuckers going to figure out how to make this shit easier and straight forward?  I just can't believe it.

WHAT TO DO

It  is as easy as downloading Wasabi Wallet (THERE ARE MANY FAKE WEBSITES,  MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD FROM THE OFFICIAL WASABI WEBSITE, AND VERIFY THE  GPG SIGNATURES) [wasabiwallet.io](https://wasabiwallet.io/) is the website, but verify yourself instead of just trusting me.

Then connect to Chaincase Backend with Wasabi (to mix &lt; 0.1 BTC coins):

1. Open Wasabi
2. From menu: File/Open/Config File.
3. Replace the relevant lines in the config, then close Wasabi:

As well as your wallet activity. It‚Äôs the mark of the beast and you can‚Äôt even see it.,"It blows my mind the amount of new people that want mass adoption that have no clue who is even behind Bitcoin. 

Let me tell you then, the NSA has been using this to track every transaction and data from you. They even hide it in the *Terms of use* that no one will ever read. 

You all think this is *revolutionary* but has been around probably before you were born. 

Research and you will see. Here‚Äôs the patent as well. Information is all out there. Go research.

My gut instinct was that institutions are manipulating BTC and keeping it low.... for a reason I don't know.   Then I think how this btc price is related to GME and the squeeze sagas.  Basically, everything happens for a reason in the financial world.

GUH makes use of the elastic supply mechanism to dynamically adjust supply to meet an increasing Price Peg. 

The Peg begins at $.001 and increases 5.00% every 4 hours for 360 epochs, at which point it will peg to the then current market price of Bitcoin plus 1% every 4 hours.""

nqhvvo,Pablolo,SDR: another reason to be bullish on Bitcoin,"I believe most of you guys understand perfectly why the hard cap on Bitcoin (21mill) is one of the core reasons why, as a store of value, is much better than fiat or gold.

We know that the 'printing press goes brrrrrr' and, in the US, we have public data on how M2 is growing, for example, to give us an idea of what's going on: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)

I've been studying Bitcoin for many years now, but I just learned today about SDR (rabbit hole takes you to unexpected places) and I know a lot of folks around here don't know anything about it.

Well, SDR or '[special drawing rights](https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR)' is a basket of currencies ([USD, Euro, Yuan, Yen, Pound](https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_sdrv.aspx)) created by the IMF in 1969. Yeah, it's old. But it's also coming to the light spot right now because of how much is being created out of thin air lately.

And, when more SDR is created, is the same as printing more of each one of those currencies.

Now, it happens that the main risk about bitcoin is regulatory risk. So, in fact, those governors are just telling people that they themselves can go and crush the new asset (that they dislike as they can't issue it). 
To counter these risk and narrative few things could be effectively done:
- the developers community could work together with some legal expertise to find out tools and friendly jurisdictions to protect against unfair national regulations,
- the community of good wishing hodlers could think to create some funding arrangement to hire lawyers ready to counter illegal expropriation of bitcoin value by means of unfavorable or unreasonable state regulations; in the end, if regulators exceed their powers they should be called to pay damages;
- at least in those countries where democracy still works, hodlers should vote out politicians backing any unreasonable or unconstitutional legislation or regulation, and vote in reasonable people who do not work to expropriate value from the citizens.

My dad passed in February because of COVID. He was in his 80s. (Had me when he was 60). I spent a lot of time with my dad but he was never very open about his life and past experiences. It was very hard for me because I am not close with anyone else in my family. That being said after he passed there was no will, so everything will be getting split 5 ways between his children. I have never met over half of these people and they where not present for my dads illness, or to help clean up the mess that was left after his passing. There will not be much inheritance for me because of this, but my father was into mining crypto and that was something we shared together. My sister had remove everything of value the day my father passed including his computer and some flash drives labeled ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù. This is very concerning to me because it was never brought up to the lawyer or in the probate. So really only I and my sister know of this. She and her husband are not very tech savvy but would have no problem taking everything without a second glance. My dad entrusted me to his safe key and password but she had removed the personal safe and broken into it before I was able to remove any items after he passed. 

I am simply asking for advice on how I could possibly proceed from here. Even with the flash drives I would be unsure of how to access the coins, if I would need a password, if I could avoid the flash drives all together. This is something that troubles me greatly everyday. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
I do have two of the main hard drives that were in his computer that has information/files with wallets.

Yes, the news came out and you may be excited but really this is a poor method to spend your crypto. **Don't spend your bitcoin using this method**.

\- Uses legacy payment rail system (trash)

\- Charges merchants a fee up the bum.

\- Charges you a fee when you use it.

\- Gas fees.

\- Only converts your crypto into USD.

**Have you heard of the Flexa network? Gemini pay uses it. More and more people are adopting the Flexa network because it does it best.** [**https://flexa.network/apps**](https://flexa.network/apps)

\- Converts your crypto into whatever the merchant wants to be paid in. Can be USD, Euros, Bitcoins, Ethereum, literally whatever... 

\- No gas fees when paying with crypto.

\- Instant payment with whatever crypto you use.

\- Merchants keep more money because it charges them less fees.

\- Is environmentally friendly (carbon neutral).

\- Uses a QR code on your phone rather than a card (online payment soon).

\- Uses an entirely new payment rail system which is incredibly more efficient and gives the user a ton more privacy. 

\- Fraud proof. Merchants are always paid.

\- Gives you a CSV file to do your taxes much easier. I could go on but I'll stop here...

npyemh,mrbiggelsworth07,Transitory hyperinflation and Capitulation,"Comments are welcome. 

Inflation: I am of the camp that inflation will be transitory, but it will be severe, scary, and unnerving inflation from July-August. I work with people who are saying ""why has shipping gone up so much"" and I've seen certain materials jump over 20% Just like covid, there is a lag time. We are starting to see the impacts of the factories that were running at half speed, the oil wells that weren't dug, and the chips that weren't made.

Capitulation: I'm also seeing A LOT of selling from people who entered around 10-20k and are selling off a large amount of their coins. Many people entered risking a lot and their spouse has said ENOUGH. Or, for them it was a trade, not a belief, and the fear of 17 is there. For those that sold at 50+, this decision right now looks like it to be the right one. I do no think the selling is done yet.

I am seeing a large amount of doubt from many people who follow the planb model as it's getting further away from the price. Yes, it's still within range, but the sentiment is negative. 

The interesting news is that I know quite a few people who were hesitant to buy a large amount at the highs but are now buying more. I think there is a real demand from many people who want to own at least 1 coin. This is a theme I am seeing more and more- ""I want to own one"".

  
For the people that do not own,  I have not seen buying. They are still more comfortable holding off buying currently.

Other than that, I wait for the news. Will there be:

npxl7x,Bank_of_Memories,ANOTHER STEP is done - listing on the Bank of Memories exchange," Here one could write a long article about the thorny path of two Ukrainian startups from the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.

Today we will tell you how two Ukrainian teams supported each other - the BTC-Alpha cryptocurrency exchange and the Bank of Memories startup.

[Bank of Memories](https://bankofmemories.org/ru/technology.html) is a service to save and transmit digital assets and memories to the future using blockchain. The service can store data, send messages to the future, and soon it will be possible to create family trees and inherit memories and assets.

BTC-Alpha crypto exchange is in the TOP 100 at Coinmarketcap.

Meet Vitaly Botnar, director of [BTC-Alpha](https://btc-alpha.com/). He hails from the picturesque Vinnytsia region, Ukraine. Vitaly took a chance and created a business with an average turnover of $ 1,500,000 per day. He achieved such a result in just 5 years.

Vitaly and his team survived crypto winter. Very often, projects come  and just want to raise funds, but sometimes they are not going to make a product. These projects have no chance to get to Vitaly's stock exchange.

 To be listed on the stock exchange, a startup must pay a large amount of money to prove its seriousness. **In 2021, Vitaly came up with a new listing mechanism for young and promising projects, namely** [Social Listing](https://btc-alpha.com/en/social-listing/global-bank-memories)**.**

**What is Social Listing?**

Such a tool is not provided by any other exchange, we have not found such.

A startup can bring about 3,000 of its followers to the exchange and ask them to vote for their project. This tool provides a unique opportunity for a startup to confirm its own viability, and as a result, attract funding without frenzied listing costs.

Bank of Memories originated from the neighboring Cherkasy region, Ukraine. Project‚Äôs author Andrey Melanchik is from Uman City. The project team has been moving from idea to working application since the end of 2017. During this time, a bunch of tests were carried out, and many different hypotheses were tested. Based on these results, Bank of Memories found the right way to develop the project.

The BTC-Alpha exchange believes that Bank of Memories is a project with great potential and therefore it was invited to go through a social listing.

Now anyone can invest in coins of new projects on the exchange, but a large number of coins or tokens in the cryptocurrency market are of little or no use. You need to carefully look at what problem the coin solves and how it is applied. If people are not learning about coins well enough, it could become a waste of money.

Social listing is an opportunity for investors, without risking their own funds (but only with bonus coins), to vote for a project and give it a chance to get support from the general public.

**How it works?**

* The investor/follower registers on BTC-Alpha Exchange and goes through KYC (identity confirmation) process.
* The investor/follower receives 100 bonus coins for voting. By giving these bonus coins to a young project, a person receives the project's coins, if provided for by conditions. 
* On the day when the project is gaining about 3000 fans, the day of listing is announced and a certain number of coins will appear on the exchange at a reduced price for those who want to buy these coins at the very beginning.

Thus, the project proves its necessity and viability.

Bank of Memories rewards those who have invested time and support the project and provides 90,000 GBM to be divided among 3,000 voting participants.

**So how do you support Bank of Memories?**

* Download the application, you will receive the first bonus
* Register on the BTC-Alpha exchange and receive 100 bonus coins, vote for the project 
* Once voting is done, each of the first 3000 people will receive a total of $ 10.50 in GBM coins.
* On the day of listing, a number of coins will be placed at a starting price of $ 0.35. There will be very few coins, since most of them belong to users, the team and investors.

You can find out about the prospects of the project and the possibilities of GBM coin  [ **here.**](https://bankofmemories.org/)",1622563820,3,1

npwzj7,BitcoinCanSaveUsAll,Thoughts on Bitcoins and today's USD/fiat currency prices of Bitcoin,"It seems as though these centralized exchanges have enough of us tricked into believing that the prices quoted on their websites and APIs in fiat currency is actually what our bitcoin is worth. This to me is absolutely absurd and the reason is really quite simple:

In my opinion, these prices are completely artificial. Think about it. How is it even possible for the first truly finite digital asset in human history with an ever increasing demand for expressed in a Fiat currency with no limit whatsoever?  


Simply put:


‚àû($) / ~18.7 MM (BTC) ‚â† $


At least not anywhere near the $ price quoted on these exchanges when considering  how many bitcoin have already been put into long term cold storage by OG HODLers who will never ever sell even close to their full stash regardless of the fiat price. Coupling the OG HODLers with the new money folks who are learning more about bitcoin and what it's really all about (hint.. Physical possession of your private keys and self sovereignty by running your own nodes) if we truly had the value expressed in a fair market where true supply and true demand determines the value of the asset in USD then something tells me we'd be orders of magnitude higher than they are today. 

It would appear that we are unfortunately still stuck in this moment where these bankster backed centralized exchanges manipulate the USD prices of our asset (peaceful revolution) since folks don't pull their Satoshis off enough to force a real price discovery to occur. Rather these exchanges use their trickery such as to rehypothecate and commingle folks bitcoin and use artificial trading volumes with bots trading back and forth to produce bogus fiat currency prices while their bankster good old boys rake in fortunes in USD via cash settled options etc.  Think about this:  why would the Elon Musks of the world want bitcoin to succeed if they can continue being fiat kings?  They could theoretically make huge USD by playing these financial reindeer games with their buddies who are all part of the cantilonaires club for as long as we accept USD as how we measure our wealth and but Satoshis (which to me is the true measuring stick). 

To me it would seem as though the only way to get truly free from the legacy financial firms price manipulation will be once the threshold of critical mass occurs where enough people HODL their own keys.  This however will require a seizmic shift in psychology of a sizable core who dollar cost averaging bitcoin HODLers whto immediately sent their sats into wallets where they are sure that they (and they alone) control the private keys. 

I truly believe that we are fast approaching our moment when enough people will understand not only what the fiat currency system is all about (control) , but also what bitcoin is (freedom) and how it's orders of magnitude more effective on not only the store of value aspect, but also in creating a more peaceful and just world for all which will stave off nuclear war amongst the top super powers of the world who are all vying for their currency to either continue being or to become the new world reserve currency.  If the masses have a free voting mechanism to vote for bitcoin (ie individual sovereignty) or to chose control of anyone they will chose freedom (bitcoin) when they understand what their real options are. Once that happens there will be no more super powers willing to kill millions of plebs to retain (or gain) financial control over the world as the true power will shift from the few to everyone who wishes to participate. This is IMO is what bitcoin is really all about. Human preservation and a transition away from a Fiat system that is doomed to failure or human extinction.  Hopefully bitcoin will get us through the great filter and BitcoinWillSaveUsAll.",1622562263,3,1

I understand that the underlying tenants of Bitcoin are based in Libertarianism.  However, Libertarianism and Conservatism have now essentially merged under the Alt-Right/MAGA/White Nationalist banner - at least in the U.S.

This group has been embracing authoritarianism for a while and are getting bolder in their desire to do away with democracy.  Authoritarians, such as Erdogan in Turkey, view Bitcoin as a major threat to their power and have essentially banned it causing the people that held it in Turkey to lose fortunes.

Bitcoin was intentionally hard coded to require *more* energy in direct correlation with its value, is in order to prevent the person with the most cpu from simply owning most/all of the btc among other reasons.

It was never intended to be ‚Äúenergy efficient‚Äù, in fact, the opposite is very much the case. 

In a very loose interpretation, you can think of btc as being backed by electricity and cpu in a sense.

If one day people decide that the cost of the electricity required to run nodes and facilitate transactions on the blockchain is no longer worth the reward, then Bitcoin becomes worthless.

nv7l6c,HonestyRewards,Today's crash is the greatest thing to happen to Bitcoin (and Crypto),"Hear me out.  Today's crash was caused by the U.S. Department of Justice revealing that they had  ""hacked the hackers"" who perpetrated the cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline, obtaining a ransom in Bitcoin.  The DOJ has now recovered that ransom from the attackers by hacking them: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/06/08/crypto-markets-crash-again-after-doj-seizes-23-million-bitcoin-ransom/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/06/08/crypto-markets-crash-again-after-doj-seizes-23-million-bitcoin-ransom/?sh=6b8ba980215a)

For any person involved in illicit or illegal activity using Bitcoin, the fact that the DOJ could hack their bitcoin wallet would have been terrifying.  This would have set alarm bells ringing and one course of action for all criminals holding bitcoin: SELL SELL SELL 

Of course, these sales negatively affected price today and likely caused plenty of liquidations of positions held by regular investors.   While this is a causing a shock dip right now, it is truly a watershed moment:  criminality is beginning to exit Bitcoin.  If you are a long term hodler or believer in bitcoin, you should be watching this dip with pride.  As the cryptocurrency rids itself of ransomware hackers, drug dealers and arms dealers, the currency will finally recover the legitimacy it deserves.  Over the next few years, the decreasing association with criminality will lead to greater individual and institutional adoption. 

P.S. For those who believe that the DOJ hacking a bitcoin wallet is an affront to the de-centralized principles of bitcoin and threatens the foundation of the currency, you are misled.

nv7c38,meteoraln,What's BTC worth? - is a hard question. What does BTC cost? - is a better question,"After BTC accounts start paying a 9% interest rate, I started wondering who is paying it. That is a monster interest rate. It's an important question because I believe in the no free lunch theory of economics.

We can debate all day what BTC is worth. You can argue about using market price or why it should be worth something else. It's not a productive question. Asking what BTC costs is a better question. It costs about $7000 worth of electricity to mine one. An Antminer costs around $20000. Using an Antminer, it will take you about 3-5 years to use up $7000 worth of electricity. In that 3-5 years, you have to hope that a new piece of hardware doesn't come out which makes your Antminer obsolete.

When BTC was at $60000, a free lunch situation appears. Why pay $60k for something that you can create for about $27k? Eventually, this all made sense. MARA and RIOT, which are corporate mining operations, decided to eat this free lunch on the billion dollar scale. MARA bought 100,000 Antminers. The bought everything available and are waiting for delivery on remaining units.

The only problem? BTC price changes every day. If it could take 3-5 years to find one on each miner, what if BTC price drops below the break even price of $27k? Even if it went to $30k, the risk is large for a barely profitable operation. But what if they could lock in the selling price of BTC, so that they could guarantee that their investment would pay off? Having BTC in those interest paying accounts allow someone else to short BTC.

It all comes together now. The corporate miners are the ones shorting BTC. They locked in their selling price at $60k. Minus electricity and equipment of $27k, we're at $33k profit. 3 years of interest at 9% on $60k gives an upper bound of $16,200. That's how much they pay to short BTC for 3 years if the price stays at $60k. Less if BTC price goes down. That still leaves about $14k locked in guaranteed profit on approximately a $27k investment.

Will BTC go to the moon? Maybe. But when the price of a good goes insanely higher than the cost of production, some big guys will come in and make more. There should be a ceiling on BTC price of around $60k for a few years. It will last until the next round of hardware changes the difficulty and raises the cost of production.

1. The BTC infrastructure or code was not hacked.
2. The US Government potentially had hacked the hackers to get their private keys, after reviewing the public ledger to know what wallets were paid.

Assuming the above, wouldn't this be a positive thing for cryptocurrency moving forward?  One of the largest detractors for the crypto industry is that BTC (among others) can be used for criminal activity.  While wallets are anonymous, every transaction ever done is on a completely public ledger, which in theory shows this as a use case where criminals would be less likely to use crypto for criminal activity as opposed to more likely.  

I know many crypto enthusiasts view the anonymity of crypto as a key draw of the industry, but others who look at it as more than that (global currency, faster/cheaper transaction times, inability of governments to cause inflation, etc.) would look at the removal of criminal activity as a positive, right?

so I am fairly new to Bitcoin. I think I understand the underlying technology quite well, but I can't figure out, how to actually use it. I wanted to buy some Bitcoin, just to play around with it and to understand, how to do transactions. So I created a Binance account and bought 15 $ worth of Bitcoin. But it seems, they only want you to buy thousands of dollars, because as I tried to withdrawal all of it to another wallet, it showed, that there would be a fee of 20 $. So I could not even do it. Of course, this kind of fee is not much if you are really trading with a lot of money, but for someone who just wants to try Bitcoin out for the first time its kind of impractical.

So my question is: How do you buy small amounts of Bitcoin directly to a desktop or paperwallet, without paying insane amounts of fees?

Aviation is a dead horse nowadays so my career is totally unviable unless I diversify. Its not difficult to work out how: I've held bitcoin since 2013 and my financial security is built 90% on crypto anyway. I'm in a great position to write about bitcoin &amp; how it can democratic global finance. 

Here's the problem: I've been furiously pitching commentaries about the El Salvador news - which I believe will sweep across South America first, then Africa - and the wall of silence is deafening.

The exact same pitching style that landed me commissions for a decade is completely ineffective. Commissioning editors, senior editors and publishers in mainstream media outlets *do not want stories about bitcoin changing the world*. They're embarrassed by their poor commentaries on bitcoin in years gone by; they're beholden to financial advertisers who rightly see bitcoin as the enemy; and they're too mentally lazy to think about the big picture. FT Group is by far the worse offender - by far.

Freelance journalism is a brutal existence, but with persistence it has good days where you feel like your voice matters.

I have a comment piece inside me that I know that can create one of those days.

I'm sure many, many other freelancers &amp; staffers feel the same way, but are powerless to act.

This is incredibly bullish.

However I'm concerned, we all know Bitcoin as it stands can't be a day to day currency due to speed, fees, through-put etc.. (yeah lightening network)

What happens when someone walks in to a cafe and asks to pay in BTC? they have to accept, its legal tender.
Even if they are set up and and understand it do they wait 10 minutes for 1 Confirmation? 
What if a taxi driver says ""I'm not accepting BTC""?

I just think this kind of mass adoption could expose to the masses the flaws in BTC we already know and accept.  Store of value, yes. Day to day currency, No.

I don't think the layman will understand that BTC is amazing at what it does... and what it doesn't do is buy a cup of coffee. And forcing this onto a country will expose its weakness to the uneducated and they'll overlook its strength. 
""Throwing the baby out with the bath water"" comes to mind.

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe El Salvador will invest heavily into the Lightening Network and educating its population. 
But I doubt it. I think this is more of a bold move without understanding the implications. to try and get ahead of the masses and hope it attracts the very wealthy individuals/company's to relocate to the country.
Which is a very good move IMHO but legal tender is too much too fast. 

I'm excited either way and glad I've got skin in the game.",1623227846,5,1

He came looking for a revolution and didn't find one on the podcast.

nvpdjr,ThreeD710,To Every Redditor that has downvoted my calls without understanding why I do what I do. Here‚Äôs a thorough explanation. Please take the time to read it as the learning would be immense even though you don‚Äôt want to follow my calls.,"1. How did I come up with this trading plan that I post? How am I so sure about my target and stop loss levels and how do I know the leverage that should be taken?

- So every trading plan has two parts. The first part is building the strategy that will generate the signals to buy or to sell and also helps you determine your stop loss and target. The second part is the execution of this strategy (where leverage, risk, reward comes into play).

Now, assume you have worked on and figured out a strategy similar to mine. Where out of every 10 trades, 6 trades are right and 4 trades are wrong (these are averages). So your accuracy is 60%. Also, when analyzing your strategy you realize that when it works, it gives a move of 4% (either on the buy side or the sell side) and that when it moves 3% against you, it for sure will go against you. So every trade that your strategy comes up with, you have a target of 4% and a stop loss of 3%. Now, let‚Äôs summarize the main stats of your strategy - 

1. Accuracy = 60%
2. Target = 4%
3. Stop Loss = 3%

Now, let‚Äôs do some quick math on this strategy that you are going to be using. Let‚Äôs assume 10 trades. From these 10 trades you are going to hit the target on 6 trades, which means you will earn 4% (your target) multiplied by 6 times which equals to 24%. 4 trades will hit the stop loss of 3%, which means 3% multiplied by 4 times, which equals to 12%. So after every trades, you stand to make 12% (24% from the wins minus 12% from the losses) based on your strategy.

So the above was the description of the strategy part.

Now I will describe the execution of the strategy.

So let‚Äôs assume you start with 10k as your total capital. Now, the first thing you need to decide is how much risk (i.e. loss per trade) you are willing to take per trade. Let‚Äôs assume you are comfortable with losing 1K per trade. Now we know from the strategy above that your stop loss is 3%, and we also know that you are willing to risk 1K per trade, so using these two pieces of information we can calculate your leverage. You divide 1000 (risk per trade) by 0.03 (the stop loss per trade) which gives you 33,333. Now 33k is 33 times of 1K, which means you can use a leverage of maximum 33x. Because no matter what happens, your stop loss is set at 3% of 33,333 which equals to 1000, which equals to the risk you are willing to take per trade. And as your target is 4%, you make 1333 on the 1000 that you use to trade.

So leverage can be used effectively when you have a strategy for the target and the stop loss and you are very clear about how much money you are willing to risk per trade.

Please note that per trade you will use 1000 at 33x leverage to have the effect of trading with 33k with a stop loss of 3% (equivalent to 1000) and a target of 4% (equivalent to 1333).


Now as your total capital is 10k and you will win 6 trades and lose 4 trades as described above in the strategy, and that your net winnings will be 12% viz. net winning 3 trades. That means after 10 trades, you can comfortably make around 4K (3 net winning trades of 1333 each).


2. What about those people who get liquidated when the use leverage? Don‚Äôt they end up losing everything?

- Yes. Actually it‚Äôs a combination of two things. They are getting liquidated because they don‚Äôt have a stop loss and because their risk is undefined.

Look at it this way, if you have defined your risk at 1K and you have a total capital of 10k, you can use either 1x leverage or 100x leverage and still have the same risk of 1k. What really changes is how far the trade can go against you till you get liquidated. With 1x leverage and a risk of 1k, you can actually wait for the trade to go 100% against you (which doesn‚Äôt happen) and only then you lose the 1k that you are willing to lose. But when you are using a 10x leverage, you lose the 1k that you are willing to lose when the trade goes 10% against you. When you are trading at 25x, you lose the 1k that you are willing to lose when the trade goes 4% against you. When you are trading at 50x, you lose the 1k when the trade goes 2% against you. When you are trading at 100x, you lose the 1k when the trade goes 1% against you.

So basically once you have defined your risk viz. the amount that you are willing to lose and if you have a strategy which tells you what your SL should be, you can come up with a trading plan and the appropriate leverage. The leverage totally depends on the strategy that you have worked on. If you come up with a strategy that gives you the flexibility of going upto 50% against you, then you really don‚Äôt need to use leverage.",1623221404,1,1

## Gayeski‚Äôs Views 

Being the co-chief investment officer of SkyBridge Capital, Gayeski‚Äôs comments on Bitcoin(BTC) have raised ample attention. Gayeski portrayed [his views on Bloomberg Surveilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Itci4vFUA4o)nce on Monday. He states¬† BTC will forever be considered the best investment option even despite the recent fallouts. Many corporates and investment firms became skeptical of BTC on its recent fallouts. Still, though, Gayeski states BTC will be a strong investment option for a long-term basis. He also stated that few business establishments might slow down their concentration towards BTC. This may be majorly due to the environmental aspects of mining BTC.

He put forward BTC will be a strong choice next to gold on aspects of digital currency for making investments. He proclaims on the longer run, BTC will only be of profits and nothing else. He adds the current downfall of BTC is majorly due to the recent halving which took place on May 11th.¬† Gayeski further continued despite the long run of the bull after a halving event, BTC will witness spikes soon

But here's hoping you guys find this as intriguing as I do. Disclaimer: I'm talking about US taxes and the IRS here. I realize we aren't all from 'Murrica...

As Bitcoin becomes accepted as legal tender in El Salvador, what does this mean for my taxes? Will BTC gains now be taxed as forex (foreign exchange) gains and dealt with using the 60/40 rule?

In the US forex gains are taxed using what is called the 60/40 rule where 60% is taxed as long term capital gains, and 40% as short term capital gains. Bitcoin has not shared in this so far.

I'm curious to see how this all plays out. Who knows?

nynzom,NegusNegust,El Salvador the stone that the builder refused,"After a tumultuous couple of weeks for Bitcoin and the crypto market, we‚Äôve finally seen a timely bounce, catalyzed by one of the most significant announcements of Bitcoin‚Äôs history.¬†
¬†
Before we get into that, let‚Äôs clarify the confusion which led to Bitcoin‚Äôs recent dip. It was reported this week that U.S. authorities recovered 63.7 Bitcoins worth approximately $2.3 million that was used to pay for a ransomware attack on the Colonial pipeline. How they recovered these assets hasn‚Äôt been officially disclosed, but it was most certainly not, as some suggested, due to ‚Äúan underlying vulnerability in blockchain technology‚Äù. (New York Times) Some reputable theories believe that the Bitcoin was transferred to a centralized exchange and recovered. Others say that authorities may have acquired data or accessed a server that controlled the private keys or account information for the Bitcoin. (Washington Examiner)
¬†
Presumptions aside, it is likely the transparency of Bitcoin‚Äôs transactions on the public ledger that aided the recovery effort. The Bitcoin network remains the largest and most secure network for transferring stores of value.
¬†
This leads us to the monumental news of Bitcoin now officially being recognized as legal tender in El Salvador. (CoinTelegraph) It was only in 2001 that the U.S. dollar replaced the col√≥n, their native currency since 1892. Bitcoin is now considered a currency and will not be subject to capital gains taxes for its usage. This, as Americans stare down the prospect of a possible 20% tax increase on capital gains, sounds borderline utopian. (Wikipedia)
¬†
The President of the Republic of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, promptly added the signature laser eyes to his Twitter profile to show his alliance with the Bitcoin community. The country will put infrastructure in place to power Bitcoin payments using the lightning network for merchants. Over 20% of El Salvador‚Äôs GDP is purely remittance-based, and with millions of citizens not having access to banking services, Bitcoin could save its citizens billions of dollars while increasing its economy through green energy mining.
¬†
The internet erupted when Bukele tweeted that he mandated the state-owned geothermal electrical company to develop plans to introduce Bitcoin mining powered by volcanoes and water vapor. (@nayibbukele on Twitter) This effort could harness excess geothermal energy to power Bitcoin mining and could lead El Salvador to quickly becoming a major mining competitor.¬†
¬†
Optimizing energy inefficiencies in current infrastructure is one of the most promising arguments for green Bitcoin mining. A prime example is Quebec, Canada, which alone has enough unused hydroelectric power to operate the entire Bitcoin network. (Documenting Bitcoin)
¬†
A representative of the International Monetary Fund told reporters Thursday, ‚ÄúAdoption of bitcoin as legal tender raises a number of macroeconomic, financial and legal issues that require very careful analysis."" (Yahoo News)
¬†
While the IMF is looking into the decision, the announcement has lit a fire across the world, inciting a wide variety of countries to consider adopting Bitcoin as a reserve currency or legal tender. The seal has been broken and, with El Salvador being first, no country wants to be last.¬†
¬†
Following suit, there are murmurs of Paraguay, Panama exploring similar initiatives. Congressional members of Mexico added laser eyes to their social media profile photos in solidarity and said they are moving forward in proposing new bills to embrace Bitcoin and crypto. In Central and South America, inflation concerns are rising, especially after the devastating ongoing effects it has had on many countries‚Äìmost notably Venezuela.¬†
¬†
Speaking of inflation, CPI data was released this week and it‚Äôs very concerning. Headline CPI hit over 5% year over year, which is the highest since 2008. This doesn‚Äôt take into account the substantial price increases that are being felt by consumers, from the grocery store to the gas pump. (CoinDesk)¬†
¬†
As inflation continues to rise above economist expectations, the cliche comes to mind: ‚ÄúBitcoin fixes this.‚Äù¬†
¬†
Keep in mind, in order for a country to add Bitcoin as a legal tender, it will require that country to acquire Bitcoin and hold it in reserves to help process and settle transactions and taxes. First, it was institutions and public companies looking to add Bitcoin to their balance sheet to hedge against inflation on cash reserves. Now, it‚Äôs actual countries.
¬†
Take it from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, who stated that he sees Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more as a gold replacement than something that could take the place of the dollar. Slowly, and then all at once, it looks like Bitcoin is replacing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.¬†",1623555912,27,1

They said I ""must withdraw the received BTC within 2 days, otherwise, the application will be declared invalid.""

I've been lurking over buying BTC for ages, could have been a millionaire had I bought in when I first learnt about BTC; been a skeptic and a believer after that, but mostly a skeptic probably due to me trying to make myself think I was right being a skeptic and that BTC was a scam - born in the 90s, everything is a scam to me. 

I'm seeing the huge opportunity of this current dip and really want to buy in, but I'm broke AF, need to move house (so even more broke), living on a tight budget, debts and shit, and obviously little to none disposable income. 

I know the main rule of stock and crypto is to invest what you can afford to lose, but I have this massive FOMO and, like most of you have said, this is a huge opportunity and probably never going to happen again, at this price. 

Is it worthwhile if I invest ¬£500 now? I can probably borrow and get ¬£1000, which I'll pay off eventually, but with some effort.

I know this chart seems very difficult to read at first glance because of the number of lines it contains, however, this may be the best support and resistance work you have seen in years. I don't know if there is another chart like this out there, but I want to make it clear that I didn't use any other work or graphical analysis as a reference for creating this ""chart"".  


This analysis was quite bold on my part, I always looked for patterns in everything in my [life ](https://br.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-VIDA/)but I couldn't believe that today I would find a possible pattern in something that could completely change my life and from many other people, maybe change yours, but that will only happen if you read what I'm writing and understand this chart.  


I dubbed this graph or analysis the ***Landz Logarithmic Curve*** after my name ""Landzz1"". I would like to mention that I still don't know if I put this work in Analysis or Educational since I will be explaining the idea trying to bring some theoretical points to support it, whatever!  


First, what is the **Logarithmic Scale**?  


According to Wikipedia, a logarithmic scale is a scale that uses the logarithm of a quantity instead of the quantity itself. Presenting data on a logarithmic scale can be useful when the data cover a wide range of values. The logarithm reduces the representation to a scale that is easier to visualize and manage. In the graph, as you can see, the farther to the right we look, the wider the scale becomes, and the farther to the left we look, the narrower it gets.  


***Whatever***, I'm not the Sherlock Holmes to stand here unraveling mysteries! I just want to know how to read this!  


Analyzing BITCOIN from 2011 to 2013 and also **Bear Market** that happened after December 2013 I could verify using the logarithmic lines that the price fluctuation *(up and down) of* this period does not quite correspond to the period we are going through. You can notice the difference in width from one line to another ( *Supports and Resistances* ) drawn on the first logarithmic scale (from the left), about the second (from the right) which is the one we are at now. **However**, I said, however, from the moment we concatenate each other, we can see in an **AMAZING**, **ABSOLUTE,** and **MAESTRAL** way that in which the supports and resistances are interconnected with each other. For **each line** intersection, if we draw a straight line to the right, we can see that it is part of a BITCOIN price support or resistance.  


As we can see in **Image (1)**, a horizontal line was drawn at the intersection points from the white line which is the line of which the ""**Top (All-time High)**"" is located, and as we can see, the result is ridiculously right.

 

Image (1)

https://preview.redd.it/x3z8ogywnw471.png?width=1467&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=576f973c6aae4e9d86f92f133ecdecfe161258e0

To further clarify the color scheme of the lines, from **red dotted** line to **white** line. **Note:** (The white line is not dotted as it is seen as the top of the logarithmic pattern). So, it's like from bottom to top, and the **blue lines** are part of a continuation so we can use it at intersections in a future projection.  


Now I will enter a point from which I bring the Logarithmic Spiral theory. Also according to Wikipedia, The logarithmic spiral was studied by Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705), who called this curve spiral mirabilis (Latin for marvelous spiral). The curve that forms with all the straight lines, located in its plane and passing through a fixed point of that plane, a constant angle. In practical real-life examples, we can find the logarithmic spiral in shells, hurricanes, and in the galaxy itself (the Milky Way).  


*Note: You can see in the graph that, as mentioned above, from the white line (the only one that is not dotted, top-line ""ATH"") all the blue dotted lines successively are considered as periods, where the colored lines of the current logarithmic, when they intersect, they will become support and resistance.*  


Although this analysis was done using the **1W** time period **as a base**, it is possible to **Zoom in** on a **1D** time period for example, and draw the horizontal lines at the intersections to find each of the supports and resistances. **Image (2)**.  


It's interesting to see how the lines narrow along the way due to the curvature of the logarithmical pattern, and yet the supports and resistances are there! **Voil√†!**

 In the next image, I'm going to bring in a three-dimensional aspect for people to see how this really looks like galaxy stuff. In **Image (3) it** is possible to see the logarithmic curves as if they were the rings of Saturn.  


Image (3) 

https://preview.redd.it/o8jgxc64ow471.png?width=1327&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aa97093583cb9e58dbcb7e3a03a9898f5a7476e

Finally and to finish this analysis as being the best support and resistance analysis you have ever seen in your life (just kidding, but maybe) I will show you the current path of BITCOIN and where will be its support and resistance lines that it will follow in the future. When the candles of Bitcoin moves to the next blue line, it will have support and resistance at the **Pink** horizontal line. See **image (4)**.

So, I end here my analysis of BITCOIN and I hope you liked it! Prepare yourself for the future, I'm not giving a value that the BTC will reach either up or down, but I'm already showing where all its supports and resistances will be in the future, so you can find the targets that best suit your analysis.  


If you have read this far, I would like to thank you for your patience, and if you work in any financial company or crypto company where is needed a professional analyst to draw and read macro charts even for day trading, please contact me, I would love to work for a company in this field. I am currently unemployed and that sucks!

Let's assume 2nd layer tech adoption increase as software gets more stable (lightning still shouldn't be used for large transactions) this will reduce the number of on-chain transactions required.

Imo at some point it will be absolutely required to increase the blocksize more in order to support 2nd layer solutions. I'm aware that segwit realistically increased the blocksize already to \~2.5mb.

What's your opinion on this? Couldn't find a nuanced discussion on this topic.

Since an absolute increase in blocksize would require a hardfork wouldn't this be perfect time to implement some proposals from the hardfork wishlist [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardfork\_Wishlist](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardfork_Wishlist). 

Another question, why is ""Increase currency divisibility""  a no-go as per the hardfork wishlist? Given that bitcoin will reach $1 Million, a single satoshi would be worth 1 cent, leading to fees that would be unlikely to support less economic rich countries to support 2nd layer adoption.

At the bustling Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, Congressman Warren Davidson, alongside United States Senator Cynthia Lummis, sat down to field interview questions. The interview took a turn toward privacy, with Davidson responding with comments on crypto wallets. 

‚ÄúAt the end of the year, if you think about it, Secretary Mnuchin was talking about banning private wallets,‚Äù Davidson said, responding to a question about the possibility of over-regulation in crypto. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a horrible approach,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt protect private wallets, someone is going to try to ban them.‚Äù

As Davidson mentioned, December 2020 saw the U.S. Treasury suggest strict overwatch on self-custodied digital asset wallets, with certain specifics, such as calling for more information from users transacting with wallets held away from crypto exchanges.
‚ÄúI wish the country would take the threat to privacy as seriously as they take the threat to the second amendment,‚Äù he said. The second amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives citizens gun ownership rights.

Taking her turn at a response, Lummis noted the importance of teaching U.S. government folks on Bitcoin. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to create a financial innovation caucus so we can use it to educate members of the U.S. Senate and their staffs about Bitcoin, its advantages, and why it is just such a fabulous asset to dovetail with the U.S. dollar,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt can be the underlying network, worldwide, to keep the dollar the global reserve currency, but still allow people to transact in a very freedom-loving way,‚Äù she said, adding:",1623614704,0,44
nz4mu6,SimonMillstw7J,The cryptocurrency market in 2021 is much different than the market of 2017,"There is no need to fear: The cryptocurrency market in 2021 is much different than the market of 2017.

Challenges stimulate progress. Technology, pretty much like life itself, cannot be static. Only dynamics stimulate positive changes. Amid the collapse of the cryptocurrency market in mid-May, many retail and institutional investors began to lose faith in the bright future of cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin (BTC) in particular. Corporations and institutions, whales, and early adopters converged in a single impulse ‚Äî the internet was overwhelmed by a wave of mistrust towards ‚Äúcryptocurrency number one‚Äù as the best defensive asset, superior to gold and everything else that had been invented prior.

One needs to see the full picture here to realize what‚Äôs happening. The last time the market suffered more or less comparable and significant losses was a year ago, in March 2020. This year, the panic sell-offs caused by a series of negative events ‚Äî Elon Musk‚Äôs Twitter crusade against BTC, the rumoured court case against Binance and the latest crackdown on crypto from the Chinese government ‚Äî bring to mind the tremendous collapse of digital assets at the peak of many asset rates in December 2017 and the succeeding ‚Äúcrypto winter‚Äù.
However, many people who have little understanding of how the cryptocurrency market functions do not realize the depth of changes that the space has been through in recent years. Emotions are the worst enemy of an investor or trader in a rapidly growing digital asset ecosystem. It is worthwhile to look dispassionately at the facts and analyze the changes to understand the true value of ecosystems growing on the fertile soil of the blockchain.The investment mindset has changed in recent years. Even though it continues to be dominated by a highly speculative component, there is also a practical application for the settlement. Investors switched from short-term speculations to the long game. The number of Bitcoin ATMs has doubled since 2020. This dramatic rise clearly demonstrates a growing demand for the world‚Äôs largest crypto assets. From a niche, the cryptocurrency industry has evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry.

Stablecoins ‚Äî tokens pegged to their corresponding fiat asset such as the U.S. dollar, euro, etc. ‚Äî have gained significant weight in 2020-2021. With the emergence of new platforms known as decentralized finance, or DeFi, protocols, opportunities appeared to offer profit without risks of the principal asset, for example. Such platforms are nothing more than distributed programs that provide clearing, custody and settlement services. Every year they take a larger piece of the pie from traditional financial institutions. The surge in activity in the environment of decentralized trading platforms also occurred because they do not have the same common vulnerabilities as centralized trading platforms in their infrastructure.

Decentralized exchanges outperform centralized exchanges in terms of trading volume, demonstrating a thousandfold growth in trading volumes in the last year alone. Interfaces for interacting with DeFi can be created by any programmer anywhere globally, and the essence of this interaction is the development of a financial ecosystem running on the global blockchain. By now, DeFi‚Äôs market capitalization has reached over $100 billion, and this trend will undoubtedly continue soon.

Related: The rise of DEX robots: AMMs push for an industrial revolution in trading

Speaking of examples, we can outline that even large companies like Deutsche Telekom have abandoned ‚Äã‚Äãprivate blockchains and are studying public infrastructure, supporting nodes in networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Algorand, Celo, etc. This fact suggests that the world of decentralized finance is gaining ground in the global market for clearing, custody and settlement services ‚Äî just as Bitcoin had previously secured the status of a shielding asset, removing gold from its throne.

We observe that corporate demand accelerated when real rates on dollar deposits turned negative (central bank rate minus inflation). Inflationary expectations have intensified over the past year, fueling demand for long-term capital preservation. Today, Bitcoin is successfully winning the hearts and minds of not only speculators and hedge funds who, realizing the inevitability of the devaluation of dollar balances, vote with their money and transfer some of the treasury liquidity into digital assets.",1623614585,17,20

While El Salvador adopts Bitcoin as legal tender, one Dutch official blasted the cryptocurrency, calling for an urgent blanket ban.

Pieter Hasekamp, director of the Dutch Bureau for Economic Analysis under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, published an essay entitled ‚ÄúThe Netherlands must ban bitcoin.‚Äù

In line with the essay‚Äôs title, Hasekamp lists a wide list of reasons why the Dutch government must enforce an immediate total ban on mining, trading and holding Bitcoin (BTC). According to the official, this could cause the price to plummet because Bitcoin ‚Äúhas no intrinsic value and is only valuable because others may accept it.‚Äù

dfsdf
The executive cited a common anti-crypto narrative, arguing that any cryptocurrency is unable to fulfill any of the three functions of money as a unit of account, means of payment and store of value. He also cited other common anti-Bitcoin arguments, such as security concerns, risks of fraud and scams, and argued that the crypto is useful tool for criminal actors.

Hasekamp said that the Netherlands has been lagging behind countries that have moved to ‚Äúcurb the crypto hype‚Äù in recent years. ‚ÄúDutch regulators attempted to tighten up the supervision of trading platforms, but without much success. The Central Planning Bureau pointed out the risks of crypto trading in 2018, but concluded that stricter regulation was not yet necessary,‚Äù the official wrote.

Related: Dutch regulators unsure of number of crypto investors in Netherlands

In his essay, Hasekamp paid special attention to Gresham‚Äôs law, a monetary principle that states that overvalued currency, or ‚Äúbad money,‚Äù tends to drive a legally undervalued currency, or ‚Äúgood money,‚Äù out of circulation. Calling Bitcoin ‚Äúbad money,‚Äù Hasekamp argued that Gresham‚Äôs law could work the opposite way with Bitcoin.",1623614294,19,0

The reason why it was so successful at the time (64k) had to do with the crypto being mainstreamed. Bitcoin was seen as legitimate when Tesla and the corporate titans threw their weight behind it. Now we are seeing a lack of confidence from institutional investors. The torrent of bad news coming from Turkey and China further depressed confidence. 

It took about 7 years for bitcoin to reach $1 trillion market cap. So it may take another 5-7 years for it to reach $2 trillion market cap. By that time the estimated cost of bitcoin would be roughly 100k. (If you did the math Market Cap/(# of Coins Mined)). I still think it's a good investment but I do not believe we are going to see astronomical growths anytime soon. People just need to hold it for at least half a decade to see gains",1623606034,50,0

Satoshi Nakamoto is, as indicated by his name, Japanese. Now there is something interesting about the Japanese language, which is that when they count, they don't group groups of 0's by three, but by four. They have this special character, ‰∏á, which means 10,000.

Now why does it matter? The distance between the earth and the moon is 384,400km. That is, 38.4‰∏ákm. Bitcoin has reached the moon, which is 38.4k, it even went too far all the way to 64k, but came back to the perfect level at 38.4k. As I'm typing these lines, bitcoin is extremely close to 38.4k, as the difference between 39.2k and 38.4k is less than 3%. Also notice how bitcoin has been oscillating around this level for weeks. As you can see, it cannot possibly be just a coincidence.

So again, be wary of all these posts telling you to keep investing, that bitcoin can only go up. You can invest now, you won't lose money, but you won't make any gains either. Bitcoin is officially on the moon.",1623668666,44,0

nzk1ly,economicsdesign,How to use options to hedge against volatility," 

Options is an obligation to do something. You can also limit your risk with this contract. The general idea is that options are really just a bet to do something or an alternative to do something.

&gt;Literally it means the option to buy or sell an asset at a specific price by a specific date.

So if you have a paper and you sign on a paper and then you have to choose four things:

* I want to Buy (action)
* I choose the $LISA (asset)
* At a price of maybe 2 bitcoins (strike price)
* By the 15th of January (expiry)

It's kind of like when you're young and you make a promise with your best friend saying that if you‚Äôre both single by 40 then you‚Äôre going to consider marrying each other. So you make a promise with each other and at that date (40 years old) or the options expiry date and you can choose whether to execute the contract.

By the time you're 40, you and your friend can say that yes we get married or no we don't get married. That is really just an option or a promise to do something. You don't have to do but if the contract buyer agrees then it will be done. Because of that you have to pay for it because this agreement is valuable because if both parties agree to execute it then there is value in that. Options are not free and you have to pay some money for it.

## Put vs Sell

Generally, there are just two types of options a call and a put so a call is to buy the option and a put is to sell the option. Let's say I want to buy $LISA at one bitcoin then I have a call option there so I want to buy it at this specific price then that is the agreement that we have. Or you want to sell $LISA at a specific price then that is the put option.

## Holding Underlying vs Buying Option

If the options are to buy or sell the asset then what's the difference between me just holding the underlying asset instead? Why do I have to buy an option to buy or sell the asset when I can just hold the underlying asset?

Because

1. **Stack strategies:** It gives you more varieties to play around with strategies so if you are doing trading or if you're doing a lot of different complicated strategies then options might be a better alternative because it gives you more variety and more leeway to play around and strategize.
2. **Lower cost/risk:** In financial terms, options are sometimes much better alternative. For example if you were holding the underlying asset then your losses could be unlimited because you could lose the entire underlying asset whereas if you're buying an option the losses can be limited depending on what kind of options you're looking at so in that financial aspect options can be a bit safer
3. **Less capital lock-up:** The other reason you want to buy options versus holding the underlying asset is that with buying options there's slightly less upfront amount of money to be paid so let's say options cost two dollars per option contract and depending on the strategy you're looking at then the maximum loss is that two dollars and also the amount of money you're putting upfront are that two dollars until you're willing to execute the contract so in that sense it's it could be friendlier in terms of of the financial aspects",1623667721,12,10

nzj5yv,gigicarlo_DE,Interview German Newspaper - BIS - Basel Central Banker," 

This Interview appeared today in the German Newspaper  ""Der Spiegel""

It is an ""automated"" translation. I found it interesting just to see the arguments of a ""Central Banker""

For me it would be interesting to have a view of this arguments from the community here

&amp;#x200B;

**About the person**

**Agust√≠n Carstens** is a central banker through and through. From 1980, he worked for the Banco de M√©xico, and in 1999 he joined the International Monetary Fund. He later became Mexico's finance minister, then head of his home country's central bank. Since 2017, Carstens has led the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel. The world's oldest international financial organization manages the foreign reserves of national central banks and plays a central role in monetary and financial policy events.

Agust√≠n Carstens (63) is driven by the Bitcoin phenomenon. The Mexican is head of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, a kind of super central bank. In an interview with SPIEGEL, Carstens makes clear how little he thinks of most cryptocurrencies - and why he nevertheless sees good opportunities for Facebook's Diem money, of all things.

&amp;#x200B;

**Interview:**

SPIEGEL: Mr. Carstens, the bitcoin price has risen dramatically since the beginning of the year, but in recent weeks it has plummeted almost as much. Is a bubble bursting, as critics of cryptocurrencies believe?

Carstens: In many cases, it is enormously difficult to judge what is still normal and what is a bubble. But in this case it's simple: this is a bubble.

SPIEGEL: Why are you so sure?

Carstens: The price has risen steeply in a short time, but there was never any reason that could have explained the increase. So it's hard to believe that it's not a bubble.

SPIEGEL: Is the financial system in danger?

Carstens: No, I don't think so. Bitcoin is a speculative asset, but on the other hand it is not so widespread that it endangers the system. That applies to cryptocurrencies in general. They are bought by individual investors, but not to any significant extent by banks. However, bitcoin is an environmental disaster. And the market is easy to manipulate - Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are vulnerable to fraud.

SPIEGEL: Explain that, please.

Carstens: These so-called coins are misleadingly called currencies, but they have no fundamental value. The current price depends heavily on who entered the market last. Individual investors can drive the price up first and then let it fall to make a profit. This ""pump and dump"" phenomenon is typical for niche markets.

SPIEGEL: Tesla CEO Elon Musk is such an individual investor who, thanks to Twitter, has proven that he has enough power to influence the bitcoin price enormously, in both directions. Does that mean Musk is a threat to the financial market?

Carstens: That's a question that the relevant authorities need to clarify.

SPIEGEL: Is the current regulation sufficient?

Carstens: We need to improve regulation. After all, the special thing about cryptocurrencies is that they have no nationality, but are at home in cyberspace, in other words, in a parallel world. Above all, we need to regulate the platforms on which cryptocurrencies are traded. And we need to make it clear, including in interviews like this one, that this is a very risky market.

""It has been shown, after all, that bitcoins have no practical use.""

SPIEGEL: Cryptocurrencies are becoming more and more popular. Could you eventually become a real threat to money issued by states - so-called fiat currencies - or even replace them?

Carstens: I am much more confident today than I was a few years ago that this will not happen. After all, it has been shown that Bitcoins have no practical use. Look at the example of Tesla: The company just decided to stop accepting Bitcoins when someone wants to buy one of your cars.

SPIEGEL: American chains like Starbucks and Home Depot do accept cryptocurrencies.

Carstens: Bitcoin is only good for two things - speculation and ransom payments. Cryptocurrencies are not a good store of value because they are so volatile; they are not a medium of exchange because they are hardly accepted; and they are not a threat to real currencies because they do not have the same purpose as real currencies.

SPIEGEL: But if corporations like Facebook create their own digital currencies, they could become popular very quickly.

Carstens: Facebook's Diem, initially known as Libra, is based on exciting technology and backed by the dollar. That's an important distinction from bitcoin. Facebook is not creating a new currency with it, but what are known as stable coins. And Facebook is discussing the concept with the authorities, which is something completely different.

SPIEGEL: But is the Diem possibly a Trojan horse if enough users join in and Facebook ends its peg to the dollar?

Carstens: I don't see that danger; moreover, appropriate regulatory precautions could be taken. But the Diem shows us: The next step should be for central banks to develop their own digital currencies.

SPIEGEL: Who needs something like that? People have cash, debit and credit cards, PayPal and other payment options.

Carstens: At first glance, there is no pressing need for central banks to introduce digital currencies. Cash is indeed one of mankind's best inventions. But as society becomes more digital and payment systems evolve, there should be a digital complement to cash. We need to transfer the trust people have in traditional money to the digital world. That's not easy. We have to do it well and seriously.

SPIEGEL: Could cryptocurrencies, if they become more dominant, undermine central banks' monetary policies?

Carstens: No, cryptocurrencies do not play a relevant role in the financial system today or in the foreseeable future. Therefore, they will not influence the monetary policy of central banks.

SPIEGEL: Do digital central bank currencies pose a threat to private banks? People could withdraw their savings at the push of a button and move them to the central bank in a crisis.

Carstens: No, after all, to prevent a run on bank accounts, there are a variety of regulations, monitoring by supervisory authorities, as well as state deposit insurance systems. Apart from that, central banks certainly have no interest in copying private banks and their services. A digital central bank currency accessible to the general public would, of course, also require very intensive interaction with the general public. Central banks don't have the capacity for that. For that, you will have to rely on commercial banks - just like in the current system.

SPIEGEL: Could digital central bank money make it easier for people who don't have a traditional bank account to access digital cash?

Carstens: Yes, that is an important aspect. People of all ages and social backgrounds can do something with cash. That's why we need to copy the advantages of cash for the digital era. We want every member of society to be able to use digital central bank money.

SPIEGEL: Bitcoin fans argue that a decentralized monetary system is needed to prevent monetary policy from being politically abused and interest rates and exchange rates from being manipulated, for example. What is your position on this?

Carstens: That's nonsense. Central banks have become much more transparent in recent years and decades, explaining their decisions and also regularly reporting to parliaments. Our priority is to control inflation, promote growth and thus also ensure employment. I believe that citizens understand that.

SPIEGEL: Do central banks need to hurry up and offer digital money?

Carstens: There is no advantage to being the first central bank to offer digital money. Rather, it is crucial that we do not allow ourselves to make any mistakes, that we protect this digital central bank currency against hacking attacks and that we preserve data protection. The technical challenge is great.

3/3

SPIEGEL: What might the financial system with digital central bank money look like in a few years?

""We don't want to abolish cash.""

Carstens: We will have more efficient payment transactions, more people will benefit from financial innovations. Money transfers - even to far-flung corners of the world - will become much cheaper. We don't want to abolish cash. Our promise is that we will create a technologically advanced form of money that offers the same benefits and more.

SPIEGEL: Will there be corporate digital currencies alongside it, or decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin?

Carstens: That's possible if they are strictly regulated. I see a future for stable coins if they are really stable, traded on platforms where there is fair competition, and if they protect consumers' data.

SPIEGEL: There are currently a lot of cryptocurrencies in circulation. Will they disappear as quickly as they emerged?

Carstens: It's nothing new in the history of money that currencies come into being and disappear again. Come to my home country, Mexico, and visit the money museum there. There you can see how many currencies there have been in our country. In the end, means of payment that are backed by a stable and independent central bank prevail. It may be that other currencies can exist as speculative investments, but not as money with all its functions.

SPIEGEL: So in the end, it's about what kind of money people trust?

Carstens: Yes, I think that's the central question.¬†

With leaders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk looking at using renewable energy to mine bitcoin. Bitcoin is essentially becoming the petrodollar for renewable energy.

Regardless of how you feel about Jack and Elon, bitcoin will be used for renewables. As Jack said, Bitcoin is a great incentive for renewable energy. Considering that all energy usage must be used on the spot or stored for later usage, any excess energy on top of that is wasted. Bitcoin fixes that problem. It allows for anyone producing energy to make an extra income by using the excess energy to mine bitcoin. With bitcoin becoming literally integrated into renewable energy systems, bitcoin is positioned perfectly to be the next biggest currency backed by energy.

Those who say proof of work is pointless and kills the environment is wrong. Nonrenewable energy is what kills the environment, proof of work is just a means to use energy. Combining proof of work with renewables is a match made in heaven. No pollution, more incentive for green energy, and more power to a network that is controlled by no Government.

Edit: TLDR; Bitcoins proof of work algorithm will be used for renewable energy. This will cause Bitcoin to be directly tied to energy production and essentially be backed by energy. This may cause bitcoin the be more powerful than the petrodollar.",1623715590,22,3

If I have and hold BTC, and need to sell for USD in the US, I will have triggered a taxable event and have to claim capital gains/loss and pay taxes.

Now that Bitcoin is legal tender in El Salvador, does this qualify as foreign currency and change the taxable event that could be less then 15%/25% capital gains? Or is it all just plain capitol gains?

Also, would a bank see this as holding an investment in foreign currency, and not technically just crypto currency? 

Just a bunch of questions I hope someone can walk through since this just happened.

Eventually, quantum computing is expected to be able to crack the ECDSA algorithim that Bitcoin uses. However, well before that point, Bitcoin will likely softfork and add a new quantum resistant algorithim that will provide additional security.

The problem is that each individual bitcoin owner will need to personally migrate their funds into a new QC resistant address. There will be those who neglect to do so, including those who are dead, as well as the wallet containing satoshi's 1million coins.

This represents a vulnerability as time goes on, eventually a powerful enough QC will be able to crack these ""lost"" wallets, flooding the market with stolen coins.

What are ways to prevent this scenario?",1623344572,16,1

nws2qb,carlosesteban,Some good bitcoin news from another country in Central America (Costa Rica),"This is news from back in April, but still good crypto news from another country in Central America. Not as exciting as what's going on in El Salvador, but interesting nonetheless.

In Costa Rica the government has a monopoly on energy distribution. A private company  can set-up a renewable energy power plant, but you have to sell the energy you generate to the government grid. Recently the government  stopped buying energy from some private companies, so a lot of them started  going out of business.

One of  these companies, which operates a hydroelectric power plant, survived by setting up a bitcoin mining farm using the energy the government didn't  want to buy anymore, and is now thriving. Part of their business model consists in renting rack space, clean energy and a fast fiber optic internet connection for anyone who wants to install their own mining rig there. This was reported prominently on the news, including Costa Rica's most widely circulated newspaper, La Naci√≥n.

I assume some of these other private plants (or even the  government itself) will follow. Costa Rica has great conditions for hydroelectric, solar, geothermal and wind energy production.

By  the way, in Costa Rica (and probably in many other spanish speaking countries) they refer to Bitcoin as ""Bitc√≥in"" (when pronouncing it, they put the stress on the ""o"" instead of the first ""i"", which sounds funny to me).

I'm imagining and extrapolating a scenario where more and more countries start tapping into their local volcanoes (or other sources) for basically free generation of electricity that would otherwise have gone wasted..

&amp;#x200B;

The difficulty will keep adjusting upwards, which will require more electricity (which wont be a problem for these places), but won't it still mean that it will become less and less profitable for each miner over time **as more and more miners join in**? 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, assuming though that the price of bitcoin keeps going up and up then it would perhaps cause the profits to stay level at least .. or rather *not be less* profitable over time.

nxe0ih,economicsdesign,Token Economics and Investment," 

From the perspective of an investor, who invests in tokens and token projects, we uncover what makes a good token economics so that investors are interested in investing in that. He also shared his top 3 projects with good token economics, opinions on yield farming and advise when designing tokens.

# 1. What makes a good token?

Number 1 factor is that there must be **concrete value accrual or value capture**. What does it mean? Tokens have something that is worthy for you to invest. The most popular token is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is investable because you can think of it as digital gold. It is a store of value because people believe that there is a scarcity in supply and (hence) value. The value did pretty well over the last 10 years and also has shown to be the most reliable token. So bitcoin is investable because it is a good store of value over the medium to long term.

**Store of value** comes from a very **huge network effect**. If you are like Litecoin or other smaller crypto, you will struggle to be a good store of value because money has a very huge network effect. It's just like USD. They have huge network effect. When you are using it, you are less likely to use other smaller currencies as your day to day transaction, be it your international commerce, and also financial activities. Most are denominated in USD. It is the same for crypto.

Beyond money, the other investable tokens are some tokens that give you some sort of value capture, like some **claim to the cash flow**, either through a direct reward distribution or have some sort of buyback and burn mechanism.

These are the one that make it a good token.

# 2. Summary of Good Token Economics

(1) it is able to **tokenise the economic value accrued by the network** so that it can be distributed to the users and the community. Because at the end of the day, one of the principle is that decetralisation also means equality or distribution of power to the community and users of the community.

(2) there has to be **very clear value accrual or value capture**. Either within the ecosystem or compared to alternatives or options outside the ecosystem and off-chain solutions.

(3) token is not just a one-off asset or thing to have one objective, which is probably a store of value. But a **token has a lot of other use cases** that needs to be tapped on like a way to bootstrap the ecosystem. It's **more than just one objective** that the token serves, but it has a lot more secondary and tertiary objectives that a token has to serve. To maximise the usage of the token, to maximise the existence of tokens in the ecosystem.

# 3. If you can have one advice that you can give to token designers or economic designers, what would you give?

To summarise, that would be one to **know your competitive advantage of using a token** as opposed to the traditional market where no tokens are being used because that is where the strength of tokenisation lies.

The second is to **use tokens to its utmost advantage**, to explore and leverage all the benefits that tokens can bring. It can be incentivising, reputation building, etc.

And lastly is absolutely **find product market fit.** Tokens are not a magic pill. It‚Äôs not Jack and the Beanstalk, when you have the pill or the beans and you can grow a beautiful solution to eradicate you from poverty. Tokens are really just a means to an end. Tokens are not an end to itself. Tokens can only help to accelerate growth if there is something about growing. That means, this product has good product market fit, that is much better than the alternatives in the space. People are willing to use it, to test it, to try it.",1623411925,2,1

nxddrk,Festortheinvestor,"Potential evidence the bull run is not over, it was merely interupted before its time.","In the chart below you can see the amount of days since all time high (ATH)

the first cycle all time high, dip, then around 1400 days (3.83 years) we reached a new ath, it took 4 years between highs. This cycle looks more volatile, with some sharp down spikes which must be contributed to short sellers, because i dont think bitcoiners over the past 2 years have lost faith in bitcoin, i think we have learnt more, progressed and evolved and now our belief is more powerful than before, so its reasonable to presume this isnt people losing faith, but markets short attacking bitcoin.

As per the chart, the recent ATH looks like it came around 300-400 days earlier than the previous, that happens to align with the stock to flow chart that says theres 300-400 days left of this bull run.

Bitcoin is code, it will do what we expect it too, but the price is getting manipulated.

take your bitcoin off exchanges. store them in software/hardware wallets, where only you a privy.

its like leaving your ferrari at someone elses house with your keys, they can go do what the fuck they want with it but for all intents and pruposes its yours, when you want it back you can get it but its values been dropped because theyve been fucking driving it, making it worth less on purpose probably, so they can offer to buy it from you at a discount. 

theyre the fuckers that scratched the rims, give them the bird, take your ferrari, clean her up good and stick it back in your garrage, where she will stay FOREVER!

take a loan against your Bitcoin when its valued at $700,000 a coin, buy yourself what you want knowing that in 4 years time there will be another halvening that will drive the price up again, then you pay off the loan with some of the bitcoins value appreciation, michael saylor is telling everyone this, what you need to understand is, is that he is giving you the master plan right there!

dont take forever to see the writing on the wall yeah...

&amp;#x200B;

summary - since the creation of so many exchanges, we need to be careful not to leave our bitcoin on an exchange, because hedge funds use them to short attack, drive the price down and play their stupid games. it can interrupt progress and i dont like it when people fuck with my money, so please consider my advice. the chart below shows how market fuckery interrupted a predictable cycle, by using media, short sell attacks, probably found a way to leverage bitcoin too by now, you know what theyre like.

the chart is courtesy of [https://stats.buybitcoinworldwide.com/days-since-high/](https://stats.buybitcoinworldwide.com/days-since-high/)

theyve got excellent tools on their site, i recommend you check them out.

as of the chart, and my understanding of the market, bitcoins supply is shrinking, we will reach a point soon where the supply shortage will be felt and demand that is everywhere at the moment will drive the price up, i dont think demand will ever stop, especially as utility grows (el salvdador)

 the original stock to flow chart shows this part of the cycle that we reach a new ATH in the coming months(1-12) as per the previous halvenings.

with code you know what to expect, humans too, we now have the tools to shape our financial future, use them wisely, consult the chart and look at what they forcast. I dont expect it to be plain sailing but i do understand the incredible technology i am using and so will everyone else eventually, furthermore Bitcoin makes you think positively about the future, it motivates people, its coming part of our ideology, people will see that.

until then, keep your bitcoin off exchanges secure them and start planning your future. 

Remind yourself the media is corrupt, biased. there are trustworthy outlets but realistically if you dont do your own research you'll skip right past the real signals, and mainstream media doesnt always inform, just look how uninformed your peers are.

1. What about the security of transactions? Is it as safe to transfer coins via Lightning as through a usual transaction in the mempool?
2. What about the fees? Who receives the fee and if the tx is free, why even bother using regular tx stored in the mempool? I get that it only works for micropayments, but can't you split a large tx into smaller ones and send it for free?

Pakistanis have been holding and trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for many years now. But due to some limitations, we couldn't buy through our cards and until now, the banks have claimed that they will cancel all the transactions related to crypto.

But how we buy crypto? We use P2P marketplaces like LocalBitcoin, Paxful, Binance, etc. We do a direct bank transfer to others and use other local methods.

It's not illegal per se, but not legal either. Since it's a Muslim country, a lot of people have a haram and halal debate about cryptocurrencies. But people are getting more awareness now. I believe that if it becomes legal this year, this will be huge. A lot of people will have access to Bitcoin and there will be a lot more buying and selling.

Nexo, Celsius etc offer interest accounts. 
Nice and easy option. But you are connected to the Internet so always a chance of being compromised from your side. 
And always a chance of the exchange being hacked. 
Not your keys etc. 

Mobile Wallets. 
More secure then exchanges/hot wallets but still not perfect. 
Ultimately wherever you go your smartphone goes with you and that smartphone has the mobile app on it. 
Would you carry thousands of dollars in your pocket? 

Hardware/Cold wallets. 
Best option so far. Stored offline. 
But if you are not comfortable with the setup process then decent chance of a mess up. Also chance of losing the device and details in a house move or something similar. Constantly having to check it's still where you left it, esp if your memory is crap or you easily get distracted. 

ETFs. 
Obviously not in the U.S yet and not your keys... 
But... and I'm prepared for downvotes.. 
This will be the best way for most. 
Investors know the concept from the stock market. 
You get the big boys.. such as Blackrock.. providing a low fee etf with
storage provided by someone like Gemini with some level of insurance .. with SEC approval... and possibly being able to put it in a tax free wrapper. 

Honestly for most this is the most attractive option from an investing point of view. 

I know hardcore bitcoiners will hate giving over control to a big institution but I think its inevitably going to be the best way.

nxbovl,JazzlikeScar,History Lesson about Exploits and Bugs and quantum computers FUD," On August 15th **2010**, Jeff Garzik discovered in block 74,638 that an unknown entity exploited a value overflow **bug** in **Bitcoin's** code. This allowed the attacker to create over 184 billion **bitcoin** amongst 3 addresses, well beyond the 21 million supply cap    


 Within five hours of the discovery, Satoshi Nakamoto published a new version of the Bitcoin client (0.3.10) with a fix that contained a soft fork. Network participants would soon pivot over to this new client and soft fork; by block height 74,691, they rejected the overflow transactions and adopted the ‚Äúgood‚Äù blockchain.    
 

But in doing so, the network essentially made previously-valid blocks, which included the exploited transactions, invalid. Though the community achieved social consensus on which chain to roll back to, rollbacks have received much criticism both inside and outside the Bitcoin community. The criticism stems from the implications of rollbacks, such as a revision of history, censored transactions, loss of funds, a higher likelihood for double spends, etc.

 

However, at this stage in Bitcoin‚Äôs life, the bug was perceived more as a growing pain. The price of bitcoin would jump from \~$0.07 and hit an all-time-high of nearly $0.40 later that year.  
source : [https://bitcoinbriefly.com/hacking-bitcoin-history-of-bitcoin-hacks/](https://bitcoinbriefly.com/hacking-bitcoin-history-of-bitcoin-hacks/)  


So if quantum computers managed To crack some keys ... and i think that's way down the list of quantum computer use , since we will see launched nukes without authorisation and reactors going critical ... infrastructures being crippled  before Btc is hacked .   
we will collectively decide that the exploited Blocks are invalid and hardfork to the valid chain with a better encryption , and the chance of that happening in our life time  is very thin .   
as Devs will fix that way before it even happens .

The seller was an old man (about 65ish years old I'm guessing). I asked him what was wrong with the phone and he said nothing but that it belonged to his son who unfortunately passed away.

I turned it on to make sure it worked and that it did not have a screen lock, it did not, he wanted $25 for it. Which seemed Fair since it's from 2015-2016.  

Coming home with plans to factory reset it and keep it as a back up in the event of my current phone breaking, I turn it back on and couldn't help myself from going through the apps before a reset and that's when I notice that there's a Bitcoin wallet, I open it and after a while of it ""catching up with the network"" it shows 26.86498 bitcoins.

My heart started pounding.  My hands shaking. Adrenaline is still rushing through my body. I sent about $500 of Bitcoin to my Coinbase wallet to make sure this was all legit and was able to sell and instantly PayPal my funds.

Now my question and concern is , do I legally own these?  Can I run into any legal trouble? And how do I go about paying taxes on this if I get to keep them?

Also is coinbase the best place to convert these to cash? Or what would be a better option? I'm sure my account will get either flagged or I will not be able to sell after a certain amount and I don't want to have to run into that problem. This is about a million dollars at the current price so how much is Uncle Sam cut ?

With the current price I don't think it's a good time to sell so Im transferring the rest into my hardware wallet that I bought and this will be kept in a safety deposit box.

""It would be great if Coinbase could add a charitable contributions section to make it easy for Coinbase customers to contribute to charities that accept Bitcoin or other crypto. With all of the potential scams out there, having charitable organizations vetted by Coinbase and listed directly on the Coinbase app would be awesome, especially since transactions within Coinbase are free and don't incur any fees. This feature would benefit the whole crypto community and do great good for Coinbase's ESG responsibilities. If Coinbase is not technically allowed to add such a feature, then build a non-profit sister site called Coinbase Charities that regular Coinbase users could interact with directly.

The different things he is saying seem to be half baked (great goal and great direction, poor planning and poor collaboration). Everyone must accept as legal tender. 100% green energy mining. Powered by volcanos.

Here's why I think compliance is going to be very hard. It's a great idea to have Bitcoin as a legal tender but to require acceptance of Bitcoin as a form of payment means that people who do not know the technology are going to be very quickly frustrated and annoyed and the lack of information and clarity and collaboration makes this whole thing probably very alienating. Add on top of this that for a lot of people who do not use electricity for their sales imagine any fruit cart that doesn't accept debit card or credit card but only accepts cash they must now accept electronic payments. If you are rural and low income, and your livelihood just got complicated all of a sudden by some, young, urban politician you're not going to like this change.

This has nothing to do with whether I think this is good for the country I think it is. But it's the psychology and economics of the social exchanges. This is very hard and it's going to make you very unpopular and it is the kind of thing that makes thousands if not millions of people ticked off right away.",1623456594,10,1

nxrt1k,anonbitcoinperson,Using a per transaction metric to talk about bitcoin energy use is disingenuous and intellectually lazy. Here's Why: (x-post from r/cryptocurrency),"I posted the following post on r/cryptocurrency because I was looking for a debate.  Perhaps here people can add to the arguments I have made:  
 
The ""PER transaction"" carbon, electricity and e-waste metric is such a deceitful metric. Anyone who uses it is willful ignoring that:  

* there are several other chains that are merge mined with the same hashpower as bitcoin (Syscoin is one of the biggest).  So does syscoin have zero carbon responsibility because it uses BTC's hash in merge mining ?  The authors of such metrics would like us to believe so.   

* There are hundreds of thousand of transactions that take place on the Lightening network.  Why are the authors of these ""per transaction"" metrics willfully ignoring all the activity on the Lightening network ?  Is it because they are to lazy to actually figure out how many transactions are taking place ? Or are they trying to push an agenda?   Besides lightening network, there are other layer 2 networks, like liquid.  Where thousands of transactions take place.  

* The current hashpower secures ALL PAST transactions.  The current hashpower isnt just used to write the current transactions in a block, but its used to secure every single previous transaction in bitcoins history.   

* The block reward is more than just a normal transaction.

 The block reward can be considered as a kind of battery whereby the electricity used to make hashes is transformed into a more easily kept and stored unit.  In a way,  these newly created bitcoin can be considered as a form of stored electricity.  The electricity used to create those bitcoins gets transformed into unit of accounts.  These units then can be transformed back into electricity via purchasing power that the BTC units have.  Or even more literally, they can be used to hire mechanical work from humans or other machines (using BTC to rent a generator that produces energy, or renting a solar array to charge a battery).  So figuratively the block reward acts as a sort of battery.  The energy isn't ""wasted""  its merely transformed into units that can be more easily stored over time and sent across the planet.  

The bitcoin energy usage discussion is a very nuanced one, and I believe it's very intellectually lazy to try to use comparisons of ""per transaction"".  Lets look at GPU gaming.  It uses more electricity than the bitcoin network, but it doesnt generate units of account that can be used forever (or as long the BTC network exists).  It just generates fun (at the time) and perhaps some fond memories.  
  Or take a look at x-mas trees lights (https://phys.org/news/2015-12-christmas-energy-entire-countries.html)  They can be considered not very useful in that they only provide ascetically pleasing lights for a tiny period, yet consume the amount of energy as small countries.  But again, bitcoin energy is transformed into units of account that can be used for as long as the network exists.  

Using a per tx metric to talk about bitcoin energy use is disingenuous and intellectually lazy. Bitcoins energy use is a more nuanced conversation than just ""per transaction"" so be suspicious of anyone trying to promote ideas about bitcoin based on them.",1623449920,24,1

nxre88,RealJukeShit,Why I think Argo Blockchain is the future of bitcoin mining.,"Argo blockchain is a crypto mining company that focuses on green energy. They are helping to lead a miners coalition and push for renewable, sustainable mining techniques. They focus primarily on hydroelectric power, but have been setting up more wind powered rigs in Texas. They mine bitcoin, and zcash. Here are the reasons why I think Argo is the future of mining.

1. Margins are insane, they profit about 80% + for every coin mined. Just goes to show how much energy consumption matters. They can still remain profitable when bitcoin is 8k.

2. Diversified company, with stakes in Defi(WonderFi) also in NFTS

3. Peter handles ignorant questions well( See CNBC interview) Peter Wall has a background in media and is a great face for the company as well as a growth oriented CEO.

4. More institutional support, added to Bitcoin etf MSCI, IMI, black rocks ishares

5. NASDAQ listing is in the works to attract more American investors.

6. Argo has a similar hash rate to MARA  with 1075 peta hash (1.075 exa hash)

7. Texas facility being built = higher hashrate, also an expansion into wind power further sets them apart from fossil fuel miners.

8. More transparent than any other mining stock(I‚Äôm talking about you üÜò) Peter will answer any investor questions on his YouTube page, and they release frequent updates.

9. Absolutely no debt. Mara owes about 387,000$) Nuff said.


I personally think Argo is going to be best in class. Practically all the other miners use unsustainable techniques to mine their coin. As the push for green mining increases I can see RIOT and MARA falling behind. They may mine more coins, but Argo does it better.(imo)

Question 1. 

I see many people say that cyrpto will take over fiat currency, or eventually even make it irrelevant. Is this the general consensus around the community? How so, If cyrpto derives it's value from fiat?

2. Taking from the 1st question. How is it that if cyrpto derives it's value from fiat currency that it can remain decentralized? Would putting it in govt and financial institutions hands would lead to regulations? 

I had I 3rd question typed  but I answered it myself. About new crypto currencies appearing so quickly. 

Now these are the 2 questions,I have that I believe many people have along with the explanation of why  they should pick a currency and which one, and how it benefits the world. 

A concern I have not necessarily a question is that in order for crypto to grow and be sustainable as a store of value and help trade especially for impoverished nations, which from my understanding is it's purpose, then then it needs rapid widespread adoption for it to be achieved.

It'll be interesting to see what happens to big coin &amp; our beloved memerzs after this weekend. The G7 summit is this weekend, and there has been growing pressure on Biden to speak about big coin taxation &amp; regulation. It's perceived as a threat to the US dollar. Especially with El Salvador adopting it as legally tender; it's only a matter of time before all of Latin America starts to buy it up (essentially guaranteeing a profit in a similar fashion to what Musk did when announcing Tesla's purchase of it).

o0tm9j,Ismoketomuch,"Fox News passes on Bitcoin stories because ""It wont play with Poor African-Americans""","On the latest Project Veritas video Ivory Hecker leaks video conversations between her and her boss, Lee Meier, Assistant News Director. 

In one of the clips, Lee Meier says ""I may say, yeah and Bitcoin for a poor African-American audience at 5(pm), its probably not going to play"" 

Also, ""I have passed on dozens of Bitcoin stories""

Here we have yet another example of the Media creating FUD around Bitcoin. We have lots of examples on how the media uses double speak, saying something and then saying the opposite, like stories about how Bitcoin is good, then Bitcoin is bad. 

I would like to take this moment to point out that the media also lies by omission. Purposefully not reporting on, likely, positive stories about Bitcoin. I am going to take a lead and assume that the ""dozens of stories"" that she passed on were Positive stories regarding Bitcoin. 

I would also like to make another assumption; Lee has a directive to not let African-Americans know about bitcoin. They want to keep Bitcoin a secret from as many people as possible right now. It seems really F\*cked up to specifically target African-Americans for anything let alone Bitcoin. 

Here her argument is that poor black people are not interested in Bitcoin. Poor people are the ones who need Bitcoin the MOST! They want to keep black people poor, and deny them the knowledge of Bitcoin and its financial opportunities. 

Im not trying to make this political so I will not address the rest of the videos topics. Positive information regarding Bitcoin is being omitted from poor people. We need to continue to tell our friends and family about the financial benefits of investing some capital into Bitcoin. Its still early and we all know that, so help your friends and families become familiar with Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. 

If they ask you questions you dont know the answers to then you have some learning to do too. Educate yourself and then follow back up with them. This subreddit is a great place to ask questions as well because you will get good information from the community.

&amp;#x200B;

**To calculate the percentage increase:**

1. First: work out the difference (**increase**) between the two numbers you are comparing.
2. **Increase** = New Number - Original Number.
3. Then: divide the **increase** by the original number and multiply the answer by 100.
4. % **increase** = **Increase** √∑ Original Number √ó 100

I go to cash it out, enter in the Bitcoin address and at first it sends me an email I need to confirm before the transfer goes through.

I searched high and low but couldn't find anything like this idea. So it is either so simple everyone is doing this OR a very stupid idea. So that is why I need your help on this.

Create 2 paper wallets. Poor in all the bitcoin into 1 of the 2. If I need some bitcoin later I do a backup of wallet 1. Send whatever I need to a hot wallet to be spend. Send the rest of the funds to the (hereto empty) second paper wallet, swiping the funds of the first paper wallet. Everything minus the funds in the hot wallet are now on paper wallet 2. 

This way the cold storage stays as cold (offline) as possible.

Is this, in your opinion, a safe protocol? Or am I missing out on some important stuff? Any thoughts are welcome!

P.S.
As a side note. The wallets are going to be made out of SS316 with the seed words punched in. Is anyone interested to see the build process? If so, let me know and I will document it for you guys and make a nice tutorial on the whole build. But let's first focus on the ""2 paper wallets sollution"". üòâ

o185ub,Ernesto_Alexander,Impact to BTC by an Economical Collapse Occurring This Year?,"As most of us know, we are on track to repeat exactly what happened in the 2008 collapse of the housing bubble. This time it is in the form of loans to businesses (as well as mortgages) and other debt. Mainly COVID and a little bit of the meme stock shorting are some catalysts. Powell is speaking today and lets assume he drops some bombshell news and lets assume this collapse happens this year. Lets assume the same bailouts also happen. Basically a repeat of the 2008 crash. What happens to BTC?

This is the scenario that BTC was originally created for, it was created as a result of the 2008 crisis.

I mean average joe retailers may need to cash out to support themselves, or cashout out of fear, putting downward pressure. The correction from $60s to $30s probably drove out many ‚Äúpaper hands‚Äù and consolidated BTC, so maybe there wont be that many average joes to drive the price down.

o1to2z,Begeegs,Suppressing Bitcoin Price,"Apologies if this has been posted here before, but I would like to hear some opinions on what would happen when government agencies work in concert with regulatory agencies to suppress the price of Bitcoin.

The way that I see it is that the Fed can and does print dollars wholesale, but with Bitcoin looking like it will rival Gold and eventually the dollar, what can stop this printing machine and the private banks which encompass the Fed from keeping the Bitcoin price in check. Given that in the past that Central Banks have admitted to having this practice with Gold, I fully expect that the same will happen to Bitcoin.

We also know that the SEC will do nothing about naked short selling, so this is also a factor which could also contribute to this keeping that price in check.

So in essence, you have large private banks which have an unlimited printing capacity and/or naked short selling which could potentially stop the growth of Bitcoin and the potential adoption globally.

I could see this price suppression occur until a relevant CBDC is issued by any global Central Bank whether it be China, USA, etc.

What is everyones thoughts with this?

Edit - the basic premise of this post is the eventual rivalry that Bitcoin presents to Central Banks. If El Salvador is a success, others will eventually follow this method. I would argue that it is a matter of time in which this starts elsewhere. Perhaps not in the official capacity, but rather something that is quietly adopted as not to incur the wrath of the US.",1623924444,20,0

It's like that 'Winter is coming' feeling from Game of Thrones - you don't know how long you have to prepare, but you know that when it comes, it's going to be devastating. I know I'm being a little irrational, but sometimes I just can't help entertain that lizard part of my brain that's raising my hair and sensing danger in the horizon.

My hope is that The USD doesn't crash before the bull run after the current one, so perhaps some time after 2026. By this, I mean that the USD would last for a bit of time after 2026 to give me time to concern whatever fiat I have left to concrete-hard assets, or more crypto.

o1rtj1,Ok_Response_3929,Educate others through free bitcoin books all around the world,"Bitcoin is the internet of money. But not everybody has access to the internet or interested in Reddit/Twitter/Youtube. Sadly, a big percentage of that 'everybody' are the ones that are going to benefit the most from such a network.  


You have been sending videos of Andreas to your family or try to explain/educate your friends about it and they think you are crazy/annoying or you just live your bitcoin life in a bubble (podcast, Twitter, Reddit, bitcoin WhatsApp/telegram group all day)...This path has worked for some cases...but I feel to reach Hyperbitcoinization we need to act as a community and don't depend on Governments (El Salvador) or institutions preachers (Jack or Saylor) to defend what we believe.  


For me, bitcoin is a vote. It is a vote against dictatorship, censorship, surveillance, monetary control and oppression to the ones below in the monetary pyramid. But uneducated people don't know or understand such power of bitcoin, they only see the price or the news about it or just ignore the bitcoin person.  


*How to spread the education of bitcoin outside the internet? How can we educate millions effectively? How can we organize ourselves to spread the word of such disrupted technology?*   


For me the answer to such a question is clear. Physical books.  


Books had helped me a lot to understand such values. I believe if people see such values, can understand why we need such technology for shaping a fairer future.  


Why physical? Because they have more tangible value than a pdf or a kindle book, they have a physical presence, it is difficult to ignore them than a file on your phone/computer. 

  
*How can we spread hundred/thousands of physical books to people all around the world?...*  


Where I live, it's common to put your books on a corner in the street or near to a building when you had finished it with the goal of sharing such content/knowledge with somebody else, for free. Therefore, the following idea came to my mind:

**Is it possible to organize ourselves (3.1M members) to buy a single BTC book and put it in a corner of your street and wait for a curious mind to grab it? Probably that curious mind will share it in the same way he/she/it received? Such a pattern can repeat several times, increasing the network effect, but more importantly, educating the real values and vision of bitcoin for those outside the internet, your inner circle or social media (Twitter, Reddit...).**",1623916952,2,3

I then mystery shopped them anonymously and asked what their policy on crypto was. Their response was a resounding ""No and we'd close your account immediately"" so I guess I'll be closing said account/s tomorrow and shopping for a more crypto friendly institution.

Can I suggest you make a quick anonymous call to your current bank and ask them what their official policy is... You may be unpleasantly surprised however at least you'll know in advance and won't have your account frozen and closed when you start taking profits...

o1pdip,l4m8d4,I sold my initial investment,"Hello there,

I just decided to sell my initial investment in BTC against the evil fiat. I intend to probably never sell the rest, which is already more than double of my initial investment (at the current price anyway). I am still more bullish on Bitcoin than ever before, but I also noticed my irrational fear during the last dump. I didn't panic sell but I felt the pressure, and I need to focus on my life and become more detached from the current price. So if the mother of all bogdanoff dumps occurs next week, I will not sell and I can continue to stack later.

Now probably some people will say that if I sell any Bitcoin now, I will just buy in later again at a higher price and make a loss. It may be true, but even if, I don't have the same degree of irrational fear. I will be there when Bitcoin goes to the moon and probably when it comes down again.

I'm not sure what I'm even posting this for, maybe I just feel the need to justify myself for selling the best thing ever, that everyone wishes he bought earlier, to buy mediocre fiat, but I would also like to know: How do you guys handle this? Am I still to immature for these markets? Am I thinking about this the wrong way?",1623907385,59,3
o1pal1,immerzzio,Bitcoin is more than a hedge to inflation. It will be the cause of inflation.,"What is the difference between BTC and all other hedges such as precious metals, stocks and real estate?

BTC hasn't been recognized as currency by the USA, but by function it serves the same purpose of fiat. It's the only hedge against fiat that you can use like fiat. If BTC is seen as a currency, it's been deflated. Deflated to the point that it now holds a 40,000:1 ratio to the dollar. When BTC buying power goes higher, it's essentially the same thing as deflated currency.

Why is this a threat to fiat and the cause of future inflation? 

In the future, wealth will come down to whoever had access to crypto in the early stages. This will cause a new wealth divide which will further exacerbate the situation.

The majority of fiat would of been converted to crypto and marketcap will be in the 100 trillion+. This will be due to the infinite deflation of BTC and infinite inflation of fiat. Why do I use the word infinite? Because it won't stop.

Also, Microstrategy will have so much power in the future that they will be purchasing countries or loaning out BTC as the Federal Reserve does with fiat, because they need to be bailed out of their country monetary inflation.

They use it to barter, pay bills, trade, and as a means of exchange for goods and services.

I was trying to gift some Bitcoin to my nephew and like a lot of posts I see on here, the whole process is awkward. Trying to decide how to safely store the coins, keep them separate and also manage the keys when the parent has an understanding of Bitcoin or Crypto in general.

I came with a solution [https://getnested.co/](https://getnested.co/) which I would like to know what you guys think about!

* Nested would allow anyone to create a specific wallet for a child in which they could buy and store Bitcoin. The wallet would have a predetermined lock-up period (for example when the child is 18) that would be set by the wallet creator. 
* All of the bitcoin would be stored with a 3rd party custodial company and always be in cold storage for maximum security of the fund. 
* The account owner could then contribute monthly and also invite family and friends to contribute to the fund if they wanted to. Due to the simplicity of the wallet the fees to purchase Bitcoin will be much lower than established exchanges such as Coinbase.
* Each account would have account ""guardians"". The ""guardians"" would be family or friends that have a vested interest in the child. Any withdrawals from the account prior to the pre-determined lock-up period would have to be approved by the guardians to ensure that the child is the recipient of the Bitcoin. 

Would love to hear what everything thinks about this idea and if it would make it easier to gift bitcoin to minors",1623966074,16,1

I have been fortunate, through certain circumstances, to have come into a financial situation that has allowed me to secure my future. Using the corrupt fiat system I invested into Bitcoin, so much so that my anxieties about the looming fall of the world economy and how that will affect me and my family, have dissipated.

I believe whole heartedly this is the future, I do my best to spread the word and educate the people I know about Bitcoin and what it can do for them.

This community has provided me with much information and news allowing me to constantly learn and grow as an investor and supporter.

It feels great to be a part of a revolutionary economic and societal shift, and in the face of this dark cloud of fiat that has been hanging over our heads there is a ray of moonlight piercing through the dark night showing us there is light on the other side.

I'm a very busy person. I'm old. I'm occasionally curmudgeonly. I don't have time at this point in my life to spend it researching and buying the parts to make a Bitcoin Lightning Node.

There is a market out there for someone to make ready to go Bitcoin Lightning Nodes that require little to no setting up. I am sure there are thousands of people in this sub in a similar position who REALLY want to support Bitcoin but are equally lazy (yes, I realise I'm a lazy bastid.)

o270tr,plaxtito,Bitcoin death cross nonsense,"I'm a little annoyed by the non-data-driven trading *wisdom* like selling at the typical MA50 / MA200 Bitcoin death cross nonsense. Here our current arising death cross:

[death cross nonsense](https://preview.redd.it/jjjjnxc9uv571.png?width=2550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45c12c715937360b177ce845feaa240ea8e04be5)

I was wondering why so many people just put up with this without doing any data-driven simulations on it. With a simple python script I have compared the death cross strategy with the bitcoin HODL strategy. Here is the result:  


[HODL vs. death cross](https://preview.redd.it/uuz4ljvgvv571.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=434addca5d2cdf6dd59e58854386baaeb66b1b85)

The death cross would have turned $ 1 into $ 22,000.   


Sounds good right?   


But HODL would have given you $ 812,000. You would have missed -97.3% performance if you had listened to the death cross. Of course, historical backtesting is no guarantee for the future, but at least this data-driven analysis has brought the big picture closer to me.

Tonight I found 2 crypto esche strings along with the site for the miner I used in 2012-2013 (50btc.com). Neither of these look like a BTC key (one starts with P one starts with Q) and now I'm wondering if that is the mining credentials, the site went down a few years ago, and I never stored the keys, so it's gone... Anyone have any insight on this? Thanks",1624068172,4,2

o35pgm,adaoeovo,Historic SHORT Squeeze,"Bitfinex BTC shorts are, on fiat worth, all-time high rn, and we do have the liquidity to pump and squeeze it. Institutions could be planning this move right now, or maybe it's already in play, I don't know, but the next 3 days are gonna be WILD. For either side.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/BTCUSDSHORTS\/](https://preview.redd.it/4608n2pco4671.png?width=1318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6854466148d2072023ae8d121e9abc29e33355e9)

As the Bitfinex graph shows there are 22102.9349 BTC in shorts right now, roughly $828 million dollars, if it starts getting squeezed we'll see a MASSIVE pump, which would have enough liquidity for those institutions to do whatever they want, take profit, or maybe drive BTC to its new ATH, taking the asset completely out of the woods, which would be fantastic for public institutions holding it, such as Tesla and Microstrategy. The shorts were placed at regular intervals, so if we get to liquidate the first wave, we'll surely destroy the whole market maker's fund.

Also, we are exactly at the price Tesla acquired $1.5 billion dollars worth of BTC, going down below it would take TSLA down, so, knowing Elon, we can expect heavy resistance on technical points.

We didn't touch the previous trend low, so daily is still technically bullish.

Longs have almost always had more volume than shorts, you're not going counter the wave by shorting bitcoin, you're doing exactly the opposite.",1624068064,129,18

o3j6rp,emilyjackson297,Bitcoin will win the SEC BATTLE,"U.S. regulators have once again punted their decision on whether to approve a Bitcoin ETF.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said in a Wednesday regulatory filing that it will seek more public comment on a proposal to list a product on Cboe Global Markets Inc. It‚Äôs not the first time this year that the SEC has delayed giving an answer to the legions of crypto advocates pushing for a way to trade the largest cryptocurrency in an exchange-traded fund format.

Crypto enthusiasts have long been frustrated by the agency‚Äôs reluctance to sign-off on a Bitcoin ETF, a product that could catapult the world‚Äôs most valuable digital token into the mainstream among institutional investors.

There were predictions earlier this year that the regulator would be more receptive under SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who once taught classes on digital assets at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But since he took the reins in April, the agency has continued to express concerns that crypto exchanges lack oversight. And it has laid out fresh warnings about the risks of mutual funds investing in Bitcoin futures.",1624118248,25,6

o3io39,shleebs,How to generate a Bitcoin offline cold wallet without hardware. Don't give your data to hardware companies or anyone else. üîí,"This guide is to safely create a free  cold wallet offline, without a hardware wallet, without a command line, &amp;  without giving personal data to wallet companies. The recent phishing  attacks stem from leaked customer data. I *tried* to make this simple, but if it's too much, just go buy a hardware wallet &amp; don't get phished.

Don't  spam me saying it's too hard to spend coins. It's supposed to be hard.  You should still have a separate hot wallet on your phone for everyday  spending. Cold wallets are for HODLing. I give three different methods  for cold wallet spending at the end: One that's hard &amp; safe, one  easy &amp; safe-ish, and one super easy &amp; unsafe. READ THE WHOLE  GUIDE FIRST:

&amp;#x200B;

* Create  a bootable Ubuntu USB. This ensures no malware when we create a wallet  because it's a fresh Ubuntu installation. It's super hard to compromise,  and you're not a target. Everything done inside this bootable operating  system is saved in RAM and forgotten. Nothing is saved to your disk:
   * [Ubuntu USB guide for Windows](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows)
   * [Ubuntu USB guide for MacOS](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos)
   * [Ubuntu USB guide for Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu)
* Boot into the Ubuntu USB drive:
   * Restart  your computer, and if it prompts you to boot from the USB, do so. Or it  may just boot into the USB without a prompt. In either of those two  cases, skip ahead. If it doesn't boot into the USB, follow this guide:
      * [How to boot from USB on a Mac, PC, &amp; Linux](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/articles/usb-boot/)
   * Once Ubuntu boots up, click ""Try Ubuntu"" and a desktop will load.
   * Everything you do now will be saved to your RAM, *not your hard drive*.
* Make sure you're connected to the internet:
   * If you are plugged into an ethernet cable, you should be good.
   * If you need WiFi, click the power icon in the upper right corner of the desktop and connect your WiFi.
* Download the Electrum AppImage:
   * Click the Firefox icon and type this url into the address bar manually so we don't get phished: [https://electrum.org/#download](https://t.co/5Va9tQQzlH?amp=1) (write this on a piece of paper)
   * When the page loads, click the ""AppImage"" link to download the Electrum program.
   * When  download finishes, click the notification to open the containing  folder. Or click the folder icon on left hand taskbar, and navigate to  the Downloads folder.
   * Right  click the Electrum AppImage file, click properties, click permissions,  and check the ""Allow executing file as a program"" box.
   * Close the properties window, but do not close the Downloads folder.
* Disconnect  the internet by unplugging the ethernet cable or turning off the  wireless router. This ensures that no one can connect to your computer  while we create our wallet.
* Open the Electrum software and generate your wallet:
   * Double  click the Electrum AppImage file and the wallet software will start up.  Make the Electrum window bigger at any point by dragging the corner  until you can read everything.
   * Leave ""Auto connect"" selected and click next (we disconnected the internet)
   * Leave wallet name as ""default\_wallet"" and click next (it's deleted from RAM later)
   * Leave ""Standard wallet"" selected and click next (this is Segwit)
   * Leave ""Create a new seed"" selected and click next
   * Write down the 12 word seed on a steel backup plate or somewhere safe and click next.
      * Store them in a locked safe. Preferably two copies, in two safes, in two locations.
   * Confirm your seed by typing it into the prompt and click next
   * Leave the password field blank and click next (wallet file will be deleted from RAM)
   * Click yes to any security prompts
* Setup a Watch Only Wallet (WOW) on your phone to receive payments and check balances without risking your private keys:
   * Click the ""Wallet"" menu button in the top left of the Electrum window
   * Under the ""Master Public Key"" section, click the small QR code icon, bottom right. A QR code image will popup
   * Install  a wallet of your choice on your smartphone (Electrum, BlueWallet, etc.)  and create a new wallet from a Master Public Key by scanning the QR  code we just pulled up. Make sure the Master Public Key matches the one  in Electrum.
      * Look at the documentation of the phone wallet you chose if you need help
      * take a picture of this QR code to save for later, it generates your public keys.
   * You now have a WOW that is able to receive bitcoin, check balances, but can't send.
* Shutdown the computer, wiping the memory:
   * Click the power icon in the upper right hand corner of the desktop
   * Click ""Power off / Log out"", click ""Power off"", click ""Power off"" again
* How to send Bitcoin from this wallet (*the safe hard way*):
   * Create a fresh bootable USB and boot into Ubuntu
   * Follow all the same directions up until you create a ""Standard wallet' with Electrum
   * Select ""I already have a seed"" &amp; enter your seed phrase to open Electrum
   * On  your phone, open your watch only wallet. Send your desired amount of  Bitcoin to create a transaction. This transaction will be unsigned, and  can't be broadcast, yet.
      * If you booted Ubuntu on a laptop with a camera, pull up the QR code on your phone for the unsigned transaction
      * If  you booted Ubuntu on a computer without a camera, save the unsigned  transaction on your phone to a file, and save it on a newly formatted  USB stick. You'll figure it out ;)
   * Go back to Electrum on Ubuntu and click the ""Tools"" button at the top
   * Click ""Load Transaction""
      * Click ""From QR code"" to scan the transaction QR code on your phone
      * Or click ""From file"" to load the transaction file you save to USB
   * Click ‚Äúsign‚Äù in the transaction window
      * Once the transaction is signed, the Transaction ID appears in its designated field
   * Click the QR code button and scan the signed transaction into your phone's WOW
   * Send the transaction from your phone's WOW
* How to send Bitcoin from this wallet (*the easy safe-ish way*):
   * Buy a hardware wallet compatible with Electrum seeds
   * Load your private keys into the hardware wallet
   * Spend Bitcoin using the Hardware wallet
* How to send Bitcoin from this wallet (*the super easy unsafe way*):
   * Open a wallet of choice on your smartphone that supports Electrum seeds
   * Create a new wallet from an existing seed
   * Enter your private seed phrase
   * Send Bitcoin easily
      * THIS LAST METHOD EXPOSES YOUR PRIVATE KEYS ON YOUR PHONE. IF YOUR PHONE IS STOLEN OR COMPROMISED YOU RISK ALL YOUR BITCOIN

And maybe at this moment you ARE losing.  You bought higher than where it's dropped.  And maybe you're a bit over-extended and bet heavier than you should have.  But the upside...

I'm going to make the argument that frequent price checking creates the very volatility that you're watching for.

1. some non-trivial percentage of fearful price-checkers are going to sell.  Fear selling IS the volatility.  So don't do that.

That's it.  That's my argument.

EDIT: Also, I want to distinguish between strategic-buy-the-dip price checking and I'm-overextended-and-have-a-lot-to-lose checking.  It's the later, obv, that I'm arguing leads to volatility.",1624116101,8,0
o3iaxe,kripptopher,You're not a real HODLer if you check prices every day.,"EDIT: What I'm about to offer isn't for everyone, and I'm not trying to tell everyone what to do.

BUT... if you're someone who has crypto and are fearful about its safety and longevity AND you think about BTC as a long-term investment, maybe don't check the prices all the time.  Let time zoom out a little.

&amp;#x200B;

**H**old **O**n; **D**on't **L**ook.

I will confess this is hard for me, too.  but I went from watching the 1m like it was an instant replay of a controversial foul, to checking every hour to checking twice a day, then once a day, to once a week. I'm trying to go once a month.

With the (Latin America, USD, Inflation index) dominoes set up to start falling (Brazil will be key), it is mathematically inevitable that BTC will skyrocket.  I repeat: MATHEMATICALLY INEVITABLE\*.

\* of course, a revelation of some mortal systemic flaw that has yet to be discovered by the highly incentivized and enormously resourced Fiat Industrial Complex might make it less than ""inevitable"" but failing that (and the FIC has failed over the last TWELVE YEARS TO DO SO).  I have yet to see a valid reason why BTC should not eventually become a primary store of value for the entire global economy.

Which means.... **your SATS are seeds**.  Keep 'em in the ground (your wallet) and water them with your patience, not your fear-checking.  This is a long term investment.  Treat it as such.

I'll add a tertiary argument:  checking frequently helps create volatility.  Some percentage of frequent price checkers are going to panicsell. I did that two years ago and lost 70% of my value.  Had I held, I'd be up 10x.

SO  STOP DOING THAT.

**CEBL, the Canadian men‚Äôs basketball league, will offer its professional basketball players the option to receive a portion of their salary in cryptocurrency. The new payment option has been enabled through a partnership with the Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Bitbuy.**

## Bitbuy to Convert Canadian Dollar Salaries Into Bitcoin

**The Canadian Elite Basketball League (**[**CEBL**](https://www.cebl.ca/)**) announced the deal with Bitbuy days before the start of its third season, on June 24. The league, which was founded four years ago, launched in 2019 with six teams, all of them owned and managed by the Canadian Basketball Ventures group. It now says the crypto partnership will be the first of its kind for any professional sports league in North America. CEBL Commissioner and CEO Mike Morreale commented:**

&gt;***Our partnership with Bitbuy speaks to our commitment to players, and also to our forward-thinking approach to how we go about our business. We appreciate Bitbuy‚Äôs investment in helping us further grow Canada‚Äôs official national pro basketball league.***

**With the help of Bit buy, the basketball players will be able to opt-in to receive a portion of their salary in bitcoin (**[**BTC**](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC)**). The trading platform will convert the Canadian dollar payments into cryptocurrency and deposit the digital coins to the players‚Äô personal crypto wallets. The exchange, which has more than 300,000 users in Canada, will also become an official sponsor of the league as part of the agreement with the CEBL.**

## Basketball Players Ask for Bitcoin Salary Option

**According to Charlie Aikenhead, VP of Marketing at Bitbuy, the partnership represents a significant shift in how athletes are thinking about compensation. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited to help the CEBL‚Äôs players protect their long-term wealth by getting paid in Bitcoin,‚Äù he added, emphasizing that the crypto company is proud to support homegrown Canadian sports.**

**The cooperation between Bitbuy and the CEBL comes in response to basketball players voicing interest in crypto payments to the league‚Äôs management. They referred to the case of NFL‚Äôs Russell Okung who last year became the first professional athlete in North America to be paid in bitcoin. In December, the Carolina Panthers offensive lineman announced he would be getting half of his 13 million-dollar salary in** [**BTC**](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC)**, as Bitcoin.com News** [**reported**](https://news.bitcoin.com/paid-in-bitcoin-nfl-offensive-tackle-russell-okung-considered-the-highest-paid-in-the-league/)**.**

**Guelph Nighthawks‚Äô guard Kimbal Mackenzie, who will be among the first CEBL players to receive remuneration in crypto, was quoted in a press release as saying:**

&gt;***The opportunity to be paid in bitcoin is something I‚Äôm incredibly excited about. I believe cryptocurrency is the future.***

**Mackenzie thinks this is an investment that will appreciate greatly over the next decades and insists that his decision was a no-brainer. The crypto salary option, in his view, also highlights that the CEBL is one of the top professional sports leagues in the world.**

**Cryptocurrency prices have increased significantly over the past year as both individual investors and companies sought to protect their funds in uncertain economic times due to the global pandemic.** [**BTC**](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC)**, the crypto with the largest market capitalization, reached a record high of over $63,000 in April. It has since dropped to below $40,000 per coin and is currently** [**trading**](https://markets.bitcoin.com/) **between $35,000 and $36,000 on Saturday.**

o5c9v1,TheeSeaverShow,"Bitcoin: Past, Present, Future.","Lets talk about how Bitcoin. What is it? How does it work? What is its future?

So Bitcoin is a ledger (record) of transactions (data). It is more commonly thought of as a payment system with no middle man. So no banks, or credit card processors telling you where/how you can spend your money.  But how would this run? Who would pay for it?  So what Satoshi (creator of bitcoin) thought of was incredible.  He would create an system for ""miners"" to keep a copy of this ledger going. In order to incentivize these miners  for lending their computing power (writing to the chain), there would be rewards for each ""block"" mined.

Miners are competing to write each block. They computer for the right to the block by having their computer solve a complex algorithm that validates and orders the transactions. Basically like having a computer keep trying random numbers until it hits the correct combination. Whatever computer solves this first, is allowed to write the block to the ledger.

With all the recent news, I am sure we all know by now that Mining cost money, (electric, maintenance, knowledge, time, etc.) In the beginning, anybody could mine bitcoin with their computer and have a chance to ""win a block"". But in today age, it has become more specialized. Specific equipment, networking, cooling, etc.  Basically only huge investors with big bankrolls can successfully mine. (Think datacenter big).

So what rewards do miners get? They get the ""reward"" offered by the original network protocol, plus transactions fees paid by every person who writes to their block while it is being solved.

Originally when Bitcoin was created, there were only 21 millions coins created. That‚Äôs a finite amount. No more will every exist. So for every block that is mined, the winner receives part of that 21 million.  It started with 50 coins to the winner, then every 4 years or so it halves.  25, 12.5, 6.25 (Where we are now).  This will continue until all of the bitcoins are rewarded.

This means that when Bitcoin was created, the mining reward was never meant to be the driving factor to keeping the network alive.  If it was, then the whole thing would die once there was no more reward, and nobody to keep the ledger going.  So again, Satohi was thinking way ahead of everyone else. This means the intention was that once the rewards were gone, the miners would make just as much or more solely off the transactions fees contained within the block.

This is where things get interesting.

For the amount of reward from transactions fees to stay high enough to incentivize (stay profitable) miners, the blocks would need to fit millions or even billions of transactions. (As the prices to mine goes up).

There are two ways to go about this.  

The first is to raise the transactions fees to interact with the ledger. This results in what todays bitcoin looks like.  Small Blocks, (MBs in size) with very few transactions. Where if I want to send my local coffee shop 3 dollars in bitcoin to pay for a coffee, I have to pay 30 dollars in bitcoin fees. (And wait a long time for them to be verified). You can get around this by using ""lightning networks"", but in reality, this is payment channel that is being created between two parties so that they can pay small fees, but the transactions take place OFF CHAIN. (Defeating the purpose of a public, immutable ledger.)  In both of these situations, the fees collected during the block solving time, will not be enough revenue to incentive miners to keep the ledger alive‚Ä¶.

The 2nd way to fix this is to uncap the block size.  Make the data capacity unlimited, resulting in blocks with HUGE numbers of transactions.  This not only allows miners to stay profitable, thus keeping the blockchain ledger alive, but also keeps the transactions fees to pennies for the people interacting with the chain. So now, in that same situation, I can play my local coffee shop 3.01 or even less for my 3 dollar cup of coffee, and they will get the money instantly.

Now‚Ä¶. some of you know what I am about to say, others may be hearing this for the first time.

&amp;#x200B;

Option one: This Is bitcoin (BTC) today. This is how it works, and where it is headed.

Option Two: This is bitcoin (BSV) today. This is how it works and where it is headed.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not going to sit here and tell you BTC is shit and you should sell it.  I've made my fair share of money in BTC, and still hold some today.  I am also not going to sit here and tell you that you should buy BSV. (Disclosure: I do hold some).  What I want people to realize, is that while we are force fed what the media, celebrities, shit-shillers, etc. want us to believe, there is so much information out there about crypto currency in general.  

This is ONE (Not even complete) example. (seg-wit, scaling issues, volatility, keys, etc. were all not mentioned in this very brief example).  This is strictly talking about BTC and BSV also.  There are 100's of other comparisons that I could do between other coin pairs.  I just want all the new people, or even people that have been in the space for a long time to realize that by doing a little research, there is so much evidence to go against what we are told my the media on the daily.

&amp;#x200B;

END POST.

&amp;#x200B;

One last thing for anybody still readying and/or mad: Talking about BSV. I know this is a controversial coin with a lot of negative press surrounding it. This was purposely chosen. There are two sides to every coin. Its hard to find people that will be honest about the big picture of them. With BSV, it‚Äôs the CSW crap. Who knows with that, what is right and what's wrong, but I do not let ""non facts"" cloud my research on any coin. Unknowns are unknowns and they add to the risk. Facts, data and evidence that is able to be proved is another story! DO YOUR RESEARCH ON ANY COIN YOUR ARE PURCHASING! (Unless your ok losing it all)!

**After breaking the $ 40,000 mark, the digital currency began to recover as the evening fell by another 6%: At the same time, after the US dollar index reached a 3-year low at the beginning of the year, it began to rise.**

Also on [TheDayByDay](https://thedaybyday.com/f/belief-in-the-currency-or-escape-from-the-dollar)

Last Friday, the digital currency set its latest high, above $ 41,800, but since then it has traded in a negative trend and tonight it completes a 20% drop to a price level of about $ 33,000. About $ 30,500 was the lowest rate tonight, reflecting a 28% drop from the peak. The currency price crash comes along with a jump in the dollar index (DXY), is this a correction after a jump or an expectation towards 2021?

The DXY, following the strength of the dollar relative to the basket of foreign currencies, climbed tonight and reached a peak of 90.7 points, a record of the last two weeks. On January 6, the index recorded a 33-month low, closing at a total of 89.21 points. Since the market crash in March, Bitcoin and the index have moved in opposite directions and each time the DXY has recovered slightly Bitcoin has corrected accordingly.

¬†**Bitcoin Dollar**

'The value of bitcoin grows as inflation expectations rise. At the same time, the dollar weakened to a perennial low, resulting in an inverted fit between Bitcoin and the government-backed Fiat currency, the research body Kaiko noted in December. The price of Bitcoin fell from $ 12,000 to $ 10,000 in early September, during which the currency shuffled, while the dollar jumped from 91.75 to 94.75 points. A similar operation also took place in June 2020.¬†

The cartographic currency began to soar during October, when foreign exchange markets began to sell dollars in anticipation of further significant quantitative easing in the United States. At the same time, a steep decline in the DXY also began, which accompanied the meteoric rise of the currency from $ 15,000 to over $ 41,000 in just two months.

The reverse correlation is not surprising, given that listed companies like MicroStrategy (NYSE: MS) are buying Bitcoin to maintain their dollar cash value. 'What we're trying to do is keep our capital. The purchasing power of cash is declining rapidly, ""said MS CEO Michael Sailor. Bitcoin is not the only asset that falls when the dollar recovers. Gold, the classic inflation hedge, fell to $ 1,817, peaking at $ 2,000.

The recent jump in the dollar appears to be fueled by a rise in U.S. Treasury yields. Analysts predict that interest rates on ten-year US bonds will reach 2% by the end of 2021, noting that ""a similar outburst of rage is a real risk."" The same bond passed the 1% threshold last week against the backdrop of the election results in Georgia that led to democratic control of the Senate. (To the full article)

The question that needs to be asked is whether the jump in the price of bitcoin is due to a belief in the technology and the new ""monetary"" system that it will create, or is it a momentary ""hype"" resulting from a sharp fall in the dollar exchange rate? We will know the answer at the end of the year, when the interest rate on bonds is expected to rise and the scope of the purchase plan is expected to fall, which will strengthen the dollar even further. If Bitcoin does not succeed in disengaging from the negative correlation against the dollar, it is likely to have a year saturated with wars against the strongest economy in the world.

How is the US administration expected to respond to Chinese control of Bitcoin? ""Immediately there is no China"" - for many, this caption embossed on products from the Asian power has become a role model, a commodity that is medium and falling apart, but the hot commodity of the moment, some of you may be surprised to discover, is also Immediately No China: Bitcoin.¬†

¬†‚ÄúThe increases in the current year are due to the inflow of institutional funds to purchase the digital currency. We follow the scope of the large wallets operating in the field, this weight has been increasing. This means that big money from institutional or investment managers is entering the crypto industry. It can be estimated that this is money that will stay for a long time.¬†",1624387931,3,1
o5uadv,xcryptogurux,Michael Burry has no clue what a head and shoulders pattern looks like,"Ok before I explain what a head and shoulders pattern really looks like, there's something more important that needs to be said.

We have a problem in society today which is a huge hindrance to humanitarian progress. It's called the halo effect. When someone who was good at something one time or good at one specific thing, we seem to fawn over their opinion on every bloody thing.

This arises from a fundamentally flawed institutionalized education system that makes us learn from famous people and the opinions of people who've come before us instead of teaching us to think and reason for ourselves from first principles.

Also, notice how they don't teach us how the creation and distribution of money and the banking system really works?

Here's an anonymous video about why that is the case,

&amp;#x200B;

![video](f835wu4j3v671 ""Anonymous telling you things you're not supposed to find out"")

&amp;#x200B;

![img](qva9s9ll3v671 ""Einstein on the education system"")

**So now to Michael ""the Cassandra"" Burry,**

**Why is the pattern below not a head and shoulders?**

&amp;#x200B;

![img](kox0uhus3v671 ""This is NOT a head and shoulders pattern"")

First of all, because it has too many frickin' heads!

Secondly, the head of this pattern does not form 100% higher than the shoulders. The head is far too high that the swing lows on either side are basically knees instead of shoulders.

Thirdly, the trendline preceding the left shoulder formation needs to, first of all, be roughly in line with the initial point of the neckline from the decline of the left shoulder and the low from the head needs to break this trendline. Neither criterion holds true here.

BTC did break down from a head and shoulders (look at the 2nd, 3rd and 4th peaks at the top), and the target from this pattern was actually around 31000. That target was reached so it's likely that we see some sideways or reversal materialize. Let's keep an eye out to see if any bullish patterns form here.",1624387876,26,1

I got into crypto at the end of January this year so I am also fresh to the scene. I took my 3rd stimi check and was in the place where I could put all 100% into crypto (BTC and ETH). I also started studying technical analysis and swing trading around that same time. In the last 5 months I have tripled my stimulus check. I got mostly out of both near the tops of each which was part luck and part seeing the signs. That being said I am never going to be fully out of BTC. This dip has provided me the opportunity to take what I‚Äôve earned and reinvest it. Thank you for those like Cramer et al. who made available the liquidity for me to keep stacking. 

I don‚Äôt plan to be rich because of crypto but it‚Äôs a system I trust far more than others that exist in our world. I think there‚Äôs space for trading and investing strategies in crypto. For my kids I am putting their birthday money and investing in BTC with it (they are babies). Each will have their own wallet waiting for them when they are older. I believe BTC is here to stay. I may not have a whole token yet but I look forward to celebrating that moment when I get there in what I hope will be later this year.

o5sa11,foxbat56,I want Bitcoin at my bank in USA,"""Not your keys, not your Bitcoin"", I know, I know, calm down.

Yes, best practice for cryptocurrency will always be to maintain exclusive control over your holdings.

However, I'd argue that's also true for fiat. While most US banks have proven ""trustworthy"" with our cash and are FDIC insured etc the fact is that if you walk in and want to use a large portion of your own cash for a purchase, it's not so simple. They only have so much cash on hand, depending on how much you need you might need to give days notice. Not to mention you need an interview to ensure you're following ""the rules"" with your cash.

That being said, banks are already set up for bill-pay services, custodial services, collateral services, loans, identity verification, notarization, etc.

Further, I recognize that in our fantasy everyone is their own bank utilizing trustless defi protocols etc, but we're a long way from that. Banks are going to be with us for a long time, plain and simple.

Right now, to interact with crypto best practice is: 

(1) send cash from an already necessarily ACH or other transfer-service-enabled account to a cryptocurrency exchange

(2) wait for cash to clear (I understand quite a few allow instant trading)

(3) set limit order / buy

(4) wait for ACH to clear / wait period for withdrawal

(5) withdrawal to crypto wallet going through 2FA / email verification etc, probably paying a withdrawal fee

(6) wait confirmations to be able to do anything with it

Finally, should you need fiat out of that crypto, now you need to execute the reverse process and again wait.

I've seen various cryptocurrency companies advertise crypto-back credit cards, and I'm interested in that but I want my crypto easily accessible and convertible.

I'd like to have crypto right next to my checking and savings with transfers available, even with a fee (so long as it's not ridiculous). 

Then, my already direct-deposited pay would come into my checking account natively as fiat and I can:

\* make a direct transfer, $50 fiat -&gt; exchange rate + fee -&gt; BTC

\* set up specific bills to start being paid optionally from my BTC balance

\* get my btc-rewards credit card rewards deposited straight to my BTC balance

This way I can easily convert back and forth, easily decide to enter / exit crypto as makes sense day to day and week to week.

Granted, I understand that presently US law or lack thereof makes this difficult for banks, but we already have some crypto-specific banks providing some of these services. Now I'd just like a ""regular"" bank to integrate some of these services. Obviously they have economies of scale to adapt and figure it out.

I hope we can get some banks to see consumer demand for such offerings so that crypto can become more mainstream in US. If a major bank began offering such services, I would switch from my current bank in a heartbeat.",1624382411,9,1

o48ii0,s_josh_f,Using Non-Bitcoin Crypto to Earn Bitcoin,"Like many here, I view bitcoin as digital gold: not something to have sitting around on an exchange or to lend out, but a thing to have safely tucked away in cold storage. I do stake non-bitcoin tokens and earn bitcoin and wrapped bitcoin; I have a non-trivial amount of non-bitcoin crypto.

This brings me to ether and lending. I have a bunch of it, bought it at much lower prices. My cost basis is low and I would prefer not to sell due to its potential to perform well and also for the taxes on capital gains that would result. I'm a bitcoin maximalist but only with respect to money, and I think that we can all agree that ether isn't money, or at least not the best money. Everyone wants to find out which horse is fastest, but I don't mind having a stable of fast horses. 

So, I was considering putting a bunch of ether on Blockfi. They have 'interest flex payment', which allows one to deposit one crypto and earn interest from it in another crypto. They can rehypothecate ether all to hell for all I care, but they can pay me in bitcoin. Seems like this would undermine ether and make bitcoin that much more scarce, right? For now, Blockfi seems to be the only platform with this option. What do you guys think? Any other suggestions?",1624204114,2,1

o47g7s,Odd-Claim-6235,Some thoughts on mining farm shutdown in China,"I want to share a few thoughts on the Chinese miner shut down viral video. If you have seen my recent video (Modo Tech on YouTube) you will know that Bitcoin price heavily relies on the global hashrate. China used to own 60% of global hashrate. However, with the recent shutdowns of major miners in the past month, global hashrate went from 150 EH/s to 100 EH/s. However, I'm not worried about Bitcoin price in the long term for a few reasons:

1. This is not the first time miners in China are facing central government pressure. It happend in 2018/2019 too. The central government sent teams to local miners to conduct studies and researches so they could finalize the policies and regulations. Many miners decided to shutdown operations temporarily. They eventually openned up again.

2. Central Chinese government's biggest arguement is the environmental impact from large mining operations. However, the truth is that most big mining fields moved to Sichuan province and other north, northwestern provinces because these provinces have been wasting their hydro-electricity and solar power. China made the biggest hydro-electricity dam in the world serveral years ago in western China, however, they couldn't transport all the electricity to the rest of China. Using these wasted green energy to mine cryptocurrency has provided the local government tremendous amount of income. Do you think they would really stop it?

3. Even if these miners are panicing and selling their equipment, they are going to other miners in the rest of the world. In fact, some mining companies already started scouting and moving to smaller nations around China. It takes time to re-establish mining farms.

infiniteRise $iRise To The Moon!üöÄ

infiniteRise is a hyper-deflationary token, which rewards investors for holding tokens, while also incorporating the Buyback approach currently present in the crypto market. infiniteRise is one of the first cryptocurrency ever to include automatic Buyback. This will be the new standard among DeFi tokens.
Why infiniteRise? How do these new Tokenomics work?
Our dedicated team started this project on the sole basis of providing a safe and secure place for investors, as they were all tired of being ripped off in many different ways.
The proprietary buyback feature is achieved by using 6% of the 11% transaction tax to buyback coins from the liquidity pool automatically. The transaction is triggered after every sell, and this ensures that there will be virtually no multiple sells in a row!

6% tax to fund the buyback function
2% tax is collected and distributed to holders for HODLing
3% tax is sent to the marketing wallet which we will use for future marketing plans
After the tokens from the Liquidity pool are bought, the new BNB amount is added to the pool and the amount of the tokens are reduced, which results in an increase in price. Once those tokens are burnt, it is like adding free BNB to the pool as there are no tokens to sell in the future.
Private Pre-sale
There was a small private sale to trusted investors we know have good intentions, and want this project to succeed in the long run. This will prevent any pre-sale dumping on people joining in later. There was zero distribution of any sort. Any tokens that were delivered were indeed paid for to fund the LP. There are no team wallets, period. This project was funded completely by everyday people like yourself.

WHAT‚ÄôS UP NOW?

At the moment, we are working on marketing, funded out of our own pockets. The CMS post is ready to fire, and we've also applied to coinsniper. Once we reach the required number of holders, we will follow through with more extensive marketing.

CAUTION

DO NOT fall for the scams. We will NEVER DM you first with any contract adress.
The contract address and/or any important info will be posted in the Telegram group by the admins.

What you can do to help to your new community of investors:
Use dex tools as a reference chart. This will help us get into the trending section, and bring on new investors. You can also take the time to vote for us on coin sniper, and any other promotional links posted by the team.

*DISCLAIMER* WE HAD AN ISSUE WITH BUYBACK BUT WE ARE ALL FIXED!

o45oqe,ChikaBtc,looking for criticism on my essay about what differentiates Bitcoin from altcoins üôè,"I have summarized why I believe Bitcoin has differentiated value propositions. Would love to be corrected and learn more üôè

More detail is available here:  [What differentiates Bitcoin from altcoins](https://chikabtc.substack.com/p/non-maxis-take-on-bitcoin-in-2021)

## TL;DR¬†

**The Bitcoin Thesis**

1. Bitcoin has unique qualities that altcoins can't replicate: [path dependence](https://breedlove22.medium.com/the-number-zero-and-bitcoin-4c193336db5b), maximum [social scalability](https://messari.io/article/social-scalability#:~:text=Social%20scalability%20is%20a%20concept,Social%20scalability%20is%20about%20social)¬†enabled by the biggest PoW blockchain, stability of the base layer, ideologically driven community. Bitcoin is in its own league.¬†
2. As of today, all the other protocols are in the beta phase. It‚Äôs impossible to know what they will look like in 5 years whereas the Bitcoin base layer won't change much. Even Ethereum suffers from the same stability issue.
3. The intentional layered design of Bitcoin keeps the base layer stable and predictable, allowing institutions to plan long-term projects on top of Bitcoin.
4. Bitcoin is differentiated from altcoins in that it‚Äôs a military-grade Shelling point for libertarians and sound money proponents. Many altcoins are about technical merits, which are fiercely competitive.
5. Most people don't understand smart contracts are possible on Bitcoin layer two. The layer two solutions are thus underappreciated and not priced in.¬†
6. [The endless money printing and the massive fiscal spending won‚Äôt stop anytime soon. ](https://cryptohayes.medium.com/farb-l-ast-off-go-de6f5bb7a099)With the rapid technological and social adoption of Bitcoin, Bitcoin is getting derisked every year.¬†
7. Bitcoin presents one of the best asymmetric opportunities, 100x return in the next 10 years.¬†

**Risks**

1. It's unclear whether Bitcoin's narrative is more socially scalable than Ether's narrative. **Ultrasound-productive money with¬†no carbon footprint**¬†is a batshit powerful meme. What if the market wants a more centralized‚Äîgoverned‚Äîcryptoasset?
2. The digital gold narrative needs some update but the Bitcoin maximalist culture is keeping VCs and developers from making Bitcoin useful. All the capital that could have made Bitcoin useful has gone to the Ethereum ecosystem instead.¬†Bitcoin is missing out on the DeFi trend bigly. DeFi matters, because the higher the transaction fees paid to miners, the higher the security budget of a protocol.
3. If people can start paying for goods with their tokenized stocks (Mirror Asset), it could severely limit the TAM of Bitcoin.¬†",1624195771,5,1

It was my first job out of school after finishing my computer science degree. We had a group 'brainstorming' session with the HEB product owner and we were supposed to write down new ideas for the app on a big whiteboard.

Everybody walked up one by one and wrote down their ideas. It was quiet in the room this whole time...

Near the end of the session I walked up and wrote 'Bitcoin' next to the other suggestion which was to integrate PayPal into the app.

The HEB executive immediately laughed at me in front of everybody and rolled his eyes. Everyone looked at me and laughed. He then turned to one of the older guys on the development team and grunted something like ""really shows you the problem with this generation"".

Bitcoin was $3,000.

I never even talked to the product owner after that because he was a sleazy asshole to me for no reason at all, on my first week at work, while embarrassing me in front of all my coworkers. Turns out I was right, and if they would have followed my advice they would have 10X the value of any BTC payments received at the time.

After she had her own kid, who I'll call Lucy, since I am 10 years older than Lucy, I feel the need and genuine desire to show her the ways to live a better life. Whenever I can, I try to pass on a little bit of knowledge about this and that. Give examples of how I made mistakes in the past and how I overcame them. Show her that if you truly want something and if you work hard for it through a relentless search for the *why* of things, you will get it eventually.

I have never wanted to learn something so bad in my life as much as Bitcoin, blockchains, macroeconomics, freedom and crypto in general.

I understand that if I want to create wealth for myself and those around me, I have to invest in the best representation of freedom in terms of human time and economical interaction we have ever created.

I see the values and benefits of Bitcoin so clearly that I feel like this is one of the if not the most important thing I can teach Lucy about.

As NYDIG's Ross Stevens said: ""the best trades we make are the ones with our future selves"".

Lucy is a 13 year old kid who I wouldn't say has a particular interest for technology, economics (in whatever form she understands it) or for the problems of central banks, concentration of power and general praxeology.

She's 13 for God's sake.

I'm afraid that even if I try to transpire my thoughts about Bitcoin and better money for the future, she won't find it interesting enough that it will spark her interest for it.

I want to give her a small amount of bitcoin but I don't have enough money right now to give a hardware wallet. But I also don't want to simply show her how to buy it on Binance, given that it would stay in my account.

I see this as a duty and I want to maximize my chances of transferring the knowledge I have (which isn't much) so that she can understand what it means to create wealth through the most important fiat killer of our time.

I want to go through this journey together with her.

Any ideas of how I can go about doing this?",1624187323,17,1

Come one, please ELI5 why a pattern and different times make people fear when adoption keeps growing and whales keep accumulating on-chain.

My biggest issue with the Death cross narrative is the bitcoin funding rate at leading exchanges when bitcoin drops below 33k since May 19, funding rates for futures become negative. This means that a whale bot may arbitrage with x125 leverage with 1/125 of what the bot holds in the spot(For ""small sums"" on each deal). Basically buying at a discount passing -2% before 30k on top exchanges.

This is why the 30k line wasn't broken on may 19, let alone that it barely held 5 minutes before jumping to 33k and short squeezed up to 35k within a few more minutes.

Anyway, back to the point, please ELI5 to me how this so-called ""Death cross"" matters at this point. And no, I don't care about inductive conclusions based on a number of events I can count with one palm.

## TL;DR¬†

**The Bitcoin Thesis** 

Bitcoin has unique qualities that altcoins can't replicate: [path dependence](https://breedlove22.medium.com/the-number-zero-and-bitcoin-4c193336db5b), maximum [social scalability](https://messari.io/article/social-scalability#:~:text=Social%20scalability%20is%20a%20concept,Social%20scalability%20is%20about%20social)¬†enabled by the biggest PoW blockchain, stability of the base layer, ideologically driven community. Bitcoin is in its own league.¬†

1. As of today, all the other protocols are in the beta phase. It‚Äôs impossible to know what they will look like in 3-5 years. Even Ethereum suffers from the same stability issue.
2. The intentional layered design of Bitcoin keeps the base layer stable and predictable, allowing institutions to plan long-term projects on top of Bitcoin.
3. Bitcoin is differentiated from altcoins in that it‚Äôs a military-grade Shelling point for libertarians and sound money proponents. Altcoins are about technical merits, which are fiercely competitive.
4. Most people don't understand smart contracts are possible on Bitcoin layer two. The layer two solutions are thus underappreciated and not priced in.¬†
5. [The endless money printing and the massive fiscal spending won‚Äôt stop anytime soon. ](https://cryptohayes.medium.com/farb-l-ast-off-go-de6f5bb7a099)With the rapid technological and social adoption of Bitcoin, Bitcoin is getting derisked every year.¬†
6. Bitcoin presents one of the best asymmetric opportunities, 100x return in the next 10 years.¬†

**Risks** 

1. It's unclear whether Bitcoin's narrative is more socially scalable than Ether's narrative. **Ultrasound-productive money with¬†no carbon footprint**¬†is a batshit powerful meme. What if the market wants a more centralized‚Äîgoverned‚Äîcryptoasset?
2. The digital gold narrative needs some update but the Bitcoin maximalist culture is keeping VCs and developers from making Bitcoin useful. All the capital that could have made Bitcoin useful has gone to the Ethereum ecosystem instead.¬†Bitcoin is missing out on the DeFi trend bigly. DeFi matters, because the higher the transaction fees paid to miners, the higher the security budget of a protocol. 
3. If people can start paying for goods with their tokenized stocks (Mirror Asset), it could severely limit the TAM of Bitcoin.¬†",1624180075,0,1
o41k02,StartThings,"Claims like ""Speculative bubbles"" are an excuse and a cover-up for the real underlying event fueling extreme changes in the market.","There is no ""Speculative Bubble"" in the long-distance view of the industry that is showing only more and more signs every day of restructuring the world economy. It is OBVIOUS that those who are rich in Crypto would have enormous economic power. Everybody knows it, the USA knows it, China knows it, hype people know it and FUDers know it. It is impossible to ignore.

This brings us to what is really going on, which is a war of accumulation. The market doesn't crush because a ""Speculative Bubble"" was popped. NO. Those extreme changes in market cap are the direct result of accumulation wars where those currently in power in the industry are trying to maximize their BTC holdings. This has been going for years. Large whales have been accumulating for years.

There is no speculation as to how far the industry will go, it will encapsulate the world economy. Every single world leader understands it. And they too are trying to control it.

So in essence, sure that things and changes in the close range are 99% Speculative, but at the far end there is no speculation as for the future status. There are \*Planned\* moves to spread the idea of the ""Speculative bubble"" narrative by the same people of understanding that narrative is complete nonsense. 

There is a war of dominance over holding in the industry and all tools are used. This war rocks the market and not speculation.

Notice how there's always a new narrative about the market. When the narrative dies out they move on to the next one even if it is 100% nonsense. Those narratives are being spread by different media outlets this is not a secret. People pay to have it there, make your own conclusions.",1624180029,4,1

They've slowly started to rise the last couple months. But, all things being equal, what should the inflation rate roughly be if it the feds weren't lying?

I understand printing money is not the only deciding factor and MV=PY comes into account. Also that if every currency is inflating than it doesn't matter as much as they're competing against one another. But, bitcoin is present and has actually lowered it's inflation rate since the March covid outbreak.

I have so many questions that i would love to be helped out with, some you may not be able to answer as they are futuristic speculation.

\-Given that younger people generally are the people who have invested in bitcoin, could we see a huge shift when there are so many young people not needing to work due to retirement (Fire) being earned on the back of bitcoin ownership? What problems would this create for society?

\-If a switch from fiat currencies occurred, what would happen to the governmental control? The price would surge if governments tried to turn up and buy more btc than they already own in large amounts. (China 1% &amp; US 0.3%)

\-When will BTC become deflationary due to the fact that people are losing their keys at a certain rate, if that rate became greater than the mining rate?

\-Satoshi owns 5% of all bitcoin, would his ownership almost be like Bezos with Amazon, where even if he tried to give away to charity, etc., It would sink the price. (Assuming he is alive)

\-Historically reliable investments such as the index, are still built on energy or technology. Would they remain theoretically as reliable investments because those assets are necessary? Would they maybe just see a huge drop based on Fiat liabilities?

\-Countries such as Australia for example which are firmly seen as a first world country, four of their top 5 companies are banks. Could a huge reshuffle in national economics be disrupted? 

\-Although BTC was created to provide equal opportunities for people globally, could it have a reverse effect with people from third world countries not having a viable currency or technology to be able to access bitcoin?

Ethereum price poised to rebound

Ethereum price has been in a downtrend since the beginning of June, shedding nearly 30% in market value. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped from a high of $2,900 to recently hit a low of $2,040.¬†

Despite the significant losses incurred over the past three weeks, Ethereum price looks¬†primed to rebound. The Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator presented a buy signal on the 12-hour chart after ETH tested the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level.¬†

The bullish formation developed in the form of a green nine candlestick, which is indicative of a one to four 12-hour candlestick upswing. A spike in buying pressure around the current price levels could see Ethereum price¬†rise toward the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level¬†at $2,540.¬†",1624248662,4,1

to conduct transactions, etc. Definitely not because Satoshi liked fiat). At the time of the publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper, the Euro had a market cap of 21 Trillion (M1 money supply). That is 1 million million. Bitcoin‚Äôs smallest unit is a Satoshi (1/million). Meaning that Satoshi could‚Äôve have implied the intrinsic value of Bitcoin by selection the supply limit. The answer is 1 BTC = 1 million Euros (in 2009). This would give a current value of 5 million Euros per Bitcoin.

o7e9i6,DemandConsistent2775,Onboarding New Bitcoin (satoshis) Users through the Lightning Network - Be Involved," I discovered the Lightning Network in the past week. I had heard of it but it seemed rather complicated. The happenings in El Salvadore however set me off to find out how it works and how I could be involved.

In the early days of Bitcoin, for me 2014, we could set up online Businesses (opportunities) that could use Bitcoin as the transaction fees were acceptable and the confirmation times reasonable. Come 2016/17, the fees rose to very high levels and the confirmations took for ever or never happened for small amount transactions. This caused the death of many online businesses that had set up using Bitcoin. They have never recovered but they now have a chance through the lightning Network. At that time I managed to introduce close to 2,000 people to Bitcoin in my country. They hated me then but today they are grateful for what I ""forced"" them into. I was running a Network Marketing Platform.

I have always believed that Crypto can only really explode through a Network Marketing process. A Network marketing process introduces people to the prospect of earning some money and they sign up and they then have to refer their friends who have to refer their friends. It could grow fairly quickly. The Catch in this case is that it is using the lightning Network!

For the love of me, what is the Lightning Network! They have no choice but to get to know what it is. They have to know how to get an LN wallet, how to top it up, how to make a payment, how to withdraw and how to convert to the Local Currency.

Except for those who have access to Strike, this is really a complicated process! The desire to make money though is strong. Human Greed is a great motivator. This is the route I intend to use to spread the Bitcoin Gospel. My Twitter handle at MusthaveCrypto is already doing this for Bitcoin although I am yet to start on LN as I am still trying to fully understand the basics myself.

Where do you as an LN come in? I would like to invite you to sign up. When you do, you will have the opportunity to help grow the Network.

&amp;#x200B;

You could also make a donation so that we can activate free members who are already signed up.

I know that many people label MLM as a Scam. If that was my intention, I would use a simpler payment method. We all have opinions and if the equivalent of $7 is too much to be ""scammed"", then I would advise that you do not get involved.

This community should already understand how to get LN to function. I believe that if we were to get involved, we could grow by at least 100 new people daily.

My Platform is still being refined and is all manual for now. I am getting my developer to look at the API to see what can be automated safely. I therefore request that you be patient and allow for at least 24hrs for the process of activation and withdrawal to happen.

Visit the platform and let us hear your comments. I will post in this thread as I get a better understanding of LN.

The goings on in El Salvadore have gotten me rather excited. Strike is a real Game Changer and I can't wait for it to be available in my country. The cost of MPESA is too high but we have no choice. Strike would kill MPESA in a very short time. I see a lot of resistance being waged against Strike but WHO CAN stop LN? Who?

Let us make LN a reality to many",1624587245,4,1

In 2021 $BTC price has followed a head and shoulders pattern, starting the year at $30K, doubling to an elated peak of $63K per coin in mid-April, and falling back down to the $30K-$40K price range in recent weeks (the past 90 days are shown in the chart above). Some speculate that this puzzling performance is indicative of institutional manipulation (search ‚ÄúWycoff BTC‚Äù on Twitter

One thing is for sure over the past 90 days: Bitcoin has gone from an emotional high of significant optimism to one of the most pessimistic and fearful tickers on the internet, and it has taken the entire cryptocurrency market with it. As of today, the investor sentiment Fear &amp; Greed Index points to ‚Äúextreme fear‚Äù 

over the past 90 days Bitcoin news sentiment has trended definitively downwards, falling below the neutral line from optimistic to pessimistic just last week.

Overall, $BTC was still more optimistic and less speculative than both the FAANG stocks and S&amp;P 500 in the news over the last 90 days.

we can see a clear correlation between the weekly price of Bitcoin and its news sentiment and time-sense.

Bitcoin‚Äôs news sentiment showed a 0.496 correlation with price (considered significant), and Bitcoin‚Äôs news time-sense showed a -0.766 correlation with price (a strong correlation) over the past 90 days.

news is more reactive and past-oriented when things are going good, but when things take a turn downwards, news articles tend become more speculative. 

So where does this leave us?

This is the part of the report where we determine if Bitcoin is currently overhyped in the news (and due for a correction), or if it‚Äôs underhyped and time to put some money into it. We call this our Hype-Or-Snipe scale, 

Based on our analysis, we have determined that Bitcoin is currently SLIGHTLY undervalued in the news, and receives a Hype-Or-Snipe rating of +0.05.

o7aas6,Eislemike,Received free Sats from Cashapp. Time to give it away on Lightning.,"I will help you onto lightning by giving away bitcoin. Seriously. (I stole this idea and post from someone else)

Lightning Network gets a lot of fud even here in this sub. I suspect a lot of you guys haven‚Äôt yet actually tried it. It really is a lot easier than i think most people expect, and here is me trying to prove it. 
I suspect that the big hurdle right now is that you have to move your coins onto the lightning Network, so the idea behind this post is actually giving away MY satoshis so you do not have to do this to experience lightning. Hopefully some other experienced lightning-users will join me if this ends up a costly adventure. (Please lets keep this thread  focused on giving people the first experience with lightning)

HERE‚ÄôS the plan:
-Go download Wallet of satoshi. This is a really really easy lightning Wallet. It IS custodial, but ignore that for now

-post your adress/qr here. I will send you 200 sats as soon as I can. I will answer you when i do,  and if I don‚Äôt get to tired I‚Äôll post how many Sats it cost to send. IF someone else wants to join me, just send sats, and answer the post in the same way.

-when you recieve the sats, congratz! You have bitcoin in the lightning Network. Find a friend, pay it forward.

-Should you choose to explore this further, go download breez Wallet. You now have a non-custodial Wallet, and you can create an invoice (recieve via invoice) for yourself and pay from Wallet of satoshi and my sats. No risk, its someone elses money. You have now made your first transaction and are probably starting to Get it.

-With the sats well placed in breez, go to the apps-section from the top left corner. Pick the lightning roulette app,  fund with 20(!) sats (press ¬´open in Wallet¬ª), and gamble HALF of your deposit. Then go to the menu and press ¬´withdraw using webln¬ª, and watch your remaining sats return to your breez balance. How cool is that?

-now: IF you want to experiment with moving YOUR coin onto breez, you have to make an on-chain transaction(recieve via btc adress) but breez assumes that you want any bitcoin on the lightning Network, and any recieved coin wil be on lightning. There are fees.",1624569726,319,1
o7aami,filmrebelroby,Trying to Orange Pill an Older Relative by Giving a Formal Presentation,"Hi Bitcoin Team!

I've got an older relative and I want him to increase his bitcoin position to around 5-10% of his portfolio, while making possible for him to sleep at night and ignore the media FUD/ volatility.  He has a small position in Bitcoin rn but he gets annoyed whenever I talk about it.  He's funny because he tells me I'm obsessed when I bring it up. So I don't bring it up, and then he brings it up!

I told him that I'd like to just have an in-depth conversation about it in a few days and then after that, we can shelf the conversation entirely.

So here's where you come in! I'd like to prepare some google slides that I can present to him formally and when I make them, I'd be happy to share them here for your use as well.

I need links to short video clips from influential people, quotes, and links to important charts. (Money supply and other charts about the financial system/ no TA, although I'll explain S2F to him)  


This is the structure I'm imagining right now, which I'm hoping to abridge into a 20-30 minute presentation:  


1) Quick overview of the financial crisis from a macro perspective. Just the main points, skipping over stuff he already knows.

2) What is QE?

3) How this was a backdrop for Bitcoin to be created

4) A brief overview of Satoshi, Cypherpunks, and the Sound Money protocol/ how it works. (the ledger, the halving cycle, mining, the difficulty adjustment, cryptography, and fully validating nodes)  I don't want to go to deep into any of this, so I'll probably make some comparisons to things he can understand and just scratch the surface. He should be left with the idea that this is new technology and pretty exciting stuff.

5) Stock to Flow, what is it and how bitcoin has tracked the price.  I'll tell him about Plan B, the anonymous Dutch institutional investor, which is an interesting story.

5) The interest rates in Europe going negative, what that means, and how we're headed there in the states.

5) Quotes from Billionaires on Bitcoin. I'd like to gather some one-line quips from Ray Dahlio, Stanly Druckenmiller, Paul Tudor Jones.

6) Explaining a Store of Value, the properties of money from Preston Pysh's inteview with Robert Breedlove, and why bitcoin's hard cap and decentralization positions Bitcoin to uniquely be the best store of value humanity has ever created.

6) The best short (around a minute) Michael Saylor Video Clip. After which, I will explain that Michael Saylor is a MIT Alum, Billionaire CEO/ early investor in Apple, who understands networks and networks effects on a master-class level.  I will tell him about Michael Saylor's position in Bitcoin on his company's balance sheet, how he doubled down during the recent dip, and what he's doing to bring in the institutional investors.

7) A short clip of Jack Dorsey's interview at the Bitcoin Conference. ""absolutely, its the only way out""

8) A short clip of Chamath Palahaptiya calling Bitcoin ""shmuck insurance"" on the news.

9) Energy FUD and why Bitcoin incentivizes clean, cheap energy. Changing the bird's eye perspective on energy.

10) Bitcoin in El Salvador, the lightning network, and a brief explanation of Bitcoin's game theory. I might tack on the reasons that I don't like ETH and why altcoins are irrelevant for him. Quick explanation of layered money.

11) I'll maybe close it with the idea that bitcoin is a speculative asset class, but it is also a growing network, with the intrinsic value being the network itself.  I'll explain that just like a Microsoft words utility is to help you make documents, Bitcoin's utility is:

Sound Money without Centralized Manipulation

Store of Value

Transfer of Value/ Settlement

Smart Contracts

Second Layer Network Technology

Financial Sovereignty for the Unbanked (and banked alike)

Access to a growing Asset class without real estate, wall street, or any third parties.

And we're barely scratching the surface.

  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Anything you think I missed from a deep orange pill perspective?  Anything you think I should skip? and finally, please link any convincing charts, video clips, or websites that might help me make this?  


Just to clarify, I'm not trying to make y'all do the research work for me, but I'd like to make an awesome short presentation and I know that your perspective will help me craft this into a banger.  Maybe I'll even turn this into an Orange pill vid when all is said and done and I'll happily share the google sheets.",1624569712,32,1

o7qy8s,NEVBnevb001,The world's first virtual token application of blockchain &amp; entity operating mechanism virtual currency has successfully launched.,"New Energy Vehicle BlockchainÔºàNEVBÔºâ- the world's first virtual token application of blockchain &amp; entity services has been successfully launched. The traditional Internet team has spent one year in transformation to prepare a perfect new application system of blockchain. While ensuring 100% decentralized operation of blockchain &amp; entity, all shared physical mining machines (intelligent charging piles for new energy vehicle blocks) finally realize the overall concept of free and selective currency holders becoming mine owners.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eadhmmdpsf771.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22e668a37ce7dc694c31045c3a7cf81e04cef145

Nowadays, with the increasingly serious global warming, it has become a huge problem in the process of¬†human beings development. Therefore, ""environmental protection"" has currently become key point and direction of the transfer of higher industries globally. Undoubtedly, it must be acknowledged the significance¬†of cars to human beings. In the context of rapid technological progress, major global automobile manufacturers, led by Tesla, have successively launched new energy vehicles such as pure electric models and hybrid electric models. Volkswagen even announced that it would take some measures to stop developing traditional internal combustion engines. New energy vehicles soon as it comes to achieve the global consumers favor, but at the same time the widely use of new energy vehicles still exist many problems as follows:¬†such as the low coverage rate of charging piles, the fear of running long distances, the fear of long-term congestion, the shrinking battery life in winter still plague global consumers, and also discourage many users who are willing to consider purchasing new energy vehicles.

However, the birth of New energy vehicle blockchain will eventually change all this. There is no doubt that blockchain will be the most reliable,¬†widely used and most convenient development model for mankind in the future. Therefore, we boldly integrate blockchain technology and concepts into practical services to solve the biggest problem for the smooth development of new energy vehicles. At the same time, we have provided¬†an unprecedented mining environment and low threshold for partners who are willing to¬†generate income by mining. You can freely choose to be the holder of NEVB or one of our NEVB mine owners.

NEVB is a highly autonomous token issued based on mainnet of ETH, which was written into BSSG remote intelligent machine docking system for the first time, and completely realized remote multi-point decentralized intelligent management of physical mining machines (intelligent charging piles in new energy vehicle blocks). It is worth mentioning that the self-developed SZPW mining coin integrated intelligent algorithm is used for the first time, that is to say, the charging amount of users of mining machines (intelligent charging piles in new energy automobile blocks) is equally converted into computing power, and 15% of the charging pile income is equally distributed to each mine owner.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img gbp2hovpsf771...*

The total number of NEVB issued is 300 million 

Among them,

30%: Permanent fixed storage to ensure all possible expenses for the construction of physical mining machines after ICO is issued

30%: Used for token ICO listing and mine pool circulation

15%: Used for initial public private placement (Note: The official website is the only subscription address)

5%:Used for incentive recognized period subscription partners

5%: Used for exchange and mine pool award

10%: Used for reward the team partners

5%: Used for reward early miners

The NEVB mining machine is upgraded and transformed on the basis of charging piles for new energy vehicles. besides the basic components of traditional charging piles, each mining machine is also loaded with the KingPd intelligent block system independently developed, which successfully realizes a new mining machine that is remote, shared, transparent and irreplaceable, namely as long as someone uses NEVB charging piles to charge, each mining owner who invests in mining machines will gain profits from this transaction. Besides, KingPd system will be converted into NEVB or ETH according to the currency exchange rate of each country and the market value of each virtual currency.

The NEVB mining method is significantly different from the previous virtual currency mining method. Specifically, the previous mining machines mostly use computer groups for mining. Due to its excessive energy consumption and a series of other legal problems, it has been suppressed to varying degrees by the local governments of some countries and regions, thus increasing the risk of investment in mining machines. NEVB is the mining income through the physical charging station, which will also bring improvement and upgrade to the local environment, so there is no need to worry about being suppressed and cleared, NEVB mining mechanism will also fully protect the property and income of the mine owners.

In order to completely decentralized private irregularities and avoid some community fraud groups activities, we adopt the method of official public private early subscribe for the first time, before NEVB market circulation, our official website is the only access to the address, we will adopt intelligent control of a computer system to complete the deal with you, Our Public Private Placement Plan will be announced on our official Twitter account.

Looking back over the past decades years, blockchain has been accompanied with us for 12 years, perhaps you have no idea from which day you start to be fascinated by blockchain, maybe it brings you countless glory and wealth, or makes you suffer trough and loses, Looking back at the past, there will always be too many regrets and nostalgia. Perhaps we shall recall whether we are still standing in the same place. we want to witness the future with you together! NEVBÔºÅGO!

o7pzqb,Braiins_mining,Great China Hashrate Migration: we might see a maximum difficulty drop of -25%. Here's what it means for miners.,"This year‚Äôs great China Hashrate Migration has turned into a Hashrate Exodus. Much has been said about long-term implications for decentralization and the mining industry as a whole. Let's zoom in on the next difficulty epoch: an **unprecedented period of mining profitability**.

![img](tdpkyf1yhf771 ""insights.braiins.com"")

At the moment, difficulty is expected to adjust down 20% in 1 week. Based on more recent block times, we may even see a **maximum downward adjustment of 25%**.

![img](en7lpnv3if771)

![img](29lq4dq4if771 ""Explanation of why difficulty adjustments are capped, from Mastering Bitcoin."")

This means that **mining profitability will increase by 20-25% in BTC terms** ‚Äî **the largest increase in Bitcoin‚Äôs history**. While hundreds of thousands of ASICs sit idle in trucks, cargo ships, planes, and warehouses, those that remain online become more valuable.

Let‚Äôs check some profitability stats, starting with the machine that redefined ASIC longevity: the **Antminer S9.** Using Braiins OS+ firmware with overclocking settings to maximize revenue, we see an increase of 2700 sats/day &amp; nearly $1/day profit with 3¬¢/kWh electricity.

![img](dsh5h5zaif771 ""insights.braiins.com"")

![img](69fepapcif771)

How about the latest-gen? Here‚Äôs a look at the **Antminer S19 Pro**. Pre-adjustment, it‚Äôs already mining nearly 70k sats/day. After a conservative -20% adjustment, revenue increases to 86.7k sats/day and profit jumps by almost $6/day with 6¬¢/kWh electricity.

Even with stock firmware, the **Whatsminer M20S** is profiting nearly $10/day at 6¬¢/kWh electricity.   Factor in the -20% adjustment, and you gain 11k sats/day, or an extra tree fiddy ($3.50) in fiat profit.

 And if you are a miner we know, we know: wen whatsminer Braiins OS+???

![img](y3xwiywqif771)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When making mining profitability projections, it‚Äôs always wise to factor in a steep difficulty adjustment. The **average adjustment since 2017 has been more than +5%, meaning that mining profitability has typically decreased by 5% every 2 weeks.**

For miners outside of China who prepared for the typical difficulty increases, these downward adjustments mean that they‚Äôll outperform even their most optimistic projections for Q2 and Q3 2021.

**End.** Salute to all the miners in China who have helped secure the Bitcoin network for the past decade. It's the end of an era.

o7plnh,LonelyInTheNewLand,I put my savings into Bitcoin,"After a lot thinking, reading, and researching, last week I completed putting my savings into Bitcoin. I did it over a span multiple weeks (following the dollar-cost averaging strategy). I haven't told people that they know me about this, and not planning to (for security reasons). Here is my thinking about why I did it and things that I considered:

* I'm debt free and have no responsibilities (not married, no kids, etc.), so for me the time is right.
* I came across crypto first back in 2017, I was interested in the technical side more than the finical side. Bought a little back then, never sold it. Seen it dropped more than 50% in the short term and gained more than 200% in the long term. In the long term, it increases.
* I'm in it for the long term (minimum: 10 years, maximum: forever).
* There will be never more than 21 million Bitcoin. That's scarcity, scarcity has value.
* Bitcoin adoption is increasing rapidly.
* Everything in life has a risk factor, for me holding a fiat currency in a bank that is losing value and purchasing power due to inflation is riskier than buying Bitcoin.
* I did my homework about crypto and security back in 2017 (private keys, cold storage, etc.), so jumping in is technically easy.
* I kept 1 year worth of expenses in fiat.
* I have a full time job so even if the price goes to zero I can start over.
* I'm a skilled software engineer so even if I lose my job I can find another one or do freelancing.

After all, maybe I will be wrong, and yes, maybe I will lose it all, but I'm willing to take my chances. The important thing for me is that I feel good about my decision.

**Disclaimer:** this is not a finial advice by any mean, I'm just sharing my experience. Everyone's life and circumstances are different, and never put what you cannot afford to lose.",1624633787,112,1

With bitcoin, if you can‚Äôt afford a second device, how do you make sure it‚Äôs safe as you go about your day?

Is there a good solution or is it easier to buy a hardware wallet or second device then I think? I thought I read something about a community multisig‚Ä¶.not sure if maybe that‚Äôs the answer? If so, anyone have any links that give details about that solution?",1624627629,21,1

**ETFs open the door to bad things**.

**Rehypothecation**: Look at the price of gold; it has been artificially suppressed via ""paper gold"". Search, ""physical gold vs paper gold"". ETFs open the door for evil people to suppress the price of Bitcoin by selling Bitcoins that don't exist, or, if you prefer, selling the same Bitcoin to many clients (dozens, hundreds), all at the same time. Don't be quick yell ""hooray for Bitcoin ETFs.""

**Government confiscation**: As the US dollar collapses (along with every other fiat currency), it will reach a point where they decide they ""need"" some money with value, to pay the military, for example.

o7mzsl,Common_Individual251,"If you want Bitcoin to moon, then help get the first US BTC ETF approved by submitting a comment to the SEC","&gt;The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the Exchange‚Äôs statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth in the Notice,17 in addition to any other comments they may wish to submit about the proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission seeks comment on the following questions and asks commenters to submit data where appropriate to support their views:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What are commenters‚Äô views on whether the proposed Trust and Shares would be susceptible to manipulation? What are commenters‚Äô views generally on whether the Exchange‚Äôs proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices? What are commenters‚Äô views generally with respect to the liquidity and transparency of the bitcoin markets, the bitcoin markets‚Äô susceptibility to manipulation, and thus the suitability of bitcoin as an underlying asset for an exchange-traded product?
2. What are commenters‚Äô views of the Exchange‚Äôs assertion that regulatory and financial landscapes relating to bitcoin and other digital assets have changed significantly since 2016? 18 Are the changes that the Exchange identifies sufficient to support the determination that the proposed listing and trading of the Shares are consistent with the Act?
3. The Exchange states that ‚Äúapproving this proposal . . . \[would\] allow U.S. investors with access to bitcoin in a regulated and transparent exchange-traded vehicle that would act to limit risk‚Äù associated with retail exposure through other means.19 Further, the Exchange asserts that ‚Äúthe manipulation concerns previously articulated by the Commission are sufficiently mitigated to the point that they are outweighed by quantifiable investor protection issues.‚Äù20 What are commenters‚Äô view regarding such an assertion?
4. According to the Exchange, ‚Äú\[n\]early every measurable metric related to \[Chicago Mercantile Exchange‚Äôs\] Bitcoin Futures has trended consistently up since launch and/or accelerated upward in the past year.‚Äù21 Based on data provided and the academic research cited by the Exchange, do commenters agree that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (‚ÄúCME‚Äù) now represents a regulated market of significant size? 22 What are commenters‚Äô views on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that a person attempting to manipulate the Shares would also have to trade on CME to manipulate the Shares? What of the Exchange‚Äôs assertion that the combination of (a) CME bitcoin futures leading price discovery; (b) the overall size of the bitcoin market; and (c) the ability for market participants to buy or sell large amounts of bitcoin without significant market impact helps to prevent the Shares from becoming the predominant force on pricing in either the bitcoin spot or CME bitcoin futures markets?
5. What are commenters‚Äô views on the Exchange‚Äôs statement, generally, that bitcoin is resistant to price manipulation and that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices exist to justify dispensing with the requisite surveillance sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin?24 What of the Exchange‚Äôs assertion in support of such statement that significant liquidity in the spot market and the decreasing impact of market orders on the overall price of bitcoin mean that attempting to move the price of bitcoin is costly? 25 What of the assertion that offering only in-kind creations and redemptions provides unique protections against potential attempts to manipulate the Shares and that the price the Sponsor uses to value the Trust‚Äôs bitcoin ‚Äúis not particularly important‚Äù?

Basically from what I researched companies would rent out their own computer processing capacity to third parties so they could do that without using their own PC or having to deal with the light bill.

Personally, it feels odd. Why would a company share their own processing capacity with someone else instead of just doing it by itself? Plus, from my own research, I would go in sites with an automatic translation, and who would say stuff like: ""Beware, 99% of those who do this are taking advantage of clients who want a quick buck, but you can trust us because we're legit"".

o6qgzn,Manweofarda,Question for Cryptos,"So having followed the start of the pop culture fascination with various crypto currencies, I have been very tentative about getting involved. 

This has nothing to do with investing in crypto to make money. If you can time the market, you can make money on anything and I envy you, and wish you the best.

If this is covered extensively elsewhere, you can just post links to these questions.

Essentially the issues with cryptocurrencies as a true international currency from my reading seem to be:
1) No real economy will allow a crypto currency to be an equivalent because it would be a currency that cannot be controlled by the government and thus prevent them from managing/controlling inflation.

2) The fluctuating value of cryptocurrencies makes it difficult to use as a legal tender because most businesses operate on very slim margins and the possibility of a 5-25% swing in value would make it difficult for most companies who need reliable income and cannot sit on money for the market to come around.

3) Because of the nature of the blockchain, if you have the will, theoretically every purchase is completely visible to anyone. While I don‚Äôt think anyone cares about someone like me, theoretically for people who are ultra high net worth, the idea that any purchase is traceable could be less than appealing.

Not sure if I recapitulated think points well enough, but hopefully y‚Äôall get my point.

o6q85x,City_Runner,Two blockchain bills pass in the US House POLITICS," From The Block:

""On Tuesday night, the [Consumer Safety Technology Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3723/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22S%22%5D%7D&amp;r=7&amp;s=1) passed in the House of Representatives. Two of its three titles were [blockchain and crypto-focused bills](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/106163/rep-soto-prepares-suite-of-crypto-legislation-for-return-to-congress) from Representative Darren Soto (D-Fl), while the third focuses on regulating AI.

Soto's bills had previously passed in the House, only to be shelved amid the political maelstrom that surrounded the end of the last Congress and the presidential election. Their passage this early in the current Congress will at the very least give the Senate more time to consider them than they had last time around.¬†

The Blockchain Innovation Act would require the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, to put together a report on blockchain's use in trade and, especially, to fight fraud. On the House floor last night, Soto described the bill as ""a first step towards our long-term goal of setting up a Blockchain Center of Excellence in the Department of Commerce.""

The Digital Taxonomy Act ‚Äî not to be confused with Warren Davidson's Token Taxonomy Act ‚Äî starts with the proposition that ""the use of digital tokens and blockchain technology is likely to increase in the future."" It subsequently mandates that the FTC assemble a report on unfair and deceptive practices in crypto markets.¬†

The legislation's progress comes on the heels of major public attention on illicit use of cryptocurrencies following high-profile ransomware attacks like [Colonial Pipeline](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/107496/us-official-says-majority-of-bitcoin-paid-by-colonial-pipeline-after-ransomware-attack-has-been-recovered) and JBS.

The fate of these bills in the Senate remains to be seen. The House has attracted a growing number of crypto advocates over the years, but the Senate, which faces less frequent turnover and hosts far fewer lawmakers, has shown less interest in blockchain regulation. That may [also be changing](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/107983/senator-elizabeth-warren-attacks-cryptocurrency-over-ransomware-energy-use), though not necessarily in a way favorable to the industry.¬†""",1624496483,3,1

o6q0fc,bigmatch,Is the bitcoin halving cycle being invalidated?,"We are all aware by now that historically, halving dates are the start of bull cycles. This belief was further strengthened by the arrival of the S2F and S2Fx model of PlanB. 

Mathematically or statistically, the way S2F and S2Fx were done is pretty dubious. You can further read about it here. [S2F](https://www.coindesk.com/why-the-stock-to-flow-bitcoin-valuation-model-is-wrong)

To summarize that, the S2F model is too linear or too predicated into a single aspect of asset valuation. 

That S2F model may have work in determining 2013 and 2017 runs because retailers are still king during those times. With the arrival of institutions and corporations and even nations, the valuation of bitcoin may not be as easy as before.

So, that prompted the question, are we are already in the process of invalidating the four-year cycles? Meaning, halving dates' impact will be getting lesser by the days and bitcoin will now be traded like a usual asset like gold, fiat and etc. Wherein cycles are determined by different macro things, not only stock-to-flow ratio.

I think this can be confirmed if we will continue to be below $50K for the next three-four months, and then we still end up creating a new ATH next year. Although, a much harder confirmation will be a new ATH by 2023 or simply, a weak bear market. 

The invalidation of the halving cycles has a lot of pros and cons. But the biggest thing for me is simply the possibility that bitcoin will now be traded just like how every other store-of-value-assets are being traded.

That way, we can have a much clearer picture of how it really differentiates itself from gold and fiat.",1624495704,9,1

o6pvw9,stratguy56,One BENEFIT of a market downturn: You can save a TON of $$$ on your taxes with this one simple crypto loop hole,"**One benefit of a market downturn:** You can save a TON of $$$ on your tax bill for next year with this one simple crypto tax loop hole. Let's discuss...

If you sell or trade your crypto when it is below the price you originally acquired it for, you incur a capital loss. Capital losses get deducted from capital gains on your taxes, and overall, they reduce your taxable income for the year.

**E.g.** Let's say you bought bitcoin at $55,000 a month ago. If you sold or traded that BTC at market prices today ($32,000), you would lock in a capital loss for the year and significantly lower your taxes.

But it gets even better: Because the IRS classifies cryptocurrency as property and NOT as a security, ""wash sale"" rules do not apply to crypto as they do for stocks. This means you can buy the BTC that you sold back immediately and still realize the capital loss.

This is even MORE important if you have incurred gains earlier this year. Remember, capital losses deduct from capital gains on your tax return during the year they were realized. So if you've already ""realized gains"", you should take losses if possible to offset these gains.

**E.g.** Let's say you traded ETH for [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) at the height of the market. In doing this, you realized a taxable event and likely huge taxable gains as ETH was at all time highs. However, now your [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) is underwater (worth less than you got it for).

So, if you sell out of [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) today, and then immediately buy it back, you will realize losses and offset a lot of those gains that you realized from your trade of ETH to [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) This could save you a TON on your taxes. I know someone who reduced his tax bill by $43,000 by doing this!

This is a process known as Tax Loss Harvesting, and it's a strategy rich people use all the time to lower their capital gains tax bill every year (more info [on TLH here](https://cryptotrader.tax/blog/cryptocurrency-tax-loss-harvesting)).

Also, you can use crypto tax software tools like CryptoTrader.Tax or BitTaxer to automatically detect your biggest tax savings opportunities for you. (The tools cost money, but you can test them out for free)

**So in summary:** Take a look at your current positions and see if there is any opportunity to ""harvest"" losses. Doing this proactively can lead to HUGE tax savings for next year.",1624495240,51,1

In particular, the Commission seeks comment on the following questions and asks commenters to submit data where appropriate to support their views:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What are commenters‚Äô views on whether the proposed Trust and Shares would be susceptible to manipulation? What are commenters‚Äô views generally on whether the Exchange‚Äôs proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices? What are commenters‚Äô views generally with respect to the liquidity and transparency of the bitcoin markets, the bitcoin markets‚Äô susceptibility to manipulation, and thus the suitability of bitcoin as an underlying asset for an exchange-traded product?
2. What are commenters‚Äô views of the Exchange‚Äôs assertion that regulatory and financial landscapes relating to bitcoin and other digital assets have changed significantly since 2016? 18 Are the changes that the Exchange identifies sufficient to support the determination that the proposed listing and trading of the Shares are consistent with the Act?
3. The Exchange states that ‚Äúapproving this proposal . . . \[would\] allow U.S. investors with access to bitcoin in a regulated and transparent exchange-traded vehicle that would act to limit risk‚Äù associated with retail exposure through other means.19 Further, the Exchange asserts that ‚Äúthe manipulation concerns previously articulated by the Commission are sufficiently mitigated to the point that they are outweighed by quantifiable investor protection issues.‚Äù20 What are commenters‚Äô view regarding such an assertion?
4. According to the Exchange, ‚Äú\[n\]early every measurable metric related to \[Chicago Mercantile Exchange‚Äôs\] Bitcoin Futures has trended consistently up since launch and/or accelerated upward in the past year.‚Äù21 Based on data provided and the academic research cited by the Exchange, do commenters agree that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (‚ÄúCME‚Äù) now represents a regulated market of significant size? 22 What are commenters‚Äô views on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that a person attempting to manipulate the Shares would also have to trade on CME to manipulate the Shares? What of the Exchange‚Äôs assertion that the combination of (a) CME bitcoin futures leading price discovery; (b) the overall size of the bitcoin market; and (c) the ability for market participants to buy or sell large amounts of bitcoin without significant market impact helps to prevent the Shares from becoming the predominant force on pricing in either the bitcoin spot or CME bitcoin futures markets?
5. What are commenters‚Äô views on the Exchange‚Äôs statement, generally, that bitcoin is resistant to price manipulation and that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices exist to justify dispensing with the requisite surveillance sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin?24 What of the Exchange‚Äôs assertion in support of such statement that significant liquidity in the spot market and the decreasing impact of market orders on the overall price of bitcoin mean that attempting to move the price of bitcoin is costly? 25 What of the assertion that offering only in-kind creations and redemptions provides unique protections against potential attempts to manipulate the Shares and that the price the Sponsor uses to value the Trust‚Äôs bitcoin ‚Äúis not particularly important‚Äù?

Because everyone dream to be rich one day, and Bitcoin made everyone believing in it.

If that crypto could really exist wich extraordinary fundamentals would it possibly have ?

Firstly it has to be a store of value to make it comparable to Bitcoin. I'm not comparing bitcoin to Ethereum or others defi crypto/blockchain. Because I really believe that Bitcoin is more to compare as a store of value, where ETH is a decentralise system. 

When I think to a ""store of value"" I think to a limited in number crypto to make it a valuable crypto.
Secondly if we follow the initial purpose of Bitcoin creation, it has to be an easy usable crypto by everyone in the world. 

To make it possible it would logicaly need to be : scalable, secure, fast, feeless and ecological.

No need to explain why it has to be secure, but why feeless ?
Because if we want BIG BIG performance we need this crypto to be adopted by a really large amount of people. And to make it use by everyone in the world this crypto has to be 100% free for every transactions. 
Why ? Because paying 0.1/0.5/1/2/3/10/20 etc. dollars each times we buy something isn't imaginable because it would be a real problem for every little payments and poor people adoption. Imagin if your bank would tax you 1$ for each payments you do ? It's simply impossible to afford.

Why ecological ? Because if all the umanity use this crypto as an everyday payment, it's unthinkable to believe that each futur transactions would cost an anormous amount of energy, growing even more each time the bigger people's adoption it become.

Why scalable ? Simply for making it usable as a very, very large amount of people.

Why fast ? It's simply logical to understand that we need an instant payment for everyday purchases, like with our credit card.

If we realise this, maybe one day this crypto would change the world and potentialy replace Bitcoin...

And if I tell you that only 1 crypto in the world has this fundamentals, and is existing with a 0.5B market cap while BTC is at 500B market cap ?

Thanks for reading me everyone ! 

Nothing can predict the futur and I won't tell you here the name of this crypto otherwise everybody would think I'm doing publicity, while I would prefer everyone to make their own research to chose by themselves if they believe in it or not.

* Purchasers receive the cryptocurrency amount from an item at the time the customer confirms its delivery instead of waiting for the entire order to be delivered.
* Customers can set a **minimum exchange rate** on the request **to be safe against market rate drops** while it is still waiting to be accepted.
* Customers can select additional instructions/conditions that the purchaser must meet in order to accept or complete the request.

Lets say i have ledger nano s holding btc eth and 2 other alts that work on their platform but they are all stored with same ledger, same wallet with same seed words. How does the seed words coordinate with btc blockchain, eth blockchain and the 2 altcoin blockchains. Like i know each word in the seed words is a number so all 26 words create a giant code number so that code number identifies your share on the btc blockchain, and that same number identifies your share on the eth blockchain and so forth? Is that how it works?

Another follow up question is if i have a wallet lets say nano s, i use it and then drain it empty so theres no crypto on it. Then i close the wallet reset the ledger, and throw away old seed words. What happens to that wallet it no longer identifies anything and is shut down and lost forever? Like those seed words can never be generated again to identifies one owned portion of crypto on a blockchain?

My understanding of it is that, if the L1 network was a WAN, the LN would be a MAN, allowing everyone in it to interact with each other and sometimes interacting with the exterior.

But doesn't that mean that we know that the accounts in the LN are in a certain country for example? If every Salvadoran gets a wallet on the LN, on the Salvadoran LN, then can't we assume that these wallets are all managed by Salvadoran? Isn't it  facilitating the identification process?

Actually, there seems to be several identical ones, for example transaction 3ab99fa9c8e7b37e560a704049552b375bb864a845c46fa053535ffd3a38fb21. Have a look at ""Large transactions"" in https://bitcoinexplorer.org/mempool-summary

These transactions take up 90,825vB and 363,298 wu so they would fill up blocks fast. Even though only around 5000 tx are in the mempool, 25 blocks is required to clear it.

What's up with these? Are they part of a spamming strategy?",1624694526,11,1

o85x8v,MrBlueKrabs,Nicehash Profits/Swing Trading/Exchanges,"I apologize in advance If I sound like a total noob to this, but i feel like reddit is the best way to get an accurate  answer on this. So I started using Nicehash about 2 months ago to make some passive income by earning BTC.  Everything's going great I have low electric costs, using my PC that's mainly used for gaming to run most of the day on Nicehash. I might be getting a little greedy, but i'm trying to see if its possible to make an attempt  to make more BTC off the profits I'm making.

Ive been watching Bitcoin since I started and it seems  like ever since its dropped from the 50-60k range its been bouncing back and forth between the low 30s to the higher 30s. My thought process is  to let it climb to around the 40k mark, sell, then buy back in when it dips down again. (considering this trend continues) Obviously its a gamble, but other then the few extra bucks im spending on electric and the extra wear and tear on my PC components , I feel like its a risk I'm willing to take.  Even if The price shoots way up after I rebuy , or shoots way down after I sell.

Couple of questions  I  would have about this would be would it really be worth it? After taxes and fees( Withdrawing profits straight to coinbase since I don't pay anything to do it, but about a 2$ fee if I want to sell or buy) Say Im only starting with about a 20 -30 dollar profit If I wait for it to go up about 5k within a couple of weeks or so, and hoping for a snowball effect as time goes on.

 Should I sell it for Fiat money?or would it make any more sense to convert to a stable coin, possibly earning interest while I wait for a better selling point? 

Using coinbase is convenient right now since I can withdraw straight from nicehash for free, but would it make more sense to withdraw or trade from somewhere else to avoid the higher coinbase fees?",1624691480,6,1

o85q95,vvillehelm,Does r/Buttcoin constitute a hate group?,"My post is about two aspects of the subreddit r/Buttcoin in relation to Bitcoin.

1) I have visited the forum a few times, typically by accident as it shows up on my feed and I don't notice that it's not r/Bitcoin before I've read some of the comments. Originally I felt it was a ridiculous place, a place primarily for insult trading, but generally harmless. But lately I've seen their rhetoric has grown more aggressive, they've taken to placing flairs on Bitcoin supporters, essentially labeling them derogatorily, which has eerie parallels with general authoritarian behaviour towards certain groups, and I see the subreddit as being increasingly hateful towards the people who are supporting Bitcoin as opposed to being against the technology itself. If it is a hate group, am I off base in questioning why such a subreddit is acceptable on Reddit?

2) More of an inference and warning to fellow investors and supports of Bitcoin, that some of the rhetoric I'm seeing online in places like r/Buttcoin and even overhearing in the public, are extremely aggressive against us, and it would be wise of us all to realise that there is a distrust, fear and hatred out there towards those our industry, and that it may grow exponentially as the impact of Bitcoin grows exponentially. I am issuing a warning to everyone here, to be less casually vocal about your involvement in Bitcoin. Yes, it is fine engage in Expo's and speak with like-minded people and share strategies and so on, but in general I think it's more important than ever to keep our cards closer to our chests in everyday life or risk the possibility of future negative consequences ranging from losing jobs, to losing access to services, political retribution, and even to aggression or in the most extreme events, lynch mobs.

People who spent 20 to 50 dollars at the grocery store in their childhood are spending hundreds today, in another ten to 20 years they could easily be spending thousands.

The US pays off its national debt with the money they receive from new bond market investors, creating even more national debt in the process. This is exactly how a Ponzi scheme works with how they take new investor money to pay off old investors. Eventually, the bubble grows too big to ever be paid off by any new wave of investors, forcing them to print more money and further dilute the dollar just to pay it off its own debts once there are not enough new investors to pay off the old national debts.

Being a native Spanish speaker I've been following local media. The FUD against Bitcoin is really strong.

Bukele is widelly being made fun of for saying ""Every business has to accept Bitcoin but doesn't have to receive it"" This is obviously correct, as merchants have the choice to instantly get their payment converted to dollar, but taken out of context is a great line for haters and propaganda makers.

The 30$ dollar airdrop is being criticized because you need to use the government app to get it (Which has id + facial recognition KYC)... ""what will they do with our data?"" Even if is completely optional and you can use any LN app you like. At the same time they criticize Bitcoin because it will suit criminals and money laundry... I just don't get it.

I am really intrigued how this will play out. Only 90 days of implementation and education are really optimistic and I can understand the fear of those in El Salvador who have no idea how BTC works and what it is. I really wish this does not backfire on BTC.

If you believe that the value of Bitcoin is strongly related to the number of users and the network effect, a ban of 1.5bn users means that the value of Bitcoin has to decrease. (3) China banning miners is also a big deal. Less miners means that the hashrate/difficulty decreases and the network becomes less secure, therefore decreasing its value. (4) The narrative of this bull market was institutional investors and the ‚Äúwall of money‚Äù coming in, but the ESG component of Bitcoin was underestimated.

I think China‚Äôs ban of BTC is ultimately a strategic move to position the digital yuan as the new world reserve currency. We might see a new digital ‚Äúcold war‚Äù with Bitcoin as reserve currency of the free world and  government CDBCs in autocratic regimes.

I‚Äôm still very bullish on BTC and the crypto market, but it could take a while until the market recovers. Mining will move to US and other locations and will be cleaner, settling up for a new bull run. History has shown that Bitcoin always comes back stronger.",1624736883,11,1

o8h9tg,Sad_Luciferr,Blockchain.com Scammed Me...,"don't use blockchain.com. so this is my story with blockchain :

on  December 22, 2020, I mistakenly deleted the Google Authenticator app from my phone and couldn't recover it, and unfortunately, I lost my Blockchain Exchange account 2Fa 

when I realized that, I immediately requested blockchain to reset my 2Fa

they said you can reset it with your 2Fa backup code or verifying yourself by taking a photo from yourself holding these informations:  

1. Today's date;
2. Today's BTC price;
3. A handwritten text ""*2FA reset for the Blockchain.com Exchange"";*
4. Email Address registered to your Blockchain Exchange account;
5. Your full name, address and date of birth.

Since I didn't have my 2fa back up I was forced to verify myself.

In summary, I end up sending my information and verify myself but there was a problem, some of my information when signing up was fake because blockchain wasn't supporting my country 

but on January 13, 2021, they ended up accepting my verification and they answered me with this message :

https://preview.redd.it/gff0si0uln771.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b832555e07bbfd6b45dcd913b23a6516694681d3

 so they said the funds will be refunded, and I send them a BTC wallet address to refund my money

and this is what they answered 

https://preview.redd.it/gsqk9vdbmn771.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91141ea6d364809e29b2fa040cc03f2304467ee0

I asked them, when? but I kept getting the same message and they set my request to SOLVED

so after about 2 months I create a follow-up to my previous request and asked them to give me an estimated time but they set my request to solved with no answer

I created few more follow-up requests but the same thing was happening until I tried to do it once more after 2 months, but this time this is what they said :

https://preview.redd.it/nltk9w1ynn771.png?width=1056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4259f9dc04530b143e198bf3357fd13ed1d85f7b

I was so confused and I was like what does that have to do with my problem I don't know what they were talking about and at the same time I realized my blockchain exchange account is deleted cause when I was trying to sign in it tells me to sign up and an account with this email doesn't exist I tell the new support the whole story again but after about 5 months they still haven't answered me and my request is still open.

after all that and a few months later I create a follow-up to my first request again, first time I explain everything again but all they do was setting my request to SOLVED  with no answer did the same thing again after few months but all I get was a SOLVED request with no message and now its been almost 8 months and still haven't got even an answer.

hope they even hear me out or people in here help me.",1624735400,47,1

Was Bitcoin an awesome idea from the start? Yes.

Does Bitcoin work? Yes.

Is Bitcoin secure? Yes.

Is Bitcoin scarce? Yes.

Does Bitcoin continue to improve? Yes.

Can a person tell much by looking at price changes over a relatively short period of time? No.

Is Bitcoin's price volatile? Yes.

Does Bitcoin's price volatility matter to long-term, buy-and-hold investors/owners? No.

Do many people know what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works? No.

Do many people understand fiat money? Fractional reserve banking? Central banking? No.

Is the current global financial system still based entirely upon fiat currencies? Yes.

Is fiat money backed by anything? No, not since 1971.

Is fiat money created from thin air by central bankers? Yes, by the trillions.

Is excessive ""money printing"" a form of theft? Yes.

Do fiat currencies always devalue to zero? Yes.

What about today's fiat currencies? They are well on their ways to zero.

Did criminal bankers get bailouts about ten years ago? Yes.

Did criminal bankers go to jail for causing the 2008/9 crisis? No, they got paid huge bonuses from the bailout money.

Did anything significant get fixed as a result of 2008/9. No. In fact, today's situation is even worse than then.

Are banker bailouts still happening? Apparently: recent Fed repo activities... looks like some Too Big To Fail / Too Big To Jail entity is insolvent. Stay tuned.

Is the economy doing well? For the top one-tenth of one percent, yes. For the rest, the bottom 99.9% - with few exceptions, no.

Are there asset bubbles due to central bank activities? Yes, in stocks, bonds, real estate, fine art, etc.

Do asset bubbles always pop? Yes.

Is there negative interest rate debt? Yes. Many trillions, and growing.

In all recorded history, have there ever been negative interest rates? No, not until very recently.

Are negative interest rates a strong warning signal. Yes.

Is Bitcoin better than fiat money? For getting paid and buying groceries, not yet. For long-term, buy-and-hold investing, yes.

Is Bitcoin a better long-term investment than stocks? Yes.

Is Bitcoin better than bonds? Yes.

Is Bitcoin a better long-term investment than real estate? Until the current bubbles pop, certainly. For all time? Yes, because real estate has significant holding costs, real estate can be confiscated, real estate is a sitting duck for high taxes.

Is Bitcoin better than gold? In many ways, yes. Overall, for sure.

Should people panic and sell their Bitcoin holdings because of a sudden change in price? That's not for me to decide. Still, I learned a long time ago not to panic.

Has Bitcoin seen sudden and significant price changes in the past? Yes, both up and down.

What is Bitcoin's long-term ROI? More than 100% per year, on average.

Is there any reason to believe the long-term ROI trend will continue? Read this post again, from the top...",1624723492,95,1

o8deq8,BigBobM,10 things I love about Bitcoin,"The freedom it provides. The hope. How it breeds self-sovereignty. Its mystery and depth. The ever-expanding crew of cyber-hornets. Its indifference to the pundits. Its staunch, principled nature. How it‚Äôs a sledgehammer to corrupt institutions. The rock-solid base layer it sets. 

What could a societal low time-preference look like?

There‚Äôs an evolution occurring as one journeys down the rabbit hole. The search for knowledge transforms us on a foundational level. That‚Äôs a good thing. A creative destruction within. 

What does decentralization entail? A million-headed monster sprouting new body parts every day. How can you stop or even hope to contain that? Who cares about backwards politicians who shoot themselves in the foot? They can suck a fat one. Pray for their citizens though. 

Freedom will follow separation of money and state. Corruption will dissipate. We're taking human lizard-brains out of the equation as we construct a rock-solid foundation for our societies and lives. The network is trustworthy as hell by being trustless. I‚Äôm tired of clinging to bankglomerates that have penetrated our ass lubeless for as long as we can remember. This ship has no captain now. 

Dissolve your ego or you‚Äôll be swarmed by a buzzing band of cyber hornets. I can‚Äôt help but smile as they do their business, stinging and discarding greedheads and imbeciles. Don‚Äôt kick the nest, or else.

I love how it keeps you on your toes. Hornets scour headlines and tweets until their perception is honed. I‚Äôm focused on the mining situation. The ‚Äúgreat migration‚Äù from China dispersing ASICs all over the globe. It‚Äôs about energy. What is the production cost of these digitally native tokens? Can I get in on the action?

One massive central bank sitting in Washington. It stinks of greed and misallocation. Conjuring up trillions with a few keystrokes and handing it to rich fucks who need it the least. At least Blackrock gets to own your entire neighborhood!

Contrast that with the dispersed nature of these humming, juiced-up machines cranking out the currency of the future. Truth-engines devouring cheap energy and producing deflationary bits of encrypted keys we all cherish so deeply.

\---

I love the mindset it demands from me. This is what I call the Zen Hodler Mindset‚Ñ¢. 

Learning to master my emotions as the price manipulates them with roller-coaster gyrations. Reminding myself to zoom out and gaze at the big picture. I find peace the less I check the intra-day price. It‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs better than anxiety. 

I love every individual devoted to the cause, even if I don‚Äôt know them personally. These people have the balls to do critical thinking. They go against what‚Äôs popular, hot and trending. 

Saylor. Pysh. Mallers. Marty. Odell. Gladstein. Parker Lewis. Hordes of others laying the groundwork for a peaceful revolution. 

I love when low time-preference seeps into my psyche. What can we build? With the ability to save money, we can think in decade-long increments. Building a skill/craft slowly and methodically is possible when the ground underneath us isn‚Äôt crumbling. 

What else? At its core it is hope. A brighter tomorrow. Sprawling citadels where life is but a dream. What have we been working toward if not a better world? I craft that vision over time, as the journey unfolds and motivation Strikes like Lightning Labs.

Only the righteous will survive. Greedlove got popped and was a corpse faster than JFK. Trust no one but yourself. That‚Äôs a tenet of this peer-to-peer wasteland. 

But know that each day we grow stronger. Stack your holdings and let‚Äôs add new members to the swarm constantly. Tomorrow there will be growth from today and then even higher the next day. The rabbit hole is a journey... and there may not be a destination.",1624722794,10,1

https://postimg.cc/gallery/y3X8w7j


Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your fears! 

I thought I should take a moment and clear things up. I've gotten a lot of messages of support but many more with questions. Please read everything here and I hope this answers some questions. 


For those of you that I haven't ran into over the years, my name is Withers. I was a friend and enemy of John. I first met him when I was around 14. John was very different then. Still eccentric and crazy but very different. He changed around 2007 and never fully came back. What most have seen in the last 15 years is an old man that was addicted to many drugs, paranoid, losing money hand over fist and scamming just to live and get his fix. He wasn't always this way. 


However, before I move on, it's important that I'm honest with you. John, for at minimum the last ten years, has been a very evil man. He has hurt a lot of people. Between his paranoia, his drug induced rage and sexual desires, and his scams, he hurt a lot of people and there families. 


In fall of 2018 a friend showed me some documents, where John had been accused of rape in TN. It happened after Guatemala. She was a 15 year old girl at a party. Apparently she was thought to be an of age prostitute. Long story short, there was minimal evidence and with help, it was closed and kept quiet. 


I spent the fall and spring, talking to his friends, enemies and so on. I believe Allison. I only confronted john once with evidence of these sexual charges. He was guilty but he hated it. Never stated it.  He would go through good times and bad times. Using drugs to get through the bad, which made him crazy and more paranoid. 


To Allison and anyone else he hurt, know that when I knew for sure, I did what I could. I am so sorry that he hurt you!  He was like a crazy uncle in some ways and dealing with it was incredibly difficult. He did have a lot of friends and knew just enough to have a few favors stored away. 


To anyone he scammed, I apologize on behalf of the old, eccentric but sane John Mcafee. He was always very savvy but late in life he turned to outright scamming. I and others he trusted can not pay back hundreds of thousands or fix the emotional and mental damage he did. I do hope you get help and continue to search for happiness. I wish it was black and white but it's not, it's very complicated. I did manage to keep the mcafeemagic bs down, the best I could. 


John Mcafee is dead. I promise you. He waited on someone to make a call or send the right people, and no one did. He waited for months. You see John had some secrets. Old secrets. His entire life started with a secret. He killed his father when he was 16. You could tell when he told the real story. He would cry non stop. 


His dad was a drunk. He would beat John and his mother. John shot him. With a shotgun when he was drunk and abusive. You'll find little about his mother. She's a complicated woman. More complicated than his dad. He was very troubled early on. 


John fell into shit at Booz Hamilton and kept finding his way up. Got his secrets in the 80s-early 90s. Secrets are like fresh baked bread. They start losing their value the moment you take them out of the oven. 


I wrestled. For a long time. Through many accounts I lurked and asked. Finally on Monday I asked one last time. Hoping someone would jump to his defense. But I knew what he had become. 


https://np.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/o6fwbq/is_john_mcafee_worth_saving/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf



I posted that question the moment I heard about his extradition. I'm sure someone can confirm the time I posted it. There were people there watching and waiting. I know the protocol. I know what comes next. I had the chance to make a call. Try. But I didn't. John was always complicated. He was in many ways a genius. But he had done a lot of horrible things. I've talked to many of his associates and friends. Between the drugs and scars, he just lost it. Whatever it is. I am sorry I didn't make the call. But not sorry enough to change the decision if I could. 


I am guilty of helping John. Many many years ago.  Then guilty of destroying John. Once I knew what he had done, the options were limited. He knew enough to weasel out of things. So I kept him busy. Kept him moving and broke. I know he was broke. A broke and running scared Mcafee is the best I could do. I'm sorry I couldn't do more to those he hurt. It is complicated. I kept him on the damn boat floating between ports, burning his and Brocks digital cash. Sadly, some of that he scammed was from some of you guys. Now I think that by keeping him running maybe he stole more from people. But I saw everything he did while he was running. And he didn't hurt anyone. I made sure. That was my goal. He kept getting off but I knew what he was. So I kept my running. Until I couldn't handle him. So..... I left him to the system. 


Looking back maybe my keeping him running was my inability to handle the truth. I don't know. I mean I didn't have any more evidence  than any other prosecutor. I didn't have a smoking gun. John did stupid, horrible  things when he was drugged or drunk. But he knew to tidy them up. If I had something that was 100 percent, I would have turned it in, but it's hard to get things to stick to John. Not to mention, certain people have passed since then, which now makes this much easier. 


I messaged a lot of you, from old post in those hours of contemplation. Thank you for sharing with me. The good and mostly bad. 

Janice....... Well see the texts posted 

John, the cyber security legend is no more. Actually, he never was. John's brilliance was never cyber. It is so hard to befriend a person that does such horrible things. He is gone and a weight is lifted. He can now, no longer hurt anyone. He was a very innovative man, but it was not worth it the pain he caused. 


I hope John's legacy is of a troubled man. A man with demons. Brilliant and evil. A believer in freedom. However, he had the luxury of having that freedom with those secrets protecting his ass. I think his life would of been very different if he never found out certain things. He did some good things though. I hope one day everyone knows the whole story. 


I know some will say I didn't do enough, soon enough. You maybe right, but I did what I could and ultimately, the day he was extradited was one of the hardest of my life. I made the decision not to save him and he's gone now. Just like that. No time for regrets. People shouldn't hurry other people!  No matter what they know! 

Even though you were crazy and I'll, part of me will miss you John.

Watch the Dollar Fall as Bitcoin &amp; Cryptos Rebound Significantly And because the money game's insidiousness lies in its control. not destructive Therefore, China must come up with a new strategy. by creating a situation and the news that floods in until new investors have to shake as well as the trick that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates (Despite the fact that QE money is pumped out in abundance) because this is China's plan to begin to adjust the market price for the dump. Something that they own. What can you do???
The fact that the US came out to raise interest rates and pushed QE back into the market meant a signal. The bubble in the dollar that was born until it was clearly visible. Because when investors fear the bubble may burst soon Everyone will rush back to the safest things (for investors) are US assets and gold. In fact, at this point in time, the vast majority of holdings are China. This kind of money game is much more brutal than destroying Bitcoin. It has to do whatever it takes to lure inexperienced investors to flee US Asset and Gold before dumping them on the market. So the only thing that still remains is The world's bitcoin and crypto frenzy will make this China's plan. It's more difficult to accomplish because investors have a very high chance of turning to bitcoin and other cryptos instead. I hope you read this line. I wish you all good luck and please study the risks before investing every time.

- Whats gonna happen to the people who own btc in China if they can't sell? Are they going to hold indefinitely? How is that going to affect price?
- How is the price affected since mining operations shut down? Doesn't that mean the availability of btc is going to be constricted, making it more valuable? Or would it be good news if some other country starts mining like crazy?
-Can't say China is going to keep out of btc forever, I'm almost sure the party is still going to use that btc in some way for political deals etc, just like how they hold usd. Maybe theyre gonna take away the btc of its citizens?

Âçê Hitler's Wealth Formula Âçê 
https://hitlermoon.net

Ever wonder why Hitler chose the swastika, the symbol of PROSPERITY, as his emblem?!
He wanted to make everybody rich!

Bolshevik financiers who want you to stay poor tried to suppress the truth about Hitler's Wealth Formula. They destroyed the Third Reich so that the Formula couldn't liberate the world from the shackles of poverty. Bolsheviks thought they got him, but Hitler and his most loyal followers escaped to the Moon and turned it into world's wealthiest economy - the Fourth Reich.

He was waiting for the right time to try to recapture planet Earth... and now with the power of decentralization, nobody can stop Hitler. He will share the Formula with the whole world! He WILL make YOU rich!

Wernher von Braun and Adolf Hitler translated Hitler's Wealth Formula into an Ethereum decentralized exchange smart contract, HitlerSwap, that guarantees everyone 1000x returns on investments in Fourth Reich's official currency - HitlerMoon!

How does it work? We block all the Bolshevik exchanges from ever interacting with HitlerMoon. You can only trade HitlerMoon on HitlerSwap and Hitler's Wealth Formula guarantees the price will NEVER EVER go down. It can ONLY GO UP! All trades on HitlerSwap are executed in harmony with Hitler's Wealth Formula ensuring everyone can get a 1000x return!

Holders of more than 10,000 HitlerMoon can convert their tokens into a Fourth Reich citizenship. If the last 2 bytes of the blockhash are 8 and 8 when selling your stake you will get a free ticket to go to the moon and visit the Fourth Reich.

After 1 year everybody will be rich and Hitler will let financiers back in just to show you how right he was about them!

In 2020, your $1,000 is actually worth $1,040.12 in 2021 money due to the 4.99% inflation. This is calculated by BLS and uses the consumer price index. 

To put in a 20 year context, your $1,000 back in 2000 has the same buying power of $1,563.27 today. But if you left it in the bank and collected a tiny interest over time, your actual money has depreciated over the decades. For other countries like the UK, their inflation is actually worse. ¬£1,000.00 in 2000 would be equivalent to ¬£1,726.63 in 2021.

This can be described as a way which - supposedly - allows you to access memories of your past life/lives (implying reincarnation).

I am scientifically minded but I also accept that there is so much we don't know about the very nature of ourselves and the universe in which we happen to live.

So, I was thinking: let's suppose for a moment that reincarnation -  or something similar - is real. What would that imply?

Being bitcoin what it is - an asset which you fully own by simply 'knowing' something (private-key / seed) - then bitcoin would also be the only asset that you can easily 'leave to yourself' in your next life/lives.

You would 'just' need to see/remember the seed (again), for example with the help of spiritual regression.

Thinking about other kind of assets, it would be extremely difficult to (re)acquire them in your next life, because it would be almost impossible to prove your 'property rights' on them (and everything would have been inherited by your 'old' relatives).

Bitcoin is different: knowing the seed is enough 'proof' (but this can work only if you didn't leave the seed to your relatives).

I just take about 15 minutes looking at the charts get in a trade, and easily get 1-2% (I use 5x leverage) every day but this honestly seems like one of those ""too good to be true"" because if I keep this up then I will technically have 37x profits in a year, and this doesn't seem right for it to be so easy (from my experience) and require so liitle time.

If this is true, and BTC someday becomes the world's reserve currency, replacing the 200 trillion dollars of currency in circulation around the world, that would imply that the final value of one BTC could be as much as around 10 million dollars, nominally speaking, in today's money.

Which would make each sat worth about a dime.

And of course the shrinkage, while I'm sure it's slowed dramatically as BTC has increased in value, hasn't stopped altogether. And even after it arrives at its final destination, and even if that destination is 10 million usd, it won't stop even then. Even if BTC replaces all other currency, the deflation, although slowed, will never stop.

Those are kind of sobering thoughts. And that's also assuming that its evolution from this point forward is smooth. While I'm very optimistic about BTC's ultimate success, I think a big part of that success will be surviving yet another global financial crisis, which I believe will be far worse than the first one. I believe BTC could suffer horribly in the short term during such an event, but recover dramatically when hyperinflation of fiat currencies finally sets in. I could easily see a scenario in which a global financial crash brought BTC to its knees, and cause the world to think it had failed. In such an event, we could see key loss like never before, even worse than the development phase when people took few precautions to protect them.

So ultimately it's anyone's guess how much value a single BTC could have. But it would seem that 10 million in today's dollars is a good conservative estimate, in the event that it eventually became the universal reserve for the world.

I write this as a word of encouragement, but also as one of warning. Along with the standard advice of not investing more than you're willing to lose, I would add to that, if such a time comes when people think BTC is dead, that may be your signal to guard those keys more tightly than ever before. Even if it returns to .10 per BTC, you continue to protect that BTC as if it were worth 10 million, because if hyperinflation kicks in, it could literally go from .10 to 10 million dollars in only a few short months.",1624826317,101,1

o94rwy,ZypherBro,"Bitcoin, daily hash rate, future energy consumption and the lightning network","Dear knowledgable bitcoiners,  


I love simulation modelling, and I've been playing around with a model to get a better understanding of Bitcoin and its energy consumption. Basically, I used this scientific paper as a starting point: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09212](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09212). I then added some small components to simulate historical energy consumption of the Bitcoin network, and compared my results to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index ([https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption)).   


Here are the historical simulation results (simulation starting at 9th of july 2016  and running in days):   


[Bitcoin Energy Consumption from 9th of july 2016 to early june 2021 ](https://preview.redd.it/hlr3gw6r7v771.jpg?width=478&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64103052c843370a0099c9145900c289e6706911)

I then started playing around a little. I ran a simulation going about 20 years ahead while assuming the following:  
\- Daily number of transactions will remain constant at 250 k per day  
\- Transaction fee per transaction remain constant at todays level (measured in BTC)  
\- The energy efficiency of mining hardware also stays constant at todays level  
\- The electricity prices stay constant at todays level  
\- The price of bitcoin increases 5% per year.   


This is what I got:   


[Bitcoin Energy Consumption from 9th of july 2016 to somewhere about june 2041](https://preview.redd.it/8xl8wpyf8v771.jpg?width=489&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a3a518313080a8d9d31609e79687a433f20f89)

  
I then realized that the miners are mostly incentivized by the built-in subsidy right now. In fact, my model estimates that bitcoin miners would only consume about 15 TWH per year if it wasnt for the built-in subsidiy. Due to the halving events, the incentives for mining will go down over time following the next halving as long as the bitcoin price does not increase by more than 50% per 4-ish year period.  At least according to my model... 

Having realized that, I came to think about the lightning network. Someone told me that the lightning network will basically bundle a lot of transactions such that it becomes only one transaction on the network. This had me wondering, what will happen to the future hash rate if LN bundle a lot of transactions in one transaction, and the block rewards go down significantly? Won't it become much less profitable with mining? Will the network still be secure in a setting where the hash rate is very low?

So if the world on average gets better hardware the difficulty increases, or if a whole country all of the sudden had to stop mining, decreasing the world wide Bitcoin processing power in the process, the difficulty will decrease. 

Why isn't the block size adaptable as well? In the past decade mining difficulty has increased orders of magnitude because Moore's law etc. But Moore's law also affects storage and bandwidth cost, so the price per block was considerably more expensive back in the day than it costs now, on every continent of the world, yet the block size doesn't scale with it.

Even if it scaled with the slowest technologically advancing country on earth, even for them 1mb in 2009 was more expensive than it is today. And if it scaled at such a slow rate, you wouldn't run into centralization issues, since for the vast majority of the world it would still get cheaper per block, since the cost per mb lowers more than the increase in block size.",1624897232,86,1

Surely 5K was worth it to buy Amazon in 2004 and hold till today. What makes you think that Bitcoin is any different? Except, it makes no sense to value what you are intending to escape from. We're not going to value bitcoin in bananas because that's hardly fungible.  

I say this to tell you, fret not, your goal should be to go for a couple bitcoin and end it there, more than that is both hard and discouraging against yourself.  You can reach this goal of a couple bitcoin if you dedicate yourself to the cause.

Even two days ago, it was at (just) over 75% of the ""six blocks per hour"" target level.  Now it's at 72%, and with the Chinese end-of-the-month deadline for shutting off power to mining farms, it will drop further in the next two days.

Only problem is, this comes right at the end of a mining period that should already have been over -- we're already five days behind, and the difficulty drop is only going to be about 75%.  This continued drop in hashrate is hitting at a time when it's going to have less effect than needed to accurately retarget difficulty.  So next ""epoch"" will continue to be sluggish.

If you've got an old mining rig, this is going to be a good period to crank it up again.

If you want to send a transaction, you're probably going to be better off doing it now rather than later.  If it's important to you, either don't try to scalp the fee, or use RBF so you can resend it at a higher fee later.

o9l9rz,solomonsatoshi,The Bankers are afraid of Bitcoin and Change it Brings. So They Spout FUD SPIN &amp; LIES about Bitcoin Energy Use.,"In Iceland Bitcoin mining monetises  surplus geothermal output overnight and offpeak when  it would otherwise  be wasted. In Canada, Alaska and until recently  Sichuan and Mongolia  surplus hydro output has been monetised via Bitcoin  mining- hydro water  reserves which would otherwise be dumped unused  have been given value  via Bitcoin mining thus lowering the cost of  overall production and  lowering the cost of these renewables to other  consumers.

The  same approach can be applied to  solar and wind outputs seasonally and  daily where surplus to grid  demand can be monetisied via Bitcoin mining.

The   MSM banker FUD that Bitcoin is not environmentally responsible is BS spin. Bitcoin mining can in fact make most renewable energy  generation systems MORE viable, efficient and profitable and thereby  deliver lower cost renewable power to businesses and consumers by  conveniently monetising surplus electricity production that would  otherwise be wasted.

How much of  most industrial applications are currently powered by  100% renewable  electricity? Are Teslas build and recharged with 100%  renewable  electricity? The banks use 2x more electric  than  Bitcoin. Gold mining uses 2x more energy than Bitcoin  mining...probably  mostly diesel!

oa6yde,wickedsmartcrypto,How Reducing Bitcoin's Smallest Unit of Account (millisat/microsat/nanosat) Could Extend the Block Subsidy Past the 33rd Halving,"First, let me start by saying that I am no expert when it comes to Bitcoin's source code (or C++ for that matter) although I have enough experience to get a basic understanding of what's going on and am curious to see what others might think of my findings as they relate to this post.

Currently, Bitcoin's smallest unit of account is 1/100,000,000th or 0.00000001, also known as 1 satoshi. For those of you that aren't aware, this parameter is set in [src/amount.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/amount.h), line 14,

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000;

If we wanted to change the smallest unit of account, then all we'd have to do is change this parameter, COIN, as follows...

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000000; // for a change to millisats

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000000000; // for a change to microsats

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000000000000; // for a change to nanosats

I'm not exactly sure how updating this parameter might affect other parts of Bitcoin's source code, but this is outside the scope of this post and I'll leave that discussion to the experts (or maybe I'll tackle it in the future once I have a better understanding of Bitcoin's code in its entirety). What I would like to focus on instead is how reducing the smallest unit of account would extend the halving schedule past the well-known and ""final"" 33rd halving, which is estimated to take place around the year 2140.

In his article, [Dissecting the code responsible for the Bitcoin halving](https://ma.ttias.be/dissecting-code-bitcoin-halving/), Mattias Geniar does an excellent job explaining why, with sats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin will only have 33 halvings so please check out this article if you want the full explanation. In summary, in the function GetBlockSubsidy(), located in [src/validation.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L1238-L1249), the initial block subsidy, nSubsidy, is defined as 50 BTC and converted into the smallest unit of account (sats). Then, in the next line of code, there is a clever way of calculating the current block subsidy by taking nSubsidy in its binary form and removing the same number of bits from the right side of that binary number as the number of halvings which have already occurred. So, for example...

**sats**:

The initial nSubsidy is equal to 50 \* 100,000,000 = 5,000,000,000 sats. Written in binary, we get 100101010000001011111001000000000. And now, after 3 halvings, we can calculate the current block subsidy by removing 3 bits from the right, 100101010000001011111001000000~~000~~. Converting 100101010000001011111001000000 back to its decimal form gives us 625,000,000 sats (or 6.25 BTC). Great, the code and math all checks out!

As you can see, the maximum number of possible halvings is equal to the number of bits it takes to represent the initial nSubsidy in binary form. So, with sats as our smallest unit of account, the initial nSubsidy (5 billion sats) in binary form, 100101010000001011111001000000000, only has 33 bits (go ahead...count them...I did!). Thus, after the 33rd halving, there will be no more bits to remove, ~~100101010000001011111001000000000~~, and the block reward will go to zero.

Now, let's do the same exercise but with millisats, microsats, and nanosats.

**millisats**:

The initial nSubsidy would be 50 \* 100,000,000,000 = 5,000,000,000,000 millisats, which in binary is 1001000110000100111001110010101000000000000 (43 bits). Thus, with millisats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin would successfully complete 43 halvings until the block reward goes to zero around the year 2180.

**microsats:**

The initial nSubsidy would be 50 \* 100,000,000,000,000 = 5,000,000,000,000,000 microsats, which in binary is 1001000110000100111001110010101000000000000 (53 bits). Thus, with microsats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin would successfully complete 53 halvings until the block reward goes to zero around the year 2220.

**nanosats:**

The initial nSubsidy would be 50 \* 100,000,000,000,000,000 = 5,000,000,000,000,000,000 nanosats, which in binary is 100010101100011100100011000001001000100111101000000000000000000 (63 bits). Thus, with nanosats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin would successfully complete 63 halvings until the block reward goes to zero around the year 2260.

One thing worth mentioning is the hard coded upper limit to the number of halvings, which is currently set to 64. I assume the reason this limit is set to 64 is because anything higher would require nSubsidy to change its data type from int64 to int128. This change is technically possible, so one could imagine a future where we simply continue shrinking the smallest unit of account and the block subsidy never actually runs out or goes to zero...it just keeps getting smaller and smaller. This could continue as long as our computers are able to work with these increasingly large initial nSubsidy integers.

Naturally, one might then ask, if the block subsidy never runs out, won't we exceed the 21 million BTC hard cap? Quite beautifully, the answer is, no! This would remain the hard cap and instead of exceeding it, we would just keep getting closer and closer to it the more we reduced the smallest unit of account. It would remain an asymptotic limit! This might actually prove to be a better policy since most of us already believe there will actually be 21 million BTC in total when in reality there will only ever be 20,999,999.97690000 BTC (assuming we stick with sats as the smallest unit of account). Ok...one last calculation below...the number of BTC that will be mined in total for each unit of account if adopted...

**sats:** 20,999,999.97690000 BTC by 2140

**millisats:** 20,999,999.99997060000 BTC by 2180

**microsats:** 20,999,999.99999995800000 BTC by 2220

**nanosats:** 20,999,999.99999999996010000 BTC by 2260

Again, as we choose to use smaller and smaller units of account, we inadvertently extend the timeframe of the block subsidy and only get closer and closer to the asymptotic limit of 21 million BTC but never actually reach it or exceed it. This could literally go on forever and we would never run out of block subsidies (not that they would be worth very much...miners would still make the majority of their revenue from transaction fees). But, to me, there's something beautiful about the idea of the block subsidies never running out (never going to zero) even as we go way into the future...possibly until the end of time. I believe the Bitcoin block subsidy, no matter how small, is part of what gives Bitcoin life and is something which, if possible, should never stop flowing.

I would appreciate any and all feedback, comments, and corrections if I've made any mistakes. Thank you for reading this whole post!",1624968489,0,1

It was just a whatever wallet for coins I don‚Äôt care to see in my main wallet. But the problem is sometimes I use my main wallet to send or receive from the the whatever wallet. So I received shibapizza and I transfer my usdt and eth to another CN wallet and left the air drop there. Now my Curiosity got to me. And I try to swap it and it said coin cannot be swap. Now what the worst that can happen to me. I heard dust attack cannot steak it fund. So what is the point of the dust attack. Sorry my English is bad. On my main wallet. Should I move all Fund to a new wallet and then to another wallet. Again the dust was receive on my other CN wallet not my main one. But again sometimes I transfer eth back and forth with each other. So idk if they can see my main account now,1624968380,12,1

I've seen a couple of noobs stumble upon the abovementioned sub / websites, thinking that these resources represent BTC. Indeed, they are trying very hard to conceil the fact that they are a miniscule and unimportant part of the space trying to gain significance. However, they failed doing so over the course of the last 3-4 years.


In short, they are trying to push a fake Bitcoin clone called B.CH (I'm writing the dot because auto-mod doesn't like talk about alt-coins). If you don't know about the history of how these sites came about, google ""the hash wars"" during 2017. You'll see that a faction of people split up from Bitcoin (thank god) to roll out their own shitcoin. However, at this point, they are basically a bunch of bitter propagandists, defining their community as being ""against"" BTC, and trying to trick noobs into thinking that their fork is the ""real"" Bitcoin. 

You'll see that their main argument is that this sub is heavily cens.ored (which is true, look how ridiculous I am trying to avoid auto-deletions), but the reason for that is not to silence opposing views (we can discuss about opposing technical views here all day), but mostly to keep this sub clean (imagine what it would look like here, if moderation wasn't harsh. Ever been on Twitter?)

\- Everything will be free of charge (paying, receiving and converting BTC to USD or USD to BTC).

\- They'll give 30$ in BTC to all users but those BTC will have to be spent and couldn't be converted to USD as it's not about giving money to their population but about giving an incentive to use BTC.

\- There will be 200 PoS in the country to deposit/withdraw USD on the app.

oa3v13,Henrych92,"My thoughts on Bitcoin, why 1000% return in the long term","Here is my thought on how we can have a 1000% return on Bitcoin in the long run. I emphasize it is a long-term investment (at least 3-5 years) from a long-term thinking perspective, not a short-term speculation.

To counter the continual money printing, we need to buy quality assets which one of them is digital gold, Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply of 21 million units.

When comparing Bitcoin to gold, there are several big advantages.

1. Bitcoin is a digital asset and gold is physical. Meaning it is very easy to store Bitcoin, you can just download an app and store it.
2. Second, it is easy to transfer to someone else. You can use the app to do that.
3. Bitcoin can be used in a cross-border payment, you can send it to people from other countries and avoid high remittance fees without the need of a third party.

The current total market cap of gold and bitcoin are around USD 12 trillion and 0.73 trillion respectively. Both of their supplies are fixed. It is not surprising to see the total market cap of Bitcoin can catch up with gold in the long run as Bitcoin has the advantages mentioned above. If we give Bitcoin a long-term market cap of USD 12 trillion and divided by 21 million units, the long-term target price can achieve around USD 570,000, implying a 1,552% potential return from the current price of 34,500 in June 2021.

For being conservative and simple, I think it is reasonable we can at least get a 1,000% return on Bitcoin in the long run. If 1,000% return from now on, my long-term target price is 379,500. Of course, I emphasize it is a long-term investment (at least 3-5 years), not a short-term price target. Short-term price movement is affected by too many unpredictable factors which frankly I admit I cannot predict them in advance. Long-term price movement is affected by its fundamentals mainly, just like stocks.

For more details, I have made a 6-minute video at [https://youtu.be/jtY\_w1trAp4](https://youtu.be/jtY_w1trAp4) to talk more about Bitcoin. Here is my thought for Bitcoin in the long run, what are yours?",1624954098,6,1

Would the project be considered a failure? Would miners just quit since they wouldn‚Äôt have an incentive to continue mining knowing their BTC would go to this megalodon (probably the most likely scenario - I can‚Äôt imagine the miners agreeing to mine blocks just to give to this person)?",1625017056,47,1

They just want a better way to track, trace and tax citizens/ corporations.. otherwise what's really their point?","Governments are racing to create their own ""CBDC""s.. Central Bank Digital Currencies.

However.. a quick look at your bank balance will tell you we're clearly already using central bank digital currency and have been doing so for many many years....

Take the Bank Of England for example... their website couldn't be clearer....

*""Banks create around 80% of money in the economy as electronic deposits in this way. In comparison, banknotes and coins only make up 3%. Finally, most banks have accounts with us at the Bank of England, allowing them to transfer money back and forth. This is called electronic central bank money, or reserves.""*

https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/knowledgebank/how-is-money-created

Many think that CBDC'S won't even use blockchain so surely we're already using near enough what we would have... unless governments want to build in some extra special features......

Even if people want a CBDC... surely we'd want a global currency backes by gold like money used to be...

We have global organisations such as NATO, WHO etc why are Governments racing to build their own CBDC""s and not working on a collaborative global currency?

oal9ye,eaglesfan8835,Never sell your Bitcoin?,"Hello everyone, 

I just wanted to see what the overall consensus was on selling Bitcoin. The well-known Bitcoin advocate Mr. Michael Saylor has already stated that you should never sell your Bitcoin and that you should hold onto it for life. He argues that when you sell you're Bitcoin you're taxed, but if you hold onto it you can borrow against the Bitcoin (tax-free) at a decent interest rate. Platforms such as Block Fi offer this type of service. 

What do you guys think about this? If I double my investment during this next bull run it would be tempting not to sell a little bit for liquidity purposes. I do love Bitcoin and the direction it's going so I plan on investing in this for the long term regardless of short-term price fluctuations.

nrpxc5,teflonjon321,Appreciation and Perspective,"Just finished reading ‚ÄúDigital Gold‚Äù by Nathaniel Popper. All I can say is, wow. 

I want to preface this post with: this book will not teach you how Bitcoin works. It is a history lesson. For the ‚Äòwhat‚Äô of Bitcoin, there are numerous amazing books that have been exhaustively discussed. This isn‚Äôt a post promoting or recommending any book in particular. 

Like so many, I dabbled in crypto with no clue what I was doing in 2017. My story isn‚Äôt unique or important so I‚Äôll fast forward. The pandemic got me back in and now I, again like many, am full-blown obsessed. I‚Äôve been reading books, posts, articles, and watching videos everyday for the better part of a year (still nowhere near an expert). Now that I have read Digital Gold, I have such a deeper appreciation for Bitcoin, where it came from,  and who it came from. I am also just floored beyond belief that this technology, ideology, and community has survived. Getting it off the ground, surviving horrific publicity and misinformation, bad actors, hacks, scams, crimes, and more FUD than I can begin to list...just wow. I finally feel more of an appreciation for all of the truisms that I can now recite from memory but never really thought about (not your keys not your coins, don‚Äôt leave coins on the exchange, never invest more than you‚Äôre willing to lose, etc.). In addition, the price action described in the book puts our current times into much greater context. My God, I can‚Äôt imagine being an OG and looking at a dip from 64k to 29k. When the current floor is an almost inconceivable ceiling from a very recent past, that‚Äôs what I call progress. 

If anyone reading this has been around since those early days, I want to sincerely thank you for believing in and sticking with this crazy idea and for putting up with the ridicule and accusations (ponzi schemers, pornographers, money launderers, drug dealers, terrorists, etc.). You are truly an integral part of this massive and beautiful system. I hope everyone out there appreciates what we are witnessing in real time and knows just how unbelievable this all is. As for me, I am proud and happy to be playing my infinitesimally small role of being a hodler, believer, and (to the increasing annoyance of those in my circle) an evangelist. 

Hodl on my friends.",1622759603,7,2
nrpwym,username7475,"I made 10 million dollars trading crypto on my father's identity, and I'm not sure who should file taxes on it.","So, some background:

The exchanges I wanted to trade on prohibited Americans, so my father gave me his foreign passport to open up some exchange accounts, and deposited about $20,000 in his name.  It is important to note he is a dual citizen who also files US taxes abroad.

I did this with his consent, but we never imagined that initial deposit would appreciate to that level, and I honestly got lucky riding this bull cycle in crypto.

My father is extremely old, knows absolutely nothing about crypto, and has never done any trading.  He just did me a favor and let me upload his documents to KYC on these exchanges.

Now I'm in a situation where I want to pay the taxes on these gains, but don't know who is supposed to file.   Obviously people will tell me to consult a lawyer, but I've already done this and received conflicting advice from different counsel.

The problem is

If we file on my father's name, it's my money, I'm ultimately going to be the one to spend it in the future, and it could look bad that I now have all this wealth and have never paid taxes.

If we file on my name, since I was the one who made the money, there could be an issue that the exchanges have my father on record having made all this money and he never paid taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't get a definitive consensus from the attorneys I've spoken to, so I thought it might be useful to ask a group of people.   I would really appreciate any thoughtful responses.",1622759573,53,0

To me, buying and hodling was not the point of bitcoin or crypto. It was made to be used for something. 

Even though I'm happy about the rise of bitcoin and cryptocurrency awareness generally, all the talk about investing and getting rich is such a major let down. 

I understand that now the talk has transitioned into a ""store of value"" sort of thing / ""digital gold"", but remember when the people who had bitcoin mined it and exchanged it for a purpose other than price speculation? Gambling, buying shit on the internet, whatever else? 

In a bizarre way, I feel like we've regressed, BTC use cases are totally different. 

Now that organizations like Coinbase are releasing bitcoin debit cards I guess you can finally ""buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin"" but the whole landscape has morphed.

So much I see now concerns financial instruments and the super wealthy.

nrm4tj,tookthisusersoucant,Bitcoin is not a democracy and we don't vote for updates.,"I remember in the past, I compared updating your software or signalling for a feature as voting, but I realise that Bitcoin isn't a voting machine and this is important to understand IMO.

Bitcoin is more like an activism machine -- but a much more direct one, because instead of taking action to cause a change, this type of activism is more like taking action to be the change. 

Everyone can run a variation of Bitcoin's protocol, and if enough people want the same thing, Bitcoin will adopt that change. Change is most effective when people are organised and can collaborate, but Bitcoin doesn't facilitate this, we use the internet, social media, and anything else we can to facilitate this instead.

When we signal for a change, we are just using Bitcoin to communicate, but we are not making any changes, we can even build in an activation policy to make it feel like signalling is the voting mechanism, but everyone needs to play their part. They can't just signal and then not act according to their signal... well, they can... and this is why you don't know people's intent until the feature is released. Signalling is just a tool to help further increase awareness and to communicate people's preference, assuming no ill intent.

Voting is too limiting, when you vote for something, there are only a handful of options to vote from and none of them are perfect, but when you see an idea and don't like something about it, you can choose to write your own interpretation and deploy that instead. Again, without collaboration, a single user is not very effective, Bitcoin adopts the wishes of the many, but allowing Bitcoin to be the referee is a very interesting effect.

Ultimately, if everyone did what they wanted when they wanted, the network might not work very well. We started from a base policy and worked our way up. We also organised ourselves, allowed open criticism, and we proved that people around the world CAN collaborate and create order from chaos.

The same system is used for mining transactions too. Someone can refuse to mine a transaction, but someone else can do it instead. If everyone agreed not to mine a transaction, Bitcoin will not mine that transaction, and if over 50% of us **really** don't want to mine that transaction, we can even try to reject blocks with the transaction within it. I'm not advocating for censorship here, I am showing the power of activism in Bitcoin.

Keep this in mind when comparing Bitcoin to PoS and other solutions, because these systems do work by voting. Although some solutions involve randomness to pick the ""validator"", they will rely on voting for things like punishing them. Voting is a blunt tool to allow someone to control the options and force people to choose between them.

TLDR; Bitcoin does not achieve consensus by voting, I'd say its more like activism; everyone advocates for whatever they want to be the change they want to see, and although coordinated activism is better than not, only a coordinated change that everyone is willing to enforce is ever a change that will survive in Bitcoin.

I needed to write this out because it felt like a eurika moment. Hopefully it is helpful.",1622749538,5,1

(for dummies),"One of the popular concerns about [bitcoin](https://guarda.com/coins/bitcoin-wallet/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=bitcoin-beginners): it's too slow for everyday use especially in terms of transaction confirmation. Why is it so? In brief, the longer confirmation means that more people are interested in using bitcoin for transactions. That‚Äôs why BTC network traffic may produce delays.

In fact, transactions on the Bitcoin network itself are controlled by bitcoin miners. Confirmation might be slow because of bitcoin network traffic. It can be high due to the increasing demand for transactions per block. Block sizes are limited, so transactions that exceed the capacity for a block get stuck in a queue for confirmation by the miners.

A good example is the 2017 bull market when traders and investors were forced to wait days for their Bitcoin transactions to clear. Also, the higher demand for bitcoin means a higher transaction fee. However, we have found a solution for our clients.

Even if you bought 30 dollars worth at three different times I'd be curious to see when you got in and your sats stats.

Sats stats:

Entry: March 2020

Cheapest coin: $5,279

Most expensive: $55,751

Average Cost: $23,605

Online gaming is a bit problem. It's highly addictive and destructive and breaks up marriages and families. Addicts often can't pay their bills and mortgages and their children often go hungry as a result of this vice.

Yet I've never once received a warning from my bank alerting me to the dangers of it. I've also never had any payments to betting / gaming sites stopped or questioned by my bank. I place the odd bet from time to time.

So how come they are so concerned about me losing money investing in bitcoin when it's been the best performing asset of the last 10 years, outperforming every stock on the planet, whereas gambling almost always results in losing everything? What's their angle?",1622491047,245,1

npaz92,hyperinflationUSA,Etherum is a shitcoin. It doesn't compare to Bitcoin in terms of a investment.,"History, Vatilk couldn't control and print Bitcoin, so he decided to make his own cryptocurrency that he could print. His first action was printing (pre-mine) 72,000,000 ETH coins and giving them to himself and his buddies. He then sold a bunch of these for bitcoin, becuase the only point of touching altcoins, is to get more bitcoin.   


About two weeks ago at the highs vatilk sold nearly a billion dollars worth of etherum and $0 bitcoin. He owns both but always chooses to sell etherum. Eventually he will run out of ETH and unable to print more he will ditch the project and move on to a new coin that he can print a premine for himself. He's buddy Charles has already done this and thats what gave birth to cardono. Altcoiners are never loyal and you will be left holding the bag.

&amp;#x200B;

Compare to Bitcoin. The creator satoshi, never made a cent off of bitcoin. He never sold a single bitcoin. And he left the project and the project continues to grow. He didn't start a new project after bitcoin. He wasn't in it for the money. Meanwhile, 100% of altcoin creators are just trying to make some money at the expense of anyone dumb enough to buy their pump and dump coin. You only need bitcoin for investing.",1622488476,9,2

Binance answered me that they freezed withdrawals and that my funds were safe. That was a lie from the support team. I discovered today from law enforcements that these users were never been freezed and meanwhile the spending of the week my hackers could withdraw again and disappear with all my funds.

I did not cause I think it is not trustworthy. But, when its price kept increasing,  I was afraid that I would miss something good then I decided to BUY that token even I knew its price was already high. As the result, right after I put money, the price was falling freely. Have you guys got experience on that? if Yes, That was FOMO. So, What is FOMO?

FOMO = FEAR of MISSING OUT.  Means that people around you get profits and you want to be like them, and you do the exact the same thing as them. This feeling will control you and affect on your decision. 

Is FOMO good? in my opinion, FOMO has both advantages and disadvantages. Advantages is for start-up, the owner of the project, it is necessary. But for me, a normal investor, it is not good cause it took a lot money from me. :))

Is there ways to escape from FOMO? the answer is YES. You may heard about the concept: ""JOMO"". 

JOMO= JOY OF MISSING OUT. Means that: OK, whatever the market happens: down or up, correction or not I will not care. I believe in what I invested, and I was not affected by anyone and any bad feelings. As my teacher says, the way to escape FOMO is  ***enjoying what you‚Äôre doing in each moment without worrying about what everyone else is doing*** such as learn to drink tea in the correct way. 

So, Can you guys tell me what is your opinion? FOMO is good or not? what is your choice to escape from it?

ns0jkc,IFeelTheAirHigh,"Bitcoin ""leaking"" value - 1B$ per month","Can you go over my thinking and see if there is some sense there, or am I way off ?  
Bitcoin mining electricity consumption has been criticized several times as harmful to the environment, greenhouse gasses, etc.  Let's ignore that for a moment and consider only the financial implications.  


Rounding the numbers down a bit, if Bitcoin uses 120TWh per year, and each KWh costs 0.1$ then bitcoin burns 1 Billion USD  each month.  
Where is this money coming from?  It comes \*only\* from Bitcoin demand - ie. people spending USD to buy Bitcoin.  12 billion dollars per year are burned this way.    
According to my understanding,  this is a huge ""leak"" of value.   Its like holding water in a bucket with a hole at the bottom. That is not a good way to store value.  When you hold Bitcoin, wether it is in your disk-on-key or Coinbase, it is leaking value.  One of Bitcoins promises is as an efficient value storage. This doesn't look like it.

And the higher the price of Bitcoin, the more electricity is used for mining.  I believe this is linear with Bitcoin price - (eg. twice the price of Bitcoin, then its worth it to spend twice as much on electricity).   So, if you believe Bitcoin market cap 3 years from now will reach x10 of 2021, then it means it will leak 10 billion USD per month, and you will have to have additional 10B of USD ""joining"" the network just to sustain that price.

This increasing leakage of value as the price rises has a negative feedback on the price, and I doubt the price will ever reach x10 if the current mining technology continues.

And finally a small comparison to gold - transferring large amount of Bitcoin is so much cheaper, but for storing value is not a clear winner. When you store gold in your safe, the value you ""leak"" is how much it costs you to keep that safe, well, safe  - eg. property tax, insurance, alarm system subscription, hired guards, etc).  However all these storage costs do not linearly scale up with the gold value, so there is much less of a negative feedback to the price of gold.  


Now on the other hand, if Bitcoin would switch to POS system, all that leakage would almost completely stop,  making a x10 price rise and make clear winner over gold and any other value storage.",1622797192,54,1

Yesterday, when Russia announced that it would cut its dollar holdings from its national fund, I saw many American Bitcoiners celebrating the news. 

Why? ""Based Russia""? Why do they root for China's and Russia's interests? America will stop being the dominant geopolitical power the moment the dollar loses the status of the world's reserve currency (and Bitcoin will certainly be adopted as the next reserve currency). 

FYI, I'm not even an American. I'm just curious why many Americans want their currency to lose any relevance.

nrzq92,xcryptogurux,Elon Musk Bitcoin FUD - Tesla desperately needs a new market for its carbon credits,"There's a lot you could say about that idiot savant Elon Musk. 

For a start, he wouldn't have the connections to be where he is without South Africa's apartheid system.

None of his companies make any money. None! All told. He's a glorified charity project who became a billionaire by taking a government subsidy-funded company public. Just imagine how broken the system is for something like this to be normalized!

He likes to take credit for things other people did. Anything he gets involed in, he wants to become the supreme leader/technoking/imperator/dogfather... He claims to this day with a straight face he founded Tesla! This is exactly what he wants out of crypto. To somehow centralize it under his leadership.

His fossil-fuel-hogging rocket company was built on the ludicrous premise that humans could somehow ""colonize"" uninhabitable worlds.

Everyone who knows anything about astrophysics knows how moronic it is to think we could somehow terraform an artificial atmosphere and live on frickin' Mars, a planet with toxic soil and next to no gravity exponentially more prone to asteroid impacts than Earth for its proximity to the asteroid belt.

[His gazillion plastic surgeries](https://preview.redd.it/buo76nqta7371.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f3aa1f4edebe3584ababadffdd4ad0f0963d2da)

*Processing img 47k1dnnpa7371...*

**But forget all that. Let's just talk about his Bitcoin energy FUD. Why is he doing it?**

Very simple. 2020 was the first time that Tesla made any money. How did they do that? By flogging carbon credits to European car-makers to the tune of 400-500 million dollars per quarter. Without this money, Tesla still wouldn't have a positive cash flow.

[https:\/\/insideevs.com\/news\/438345\/tesla-428-million-carbon-credits-q2-2020\/](https://preview.redd.it/wrqwfqzqe7371.png?width=1022&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64a47df78787f36e43045e09104c5802bab323f4)

[https:\/\/thedriven.io\/2021\/05\/06\/teslas-carbon-credit-windfall-to-shrink-as-rival-car-makers-clean-up-their-act\/](https://preview.redd.it/rpe34l3kd7371.png?width=919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c411a3d4c3951c07a630cb221662d580a6914dbb)

**Now with European car-makers decarbonizing, Tesla needs to create a new market for carbon credits - Bitcoin miners.**

So when people ask how could they not have done their due diligence on Bitcoin mining before investing, **Tesla invested in Bitcoin precisely because they did their due diligence!** They identified Bitcoin mining as their new market for flogging carbon credits.

Tesla invested in Bitcoin roughly the same amount of money they made last year selling carbon credits to show they are taking a position and they now have a vested interest in Bitcoin. It's an investment to attain a semblance of authority over Bitcoin.

Instead of just buying and then selling Bitcoin over energy FUD, because they're long on Bitcoin long-term, Tesla's FUD play was to pretend to accept Bitcoin for payments and then walk it back a month later over energy concerns AFTER selling a portion of their purchase to show a quarterly profit for Tesla.

**Please do share this across social media so that everyone becomes wise to this chancing prick's cynical gambit which has already cost average folks billions of dollars.**

**More importantly, please stop trading based on an individual's opinion about Bitcoin. EVERYBODY has an ulterior motive. EVERYBODY has a self-serving agenda.**",1622793822,405,1

So I met the car seller at a credit union in my network. Test drive, inspection went great. Walked in the lobby with confidence to complete the transaction. No can do. I'm limited in withdrawals to my $500 per day ATM limit. WTF?? Get on the phone with my credit union, totally useless. Best they can suggest is I do a wire transfer directly to my seller, which will take a day. UGH!!

Leave. Call customer service again, get escalated to ""Tier 2"". This guy says everyone is wrong, Of course I should be able to get cashier's checks for the amount I need. But... although the credit union I was at was in ""the network"", it was not in ""the co-op"". He sends me to another credit union.

Drive to credit union #2, wait forever in line. Three tellers laugh and tell me they can't do it, it's impossible.  F\*\*\*!

Go to another ""co-op"" credit union. I explain what I need, teller says ""Ok, no problem."" I don't believe him, holding my breath while I give him my ID and info. As he's typing the teller next to him leans over, ""Actually there's a $2500 limit on transfers."" AAAAAGGGHHHHHHHH!!

So now I'm doing a wire transfer to my seller like it's 1985, and paying $20 for the privilege, and hoping that he gets it tomorrow with no snags. 

I've always believed that Bitcoin usage would grow more in third world countries first because they don't have the plethora of financial services that we already have in first world countries. But that's not good enough. Good luck trying to get ***your money*** sometimes.

Yet when we look at the bigger picture and go beyond this year we see that bitcoin has actually performed quite well.

Bitcoin has risen by almost 264% in value compared to a year ago. Rising to $34,000 from $9,400 in just a year and despite the jaw-dropping price swings bitcoin has managed to continue on an upward trajectory.

And one thing seems to be driving this trend, 

&gt;Institutional Investors

According to [bitcoin treasuries](https://bitcointreasuries.net/), about 8.08% of the total bitcoin supply is currently held by institutions and the list is only growing. 

Top investments in bitcoin by institutions: 

* GreyScale: $22 Billion
* Microstrategy: $2.2 Billion
* Tesla: $1.5 Billion
* Square: $ 220 Million
* Bulgaria Government: $3.3 Billion
* Ukraine Government: $1.7 Billion

The past year was a transition moment for bitcoin and cryptocurrency as hedge funds and large asset managers looked for ways to protect themselves from the rising inflation and devaluing fiats and digital currencies proved to be a safe haven. 

What's interesting is that many analysts and crypto veterans agree that much of the price volatility that bitcoin saw in the past weeks was propelled by retail investors while institutions held strong, in fact, they used this opportunity to invest even more.

‚ÄúWe believe in the future of blockchain technologies, generally speaking, and we want to extend our market-leading services in rapid COVID-19 testing solutions to those who prefer to pay through Bitcoin,‚Äù noted Alan Jay Weisberg, CEO and Chairman of Progressive Care. ‚ÄúThis is an excellent alternative for post-pandemic tourists coming into our communities from abroad.

The most exciting developments in Bitcoin can barely crack 100 upvotes. The list of amazing things that barely see the light of day around here is huge: Lightning Network,Taproot/Schnorr, RGB, CoinSwap, Bitcoin Conference, the #21 Indy 500 Bitcoin car, worldwide Bitcoin charity work, MARA not signalling.. The list goes on.

The things that get attention around here make me want jump out a two story window. Every other post is about our least favorite billionaire. Claims that Bitcoin's stability is somehow connected to its price get hundreds of upvotes (like we aren't still way beyond our previous all time high). I'm ashamed to admit my most upvoted post here is a tweet from Elon back when this place wasn't yet flooded with it.

I saw a post about the M1/M2 money supply chalked full of misinformation get over 800 upvotes. No, they did not stop reporting it. No, the M2 does not contain savings deposits anymore. No, you did not do your research.

How many people here do you think have setup a full node? My guess is a tiny fraction. That means the majority of redditors are non-contributing members of the Bitcoin network. Yet they feel the need to vomit their uneducated opinions all over this place with zero hubris. I'm covered in fucking puke.

Please help this noob with the argument ‚Äú70% Bitcoin mining is done in China so it is no decentralized‚Äù. 

As far as I understand, those 70% are under four mining pools in China, but since these are mining pools, the hashing  power is spread throughout a larger number of individual miners, so it is not like the hashing power is actually centralized right? 

Since this also connected, regarding voting for changes \ updates to the protocol, these miners have an independent decision or is the mining pool that votes? If this is the case is not like 4 dudes can decide the ‚Äúcorrect way‚Äù for bitcoin right?

Lastly, the dreaded 51% attack is really hard to pull of, let alone maintain, but in case something like that happens, the ‚Äúperson‚Äù that controls &gt;51% hashing power cannot empty wallets, or ar the balances in each address are under risk?
I think they would be capable of double spending, but after losing the 51% hashing power, one of the transactions would be reversed right? What are the real damages that can be made with the 51% atack?",1622818876,9,1

ns610s,JohnnyBlack22,"When Billionaires Tweet, FREE Markets Will Move","A lot of people act like Elon's ability to move the Bitcoin market with one tweet is a bad thing. It's not. It's actually an indication that Bitcoin is still a FREE market with heavy price discovery.

There will always be influential people in the world. When those influential people say things, the sheep WILL follow. This means that almost any asset with less than, say, a $10T market cap, will move a lot on the tweets of billionaires. 

That's just how people think.

Let's contrast the Bitcoin market with the stock market, which, in its current form, is NOT a free market with price discovery. **The Fed has essentially outlawed bear markets.** Every time there's a market dip, the Fed extends lots of essentially interest free credit to big companies in order to correct the price, (via them buying their own stocks, among other things).

In trading circles, there's this idea of whether the Jerome Powell's comments resemble a ""Hawk"" or a ""Dove."" Here's what they basically refer to:

* **Hawk:** let the market drive interest rates up, allow bankruptcies, allow liquidations, allow reallocation of capital and labor
* **Dove:** force interest rates down, lots of low interest rate lending, bailouts, no liquidations, guarantee employment

Now here's the insight: ***The stock market is driven almost entirely by Jerome Powell's latest comments.*** When JPow has a press conference, if his comments aren't quite Doveish enough, the market tanks. When he clarifies later, it goes back up.

When the interest rate on the 10 year treasury note rises just a few tenths of a percentage point, the market tanks. When JPow comes in and assures us that the Fed will continue QE (or whatever they call it now) and prevent the recession, it recovers.

It's not even that JPow needs to say Hawkish things to move the market down. It's even the case that if he's simply *not dove enough,* there will be a small sell off to test the waters.

**tl;dr** \- All this is to say, what you're seeing with Elon and market movement indicates that Bitcoin is a healthy free market with real price discovery. Free markets can be manipulated for the masses, but as long as you understand it, they can never take your Bitcoin or steal it through inflation.

The alternative is the clown world stock market we live in where the entire market lives or dies on each JPow press conference, and your savings are debased as they prop the whole thing up.",1622815807,34,1

Would we not be on our way to a never ending supercycle?

For clarification purposes: No, I don't believe that the recent weeks can be described as a bear market, I'd rather consider them as a bearish trend in a bull market. Of course, I might be completely wrong. Even if my supercycle theory is correct, there will always be days/weeks/months where the market will drop, that's just how it goes.

[Photo by Vadim Artyukhin](https://preview.redd.it/gapba5fo19371.jpg?width=6000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9de560bc7be417a303301c69b1264e37b2bafa1c)

## Deposit

Many centralized cryptocurrency exchanges have adopted the principle of working from banks. They attract users to deposit their funds on the platforms. The exchange benefits from increased liquidity. Some platforms allow you to open deposits with a fixed or floating interest rate. Deposit holders receive a small portion of the cryptocurrency‚Äôs income as compensation. For example, on Binance you can open a deposit in Tether for 90 days at 6% per annum.

The yield of fixed-rate deposits is easy to calculate: the longer the term, the higher the yield. Profitability of deposits with floating rate is difficult to predict, since the interest rate regularly changes based on the situation on the stock exchange.

The owner of the deposit takes the risk, providing his funds to the exchange. In fact, the investor stops owning the digital coins, since they will be stored on a wallet of the exchange, which can be accessed by intruders.

## Loans

Placing cryptocurrency at interest is not only possible on exchanges. Many cryptocurrency services allow cryptocurrency owners to lend their digital coins to other users for interest. There are two types of such platforms: decentralized, including Maker, Compound, and Aave, and centralized, such as Nexo and Crypto.com.

Decentralized venues usually have lower returns. They are more secure because they don‚Äôt store user funds. Interest rates on cryptocurrency loans are usually not fixed, but vary depending on the amount of digital coins on the lending platform. At the time of publication of this article on the decentralized platform Aave, the return on loans issued in Tether is 11% per annum and in DAI is 12% per annum.  


The lender‚Äôs risk is that when using decentralized platforms, there is a chance of encountering unscrupulous borrowers. In the case of centralized exchanges there is a risk of losing funds due to hacker attacks on the wallets of platforms.

## Stacking

Stacking is a method of passive earning in which users store coins on the Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm and ensure that the blockchain works. This entitles them to receive rewards.

To start the stacking process, you can give your cryptocurrency to node operators ‚Äî validators (easier way) or start your own node. The latter method is suitable for those who have sufficient technical skills and plan to invest a large amount. Owning your own node is considered to be a safer and more profitable way of stacking, compared to transferring coins to validators.

Stacking is available on many cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance. As of the publication of this article, Binance Coin‚Äôs internal token stacking yield is 8.4% p.a. and Ethereum‚Äôs stacking yield is 1.7% p.a.

When placing funds on Binance and other centralized platforms, it is worth bearing in mind that such platforms are susceptible to hacks and there is a risk of losing your money in the event of a hacker attack.",1622812930,0,1

I'm not going to ask how much Bitcoin will worth by end of the year in your opinion, instead I'm more interested in hearing your thoughts on what direction it can take.
2021 has been bullish for a while and is doing a bit worse those days but what do you feel the future of Bitcoin is?

It was a smart idea I believe, it became very popular as one of the senior in the crypto world but I also see many people investing just to make money. I feel like there's a real need for acceptance in real life use cases, so far most of the IRL things are related to getting Bitcoins but not much on spending for the average Joe.

The recent Tesla announcement (before being retracted) seemed interesting but again, using the daily exchange rate to convert fiat into a crypto currency to purchase goods feels a bit unfair as the coin itself is again evaluated against fiat.
Some underground sites or dark net things were available at some point but were pretty sketchy.. 

Can we expect a real alternative market one day where Bitcoin or any crypto would be the only assets traded, unrelated with fiat at all? I have to be honest and admit I dream about that for quite a while :) It could be an alternate market from which people would choose (being paid in crypto, pay in crypto...) depending on their portfolio performance !

[ Bitcoin could be unit of account by 2031 ](https://preview.redd.it/bbn4mim97d371.jpg?width=717&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8d304166a7c9e11dd02f0250eb09408375ed48f)

speaking on a panel, The Bitcoin Standard author Saifedean Ammous, Unchained Capital head of business development Parker Lewis and Kraken growth lead Dan Held all gave their deadlines for when Bitcoin will effectively take over global finance.

""I'd say a decade,"" Lewis began.

""I think that based on how Bitcoin has been adopted historically and based on the trillions of dollars that the Fed is going to have to print in the coming months to years, that it would potentially be conservative to say that Bitcoin's a unit of account in 10 years.""

That would involve the Bitcoin network onboarding billions of new users by 2031, but as the panel noted, the rate of adoption since 2011 has already produced hundreds of millions of Bitcoiners.

""I'm going to be a little more conservative than Parker and say maybe 15 years to 16 years ‚Äî you know, four more halving cycles,"" Ammous continued.

His perspective is similar to that of PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow Bitcoin price models, who previously estimated that after several halving cycles, it will become impossible to measure Bitcoin's price in dollars. This is because as a currency with no bottom, the potential for Bitcoin to grow in U.S. dollar terms is infinite.",1622863270,19,1

Almost anything negative you could say about bitcoin is a feature, not a bug.","Ladies and gents, just wanted to let you know that I‚Äôm new to bitcoin. I bought in February. One of the reasons why I‚Äôve taken the deep dive down this rabbit hole is I‚Äôve seen more principles in bitcoin and in this community than most of the subs I‚Äôve visited. I try going to the cryptocurrency sub and all I see are ppl trying to shill the next coin or talk about the next ‚Äúadvancement‚Äù in blockchain tech. Talking about things that hardly matter in the short term. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there are plenty of people obsessing about price here who don‚Äôt understand the asset they hold, but this is no longer a concern when you realize we are buying what is potentially the future world reserve currency.

  I see that some devs come along every few years thinking they have a better proposition for cryptocurrency and some will blindly pile in without understanding what makes bitcoin irreplaceable.  Hard money. Absolute scarcity with a monetary policy that has never and will never change on the whims of a central organization. Decentralization, immutability, and proven security. An unknown creator who stepped back from the project and passed the torch. And a strong community building innovative solutions such as transaction scalability and defi on top of the base layer protocol. And seeing the energy consumption as a strength that can help propel bitcoin adoption to fund renewable energy projects that otherwise would not have been built‚Ä¶ This will change the world. This is a movement that has reached critical mass.

Some criticize this sub as extremist or like a religion. But I see that as a feature, not a bug. We‚Äôll need to be true believers to spread the word and stay strong during inevitable challenges ahead.

Abstract:


Bitcoin users can offer fees to the miners who record transactions on the Blockchain. We document high variation of Bitcoin fees, not only over time, but also within blocks. Further, the blockchain rarely runs at capacity, even though there appears to be excess demand. We argue that this is inconsistent with competitive mining, but is consistent with strategic capacity management. If agents believe that only high fee transactions are executed in a timely fashion then strategic capacity management can be used to increase fee revenue. We note that mining pools facilitate collusion, and estimate that they have extracted least 200 million USD a year in excess fees by making processing artificially capacity scarce.",1622918587,1,1

nt244x,Styx1213,"What if somebody finds your secret ""seed"" or password stash? A suggestion for additional safety for seeds and passwords","Look at all the seed words that you need to write down. Which one(s) you can define in a way that only you (and preferably a trusted person, too) can understand just by reading its definition.

Example seed sequence:

1. apple 2. machine  3. We found THIS on the beach with my brother during camping (a dildo?)

4. bold 5.dumb...

The reason that you may need a second person (who can decipher) is that, you may die and your loved ones can't recover the coins or you may have amnesia due to a head injury. (Oh, interesting! I have a brother! but what are these 24 funny words for?)

The best part is that even if somebody finds your seed words, they can't steal your coins or login to your accounts (at least not immediately). If you are #4 and #5 seed words above, you can write definitions only you can decipher (e.g.: that THING I saw in my dream just after my 18th birthday!)

You can use a similar approach for generating strong and safe passwords for exchanges/wallets/mails, too. I call it MAP (Memory Associated Password). Map a few words/numbers related to an old memory to make your safe password (The chain length depends on you. Certainly, longer the better)

Example:  My father gave me THIS when I was 6 &amp; I gave it to THIS PERSON for a week &amp; That person was my RELATIONSHIP &amp; That person gave me NUMBER items in exchange

Note to self: Replace the special characters (&amp;) with \[Shift+My lucky number\]

I used that MAP above for Binance (until now). I better not to reveal it anyway, but it looked something like: 

Bicycle\*Boris\*Brother\*15 

Assume that my favorite number is 8 (the \* character) and my brother gave me 15 trading cards in exchange of riding my bike.

Such a memory-mapped password will be easier to remember, very difficult to crack and most importantly, much safer to store. 

Just watch your head while getting in and out the Lambo!",1622917768,35,1

nt22hx,potatocook123,"Bitcoin should be treated as serious assets. Therefore, I‚Äôm suing Robinhood.","### TL;DR

Robinhood arbitrarily sold all of my Bitcoin against my will. I‚Äôm looking for legal ramifications. 

### Full Story

I used Robinhood for both stock and crypto trading. From the beginning, **I was aware that Robinhood Brokerage account (operated by Robinhood Financial LLC) and Robinhood Crypto account (operated by Robinhood Crypto LLC) are separate accounts**. Last month I requested a full ACAT transfer from my Robinhood brokerage account to another brokerage. I know crypto can‚Äôt be transferred so I intended to use Robinhood to store my cryptos for now until they support crypto transfer. 

Two days later, I got an email from Robinhood saying that they **will force liquidate my Bitcoins after my ACAT transfer is complete**, and both my Robinhood brokerage and Robinhood crypto accounts will be closed. I immediately contacted Robinhood support and **stated in writing that I do not want to sell any of my Bitcoins and I do NOT authorize Robinhood to force liquidate my Bitcoin**. A day later, Robinhood support replied and **agreed to hold my Bitcoins for now** and escalated this to the management. I appreciated her help and have offered to provide my Bitcoin address so they can transfer my Bitcoin to me if they really want to close my account. 

I did not hear back from Robinhood support ever again on the resolution for two weeks. During this time, the stock transfer is complete, my Robinhood account was deactivated and I was not able to perform any operations. Two weeks later, on this Friday morning, I received an email stating that all of my crypto positions were force liquidated. **I did not receive any communication from Robinhood on why they made this decision and what changed.** 

Here is what I think is wrong with this situation:

* Robinhood brokerage account and crypto account are separate. In their crypto disclosures, they stated that in case of full ACAT transfer from Robinhood brokerage account, Robinhood has the option to either reject this transfer or accept and liquidate the crypto account. However, I have explicitly communicated that I do not authorize them to sell my Bitcoin, and the liquidation happens two weeks after the transfer. **Robinhood‚Äôs decision is not only against my will, but also arbitrary:** 
   * It is not an action required by any regulations; 
   * It is not a definitive action outlined in their user agreement.
   * there was no communication on why they needed to sell it. 
   * If we allow this from Robinhood, then any crypto exchanges, custodian services will be able to do the same.
* Again, on their crypto account user agreement, they stated that in case of account closure, they can ask for crypto addresses to transfer the crypto assets over. I wasn‚Äôt given this option. **They failed to fulfill their own user agreement.** 
* From the [SEC guidelines](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsacctxferhtm.html): ‚Äú *Your old firm is required to transfer whatever securities or assets it can through ACATS and ask you what you want to do with the others. You generally have two choices: either sell the non-transferable security and transfer the cash, or leave the security with your old firm. Sometimes, you may be able to take possession of the security itself.*‚Äù This, to me, **looks like a violation of the guidelines.** 
* Most importantly, they have sold my crypto assets against my will. 

### Why am I doing this?

I‚Äôm a firm believer in Bitcoin. Admittedly, I suffered a financial loss from this action -- most of the Bitcoin were held for only 20 days away from 1 year. I‚Äôve been DCA since 2018. I‚Äôm in it for the long haul and I have never sold a single satoshi. **Today, I feel my dream is shattered** \-- there will be a few days for Robinhood cash to settle, then it will be (force) transferred to my other brokerage, then from there it will again take a few days to be available to withdraw to Coinbase. I do not know what Bitcoin price will be after 2 weeks. Even if the price is unchanged, I will need to leave half of the cash out for tax (I live in a high tax state). In the best case, my bitcoin positions will be cut in half. 

But what‚Äôs really bothering me, is that I believe **Bitcoin should be respected as a serious asset.** Robinhood was the first stock broker that offered crypto trading in 2018, yet not only do they not respect their users, **they do not treat Bitcoin as a serious asset**. Think of it this way: **would a real estate agent ever force selling his/her client‚Äôs house? Would a stock broker ever be allowed to force liquidate non-leveraged accounts?** **Would a bank be allowed to make unauthorized purchases without client‚Äôs permission?** Why should Robinhood be allowed to force selling my Bitcoin? If I do not take actions, then in the future, any crypto exchanges, crypto brokers and crypto custodian services would be allowed to sell their client‚Äôs crypto assets at will. 

I just began to reach out to local lawyers on this matter. I‚Äôm writing on this sub to tell people: **please don‚Äôt use Robinhood for crypto**. **Robinhood needs to be held accountable for their actions. I‚Äôm also looking for pro-bitcoin lawyers who are familiar with brokerage laws.** Please do not hesitate to reach out if that is you. I believe the outcome of this case will establish what Bitcoin is: **is it a ponzi scheme that any brokerages can liquidate arbitrarily without permission from their clients, or it is a serious asset that should be respected?** 

I will fight for myself.

I will fight for Bitcoin.",1622917638,37,1

**Bitcoin, the protocol, is decentralized.** No protocol change can be made to Bitcoin without overwhelming community support and anyone can submit a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Protocol). Yes, you can do it right now.

Then there are various checks and balances to ensure that the process to determine whether the protocol change is adopted or not does not go against the wishes of the community (full nodes). The community can NEVER be forced into accepting an undesirable protocol change. This is only true for Bitcoin.

**Bitcoin, the network, is decentralized.** Bitcoin is not governed or ruled by miners. Miners simply find blocks. All full nodes validate transactions based on consensus rules, hard-rejecting blocks and transactions which break these software rules. Software rules with no rulers.

As long you run a full node, miners have absolutely no power over you. There are currently over 10000 full Bitcoin nodes across more than 98 countries and a similar number of nodes on the Lightning network. Don't trust, verify. Run a full Bitcoin node. Run a Lightning node.

**Bitcoin's price is not decentralized.** Why? Because it would seem that most humans are sheep-minded slaves to clout-chasing government-subsidized charity project billionaires.

I don‚Äôt have faith in archeologists. I understand that old translations and advanced forensic techniques reveal true things about the past. Ancient humans possessed our same biological drive to act in pursuit of their values, and those values can be determined by what our ancestors made, what they traded for, and what they used as currency. The adoption of agricultural societies allowed for generational stored value, and the constant need to protect stored value created an arms race for which tribe could become the largest and most powerful. 

I don‚Äôt have faith in historians. I understand that empires were formed when one tribe was better organized and more numerous than their rivals. Humans evolved in the context of groups under 150 people though, and could not rely on a genetic adaptation to coordinate into civilizations. Currency was an invention as fundamental as language for allowing individuals to communicate and and cooperate in larger groups to satisfy common goals. We can induce the ubiquitous presence of gold and silver correlating with larger empires and better organization, and use that knowledge to deduce the unique properties of sound money which gold and silver best satisfy: durability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability. 

I don‚Äôt have faith in economics. I understand how division of labor, free markets, and the protection of private property create the conditions which allow maximum human freedom and organization, building an empire to outcompete any totalitarian state. I understand that there are no contradictions in reality, and that the insights in one domain must be integrated with those of another, so that truth can be found where they meet. And every truth I know about the world converges on Bitcoin. 

I don‚Äôt have faith in Bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt need my faith any more than gold had to be worshipped to retain its properties as a monetary metal. Instead I have conviction in the inevitability of natural selection, the efficacy of reason, the aspiration of freedom, and myself for recognizing truth when I see it. 

A cult demands faith.

nsydtp,Bryan_Evans,When will Elon Musk's influence on Bitcoin end?,"

Even if the billionaire doesn't give up his new toy willingly, it may soon slip through his fingers anyway.

Elon Musk‚Äôs tendency to sway the crypto space with devil-may-care tweets was on display again on Friday, as numerous coins lost between 10‚Äì18% in the wake of Musk‚Äôs latest Bitcoin (BTC) meme.
The Tesla CEO‚Äôs¬†tweet¬†which showed a Bitcoin sign next to a broken heart emoji could have been interpreted as fairly cryptic, but within minutes the crypto market responded by plunging into a sea of red, as close to $100 billion departed the global market cap.
Industry executives, while concerned with the influence Musk exerts on the crypto space, are now growing hopeful that Bitcoin can escape his gravitational pull. Friday‚Äôs sell-off was actually an example of this, said the chief operating officer of payment network Mercuryo, Greg Waisman, who pointed out that the latest drop wasn‚Äôt quite as violent as others had been in the past.
‚ÄúTo a large extent, Bitcoin investors are learning to ignore tweets from Elon Musk and this was made evident as the price drop was not as huge as we have seen before. Bitcoin investors strive to maintain a united front by limiting how they panic sell. This is a good start for Bitcoin,‚Äù said Waisman.
Waisman said traders were slowly accumulating the industry knowledge that will eventually make Musk‚Äôs tweets irrelevant, adding that factors like jurisdictional regulations would¬†become a more accurate driver¬†of markets in the future.
‚ÄúWe are getting to the point where crypto stakeholders will react only based on relevant fundamentals. The cryptocurrency industry is growing towards maturity, and to a large extent, knowledge accumulation is taking the center stage,‚Äù said Waisman.
‚ÄúAs market stakeholders get additional knowledge, they will learn to base their decisions on the influences that matter most, like regional regulations,‚Äù he added.
Nick Spanos, co-founder of ZAP Protocol, agreed that previous tweets from Elon Musk had proven¬†more destructive¬†to Bitcoin than the one posted on Friday. Spanos said this was a sign that traders were beginning to ignore Musk‚Äôs influence.
‚ÄúAfter today‚Äôs tweet of Elon Musk which has pushed Bitcoin price down by roughly 5%, there is some sort of resistance from the coin. But despite its drop Bitcoin is comfortably trading above the critical price level of $36,000,‚Äù said Spanos.
‚ÄúFrom previous trends, the cryptocurrency usually sees steeper plunges but the current 6.83% is a sign that the market is proving to be unmindful of the billionaire‚Äôs influence,‚Äù he added.
Konstantin Anissimov, executive director at CEX.IO, shared similar sentiments, noting that the entire crypto market couldn‚Äôt bow to mere individuals like Musk for much longer and that global regulatory matters would soon take center stage.
‚ÄúI feel at some point the crypto market will grow independent of influence from influential people like Elon irrespective of their large follower base on Twitter and only bow to influence from regulators and happenings in the global and international market,‚Äù said Anissimov.",1622907405,16,1

nt4zst,manojiii,Is there a bigger reason behind Elon's tweet?,"I think elon is not hating Bitcoin. But i think he is doing this on purpose, whether the purpose would be tweeting and dumping what he is holding and make it look like the coin is dumping because of his tweet. If he dumps and coin is going down, everyone will think a whale is dumping. But in this case everyone will think the whole community is selling because of a tweet. So that no one will speculate him. I also think rather than dumping a whole amound, he's dumping what he's holding little by little with his tweets and timed it once after market recovers.

The other reason would be, he doesn't want the market to move with his tweets. So he's posting a lot and eventually if he does that too often, people will start to ignore his view. By doing that he can have his fun without being blamed for manipulating the market.

And the last reason why i think he's doing this is because of government. Crypto is all about decentralization. And if one man can move the market with his tweet and has a control over the market. The core value of crypto will be questioned and people would think it's not decentralized as it claims to be. So government can take this opportunity and point this out when asked why crpto is bad. By this way, he also can gain support from top people who hate crypto. And yes, he is only pointing hate towards Bitcoin and supports other coins. But he knows very well every other coin in the market moves with Bitcoin. So if you defeat the leader, it's easy to defeat everyone who follows the leader.

Anyway, there's no supporting source for what i wrote, but i think there is bigger reason behind why he is doing all this tweeting thing.",1622926068,3,1

nt4d12,Chicks_Hate_Me_Too,Protect Yourselves!!!,"Here's some suggestions on how to try and protect yourselves from scammers and shady companies....

&amp;#x200B;

**LOCK UP YOUR CREDIT**

If you are NOT going to be applying for a loan in the near future, you should go to the 3 credit bureaus and LOCK your credit up. That way no one can apply for credit in your name. I did this.

I actually got denied a loan because I forgot to unlock my credit BEFORE applying for a loan(HAHA!!!). So, it does work. You just need to unlock them BEFORE you apply for a car, house or other credit.

Here are the links to the three Credit Bureaus.

[https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/](https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/)

[https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html](https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html)

[https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze)

Just be SURE to copy and securely save your username, password and answers to any questions you answer, or you may be locked out yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

**CHECK ALL CREDIT REPORTS**

You should get your free, yearly copy of all 3 credit reports. Just to be sure nothing weird is on them.

If there is something weird on them, you can dispute it and it will usually be removed if the other party doesn't reply in 30 days, or if it's just an error.

[https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/free-credit-reports/](https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/free-credit-reports/)

[https://www.experian.com/consumer-products/free-credit-report.html](https://www.experian.com/consumer-products/free-credit-report.html)

[https://www.transunion.com/get-credit-report](https://www.transunion.com/get-credit-report)

&amp;#x200B;

**OPT-OUT OF MAILING**

While dealing with credit bureau's, it may be good to stop pre-screen mailings as well.....

[https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t)

&amp;#x200B;

**DO NOT CALL LIST**

ALSO, maybe sign up for the DO NOT CALL List. Not that the deviants pay attention to it, but it can help reduce some spam calls to your phones.

[https://www.donotcall.gov/](https://www.donotcall.gov/)

&amp;#x200B;

**DIRECT MARKETING MAILING**

If you hate regular junk mail, you can sign up to the DMA (Direct Marketing Association) to be removed from junk mail. It cleared up about 90% of mine. It might be a really small fee ($2.00 for 10 years), mainly to prove you are you. But it IS legit.

Some companies ignore this, like Red Plum (weekly paper fliers) and Miracle Ear, which I had to call and BLAST. They FINALLY removed me after my personal complaints. Others that ignore it (Like GMC/CHEVY), not much you can do about...

[https://www.dmachoice.org/register.php](https://www.dmachoice.org/register.php)

&amp;#x200B;

**SCREENSHOT YOUR TRANSACTIONS**

Whenever you do a transaction online, whether it be buying or selling, you REALLY should take a Screenshot of whatever you did. Don't depend on the other end of the transaction sending you a copy.

On Windows;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Press the PrintScreen button.
2. Open Word or Wordpad or whatever app you find you can paste to.
3. Click in a blank page and press CTL-V or RIGHT-CLICK and select Paste.
4. Save it.

\~OR\~

Open an app like ""Snip and Sketch"" or ""Snipping tool"" and grab the section you want and save it.

&amp;#x200B;

**STAY SAFE!!!**

nubgob,MGTOW_and_Bitcoin,The future belongs to bitcoin and CBDCs that are managed the best.,"The only use case that I can identify for a shitcoin is an alternate means of acquiring more Bitcoin for miners and the top 10% of Smart traders. Because they're going to use the shitcoins to pay for their mining operations and or take Bitcoins from idiot speculators. ( in fact it's speculators that keep getting in their own way, but I don't care about that group let them fall on their own swords)

Payments for goods and services will likely never settle in Bitcoin because it will be volatile to the upside for years to come. The market may actually adopt a stable coin attached to a wide basket of goods and a provable Bitcoin Reserve.

The medium of Exchange will likely be handled by a competent Nation and where that does not exist it will be handled by a stablecoin.... all of these things will be centralized as they should be because no one wants to make a mistake on a payment or not have their money returned if a vendor fails to produce the good or service basically I still want someone I can call if something goes wrong with a transaction. So it's my opinion that Bitcoin will actually help do u.s. dollar remain the unit of account and medium of exchange for the world.

Outside of that all of the smart contracts, NFTs and defi projects they will actually need a stable secure decentralized network and so it's all about Bitcoin.",1623069363,4,1
nub1fu,deron666,Utopia P2P‚Äôs Crypton: Privacy and Staking Rewards in One Cryptocurrency,"In today‚Äôs hyper-connected world, privacy ‚Äì or the lack thereof ‚Äì is now more important an issue than ever before. Your personal data is a valuable commodity to advertisers and those who may wish to scrutinize (and censor) you. One of the most effective ways to track you online is by following the transactions you make ‚Äì and the digital trails your transactions leave behind.


The 1984 Group created [Utopia](https://u.is/en/) as a Peer-to-Peer ecosystem to protect your identity and freedoms online. And at the heart of that network is the private, digital currency, [Crypton (CRP)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/utopia/).


**WHAT EXACTLY IS CRYPTON, AND WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT?**


Crypton settles permanently in less than 3 seconds, enables microtransactions and automated payments through integrated APIs. All transactions are not only fast but also untraceable and irreversible.


Crypton was fairly launched, as an integral part of the Utopia P2P ecosystem, on November 18, 2019 without an ICO, private investors or team allocation.  It is based on blockchain technology and is designed to provide users with complete anonymity and freedom.


To put it simply, it is the optimal digital currency for those who wish to conduct fast and 100% confidential financial transactions.


**WHAT MAKES CRYPTON DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES?**


A flood of different cryptocurrencies is currently on the market, with more released all the time. Some are surrounded by a great deal of attention and fanfare. For a cryptocurrency to be adopted (and therefore retain its value), however, it has to offer more than just hype. It needs defining characteristics to set itself apart from the competition.


The two key features that make Crypton stand out from other cryptocurrencies are its sophisticated form of encryption and transactions that are entirely private by default.


As mentioned earlier, Crypton is part of the Utopia ecosystem; a system whose aim is to guarantee complete protection of your privacy. Just like Bitcoin, Crypton is not controlled by a single entity. It is fully decentralized and runs independent of any authority; be it a major company, institution, central bank, or even government. Because there is no central control or server, Crypton, and indeed the entire Utopia network, is less susceptible to attack or price manipulation in currency markets. 


Many other cryptocurrencies are not as private as their proponents would like you to believe.  Some carry metadata and can be forked into new currencies, lowering the value of the original chain. Situations like this compromise your privacy while also making the original currency more vulnerable to attack.


However, the cutting-edge technology developed by the 1984 Group for Utopia has ensured that Crypton cannot be forked or exploited in any way. What is more, not even the creators of the Utopia ecosystem can alter its algorithms ‚Äì and that includes those for Crypton.  


Encryption features are provided in the u-wallet by default. All your assets are kept in an encrypted container protected by multilevel cryptographic methods.  Your currency will be protected from any hacker, regardless of the computing power at their disposal.


Transactions on the Crypton network are just as secure as storage.  Your transaction is encrypted, and a cryptographic signature links the transfer of your transaction to the blockchain.  Nobody can link your transactions to your IP address. In other words, no one can ever find out who paid what to whom when using Crypton.


**THE FUTURE OF CRYPTON**


Because Crypton is such a young currency, it is hard to compare it with other cryptocurrencies. However, it seems that Crypton will only go from strength to strength. Several crypto exchanges want to host Crypton for free (which tells us something about the demand for the currency).  


Because Crypton is the exclusive digital currency of the revolutionary Utopia P2P ecosystem, demand for it will only increase as adoption of the ecosystem continues to rise. There is a great deal of interest for the currency online which can be confirmed by performing a search for ‚ÄúWhat is Crypton?‚Äù on Google and examining the results for oneself.


Could it be that Crypton will be the next Bitcoin? Will it make its early adopters wealthy in the same way that the biggest cryptocurrencies have? There is only one way to find out, and we invite you to join us in anticipation of the inevitable.",1623068293,0,2

1. **Tracker:** A watchlist to track stocks and automatically pull financial ratios and data.
2. **Fundamental Analysis:** A way to automatically pull financial statement data, ratios and metrics for analysis.

Everything is **automated**, the only things you have to change are the **tickers** and **data points** you want to pull.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Open it, go to File and click Make a Copy**
2. **Follow all of the instructions on the ""Guide"" tab**

**Use the sheet in this way:**

1. Add new tickers to column A of staticData
2. Sort column A of staticData by A-Z each time you add a new ticker
3. Add the ticker you want to analyze to A1 of fundamentalAnalysis in UPPERCASE

It currently sits at a -x29* of this...
With a total supply of 21million... ( not including what is yet to be mined or what is lost, conservative estimates are around 15-17 million)
And a current population of 7.674 billion...
The current equal representation per person for bitcoin is 0.0027272727272727 bitcoin per person....
At todays price that means its current value per person if every single person wanted their ""share"" of bitcoin would be about $96 usd...
The current world ""Gdp"" is $80,934,771,028,340... almost 81 trillion.
If every person on earth today owned their share of bitcoin its value to be $739,200,000,000.... only 739 billion.
With a multiplication value of only 29, this will only bring the price to $21,436,800,000,000.... 21 trillion....
This puts the equal representation per person for bitcoin of 0.0027272727272727 at about $2784. Pretty good return on investment of $96 to secure your ""share"" of bitcoin in todays price. 

If i have any understanding on human emotions when it comes to greed and FOMO, this means not everyone own some bitcoin, and the price will be MUCH higher than this. These etimates put the price per bitcoin at $1023000... PER BITCOIN.

None of this takes into consideration the potential infaltion % in the future, this is at todays current market value...

It cannot really be categorized as a currency, and its value as a currency does not explain its incredible price, nor does its ability to evade banking or government oversight. Instead, it‚Äôs value is inflated entirely by Americans as a vehicle for speculation. It‚Äôs value is overinflated.

I remember back in 2010, Bitcoin was advertised as an alternative currency for a deregulated and decentralized banking system. You could buy alpaca socks with it, Overstock.com accepted Bitcoin as payment, and, of course, you could buy heroin, fake passports, guns, stolen goods, and more through Silk Road. Since then, it has become somewhat useful in restrictive countries or countries with unstable currencies. Most of its real value as a currency remains its usefulness in the black market.

The price of Bitcoin is not skyrocketing because of the black market though. It is skyrocketing because average Americans are using it as an investment vehicle. They are not spending it. Bitcoin is not a currency to the vast majority of its holders. It‚Äôs price is increasing not because it‚Äôs value or utility is increasing, but because speculation is driving the price up. The price is overinflated and it is a speculation bubble. The coin itself has a value completely detached from the price.",1623083764,85,1

I pay directly with Bitcoin via the original seller (no dealership / middleman) and the car don't work, what can I do (other than hit myself).

I think I am getting my middlemen and trust mixed up and missing something fundamental in my thinking.

Although U.S. miners have come together to form the Bitcoin Mining Council following Musk‚Äôs critique by promising more transparency on mining‚Äôs energy use, Jack Dorsey‚Äôs Square plans to lead the way in terms of substantive action. Instead of jawboning the crypto up and down, Dorsey is putting Square‚Äôs reputation on the line with an investment allocation to a sustainable mining initiative.

The payment giant revealed plans to invest $5 million in a solar-energy-based mining facility in partnership with Blockstream, which will be responsible for providing the infrastructure development know-how. The project will ultimately deliver a proof of concept that underlines how sustainable bitcoin mining can be accomplished at scale, paving the way for more widespread adoption of these techniques.

An article that appears well researched (although I lack the skills to say if the research is accurate or not).  The article is quite long and nuanced.

Short version... author believes in bitcoin as a revolutionary way to reclaim power from centralized authorities and as a store of value.   They believe that there is alot of fraud in tether issuance which is then being leveraged up broadly across the crypto market (including bitcoin).  They do not believe that bitcoin is a fraud in any way, but do believe that fraud on the usdt half of the btc/usdt trading pair is resulting in inflated prices that are unsustainable short term.",1622997626,5,1

I‚Äôm no mathematician so forgive me if this is a silly question. In the far future as mining difficulty increases would it become more energetically feasible to do a reverse hash function for solving blocks? 

To my understanding, generating an input from a SHA-256 output is exceedingly difficult, and currently it is so hard to do that it is just better to ‚Äúguess randomly‚Äù to find a output hash with a certain number of leading zeros depending on difficulty.

However, as difficulty increases do these outputs with a huge number of leading 0s become proportionally difficult to generate in a reverse direction? If not, could there be a ‚Äúthreshold difficulty‚Äù where actually doing a reverse hash function may actually be more energetically feasible?",1622993979,11,1

nqs0pr,skiippy,Thoughts on Bitcoin's energy usage and common explanations,"There's one specific aspect of how bitcoin mining is commonly explained that I wanted to share my thoughts on. The ""solving complex puzzles"" explanation of bitcoin mining. I'm not sure where the explanation originated from, but I've been watching it take hold over the years and it's never felt quite right to me. I hope this doesn't come across as a personal attack or anything, I'd like to address what I see as the shortcomings and then how I see things.

First off, I'm assuming that ""solving complex puzzles"" refers specifically to brute force hashing until you hit less than a magic number. I assume the ""complex"" part refers to using the SHA256 algorithm.

I find this analogous to rolling a d20 until you hit a 20. I don't think that can be considered a puzzle... you just roll until it happens. It's all brute force. Even if you're using a really ""complex"" die (SHA256).

I'm also not sure if this explanation provides more understanding of how bitcoin mining works, so much as sweeps it under the rug. ""Solving complex puzzles"" somewhat sounds like ""I can't explain, and you don't need to understand"" to me. I think it also leaves the impression that we're taking ""puzzle solving"" power away from things like medicine, or something else you might find useful. It sounds wasteful in general.

It also doesn't lend itself to understanding bitcoin's security properties if you want to dig in. If you're learning about bitcoin and see ""solving complex puzzles"", I'm not sure what understanding you can build on top of that.

Again, I hope my thoughts above don't come across as antagonistic. I haven't really put how I see things out there, so my own explanation may suck.

Here's how I would explain the part of bitcoin mining that ""solving complex puzzles"" refers to. Bitcoin mining works by attaching energy to your transactions. Or alternatively: associating energy with your transactions. (I'm not sure which wording I like better)

Why do I think of it as attaching energy to your transactions? Bitcoin's proof-of-work system creates the proof of energy spent, but that's not just being done on random data. That's being done specifically on the data (transactions) making up each new block. When a new block is found you now have a proof of the energy being spent by miners, and that proof is specifically associated with the transactions in the new block (and every transaction in every block before it).

I think this is a more tangible way to understand things, and then it's easier to build an explanation on top of that of where bitcoin's security comes from. And ultimately, that what's bitcoin's energy usage is going towards at the end of day: security. If you want to dig down and find out about details like SHA256 and target difficulties, I think it helps to understand that that is building up to ""attaching energy to your transactions"".

I won't go into how the attachment of energy then leads to bitcoin's higher level security properties, there's a million great explanations out there already. It all comes down to the energy, so I think ""attaching energy to your transactions"" slots nicely into all those explanations where ""solving complex puzzles"" currently is.

Also, some thoughts on bitcoin's current energy usage. Right now, the energy spent is somewhat forced by the mining subsidy. We're currently ""forced"" to pay 6.25BTC/block for security, in addition to whatever transactions fees are also paying for security. Whether that means we're currently spending too much or too little energy on security, I have no idea. And once the mining subsidy is no longer consequential, it'll be entirely in our hands how much we pay for security.

There are so many facets to a question like ""how much energy do we need to spend on bitcoin to keep it secure?"". I don't think we have the tools to answer this yet, or even the experience to know what questions to ask.

So why does bitcoin use energy? Well, I paid the miners to attach energy to my transaction in order to secure it, and so they did.

Thoughts? Do you find this a useful way to look at bitcoin mining? Hopefully I haven‚Äôt missed anything really obvious, but I wanted to put my way of looking at things out there.",1622656943,26,1

&gt;  
&gt;And President of the European Central Bank Christine Lagarde thinks it‚Äôs ‚Äú[a highly speculative asset which has conducted some funny business and some interesting and totally reprehensible money-laundering activity](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-13/lagarde-blasts-bitcoin-s-role-in-facilitating-money-laundering).‚Äù

**The Facts:**

* [Research](https://www.elliptic.co/resources/typologies-concise-guide-crypto-leaders) [shows](https://ciphertrace.com/2020-year-end-cryptocurrency-crime-and-anti-money-laundering-report/) that illicit activity accounts for less than 1 percent of transactions.
* Of that small portion, scams make up the [overwhelming majority](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-crypto-crime-report-intro-ransomware-scams-darknet-markets) of cryptocurrency related crime ‚Äî not money laundering, terrorism, trafficking, or other unlawful activities.
* From 2017 to 2020, criminal economic activity was [overwhelmingly conducted through traditional financial institutions](https://www.cryptoforinnovation.org/resources/Analysis_of_Bitcoin_in_Illicit_Finance.pdf).
* Good old-fashioned [cash](https://www.swift.com/sites/default/files/files/swift_bae_report_Follow-The%20Money.pdf) continues to be the funding of choice for criminals.
* [The UN estimates ](https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/financing/facti-interim-report.html)that \~$1.6 trillion in cash is laundered each year
* Meanwhile, [criminal activity](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-crypto-crime-report-intro-ransomware-scams-darknet-markets) in cryptocurrency actually *fell* quite dramatically, from 2.1% in 2019 to less than half a percent in 2020.
* Despite the perceived appeal of cryptocurrency for money laundering, [an estimated 99 percent of cryptocurrency transactions](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR4400/RR4418/RAND_RR4418.pdf) are performed through centralized exchanges subject to the same AML/CFT regulations as traditional banks.
* Crypto is easier to track because searchable public databases (blockchains) already exist for the majority of transactions. Even the Department of Justice [says so](https://www.justice.gov/usao/page/file/1205051/download#page=170).
* This gives law enforcement access to substantially more information than a case involving cash, including the date, time, and amount of the transaction, as well as the type of crypto used, the wallet address involved, and the unique transaction identifier (hash value).
* Once that data is recorded in the blockchain, [it cannot be altered retroactively, there is little risk of data loss, and confidentiality is maintained](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2018/02/01/can-cryptocurrencies-and-blockchain-help-fight-corruption/).
* Immediately accessible with crypto, this kind of information can take law enforcement months or even years to obtain regarding cash transactions.

This data is already paying dividends to law enforcement, who has teamed up with private analytics firms to analyze blockchain transactions [to identify individuals](https://www.justice.gov/usao/page/file/1135861/download#page=251) involved in illicit finance and pursue investigations into [the dark web](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/982821/download#page=21), [child exploitation](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/south-korean-national-and-hundreds-others-charged-worldwide-takedown-largest-darknet-child), and even [terrorist financing](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1304276/download#page=10).

**These examples illustrate that crypto is not a haven for criminal activity or illicit financial dealings, but a medium for a wide range of secure, trackable transactions.**

nqnf9t,tjgerhardt58,"I converted Burry's book recommendation ""Dying Of Money"" into a audiobook.","Did my best adjusting the voice. I found this book very informative. Hope it helps those who have trouble reading like me. GUH!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk70l2jq2WE&amp;t=5318s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk70l2jq2WE&amp;t=5318s)

The cover motif is a piece of old German money. It is a Reichsbanknote issued on August 22, 1923 for one hundred million marks. Nine years earlier, that many marks would have been about 5 percent of all the German marks in the world, worth 23 million American dollars. On the day it was issued, it was worth about twenty dollars. Three months later, it was worth only a few thousandths of an American cent. The process by which this occurs is known as inflation.

A few years before, in 1920 and 1921, Germany had enjoyed a remarkable prosperity envied by the rest of the world. Prices were steady, business was humming, everyone was working, the stock market was skyrocketing. The Germans were swimming in easy money. Within the year, they were drowning in it. Until it was all over, no one seemed to notice any connection between the earlier false boom and the later inflationary bust.

In this book, Jens O. Parsson performs the neat trick of transforming the dry economic subject of inflation into a white-knuckles kind of blood-chiller. He begins with a freewheeling account of the spectacular inflation that all but destroyed Germany in 1923, taking it apart to find out both what made it tick and what made it finally end. He goes on to look at the American inflation that was steadily gaining force after 1962. In terms clear and fascinating enough for any layman, but with technical validity enough for any economist, he applies the lessons gleaned from the German inflation to find that too much about the American inflation was the same, lacking only the inexorable further deterioration that time would bring. The book concludes by charting out all the possible future prognoses for the American inflation, none easy but some much less catastrophic than others.

Mr. Parsson brings much new light to bear on this subject. He lays on the line in tough, spare language exactly how and why the American inflation was caused, exactly who was responsible for causing it, exactly who unjustly benefited and who suffered from the inflation, exactly why the government could not permit the inflation to stop or even to cease growing worse, exactly who was going to pay the ultimate price, and exactly what would have to be done to avert the ultimate conclusion.

This book packs a wallop. It is not for the timid, and it spares no tender sensibilities. The conclusions it reaches are shocking and are bound to provoke endless dispute. If they proved to approximate even remotely the correct analysis of the American inflation, hardly any American citizen could escape being the prey of inflation and no one could afford not to know where the inflation was taking him. In the economic daily lives of everyone, nothing will be the same after this book as it was before.",1622645091,13,1

ntw6bc,andy318,Thoughts on El Salvador adopting Bitcoin,"El Savador is looking to become the [first country](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57373058) in the world to switch to Bitcoin as a currency.¬†

There is some sound logic in this move. The country's currency has been pegged to the USD for the last [20 years](https://ticotimes.net/2021/01/04/el-salvador-marks-20-years-of-dollarization-with-weak-economic-impulse)¬†and 23% of its GDP is [remittances](https://apnews.com/article/san-salvador-coronavirus-pandemic-el-salvador-1623416c0ddc7aa238911f8a422b6c8b) from abroad and around 10% of that money ends up in the hands of money transmission services.¬†

Switching to Bitcoin allows for a nearly 10% increase in GDP by simply skipping the overhead involved in the legacy money transfer system.¬†

It also switches the country to a monetary system with a predictable supply that is outside the control of any political organization.

Jack Mallers is a young kid who [enabled this](https://www.coindesk.com/strike-launches-bitcoin-lightning-payment-app-in-el-salvador-full-eu-support-is-next) in El Salvador.

His story is an interesting one. I only found out recently he was a competitive Chess player too. The first 2 minutes of this video are worth checking out to learn more about him - [Interview](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1043779351?t=435s)

This sounds like a good thing for Bitcoin. There will be increased demand for it as people move some of their money into BTC for remittance to El Salvador. From there on, that money can stay in BTC as it moves through the El Salvadoran economy.¬†

Some of those who are compelled to buy BTC for remittance might also find it useful as a means of some of their savings.¬†

Dubbed the Daymak Spiritus, the car will be the first car in history with mining hardware and cryptocurrency technology programmed into the user interface.

The car, being electric and coming equipped with solar charging capabilities, boasts it is emissions-free, both for driving and cryptocurrency mining, putting the Tesla Bitcoin objection problem to rest.

‚ÄúThe Spiritus car is for those who want more in life, and we are committed to putting our customers ahead of the curve. We envision a future where your highway tolls, your parking, and your drive-thru order will be paid directly on the fly with crypto. Your online bills and your banking can be handled through the same software platform paid in crypto. And whereas most vehicles are depreciating while they sit in your garage, the Nebula Miner will make you money while your Spiritus is parked. The potential applications are limitless,‚Äù stated Aldo Baiocchi, President of Daymak.
‚ÄúIt is not just about building LEVs. We have positioned our Daymak Avvenire series as the LEVs of tomorrow, and tomorrow‚Äôs vehicles will feature an array of technology systems seamlessly integrated for the convenience of the driver. Daymak has been a champion for disruptive technologies since its inception, and the current crypto movement is a clear indication that by the 2023 Spiritus release date, we will be in the midst of the blockchain revolution. Everyone will be paying with crypto by then, and we are building these cars with that in mind,‚Äù added Baiocchi.

‚ÄúDaymak Spiritus is more than a car.‚Äù",1623014096,11,1

Dorsey claims that if the project moves forward, the entire design and development will be open source and in collaboration with the crypto community.
Square is considering making a hardware wallet for #bitcoin. If we do it, we would build it entirely in the open, from software to hardware design, and in collaboration with the community. We want to kick off this thinking the right way: by sharing some of our guiding principles.
The Twitter thread explains that while exchanges have the best intentions for their clients, they cannot give them full control over their crypto. So bitcoin exchange balances are really not much more than IOUs when conditions are sufficiently hazardous.

Jack‚Äôs plan is to develop the idea of ‚Äúassisted custody‚Äù, where management of crypto assets would lie somewhere between the current best practice of self-custody (where the user maintains 100% control and bears 100% of the risk) and exchange/managed custody (where custody is controlled by a third party).
Jack closed by saying he and his team would be evaluating feedback and that if the project were to move forward that he would be setting up dedicated social channels for it.",1623013923,3,1

The sharp declines come on the heels of Elon Musk sending several critical tweets regarding Bitcoin energy usage and a false but widely circulated claim that China had banned financial institutions from servicing bitcoin-based businesses.

Taking a month‚Äôs view, Bitcoin dropped nearly 50% from an ATH of $64,000 on April 14 down to a low of $32,000 earlier today.

Ethereum briefly lost over 50% of its value, dropping from $4,300 on May 12 to $2,092 today before bouncing back to its current price of $2,660.
But will the carnage stop?

CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄòChartmaster‚Äô Carter Worth envisions Bitcoin hitting a $29K low:

Cornerstone Macro‚Äôs Carter Worth appeared on CNBC this week and stressed that he thinks the current price is a top support region. Worth, who is also called the ‚ÄòChartmaster‚Äô sees BTC dropping 55% from the crypto asset‚Äôs high. 

I think we‚Äôre in support‚Äî it‚Äôs fighting, but my hunch is it goes lower.

Worth is not alone in his thoughts on the new Bitcoin price range.  Delta Exchange‚Äôs CEO Pankaj Balani thinks Bitcoin will stabilize in the $35K to $38K price range.

‚ÄúDespite a sharp correction and BTC price trading in the support zone of $42,000-$44,000, we don‚Äôt think bitcoin has found a floor yet,‚Äù Balani said.

And Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote in Gland, Switzerland, said, ‚ÄúThe next important support level stands near $37,000, then the $30,000 mark. There is a chance that we see a pullback to these levels and even below, at least in the short run.‚Äù",1623013713,3,1

nqasyl,averagenoone,Cake Wallet - Sent 0.013btc To Exchange &amp; &lt; 15min It Was Stolen &amp; Sent To Unknown Wallet,"TLDR at the bottom

Reason for post: I am NOW aware after searching for my specific problem that there was a massive security flaw &amp; a few weeks ago Cake Wallet made A social media post telling people to update to the newest version. Lucky me, I don't follow Twitter and learned last night the hard way. I am now wondering, for anyone that had their btc stolen,  how long did it take the case to reach resolution and were you happy with how it was handled? 

What happened: 

To sum it up, around 6 o'clock I logged into my cake wallet to copy my btc address so I could make an exchange. Figured it's a good time for a dip buy possibly make a few dollars. After btc was confirmed in wallet &lt;10 min or so, I started the exchange process and before I could finish it, POOF my balance was zero. The balance is currently sitting in a unknown wallet unspent. 

I don't know what version I had but I just started using cake wallet this year and used it a month ago so guessing that was the last update I had. I don't keep anything in this btc wallet so it's empty unless I want to exchange. There was no warning message pop up like I've read about, I don't follow Twitter or a lot of social media, I never got an email about updating or anything and the website didn't have a warning either. 

I saw the warning on reddit yesterday and I immediately updated the app. Since the ""what's new"" just reads ""bug fixes"", Even if I knew there was an update prior to reading reddit without knowing about the security risk, ""bug fixes"" wouldn't make me think there was potential security flaw and could result in $500 disappearing in 15 minutes. I'd think something like, ""probably a force close issue"" ü§î.

If the old version I had was deactivated (not sure if that's possible?) and a message forcing me to update popped up, I'd immediately update and make a new wallet. Other apps I've used in the past have done this for non security issues, just launching a new app style etc. At the end of the day if that was possible, then nobody would be able to make new deposits unaware of a security threat and would have to immediately update saving further theft. Like in my case. Some how someone had control of my wallet that had  previously been empty for a month, and somehow KNEW I made a deposit within minutes of the deposit clearing and stole it in less than 15 minutes from point a to b. 

TLDR :
$500 of btc I had just deposited was stolen in less than 15 minutes from my cake wallet. A wallet that is empty 99% of the time and usually holds a $0 balance. No pop up warning, no nothing until I read a reddit post last night and found out what most likely was the problem.",1622599768,18,1

nqao37,Mammoth_History_7224,Can bitcoin be a better hedge against inflation in USD?,"I am conflicted with the idea that bitcoin can be a good hedge against the world's reserve currency. The volatile nature of it - rising from 58k at the beginning of May to dropping to 34k at the end of the month, can make anyone retract the statement that ""bitcoin is a deflationary asset."" 

The world we live in is filled with inflation. Regular new cars now are priced between 31k to 39k starting off. Back in 2014 I can remember a new vehicle being priced from 19k to 24k. The inflation effect has already happened, yet the wages are not getting any higher. For someone making 55k in one year, they would have to sacrifice 3/5-ths of their annual income on a new car. The rental prices have gone up as well in major cities. So how can anyone afford anything? To make ends meet, it's becoming increasingly clear that a base income can no longer pay for life's necessities. You must invest in something that will make the cost of living break even.

I was introduced to bitcoin as the poor man's bet against the odds. Now it's a rich man's game and for someone of little income to even have a chance they must invest almost all of their life's savings. Bitcoin is still an asset, but it's not a guarantee of being the best bet against inflation. Inflation is rising now but bitcoin is dropping so there doesn't seem to be an inverse relationship yet.",1622599338,13,1

In its most basic sense, Taproot can be thought of as the latest step in Bitcoin‚Äôs evolutionary path because the upgrade seeks not only to enhance the overall usability of the network by making transactions cheaper, faster and easier to deploy but also eventually allow for the deployment of smart contracts.

Furthermore, Taproot also proposes significant privacy promises ‚Äî i.e., it seeks to make all transactions look the same to everyone except the transacting parties. This potential camouflage-based framework seems as though it has been inspired by security-centric crypto offerings available in the market today, thus potentially moving Bitcoin closer to some privacy-focused coins, at least from a design standpoint.",1622557257,14,1

‚Ä¢ New signals that US regulators aim to ‚Äòrein in‚Äô the crypto market.

The Joe Biden administration is filled with distrustful bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptos regulators. This is because of new signals that US regulators aim to ‚Äòrein in‚Äô the crypto market by enabling partnerships between agencies.

Moreover, the US financial authorities gear up to regulate the crypto market actively. However, there are increasing concerns that a lack of proper oversight risks harming the investors. This may take time because the country‚Äôs regulators plan to figure out who has the power to oversee the market, according to Financial Times.

The newly appointed Acting Comptroller of the Currency, Michael Hsu, expects that the US officials will work together to set a regulatory perimeter for crypto assets. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said that bitcoin is a high-risk investment. Even more, there would be a change in methodology to crypto with the Hsu appointment at this position.

More so, another indication that the US is preparing for a new approach. It is the first meeting that happened earlier in May, which focused on crypto regulations. Moreover, it involves three major federal bank regulators. They include the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

According to Hsu, blockchain technology is likely here to stand. However, various platforms create innovative and promising payment processing tools. More so, these also risky, potentially leading to a huge shadow banking process.

Moreover, Hsu took over the OCC from Blake Paulson, who stepped into the role after the January step-down took place by Brian Brooks, a former executive of crypto exchange Coinbase and current CEO at Binance.US. In addition, Yellen, Hsu, and their stances towards crypto are not the only change in the regime that could signal to strengthen the regulatory belt around the crypto.",1622549782,39,1

What we know is that law enforcement sent a seizure warrant AGAINST THE FBI, since the FBI had the private keys to where the bitcoins ended up. Strange? See bottom link.

So either:
1. Someone working for the FBI has many Bitcoin laundering/mixing services on the darkweb who are actually working for the FBI, which the hackers were trapped into using. And then without revealing the process, said ""the FBI has the private key to the hacked bitcoins"".

2. Or a security team working for the FBI managed to hack DarkSide, using clues from the communications/negotiation between the hackers and their victims via surveillance programs... and through analysis of their decryption software etc. Then managed to hack them via some backdoor and sent the bitcoins to the FBI, which then led to the seizure warrant ""against"" the FBI.

I believe 1. is more likely, that a honeypot was setup, or 2. they got compromised somehow in a hack. But I don't believe they stupidly sent the bitcoins to a coinbase account.

In particular read points 33-35. The hacked bitcoins where in the ""SUBJECT ADDRESS"" and had not been moved since, hence in possession with the FBI who had this seizure warrant against them from law enforcement, no where does it say this is against coinbase or any other exchange:

**FORBES: ""El Salvador To Make Bitcoin Legal Tender: A Milestone In Monetary History""**


&gt; On June 5, at a conference in Miami, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced that the Central American country is in the process of adopting bitcoin as legal tender: a move that would make El Salvador the first country to deem bitcoin an official national currency. Despite El Salvador‚Äôs small size, Bukele‚Äôs effort is a major milestone in monetary policy history, one with significant ramifications for the global financial system.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄòPotentially helping billions around the world‚Äô 
&gt; At the Bitcoin 2021 conference, Bukele described his legislative proposal as a way to ‚Äúdesign a country for the future.‚Äù On Twitter, he pointed out that if 1 percent of the world‚Äôs bitcoin moved to El Salvador, it would amount to a quarter of the country‚Äôs annual economic output. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; And Bukele is not engaging in wishful thinking. Each year, Salvadoran emigrants send $6 billion home in remittances, from places like the United States. Indeed, 2.2 million people of Salvadoran ancestry live in the U.S., compared with 6.5 million in El Salvador itself. Today, Salvadoran emigr√©s‚Äô remittances must travel back through middlemen who take cuts as large as 20 percent. ‚ÄúBy using bitcoin,‚Äù tweeted Bukele, ‚Äúthe amount received by more than a million low income families will increase in the equivalent of billions of dollars every year.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; 70 percent of Salvadorans lack bank accounts, Bukele noted. Because people can transmit bitcoin to relatives and businesses on their smartphones, without the need for a bank account, the move to make Bitcoin legal tender could help achieve the ‚Äúmoral imperative‚Äù of financial inclusion, and provide ‚Äúa space where some of the leading innovators can reimagine the future of finance, potentially helping billions around the world.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; The political party Bukele founded, Nuevas Ideas, controls 56 seats out of 84 in El Salvador‚Äôs legislative assembly, the Asamblea Legislativa, making it likely that Bukele‚Äôs bitcoin initiative is enacted into law.
&gt; 
&gt; Why El Salvador is adopting Bitcoin 
&gt; El Salvador‚Äôs interest in adopting bitcoin as legal tender has other powerful economic rationales.
&gt; 
&gt; In 2001, after a long period of instability, El Salvador replaced the Salvadoran col√≥n with the U.S. dollar. Indeed, dozens of countries either peg their currencies to the value of the U.S. dollar or use the greenback outright, especially those with heavy trade or tourism relationships with the U.S., such as the nations of the Caribbean Sea, and oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
&gt; 
&gt; Overall, this system has worked fine for El Salvador, but recently things have taken a turn for the worse. In an effort to blunt the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. Federal Reserve has dramatically expanded the supply of circulating U.S. dollars, as measured by the M2 money stock, from $15.35 trillion in February 2020 to $20.26 trillion in May 2021. That‚Äôs an increase of 32 percent, unprecedented in modern peacetime U.S. history.
&gt; 
&gt; From February 2020 to May 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve has increased the circulating supply by a proportion unprecedented in peacetime history.
&gt; From February 2020 to May 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve has increased the circulating supply of U.S. dollars by a proportion unprecedented in peacetime history. FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST. LOUIS
&gt; While the Fed‚Äôs extraordinary measures succeeded in pumping more cash into the coffers of U.S. financial institutions, the stock market, and other aspects of the U.S. economy, the same was not true for Salvadorans, whose banks did not receive infusions from the Fed, but did lose purchasing power due to U.S. monetary inflation.
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, Bukele‚Äôs proposal states that ‚Äúcentral banks [like the U.S. Federal Reserve] are increasingly taking actions that may cause harm to the economic stability of El Salvador‚Ä¶in order to mitigate the negative impact of central banks, it becomes necessary to authorize the circulation of a digital currency with a supply that cannot be controlled by any central bank and is only altered in accord with objective and calculable criteria.‚Äù The supply of bitcoin is capped at 21 million units, making the digital currency immune to the types of policy changes that affect the U.S. dollar and other ‚Äúfiat‚Äù currencies.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin thought leaders are working with the Salvadoran government 
&gt; The Salvadoran marriage to Bitcoin has been two years in the making. Bitcoin entrepreneur Jack Mallers, who helped build the Lightning Network to facilitate fast, low-cost bitcoin transactions, has been working with Bukele and other Salvadorans to make bitcoin a feasible means of exchange for everyday purchases.
&gt; 
&gt; Another crypto entrepreneur, Adam Back of Blockstream, told CNBC that he ‚Äúplans to contribute technologies like Liquid,‚Äù which like Lightning can speed up bitcoin transactions, ‚Äúand satellite infrastructure to make El Salvador a model for the world.‚Äù Satellites can help rural Salvadorans connect to the internet, and thereby to the Bitcoin network, in places where land-based connectivity is poor.
&gt; 
&gt; Mallers has been working to increase Salvadoran adoption of his smartphone app Strike, a Lightning-powered analog to Venmo or Cash App. In 2019, thanks to a anonymous donation, crypto entrepreneurs founded Bitcoin Beach, as a way to pilot in El Salvador a circular Bitcoin economy in which residents and businesses transact entirely in bitcoin, without conversions to and from U.S. dollars. 
&gt; 
&gt; In a press release, Strike stated ‚Äúmaking bitcoin legal tender is a leapfrog moment that can help countries like El Salvador shift from a largely cash economy to an innovative, inclusive, and transparent digital economy where your bank account is your phone.‚Äù Mallers described the Salvadoran move as the ‚Äúshot heard ‚Äôround the world‚Äù because it would provide ‚Äúa way to protect developing economies from potential shocks of fiat currency inflation.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Could El Salvador become the world capital of the Bitcoin ecosystem? 
&gt; Alongside the potential for Salvadoran emigrants to send remittances back to their home country, the move by El Salvador to make bitcoin legal tender could also attract western and Asian crypto entrepreneurs. ‚ÄúCrypto investors and entrepreneurs will start to move to El Salvador!‚Äù tweeted Justin Sun, founder of cryptocurrency platform TRON. ‚ÄúAmazing! Packing now!‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange, tweeted a GIF of Mickey Mouse hurriedly tossing clothes into a suitcase, implicitly heading to El Salvador.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In 2019, according to the World Bank, El Salvador ranked 115th out of 186 countries in annual gross domestic product per capita on a purchasing power parity-adjusted basis, with $9,164. A handful of crypto billionaires moving to El Salvador could transform the country. 
&gt; 
&gt; Ireland was once one of the poorest countries in Europe; beginning in 1996, Ireland reduced its corporate tax rate from 40% to 12.5%, resulting in a multi-decadal economic boom as large multinationals relocated to the Emerald Isle. In 2019, Ireland‚Äôs PPP-adjusted GDP climbed to 4th in the world at $89,684, ahead of the 8th-ranked U.S. ($65,298) and even 5th-ranked Switzerland ($72,376).
&gt; 
&gt; El Salvador has more to do to replicate Ireland‚Äôs success. The Heritage Foundation ranked the country 94th out of 184 countries in its 2021 Index of Economic Freedom, dinging El Salvador‚Äôs ‚Äúuneven‚Äù protection of property rights and inconsistent rule of law, noting that ‚Äúthree of the past four presidents have been indicted for corruption.‚Äù 
&gt; 
&gt; Earlier this year, President Bukele‚Äôs allies in the Asamblea Legislativa voted to replace the five members of El Salvador‚Äôs highest court, the Constitutional Court, and also the country‚Äôs attorney general. Mary Anastasia O‚ÄôGrady, Americas columnist at the Wall Street Journal, responded by expressing concern that ‚Äúunder Mr. Bukele El Salvador may be the next Latin domino to fall to authoritarianism.‚Äù The U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, led by Samantha Powers, redirected funding from the Salvadoran government to civil society groups.
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, if El Salvador is to become a global crypto capital, entrepreneurs who move there will need to help increase confidence in the country‚Äôs legal and economic institutions.
&gt; 
&gt; If El Salvador doesn‚Äôt improve quickly, it could face competition. Other countries may follow El Salvador‚Äôs lead in adopting bitcoin as legal tender. Most Caribbean nations peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar, for example, and many, like the Cayman Islands, are already well-versed in attracting foreign capital through low tax rates and efficient financial regulation.
&gt; 
&gt; Significant implications for U.S. companies and individuals
&gt; El Salvador‚Äôs bitcoin policies will also have significant ramifications for individuals and businesses in the United States and elsewhere. 
&gt; 
&gt; Today, in the U.S., it‚Äôs difficult to use bitcoin for ordinary payments, like buying a cup of coffee. That‚Äôs because, in 2014, the Internal Revenue Service defined cryptocurrencies as ‚Äúproperty for Federal income tax purposes.‚Äù As a result, if you use bitcoin at Starbucks, and you purchased that bitcoin a few years ago when its price was lower, under IRS rules you‚Äôve triggered a taxable event for which you have to report capital gains and fill out a cumbersome form. 
&gt; 
&gt; This IRS-imposed friction makes it extremely difficult to use bitcoin for everyday payments in a legally compliant way. On the other hand, if bitcoin is legal tender in the same way that euros and British pounds are, it becomes much easier to use bitcoin for ordinary payments, because the IRS thinks differently about transactions using foreign currencies. 
&gt; 
&gt; Something similar affects large U.S. corporations and financial institutions that wish to hold bitcoin on their balance sheets. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and their parallels abroad long predate the invention of Bitcoin. Today, GAAP regards virtual currencies like bitcoin as ‚Äúindefinite-lived intangible assets.‚Äù In real-world terms, this means that if a company bought one bitcoin at $50,000, and the market price goes down to $35,000, the company must write down the $15,000 loss as an ‚Äúimpairment.‚Äù By contrast, if the price of bitcoin goes up to $60,000, the $10,000 appreciation cannot be logged as an unrealized gain. These GAAP accounting quirks basically mean that, from a cosmetic standpoint, owning bitcoin on corporate balance sheets is nothing but downside, even if in reality the value of a company‚Äôs bitcoin holdings appreciates substantially.
&gt; 
&gt; The transformation by El Salvador of bitcoin into legal tender, i.e, a foreign currency, makes the accounting treatment much more straightforward, enabling every corporation in America to hold bitcoin in the same way that it holds other forms of cash. Such a change could dramatically increase the utility of bitcoin for corporate treasury management.
&gt; 
&gt; Most importantly, El Salvador‚Äôs decision has ramifications for one of the greatest sources of skepticism for Bitcoin‚Äôs staying power: the theory that the U.S. will ban the digital currency if it ever becomes a true competitor to the U.S. dollar. ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs greatest risk is its success,‚Äù said Ray Dalio, founder of the world‚Äôs largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, at the Consensus cryptocurrency conference in May. But banning the official national currency of another country would be an unprecedented step for the U.S., one that could, on its own, undermine the greenback‚Äôs utility as the world‚Äôs premier fiat currency. 
&gt; 
&gt; El Salvador may be the smallest country in North America. But if President Bukele‚Äôs bitcoin proposal becomes law, El Salvador could become one of the most significant monetary centers in the world.",1623130453,4,1

nux1yu,s3k2p7s9m8b5,"Today's anti-FUD rant. RE: CNN's FUD ""Ban Bitcoin because it's used by criminals!""","The masses are easily manipulated with fear. As more politicians in Latin America emerge in support of Bitcoin and adoption grows, in the USA and Europe they publish negative articles on BBC, CNN, CNBC, etc.

So, despite all the new news of adoption and development, when Bitcoin is stronger than ever in its fundamentals, the price is still suppressed, but that may be only temporary, as Bitcoins are very limited in their existence and production and there is hardly anyone left with weak hands holding Bitcoin, because most have already sold them in panic.

Statistics show how the amounts of Bitcoin on exchanges are drying up, with more and more people and institutions moving them to their private wallets and fewer and fewer circulating coins left to sell. This is only going to continue to accelerate, and the amount of Bitcoins produced is cut in half every 4 years.

But more than 99% of people still don't know about it. We're in very early adoption stages still. The price is going to keep multiplying exponentially in the years to come, in cycles as it has been so far, where the up periods are very accelerated but very short and the down periods are longer, but always reaching new highs in each period.

People who are well informed about this just buy more at these lows, while the uninformed sell what they had in panic or have never bought for fear of the negative narrative the news presents about Bitcoin.

Today's negative news from CNN, is positive news flipped to negative by them: The US Department of Justice recovered the Bitcoin money that Pipeline hacks obtained recently.

That should be good news for Bitcoin, as it proves what has been said many times by those who do know about this technology: Bitcoin is a transparent global accounting record, containing all transactions in an unalterable form. 

That way, it makes it easier to catch criminals using Bitcoin for illegal things, funds can be traced. And this has been the case virtually every time criminals have used Bitcoin.

But if they had used 'cash' (dollars) like the vast majority of the world's criminals, they would not have been found. Over 90% of the world's criminal activity is financed with dollars.

And now, because of that news, certain officials are calling for a ban on Bitcoin, because it was used by those Pipeline ransomware criminals. And that's all uninformed people hear and take from the story: ""Bitcoin should be banned because it's used by criminals!"".

That's how easy it is to scare and manipulate the masses, while many institutions, banks and some governments continue to buy Bitcoin off exchanges and at cheaper prices because of such manipulation.

The bottom line is that Bitcoin cannot be banned by anyone, only its adoption rate can be decreased by using current financial institutions if they decide not to interact with Bitcoin. But it is already too late for that: most financial institutions are already involved and offering funds in Bitcoin or its derivatives or have plans to do so, likewise banks in the USA, already have government approval to handle Bitcoin and are already preparing to do so.

Likewise, many of the politicians in the highest positions of government have Bitcoin and are accumulating more, they know what it is worth and the more they can lower the price temporarily, the better for them, as they accumulate more, while the average people are kept in fear so they do not buy.

That is why everyone should stay well informed and not depend on TV news to know what is really happening.",1623129341,5,1

nv5rc8,bfeeny,Proposed method for blacklisting and recovering coins,"This pipeline hack got me thinking.  There will be several situations where things like the pipeline incident happen.  Someone hacks a business, etc.  and then demands ransom in BTC.  This is bad for BTC in many ways.

Once the BTC is paid, everyone knows which coins were paid.  They will be tracked.  There will be attempts by multiple governments to blacklist these coins.  It is bad for everyone if anyone should end up with blacklisted coin.  So what can we do?

What about through concensus, there is a way to mark/blacklist coins.  Now these coins can never be used.  If this existed, then it would discourage hackers from using BTC for ransomeware payments.  The coins could be destroyed and new coins created to take their place, to maintain the 21M cap, and those coins would be returned to the proper source, by simply backpropagating the last transactions before the blacklist.

Anyone could propose a vote for consensus.  Obviously only the more public and notable ones would get attention.  These means that any extortion / ransomeware would need to be public and transparent.   What are the negatives to this?

My concern is that countries such as the USA have already started building this blacklist.  It will be required by all US exchanges such as Coinbase.  Which means over time, through illicit activity, more and more coins will be removed........in some cases it could be $100M or even $1B or more coins, who knows. If BTC does not have a  measure like I describe, you will have every country create their own blacklists and the management of ""clean"" BTC could become very problematic.  If a change was done like I am mentioning, then ransomeware would die in its tracks when it comes to BTC.",1623163713,6,1
nv5ra6,GiantCoccyx,"""WWWD?""","What

Would

Whales 

Do?

BTC is being controlled by a small group of elite whales.  Never forget, the ruling elite told us to our faces; ""We will tame bitcoin..."" they have. 

So, I am looking at the price and thinking, of this in terms of a chess game.  The rulers know the masses are trading in BTC entirely off emotion and they are using that to their advantage.  It's tough to win any battle when fueled by, or driven by emotion.  

**So, let's turn this into a thread where we put our big boy caps on and we think... WHAT WOULD WHALES DO?**

# My Brainfart from the 3 Functioning Brain Cells I Currently Have

Here's what I see...

* It will take some more months to completely diminish demand and exhaust the masses.  Currently, instances of the word ""HODL"" on Twitter have been trending down.  
* Rising costs of EVERYTHING (food, gas, etc.) will place enormous pressure on people who bought with savings, 401k's etc, and many of them will have no choice but sell for a loss.  
* The controllers will continue to ""test"" demand to see if the masses are exhausted enough, then they will ""flash crash"" BTC as a final ""shakeout.""  
* They'll begin buying, aggressively, in itty bitty chunks, just like 2020, barely noticed.  Then, they'll pump the price up and begin selling to people who will use income tax returns, and whatever other means they have to buy next year.  There will be some BIG NEWS (EX; ""TESLA BOUGHT!!! MOON TIME!"") and greed + inflation will inspire folks to buy BTC at crazy highs (above $100k), and the cycle will repeat.

As an example any new gold produced is surplus to any tangible requirements, we don't need it, so why does it have value? You could argue the same with bitcoin, we can live without any new bitcoin being mined.

As a comparison we mine $150 billion dollars each year of gold and $2 billion dollars per year of bitcoin. To equal gold, bitcoin would need to have a price of around $2.5m. Some people say bitcoin could reach $1m per BTC (or one cent per sat), it's possible, but so is $2k/BTC. But one thing is for certain, the crazy growth days are over as there is a limit to how much currency is needed as a medium of exchange, but I'd be happy with a 500 sat BigMac if we reach the magic million

I believe BTC is treated more like an investment, so it is not insured?  

Just need to start somewhere, even if it is not ideal (like Paypal), while I get familiar with the whole crypto basics.  


Also, secondly, if the above is a not currently insured, which reputable &amp; legal US companies that that trade (buy/sell) BTC with a reasonable fee ?...1.5% to buy and another 1.5%  to sell is kind of steep, but that's maybe my interpretation of reading a company user agreement/policy.

I don't have much income so I'm starting slow but I'm hopeful that this will be a fruitful investment. Now I'm wondering a few things and I'd like the community's advice.

1) We all read the news about El Salvador but realistically it's going to take quite a while before other countries embrace Bitcoin as legal currency and not just an investment asset. Meanwhile, the exchange I signed up with offers an optional Bitcoin debit card that automatically converts the purchase value in BRL and deducts the BTC from my wallet. It doesn't really seem like a good idea to me. I'd rather hold on to my Bitcoins and pay for stuff with Reais like I've been doing up to now. What do you think?

2) How long is long enough to HODL? Are we talking months, years, decades, forever? I don't intend to become a day trader or time the market, that's a losing game. But I also wonder when it's okay to try and turn a profit, considering that inflation and other factors are likely to make my investment grow in relation to ""official"" money in a period of several months. I'm not looking to cash out completely - on the contrary, I hope to have more bitcoins at the end of the year than I currently have - but when is it okay to HODL a little less and regain some fiat currency that I can actually use?

3) Wallets and interests. My Bitcoins are currently sitting in a wallet owned by the exchange. In order to withdraw, I'd have to pay a withdrawal fee. While they sit in that wallet, my Bitcoins aren't really ""doing"" anything. If I withdrew them to a local wallet, they'd also sit idle. Which is safest? Also, I've heard of ""Bitcoin investment"" accounts that function just like savings accounts, earning a modest interest. That would also involve putting my Bitcoins out of my hands and into somebody else's but at least I'd be getting a little something back. What is generally considered to be the best way to store my BTCs out of these three? Is there another better option or another way to gain interest or dividends on my Bitcoins?

I know that with the small sum I have currently, these things probably won't make any difference for a long while, but I want to start off on the right foot, even if this is information for the future. I'm really excited to become a part of this and I thank you in advance for any and all replies. I'm also open to tips, constructive criticism and advice of any kind.

nw38mp,Cute_Sun3943,Victim of a scam and lost $20k yesterday,"Hi all

Yesterday on 8th June I was the victim of a scam/hack where I lost a total value of approx $20k at yesterday‚Äôs prices. It started off as result of my complete stupidity and then gradually got worse as I tried to correct it.

I wasn‚Äôt sure whether to even write all this up as I assume my money is gone forever, however I was persuaded by family as you never know there may be someone who can recover the money (for a cut).

It started off by me attempting to purchase some $SLD (Shield Protocol) coins. I missed the initial coin offering the day before and I was in a rush for some reason and tried to purchase by another means.

Anyway I ended up trying to buy directly from Shield by transferring 750 GBP of ETH (around 0.4 ETH) straight from my Coinbase Exchange wallet based on a tweet from the Shield Dao team. Yes I know this was stupid on so many levels it doesn‚Äôt bear describing. Anyway as soon as I sent it I realized I made a screw up. As how would they send coins to my Coinbase exchange wallet?

I then compounded the mistake by tweeting for help. One replied reporting to be from Shield Customer services. For some reason I assumed it was legit (even though someone else tweeted in response to be careful).

Anyway then the customer service guy told me to retrieve my funds I would have to send an identical amount of ETH to the following account to ‚Äúunclog‚Äù the funds.

 https://www.blockchain.com/eth/address/0xb5ea4130b750a60d5f94985efb77bf5592929e2a

Anyway I stupidly did so and then another 0.4 ETH disappeared. Then the customer service guy said don‚Äôt worry they will send me a link and to click on the link and attach my wallet details and they would transfer it straight over. Again I‚Äôm so stupid I did as I was asked, as I thought they were genuine.

This was the link they asked me to connect to

https://securewalletlink.com/

I attached my wallet to this by typing in my seed phrase, I then also stupidly attached my metamask wallet to it as well as my coinbase wallet.

I waited a few mins and suddenly my coins started to disappear. I had 1bn of SHIB and that was the first to go. I think I had around 2 dozen coins disappear from my ETH account and BSC wallet and the total value at yesterday‚Äôs prices was $20k and it‚Äôs prob worth more now as the market went up today. These were some of the transactions that went out the door

 

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x95244952a399350768f1ec3d93ef81eb5bb82c74f415b48afa34694aa5367878

So yes I‚Äôve been dumb and stupid and deserve all the abuse, but what do I do now? Shall I just leave it and forget it to try to investigate it? I don‚Äôt want to make a bad situation worse but then what have I got to lose? All of the funds have gone.

Oh and one other thing, the customer service guy sent me a taunting tweet afterwards to rub it in. I don‚Äôt think the guy had any affiliation with the official Shield team but I can‚Äôt be sure.

nyzkyv,dev-00ps,"What does this sub specifically mean by ""money printing""?","I see this phrase thrown everywhere, I'd like to know the underlying or what r/bitcoin thinks money printing really is. What charts are you using to track this metric. 

Is it the Total Assets of the Federal Reserve?
https://i.imgur.com/vFakoda.png

Isn't this a swap, where the fed buys assets on a temporary basis to provide liquidity to banks (QE). 
It seems that a lot people that are referring to money printing, are referring to QE.
Looking into QE, it doesn't seem to be helicopter money:
https://voxeu.org/article/qe-not-helicopter-money-and-yet-it-useful#:~:text=The%20main%20reason%20is%20that,held%20at%20the%20central%20bank.

Is it fiscal stimulus, infrastructure bills, etc?
You see this everywhere as well. Stimulus checks are from money printing, which makes sense. But then the new 6T infrastructure/stim bill is talked about and I see the first responses saying that this is just more money printing as well. 

How can this be money printing if these bills are funded by the tax payer? Money printing implies we just created it out of nothing. 

These imply that there is either a reversal of swaps, or debt to be payed off. When this ""balancing"" happens, there will likely be a large market crash, as well as high rates and maybe a recession. 

Just trying to learn this in simple terms and not just throw around phrases that are popular without understanding the underlying basic and true mechanics.",1623600355,32,0

nyxsqh,theguru1989,Bitcoin inflation Vs inflation,"Crypto influencers and companies use ""inflation"" incorrectly. ""Inflation"" has 2 means; the physical meaning and the economic meaning.
- The physical meaning is the increase in size of an object.
- The economic meaning is the decrease in purchasing power of a currency.

Bitcoin will become deflationary (physical term) one day, which means with time total accessible supply of bitcoin will decrease. But this is will be true only when;

```
number of lost bitcoins &gt; number of mined bitcoins
```

We can assume this to be true after 24 years perhaps when mining reward will be too low. But at the current time bitcoin is probably inflationary (physical term).

Bitcoin's inflation (economic term) is a function of demand and supply. It is not a function of its reduced mining rewards because that does not say anything about demand. Whenever the price of bitcoin vs USD drops we can safely say the bitcoin has inflated (economic term). Over a period of last 5 years yes bitcoin has been highly deflationary (economic term). It might continue to be deflationary (economic term) for the next 100 years. Which means Bitcoin might continue to rise in value against USD.

I think no one should fool people to say that Bitcoin is deflationary (economic term) just because of limited supply. Limited supply tell us nothing about the demand. Someone's shitcoin is limited in supply too but they can't surely sell it for an ever increasing price. There has to be demand. People who are not very savvy get pulled into this limited supply shilling to buy shitcoins.

Crypto influencers use the physical and economic meaning of inflation very loosely to fit their narrative. Perhaps they themselves do not know the meaning of inflation which is very dangerous for the community or they are shilling which is bad too.

I think we as a community should get this clarified by the author when this happens. The new Coinbase [article](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-inflation) is an example of confusing usage of inflation.",1623595449,30,14

nyvzw3,Imaginary-Friendship,Fighting the FUD,"First off, I‚Äôm not a Bitcoin maximalist (I am a majority-alist, though).

I have a background in computer science and finance. I know I‚Äôm not the smartest person in most rooms but I feel like I have the ability to grok stuff like cryptocurrency better than the average person (maybe). That being said, it‚Äôs taken me  4-5 years to really understand Bitcoin and I feel like I still only understand 50% of it. It‚Äôs one thing to understand the code, it‚Äôs another to understand money/currency/assets/inflation/etc.

What‚Äôs my point? I have two points:

1. It‚Äôs really sad to me to see so much FUD against Bitcoin, especially when a lot of it comes from people that are into cryptocurrency. It‚Äôs one thing to FUD Bitcoin when you are anti-cryptocurrency, but it‚Äôs extra annoying when it comes from the ‚Äúinside.‚Äù If the FUD was simply questions looking for answers then cool, we can help out. But, so many folks seem to be reading bullet points for alt-coins and then saying, ‚Äúyep, this is better than Bitcoin.‚Äù Who knows, maybe the altcoin is better, but I‚Äòd wager that most folks don‚Äôt even understand Bitcoin or how money works or has worked throughout history - therefore, how can a person say the alt is better?
2. As upset as I am about ignorance, I think impatience may do more to hurt Bitcoin than the FUD. To those of us that are pro-Bitcoin - please be patient. Use facts, don‚Äôt resort to attacks. Honey captures more flies than vinegar. We may never win back those that are dead set against Bitcoin(\*), but folks reading your comments may learn something and may be convinced to learn more if they see wisdom and confidence. If an attacker makes a good point against it, admit it. Learn more about Bitcoin and see if it holds its own (it usually does). Don‚Äôt be cultish. Get smarter everyday and help others grow, too (even if the others are huge a-holes).

Basically, I wanted to vent but also talk myself into a solution to the irritation.

nyumwx,fluffy_convict,El salvador: Can someone explain me how using BTC as a fiat curreny would even work in practice?," I have questions.

So El Salvador is introducing BTC as a second fiat currency. This is a great step forwards for the adoption of crypto currencies, but how would that work out in practice?

1 BTC currently stands at around $35'000. Google teaches me that in El Salvador, a 12 oz small bottle of Coca Cola costs $0.69.

That would make the price of 1 bottle of coke (0.69 / 35'000) 0,0019714 BTC. How would that even work in stores? Price tags of 0,0009 BTC, 0,00242 BTC and with the volatility of BTC currently, these prices would change basically overnight?

Don't get me wrong -- I'm very much in favor of ""banking the unbanked"" and protecting people in high-inflation countries against price instabilty, but I don't see how it would work in practice with a coin that has such a high value. And it will only get worse if BTC goes to the projected $100'000 - $500'000. Assuming the latter, a can of coke would cost (0.69 / 500'000) 0,00000138‚Ä¨ BTC. This doesn't seem workable.

I guess the problem with other low value crypto is their even bigger speculative character, and almost infinite supply. But at least my human brain would be able to comprehend such prices. There are a few semi-serious crypto's that currently cost around $0.31, so the same can of coke would be approx (0.69 / 0.31) 2,26 in those denominations -- this is a number my brain can understand!

Can someone explain me how BTC could be used in practice to run an economy on? I'm really very curious because it is the one thing that is holding me back to go into BTC more, and I'd love to understand.",1623584995,23,1

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: Does this somehow change ""globally"" bitcoin ""tax heavens""...? I mean currently there are ways for people to legally NOT pay taxes on their bitcoin sales - they ""just"" need to change their tax residency (for 183+ days a year) to a country that does NOT tax bitcoin sales - e.g. - Germany (after 1 year of holding), Singapur, United Arab Emirates, Slovenia, Portugal, Belarus and i think few more... 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that bitcoin is ""just"" not taxed in these countries (but is still NOT considered a legal tender in these countries)... You still need to move your tax residency to these countries (that means moving into the country for 183+ days a year and rather moving and staying there like 1 or 2 years) (which is not so easy/convenient ...

&amp;#x200B;

Does the El Salvador situation somehow change how you can legally pay NO taxes on selling your bitcoin...? Im an European BTW, not an American, so keep that in mind (USA has tougher resitrictions on these things). Can i just go to El Salvador for a ""holiday""  - few days, sell my bitcoin there for USD or EUR and fly right back to my European country with these USD or EUR (sent them via bank transfer rather) and voil√† - i dont have to pay any taxes on my sold bitcoin... Not in El Salvador, not even in my home country (because i sold them in El Salvador, wheres its just ""normal money"" - legal tender...)...

&amp;#x200B;

I got the feeling that its still NOT that easy right...? And i would still need to change my  TAX RESIDENCY to El Salvador, correct...?

&amp;#x200B;

If its still not that easy and i would still need to change my tax residency, can someone answer my why...? Its like i would go to El Salvador and in El Salvador i would change my EUR to USD and return to my home country... In this case i would NOT have to pay any taxes on the exchange of EUR to USD, correct...? So why is the situation with BTC different...? From the viewpoint of El Salvador, BTC is money, like USD or EUR etc..? So changing BTC to USD is like chaning EUR to USD...? So why would i have to pay tax in my home country for this operation...(???) Is this because BTC is still considered a TAXABLE ""good"" (or whatever) in my HOME country...? Is this the catch...?

nwkddp,Key-Succotash6604,How long term players are thinking about Bitcoin,"Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode is weighing in on the supply dynamics of Bitcoin and how long-term holders are reacting to the most recent crypto correction.

In its latest newsletter, Glassnode highlights that hundreds of thousands of BTC have moved hands in the last 30 days as the flagship cryptocurrency lost around 50% of its value from the all-time high of $64,000Over the last month, a total volume of 160,700 BTC has been spent from an illiquid state back into liquid circulation. This provides a gauge of the amount of overhead supply that has re-entered the market after being classified as illiquid by our analytics and heuristics.‚Äù

While a huge supply of BTC has entered the market, Glassnode says it represents only a small amount of the Bitcoin that was accumulated since the coronavirus-induced sell-off in March of last year.

‚ÄúWhat is important to note is that this 160,700 BTC represents just 22% of the supply that moved the other direction, from liquid to illiquid, since March 2020. This means that of the 744,000 BTC that were withdrawn to cold storage (or equivalent) over the last 14 months, 78% of them have remained unspent despite this recent volatility.‚Äù",1623321389,0,1
nwkcwz,RadManSpliff,The Bitcoin short squeeze?,"I want to lay out a potential case for a coming short squeeze in Bitcoin by using free and publicly available graphs and data from [datamish.com](https://datamish.com)

Firstly, the past few weeks have been a bloodbath for Bitcoin bulls with longs getting liquidated due to the immense amounts of FUD and downwards price pressure. But now things are seemingly turning around again as Bitcoin is up by double digit percentage over a day fueled by some historical news of Bitcoin adoption (El Salvador, Saylors' $500m bet, etc).

So are the bears taking a step back out of the market? No, they believe bitcoin is either doomed or bound to enter an even deeper bear market cycle. The short interest in Bitcoin is currently at the second highest point in the last 360 days at 28.5%.

[BTC 360 day chart from Datamish \(shorts in red, longs in green\)](https://preview.redd.it/1hl2urnjxe471.png?width=1098&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4656c98b3fc3f7e62414889fcd93d011184ac199)

The last time in this bullrun the short interest was at least this high, it peaked at 32.4% in late November. And we all know what happened next. Bitcoin over doubled from $19 000 to $40 000 in less than two and a half months, before the next minor correction to $30 000, and then on to the new highs in February, March and April.

That's not to say that all the gains we've had since November can be attributed to a short squeeze, since there has obviously been retail and institutional buying and renewed interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. But it is a fact that the shorts did get squeezed. And I believe they are about to be squeezed again.

What's different about the short pressure we are witnessing today vs November, is that a much higher percentage of those shorts are now unhedged (nearly all of them).

[BTC shorts. Unhedged in red, hedged in yellow.](https://preview.redd.it/4jamujc70f471.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1ae1d8eac60f7e4c70cb2670da780a152fd8d67)

In November, there were about 8800 unhedged shorts and 1800 hedged shorts (about 5/1 ratio).  
Today there are 18600 unhedged shorts and only 300 hedged shorts (that's 62/1 ratio!!!).  
Being unhedged, means that those short positions are not covered and need to be bought on the open market to close, which would inevitably drive up the price.

The fundamentals of Bitcoin have never been stronger  and the price seems a bargain. Add on top of that the potential of a shorts squeeze and I see this bullrun continuing past many expectations. That's why I have personally allocated a little over 10% of my net worth to Bitcoin @ $35 000.",1623321337,19,1

nwim91,UsedEstimate,Help with some Bitcoin implications/questions..,"Hi,

I have a few questions that I was hoping someone could answer for me

&amp;#x200B;

1. In El Salvadore, Iif internet (even the satellite connection) goes down.. will they have to resort to dollars or is there another way (other than opendime). I remember Saifedean Ammous talking about another possibility of bitcoin backed coinage at once stage but forget what it entailed
2. Ive been playing with the lightning network and its very very cool, but as far as I see, even after you create or connect to a channel then it must be funded first which is basically one normal and slow bitcoin transaction. Isn't it still going to have scaling issues for this reason? or are folks simply going to have to pre fund all the channels that they will need to interact with. I guess its a good thing in terms of impulse buying some new thing you never seen before (as iy would take you 30 mins to fund the channel :))
3. If governments go ""full BTC"", then how would they fund disaster scenarios e.g. covid, floods, earthquakes, famine etc. - or even social welfare ?  Most would have reserves but many would not. So would they just borrow BTC ? I assume the rates on those borrowings would be pretty high since a default means those BTC are never getting paid back ? I guess it opens up some sort of credit default market for BTC ?
4. I realize price volatility right now will probably be noise as price goes up but in the meantime whats the opinion on merchants in El Salvadore having to price things in BTC and the implications for the volatility ? i.e. dealign with a 'loss' after receiving payment in BTC only for the BTCUSD rate to drop. I am going to assume that most will accept fiat in a fixed USD price and quickly convert to BTC and just hodl. What does this mean for the USD though.. it kind of gives it a new use of life.. i.e. something used very temporarily but something not really used for long store of value perhaps nothing longer than weeks/months
5. Will a satoshi be a small enough unit as time goes forward ?

nwiish,Existing-Date-1089,Native Android support for Bitcoin Core (full node),"The next release of Bitcoin Core (version 22.0, scheduled sometime during/after the summer) will include native Android support[1].

There have been other ways to run Bitcoin Core on Android, for example with ABCore [2], but the project has been abandoned since 2019, and in general was just a wrapper for bitcoind rather than an official build for Android. With this release Bitcoin Core is officially supported for Android, and it will make further development and testing much more real!

There are however great obstacles left for actually having people run full nodes on their phones. How feasible will it really be to run this on Android devices in the near future? Size requirements are an obvious issue, the blockchain currently being 397 GB. A few of the highest top model smart phones ship with 512 GB, but this is only for a very small percentage of power users. Sure, you could run a pruned node, but there are so many benefits you will lack. There is also the issue with how intensive the initial block synchronization is on the phone's hardware, and also the data costs associated with running a background daemon as such.

What are your thoughts? If it will, how long until technology catches up and makes full nodes on Android phones a reality for the masses? What benefits and developments do you see this enabling?

I for one see one of the benefits as being able to run a real full bitcoin wallet on the go, without having to have a separate server somewhere. Obviously also it will be great for the network as a whole, for real decentralization. I think a great number of the current nodes in reality run on data centers like AWS.

I've been in this sub for almost a decade now and I can tell you that this recent influx of bad-faith commenters is new. Usually, this sub would help everyone find answers to the FUD discussed above. Noobs would ask naive questions, someone more experienced would break it down for them. Again, and again, and again. This is what this sub is for. 

Now, I understand that the OG's don't necessarily have the time to respond to all the FUD every time over and over. But I assure you, there has been never a more important time in Bitcoin's history to defend what Bitcoin stands for (openness, decentralization, censorship resistance, ...) and to explain its immutable properties to the public and the media.

This post is a warning for you to be more vigilant and to understand that most, of not *all* of these issues have been addressed and that they are *not* the problems that will break Bitcoin. 

You have to know that, either through organic growth or through outright concerted manipulation, noobs in this sub appear a lot more hostile towards Bitcoin than they've ever been. I wonder why the fuck they joined this place if all they do is to repeat the same FUD without ever listening to anyone's thoughts on it. It's just an observation.

So as the topic says I'm a bit late to the crypto party. At least in terms of really trying to get involved, investing in it, understanding it, and using it.

Anyways I'm trying to understand bitcoin a bit more. It seems to me one of the biggest issues compared with other crypto is that Bitcoin only can support up to 7 transactions per second. BUT it seems Bitcoin also has some layer 2 solutions such as the lightning network.

If I understand the Lightning Network (probably don't at all) then you open a payment channel from the main bitcoin block chain to another address. Once opened funds can move back and forth near instantaneously with all other addresses that have open payment channels into the lightning network. So now Bitcoin can move back and forth between addresses extremely fast and with no fees. Cool. So if that's a thing what does anyone need the actual Bitcoin blockchain for? Why wouldn't developing a digital currency that just uses something like the Lightning Network as a layer 1 be the way to go?

Also, trying to understand how much $USD is transacted over time. I found some resources where I can see how much in $USD equivalent is transacted on the bitcoin blockchain. However, it seems this might only account for a small amount of bitcoin being transacted as much more may be happening in Lightning and other Layer 2s if there are any. Anyone know how I can get idea of what the rough total amount of bitcoin being trasacted in $USD including within Layer 2s?

So my last question - are there any other Layer 2s right now other than Lightning? Thanks all!",1623307534,9,1

Days after ProPublica revealed that the Fed keeps printing free money for tax-dodging billionaires like the Dogfather, Elizabeth Warren and some banker guy peddled all the usual boomer FUD from 2010 yesterday - energy use, criminal activity, nobody uses it (LOL), but most of all she was mad that the central bank can't control it.

Warren wants the government to outright ban Bitcoin and the central bank to issue a ""clean"" CBDC. She basically wants the US to become a fascist state.

 Here‚Äôs a picture of John Thain‚Äôs house, former CEO of Merrill Lynch

Thain was one of the biggest recipients of TARP bailout bonus money when Warren was a TARP administrator.

Observe very carefully what's going on right now.

US politicians - El Salvador is a corrupt, crime-ridden country. Nayib Bukele is a bad man.

Privileged, govt-subsidized charity project billionaire Elon Musk - Bitcoin bad for the environment. I have no solution but watch how I can manipulate the market by promoting worthless meme coins.

Meanwhile Nayib Bukele - Adopts a currency that runs on a transparent public monetary network as legal tender within days of announcing it, bringing 100% financial inclusivity at 0% remittance cost for 7 million citizens.

nwq3rs,Pantamis,Increasing the intrinsic value of Bitcoin with your full node and MinRelayTxFee setting,"TL;DR: Bitcoin is NgU tech and you can tune the (kind of) intrinsic price limit by using a different settings for MinRelayTxFee if enough people run their full node with it. Your node, your rules. (ok it is a bit a clickbait, but read the long version if you want to understand)

What is the intrinsic value of a bitcoin ?

I guess we will not all agree on what makes bitcoins valuable. But there is one thing for which it is clear that only bitcoins can give it to you: [""the ability to embed a large number of short in-transaction messages in a globally distributed and timestamped permanent data store, namely the bitcoin blockchain""](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths#Bitcoin_has_no_intrinsic_value_.28unlike_some_other_things.29). Say otherwise, bitcoins is the only currency that allows you to pay the transaction fee so that your transaction is included in the Bitcoin blockchain (you could pay a miner in another currency directly to include a feeless transaction, but other miners won't try to include you transaction, it will cost you more money and time). This is useful to send bitcoins but also for other protocols like RGB or [opentimestamps.org](https://opentimestamps.org) (or ION, Omni, ...)

The price you will pay in bitcoin to do that depends on how many people want to do the same and how quickly you want your transaction to be confirmed, that's the fee market. It is not a coincidence that high fees currencies are also the most valuable ones. This is not a causation relationship but a correlation one: Bitcoin blockchain is the most distributed and secure public ledger so demand to include transactions is high, so fees are high and bitcoins are valuable.

There is however one thing that is not determined by the fee market: the MinRelayTxFee. It is a node parameter and it is [the minimum fee rate that a transaction must pay to be relayed by the node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/48235/what-is-the-minrelaytxfee). By default, a node will enforce a MinRelayTxFee of 1000 sats/kvBytes or 1 sat/vbytes. This means that if your transaction spend less than 1 sat for each bytes (with Segwit discount) it has, the node with a default value will not include the transaction in its mempool and will not relay it to its peers (it wil even ask to its peers to not send hime such transaction). In practice, that means that a feeless (or paying less then 1 sat/vbytes)  transaction will not be propagated in the Bitcoin network and will certainly never reach the miners. That's why it is commonly accepted that you must pay at least 1 sat/vbytes for your transaction to be confirmed.

Why are nodes doing this ? The reason is simple: [it protects a node from spam of feeless transaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/aiafv3/should_i_care_about_the_clients_minimum_relay_fee/eemo748?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). From node point of view, a transaction paying less than 1000 sats/kvBytes could be spam and doesn't deserve to be relayed. However, if a such transaction is included in a new block, every node will validate it with the block no matter the fee paid, the PoW is sufficient proof that the block is not spam (and that's the reason PoW is used at the first place).

Going back on the intrinsic value of bitcoins, this means that you must at least pay 140 sats (the lowest size of a typical transaction si 140 vbytes, that's how fee estimator display the typical transaction absolute fee) if you want to be sure that your transaction will be included in a block when the mempool will clear. This means that 140 sats is intrinsically worth having a message embedded in the Bicoin blockchain with very very low priority. Say otherwise, a transaction is considered spam if it pays less than $0,056 of miner fees at current price. [Considering that electronic notarization services charge something like $10/document](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths#Bitcoin_has_no_intrinsic_value_.28unlike_some_other_things.29) for quick notarization, you may think that bitcoin allow very very very cheap notarization (here with lowest priority so a lower price is normal but that low ?) and that it has room to grow to its intrinsic value.

However maybe you think that 5 cents is a too high limit for spam and that maybe nodes should lower it. The good news is that MinRelayTxFee is not a consensus parameter ! Some node will not relay any transaction (they are called block only), some node (but not enough) will even relay feeless transaction ! So you can start running your full node, set a lower value (I would not advice to set it to 0 but do as you wish) and if enough nodes are doing it, transaction with a fee less than 1 sat/vbytes have higher chance to reach miners and to be mined !

Now consider that having a message embedded in the Bicoin blockchain with very very low priority is still worth at least 5 cents like before. Let say your and most nodes choose to relay transaction which pay 0.1 sat/vbytes (they divided by 10 the MinRelayTxFee), the typical transaction will be relayed by your node even if it pays only 14 sats. This means that if a sufficient number of nodes do this then 14 sats are worth a service worth 5 cents: the intrinsic value of bitcoin can go to ten times higher (14 sat = 5 cent means $400 000 per bitcoin), provided the mempool clear as regurlary as before.

Obviously, if mempool never clear, this will not change anything, the fee market will set the price in bitcoins. This may happens if reducing the minimum fees indeed allow onchain usage to increase, until blocks are always full. Also intrinsic value doesn't mean much in terms of price, nothing garantee that the market will converge to it because market are unpredictable and economy is complex. However I think that with the price increasing, node operators should remember that MinelayTxFee is a limit for spam and if they continue to look at the value of bitcoins through the price in fiat, then they should rationnaly change this parameter after the price of Bitcoin increased a lot,they have full control to reflect what they think is a spam and what starts to be a tip in USD. And it may be worth for us to start a discussion with other to lower the setting (with or without changing the default value). 1 cent is maybe a worthy tip already.

If you want to change the MinRelayTxFee in Bitcoin Core, just add `minrelaytxfee=&lt;amt&gt;` in the `bitcoin.conf` file. The amont is in sat/kvBytes, so default value is `minrelaytxfee=1000` for 1 sat/vbytes. For 0.1 sat/vbytes, you must set `minrelaytxfee=100`

This is your personnal choice, your node, your rules. Just remember you have this choice and it can have big implications !",1623338119,0,3

**IT HUMANIZE BITCOIN**

First things first, Bitcoin should first be successful as a legal tender. If that happens, then what I will say next is in play.

I strongly believe that the number of nations adopting BTC as a legal tender will create a strong defensive wall against the elite Nations deciding to destroy or control it.

The more countries that will adopt, the more lives that will be relying on Bitcoin. That means any attack then on BTC is like attacking the people of these countries. 

The concept of human rights will then be floated. And this concept can be considered as the ultimate morality measure of every country. 

Are you familiar with United Nations? Part of their Preamble is this ""...  to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small.""  


If Bitcoin is proven to be a good legal tender and beneficial to country men, any FUD about it promulgated by the elite countries can then be put under a microscope and the lens will be the UN charter.   


And of course, the elite countries do not want that. It will impact their Capitalism ways.   


In short, let us all hope that more countries will adopt it as legal tender. The more adoption, the stronger will be the defensive wall.",1623333111,11,2

Each account would be able to register the address of an off-Twitter LN wallet into it, you could then donate some satoshis for any tweet you see through your own off-Twitter wallet, something like Brave do in their browser with BAT. 

It could be made in two ways: 1) a direct channel between the user and the donator or 2) with Twitter as an intermediate.

If it is a direct channel, I don't see how Twitter could verify if the transaction was successful or the one who clicked to donate didn't complete it. This would be bad for social media-wise since it would be only a wallet option without metrics.

If it has Twitter as a middle-man, the transaction could be made as donator -&gt; Twitter | Twitter -&gt; receiver. The address of the LN wallet would be private then, with Twitter being the only one to know it. The donation of satoshis through lightning would make the tweet appears for more people, something like Likes, Retweets, and Replies do, it could appear as X enlightened this tweet instead of liked/retweeted/replied, or could just make the algorithms better for the other ones. Twitter could receive a small fee so that would be profitable for them, let's say 1% and the minimum donation of 100 satoshis. 

The number that appears on the tweet could be the number of satoshis (or an unit of 100 satoshis, that is, the smallest donation possible) or the number of people who donated.

Twitter would build a major global financial integration. People who need help could easily receive financial support from the whole world with a single tweet.

nyd6g7,legionofshroomz,One of Hal Finney‚Äôs last posts on bitcointalk.org. RIP. It gives me hope. You should know him. Cypherpunks Never Die!,"Bitcoin and me ( Hal Finney )

March 19, 2013

I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.

nyc1bb,ripper2345,Recommended bitcoin wallet for a small startup,"We're a tiny startup (2 people currently) working on a non-bitcoin project. We would like to pay some of our expenses, freelancers, employees etc. in bitcoin.

What is a good wallet for this?

Requirements:

1. Super super super simple to setup &amp; use, even for people who haven't used bitcoin before. (Well, I will be doing most of the setup, and I've got plenty of bitcoin experience but zero free time ... other people without bitcoin experience will be operating it).
2. Easy seamless support for mobile &amp; desktop/browser. If I have to choose mobile or desktop/browser, I would go with browser support.
3. Some security ... but not too much. We won't have a huge amount of money there initially, comparatively speaking. A hot solution without a hardware/cold key is quite sufficient.
4. Multi-user support (Accounts, maybe Roles). Some/most transactions can be spent without a multisig / multi approval process, but rather by just one person.

Is **Bitgo** the answer?
 Is it too heavy/complicated for a 2-4 people startup?

If not Bitgo then I would go to **blockchain.com**. I know it would be touted as insecure here ... I've been using it since the website was first created, and I've never had any funds stolen (most of my funds are currently not stored there. but still - I think it's a great website).

nya9g3,economicsdesign,APY &amp; APR," 

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.",1623514476,0,1

After God gave me the Holy Spirit, I found proof that TV, movies, novels, music, video games and computer games are all sins, except Christian stuff that don‚Äôt have sins like sermons. I found out that in them there is stealing, adultery, fornication which is sex before marriage, revenge, jealousy, pride=self-pity, hypocrisy, using God's name in vain as a curse word, they are all idols (breaks 2nd Commandment) because most people can‚Äôt live without them and they love them more than God and more. Just read the 10 commandments for a list. But if you are one of God‚Äôs elects and God gives you the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit is the permanent cure to boredom but it is only given to God‚Äôs elects who suffer the most in this world since they were physically born.

[https://spreadthegospel59.wordpress.com/2013/08/26/the-short-version-of-is-gods-words-powerful-how-do-we-receive-the-holy-spirit/](https://spreadthegospel59.wordpress.com/2013/08/26/the-short-version-of-is-gods-words-powerful-how-do-we-receive-the-holy-spirit/)

Now I will be preaching about how to receive the Holy Spirit and be 100% going to Heaven.

First, it's only by the grace of God that he gives you faith in Jesus Christ in order to give up your sins. It‚Äôs only by the grace of God that he leads you to pray to him to destroy all your evil desires of watching TV. When you pray to God to destroy all your evil desires of watching TV, Satan will intervene and extremely tempt you in watching the TV. But if it's God's will and if you are one of God‚Äôs elects, you will overcome it and God will destroy all your evil desires of watching TV. After God has destroyed all your evil desires of watching TV and if you are one of God‚Äôs elects, you receive the joy of the Holy Spirit for about 40 minutes. After the joy wears off, all existence of boredom no longer exists and you no longer burn out (psychology) anymore. That is when you have received the Holy Spirit.

Then it's by the grace of God that he forgives you of your sins, as you confess and repent of your sins throughout your life which is called sanctification. But you can watch Christian stuff that don't have sins (Like sermons) because that helps you grow more mature as a Christian spiritually and for more information about this sermon, go to spreadthegospel59.wordpress.com then go to ‚ÄúIs God‚Äôs words powerful? How do we receive the Holy Spirit?‚Äù

Just so you know Jesus had to endure the punishment for God‚Äôs elects sins which is Hell-Hellfire, which is extreme love and mercy. Read the bottom of what Jesus had to endure in Hell.

Lazarus and the rich man Luke 16:19-31

Extreme Dehydration, rich man begs for a drop of water.

Luke 16:24

King James Version (KJV)

24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

A place of outer darkness Matthew 8:12

A place of no rest Revelation 14:11

A place of blackness and darkness forever Jude 13

A place where people are tormented with fire and brimstone Revelation 14:10

Extreme pain since you are in everlasting fire.

YouTube:

""David Platt - Jesus Absorbed the Wrath of God""

If Jesus didn‚Äôt die on the cross and endure Hell which is the punishment for sin, God would still be just in sending us all to Hell because we are all guilty of our sins. Remember TV, movies, video games and computer games are all sins, except Christian stuff that don‚Äôt have sins like sermons. Just read the 10 commandments for a list. But God was willing to have some mercy, which we don‚Äôt deserve because we are all guilty of our sins. At least God was willing to have at least some mercy, better than no mercy at all.

Isaiah 1:9

King James Version (KJV)

9 Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant (God‚Äôs elects), we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.

Romans 9:29

King James Version (KJV)

29 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed (God‚Äôs elects), we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.

If God didn‚Äôt chose anybody to be saved, God would still be just in sending us all to the lake of fire which we all deserve because we are all guilty of our sins. Be thankful that God was willing to have some undeserved mercy, which is better than no mercy at all.

Jesus came to save us elects out of sin and the lake of fire.",1623212679,1,1

1) You must think it has reached it's all-time peak and will never get that high ever again. This is something I seriously doubt has happened. We have seen it rise and fall and if I had to bet on it, I would say it will rise again.

2) Have you considered what the frenzy will look like when bitcoin is close to having all of them mined? Do you think the price will still be less than 33k? Do you think the price will be less than it's current peak (around 63k)?  
I have some serious reservations about the use of bitcoin, the hocus-pocus of who created it and who is really in charge of it (enlighten me), and the current conversion place value (I don't want to buy a sandwich with $0.0000000045), but if I was a betting man (and I am) I would bet that we have not seen the peak.  
P.S. No one seems to be concerned about how much electricity mobile phones use, or street lights, or iPads, or laptops, so why the big concern over digital money? How much electricity and material does it take to make dollar bills? (I'm sure I will get some enlightening posts about this also).

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine you're a newly minted billionaire and you want to protect some of your wealth from inflation and volatility, you could do this by purchasing gold right? your wealth is now secure? NO

a billion dollars worth of gold weighs 582 TONS, good luck securing that amount of gold unless you have a nation state protecting it for you, what's your next option? Well you can do what most people do, buy a piece of paper that says you own a certain amount of gold, good right?.. now you ""own"" some gold and you assets are secure? NO

First of all, you probably don't have the slightest clue where this physical gold is even located, for all you know it might not even exist at all. What if this gold is located in a country that is facing a lot civil unrest? well that country can always just re-appropriate that gold and the paper saying you own a certain amount of gold is now worthless, maybe that country doesn't like your country anymore well once again they can simply say that the gold belongs to them now. what if your own country doesn't like that you are holding gold and decides to seize it from you, while it's easy to do because you don't own any physical gold you just own a piece of worthless fucking paper.

Some sources say that the majority of physical gold is actually located in America( well you just have to trust Americas word on that because fort knox hasn't even been audited in 50 years ), for a lot of countries that are listed as having gold reserves a large percentage or even all of this gold is not even located within their own borders, To believe that this gold belongs to them they have to be fully trusting that America won't just take it from them.

Well what about bitcoin? It's fake money right, imaginary? what makes something real?

think about this,right now distributed across nearly every country on earth there are these things called nodes, there are currently over 100,000 of these nodes running right now, any one of you can host a node if you like, it doesn't use much power and 1TB of hard drive should be enough for the next decade. there is also no limit of the amount of nodes that can support the network, we could have 8 billion nodes if each person on this earth hosted a single node.

What is the purpose of these nodes? well every single one of these nodes is working together in unison and saying BITCOIN EXIST and here is who OWNS bitcoin. rather that trusting a piece of paper from one person/organization/country you are trusting the consensus of 100,000 separate entities in China/America/Japan/Zimbabwe/Madagascar/Brazil and so on.

What if some of these nodes are intentionally bad? well the Good majority of nodes can simply ignore these bad nodes and blacklist them. What if China decides they want to stop you owning bitcoin, and then they launch 2 million nodes in an attempt to do so, it doesn't matter, they can't just spend any bitcoin they please, they would need to reverse and reorganize millions/hundreds of millions of transactions to even attempt it, creating a new chain/fork that the rest of the world would simply ignore.

But what does it even mean to own a bitcoin? All it really means is that you know a number, it's a number between 1 and 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,852,837,564,279,074,904,382,605,163,141,518,161,494,336, each number within this range will have a corresponding public and private key, what's special about your number is that all these nodes I was talking about earlier all say that your number holds X amount of bitcoin and every single 10 minutes a block is mined all these nodes once again reaffirm that your number holds X amount of bitcoin.

You may ask yourself, what's stopping someone else from just using your number and saying it belongs to them? Well the thing is; you don't actually ever tell anyone what your number is, prior to making transactions on the network(all the nodes) all agreed on what ways you can represent this unique number to each other. then you would follow the agreed upon steps to convert your number into a representation of your number; everyone will know this represents a certain number within that range but you are the only one that will know what number it actually represents and you are the only one that can prove this representation of a number matches your number, this is all done through cryptography.

There are only three ways to retrieve this number from you

1. Break all the the cryptography used to hide your number(not likely for at least decades or maybe 100+ years, when the current methods of cryptography are breakable, all the nodes can simply agree on a newer stronger method to produce the representation of your number)
2. check every single number between 1 and 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,852,837,564,279,074,904,382,605,163,141,518,161,494,336, they would need to calculate how each number would be represented on the network and then compare it to yours too see if there is a match.... even with all the computing power in the world they wouldn't be able to find it before the heat death of the universe.
3. Get tricked/forced to or simply give away your number

so If you have a number/address or whatever that contains 3 bitcoins, it doesn't matter if all governments of the world ban bitcoin, it doesn't matter if the value of bitcoin is $2 or $200,000, it doesn't matter if you're completely naked living in the wilderness, as long as there is somewhere in the world that has a copy of the blockchain.. and that you did well in memorizing your number... then you do infact own 3 bitcoins.

You can put your trust a small group of people, a company or even a nation, or you can trust 100,000s of thousands of strangers across every nation where it's in the best interest of every single one of them to truthful, because if they weren't then bitcoin would have no value at all to anyone.

What other asset in all of human history would allow you to secure a billion dollars just by being able to memorize a certain number?

\--

to those that say &gt;""Gold has industrial uses. That alone makes it more 'real'.""

I know gold is very real, my argument relates to anyone's ownership of it

Purchasing an Ounce of gold and holding in ones hand is as real as memorizing a number that corresponds to n amount of bitcoin, but most people do not own gold that way.

To people that complain about bitcoins ""volatility"" know this

Bitcoin is a highly speculative asset I agree, a large amount of the value it has now is just from people speculating that it will go up. but besides those people there are a great many people that hold bitcoin and never sell it because they see it as this amazing asset they can trust the security of the ability to easily transfer and take it with them.

But if there is mass adoption of bitcoin in the future, then we won't have the volatility we are seeing today, if everyone sees it as a store of value then it will be a store a value and it will be much more difficult to move the price with a 10 trillion marketcap because there will be very few individuals or groups of people that can cause large volatility, and if they tried doing this then the rest of market will just swallow up their share of the circulating supply, and the market will become less volatile.

Most of golds value comes from it being seen as a store of value, not from its industrial use.

Gold's advantage over bitcoin is that it's easy to convince people to keep it safe, because people have already been doing it for thousands of years since people really like nice shiny rocks",1623206559,12,1

In 2017 I purchased a small amount of BTC and transferred it to a Ledger Nano which I still possess. I literally haven't attempted to access the wallet until today, when I plugged in the Ledger to my computer. The device was recognized and I was able to enter my wallet after entering my pin, however when I checked my bitcoin balance it was zero.

nviywc,MO_RAHIMI,best trading platform,"This is the best trading [platform](https://antares.trade/personal/?signup=MA403045419).
There are certainly many ways to profit in the online world, and each method has its own strategy.

 That is why one of the methods that I am going to show you today is so effective that you cannot find similar methods in the online world.

Which is how to invest your money and trading to earn more than $150 so I decided to bring you an amazing place called Antares. The site is very popular in the world and offers good service.

The site offers many different ways because it is a very big treasure to get a trading robot through the site. You can also invest your money on the site and get good money from the site.
What is [Antares](https://antares.trade/personal/?signup=MA403045419)?
Antares is a platform for investing in the digital market and companies that use the recommendation system model.
Profit from Antares depends on two ways:

First method:

  Paid After you purchase the package, some investors manipulate the invested money to make a daily profit for you, and after the package period expires, you will get the full benefit, usually three times. of the amount paid in advance. The platform feature is nothing but a team building system. Second method:

The site is network marketing if you invite people to nominate the platform you use the earnings on the platform if those people are owned by other people after you nominate you also get income from their deposits etc.
This is just an example of the site plans, you can invest in this site for $100, for 200 days you will get 5 percent return every day. This is a very good thing because the company invests and trades heavily and has good plans to distribute the funds among the investors. You can also find much less than that which is highly dependent on the larger programs. You can invest in a site of $50 for 280 days, and you have a good profit rate of $146 per day. That's cool, say just fifty bucks put it on the site and forget it, there's more software on the site.

Just choose the type of investment you want, and you can make money.
To see how much you get in 284 days or less, simply put the required amount in the $100 box and scroll down. You will find that the net amount is 298 which is a good thing, that is, you are simply waiting for your profits from the site at the end of the specified time",1623198771,0,1

nvhg5o,manelbueno,"The bitcoin money supply is not fixed, and even if it was, this isn't an good thing","Abandon the ""fixed money supply"" dogma already. I can give you three basic reasons:

1) The money supply is the money base times the money multiplier. A fixed money base doesn't imply a fixed money supply.

2) The quantity theory of money, which says that MV = PY, where M is money, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level and Y is the quantity of real goods. A fixed M doesn't imply a fixed P.

3) Deflation is worse than inflation. Deflation causes recession or hyperinflation. Bitcoin is at increased risk of deflation.

nvhdo9,steevie_2k,Using 401k to purchase Crypto,"Hello everyone. First time poster here.

The purpose of this post is to receive constructive criticism as well as important feedback regarding my current action plan.

For the longest time I've been contemplating on creating a Self Directed IRA/LLC to be able to have more control over my 401k portfolio. I'm 27 and have built a nice nest egg in my 401k throughout my career at my past employer.

For those not familiar with the topic of SDIRA (Self Directed IRA/LLC), to make a long story short it allows you to roll over your 401k account into an IRA that owns an LLC (that you can manage) without having to pay a 10% penalty for not meeting the age requirement of 59 1/2.

This type of account also give you the ability to invest in crypto/real estate/common stock/precious metals etc.

After careful consideration and research for some time now I've made up my mind and began the process.

Logically since this investment route allows me to ""drive the bus"" with my retirement money, this option is a lot riskier than following the traditional 401k route and for that reason I will only roll over 50-60% of my current balance leaving the rest to grow the traditional way.

Another thought I've come across is that one of the most important factors for investors is ""time"" and with me being 27 I figured I can afford a calculated loss if this SDIRA idea did not workout and still save for a good retirement.

As far as investing within my SDIRA I'm thinking a safe route would be to dollar cost average into crypto/stocks, another thought I came across was perhaps staking to generate passive income but I'm not very knowledgeable on the topic currently.

If you've read this far thank you, I would appreciate any feedback regarding this information.",1623193970,15,1

I sincerely doubt that they are going to just talk about outright banning cryptocurrency, rather they just want to heavily regulate all global crypto exchanges/vendors and make them report all large transactions to prevent bad actors from exchanging crypto and so they can recover illegaly obtained bitcoin.

This is bad news for criminals that want to get paid in bitcoin, but there will always be ways that they can circumvent this with most probably opting to use a privacy coins instead.

Why would they ban bitcoin when they thing they can control it and tax the fuck out of it. the worst think that could possibly come from this is some retroactive crypto tax.

This ""heavy regulation"" they've been talking about will just make institutions more comfortable investing in crypto and also increasing the likelihood of the SEC approving crypto related ETF's.",1623193208,1,1

Then i noticed that my transaction is ""in review"" (No network fee was added because it was saying that there's no network fee to transfer funds from the trading account).

I had a option to recover my account using the recovery phrase so i did that. They gave me a new ID with all my fiat balance converted to BTC. My last transaction was still ""in review"". I thought i should move the rest of my BTC balance (in trading account) to my personal wallet key. Unfortunately this transaction is also ""in review"" now.

nzgkjb,slvbtc,"Tell me what I am misunderstanding here, or is Kevin O'Leary the one misunderstanding bitcoin mining.","No energy is consumed to create or mine coins. Newly mined coins are simply the incentive and reward for using your energy to secure the immutability and integrity of the network as a whole.

Newly created coins are a byproduct of mining not the function of mining. The function of mining is to secure everyones coins from theft and double spending because proof of work prevents attackers from being able to mess with the system.

So someone who simply holds bitcoin for years is still relying on miners to secure his coins every 10 minutes by keeping the network secure and immutable. It doesn't matter if you hold coins mined from renewable energy, because every single block other unknown miners are securing your property rights in perpetuity.

Mining isn't a mechanism to produce new coins, mining is a mechanism to secure the network and protect property rights in real time and in perpetuity. New coins issued from mining are just the incentive and byproduct, not the main function.

No energy is used to mine coins, energy is used to secure the network.

If I were to hold ""green coins"" how can they be green if every 10 minutes for the rest of eternity I am relying on every other miner on earth to secure them from attack.

Am I missing something? Or is the idea of holding ""green coins"" ignorant because technically no energy was used to mine new coins, energy is used to secure the network.

Has Kevin O'Leary taken the word mining literally when it shouldn't have been? Perhaps if we had called miners ""network protectors"" instead then this debate would never have happened.",1623652474,14,9

I am getting my first ever tattoo in the name of Bitcoin, which has helped shape me to be a better person and overall has changed me and my life.  I am looking for suggestions. Still in the researching phase. The artist is Incredibly talented and I have time because I had to book him 6 months from now. 

Looking to get a medium size tattoo on the arm... at most a half sleeve. 

\-Was thinking of getting Trevor James- Bitcoin Angel- However I think he would need a huge amount of space to work with. 

\- Also was thinking of a globe that is cracked open and bitcoin logo/ circle is at the core spewing lava from different volcanos / orange fissures and cracks around the globe. 

\- I Remember on this page seeing a Giant dyson ball sun for BTC mining. It looked sick. Was thinking of getting that

\- Otherwise Thinking of genesis block but that is too easy and would prefer actual art.

The country has this week become the first to make Bitcoin legal tender after the majority of lawmakers (62 out of 84) voted to embrace the digital currency.

As Reuters reports, El Salvador relies heavily on money sent back from workers abroad, which accounts for around a fifth of the country's GDP ($6 billion). President Nayib Bukele proposed introducing Bitcoin as a legal tender in part to make sending money to the country easier, but integration with the local economy will go much further than that.

Alongside the US dollar, Bitcoin will become legal tender in law in 90 days. It will remain optional to use for payments, but the government is guaranteeing convertibility to dollars as well as allowing taxes to be paid using the cryptocurrency.

Scientifically, as well as mathematically, it may actually be more possible than not that the FBI can infect crack your 1 word seed phrase.

Let‚Äôs paint a picture, shall we?

The pentagon recently confirmed that UFOs are in fact real. These UFOs, whether alien or not are in fact able to break the sound barrier without emitting any form of sound. This is physically impossible, yet it‚Äôs being done.

Further, it has been accounted by numerous military officers that when these object were flying directly overhead, from the officers point of view, these unidentified flying objects appeared to be invisible.

If true, from a physics point of view, this would mean that these objects are actually bending/refracting particles of light around their mass resulting in the appearance of being transparent.

This means that if these claims are true, (one was by a US Navy admiral)  then these UFOs are actually generating their own gravitational field as a means of travel.

In creating their own gravity this would mean that these UFOs no longer technically exist within the realm of time and space. They would have no space when they are bending space around them to ‚Äútravel‚Äù. Travel is not the right word in this context because actually what they are doing is much closer to move you around them, than it is to moving itself around you.

Given that these things appear to be true but yet are simultaneously physically impossible it makes one wonder what else technology is capable one

This sort of technology is one million times more advanced in proportion to cracking some silly random word generator than the wooden spear is to the atomic bomb.

There is also a high likelihood that these UFOs are not in fact alien technology but rather secret technology of either Russia China or the USA. In fact, from a scientific standpoint, and according to my calculations, this is millions of times more mathematically likely to be the case.

If one of the big three was in control of this capacity of tech, comparing this to a quantum computer capable of cracking a simple type: string() === true is the equivalent of cracking a nut with a jackhammer.

1:  Is the muun wallet is Good as It seems or is there a catch that I don't see yet? I love how the balance is all in one place and you can go either BTC or lightning back and forth with the same wallet balance, I love it.

2: I think I found a way to get rid of most of the exchange fees when buying Bitcoin but like I said I would like to defer to The experts maybe I'm missing a hidden fee?   So my plan is buy Bitcoin with strike which has no fees. Then I will send from strike to Muun which I found cost between 1 and 3 cents on lightning. Then from there I can either use lightning with muun or good old BTC when needed. Also I like that I can send to my ledger using muun pretty cheaply because you can adjust the fee you pay, obviously I'm not in a hurry to get my BTC in the cold storage so it doesn't matter if it takes two or three days.

Already we are seeing stiff resistance from the international central bank authorities with countries like Turkey completely prohibiting bitcoin to China where strict regulations bar its citizens from transacting in crypto, but mining activities are still allowed.

The IMF was designed to guarantee the stability of the world's monetary systems after WWII to prevent the worldwide economic depressions in the 1930s. The IMF was supposed to prevent unilateral decision-making that could cause currency devaluation. They failed their mission in 1971 when the US moved away from the gold standard. The US dollar has experienced an 85% inflation since then. The move by the US influenced other currencies to move to a ""floating standard"" model that is the value of the currency is determined by current market forces.

Currently El Salvador is seeking a $1 billion loan from the IMF. The IMF's rhetoric has caused concern with international bankers who've raised their interest rates on El Salvador's debits.

The Prosecutor's Office of the Berezovsky District of the Perm Territory, in the course of supervising the implementation of the legislation on combating the legalization (laundering) of proceeds from crime, revealed illegal information.

It was found that information on methods of cashing Bitcoin cryptocurrency was freely available for viewing and using on certain Internet resources.

Considering that the legislation considers the exchange of virtual currencies as a potential involvement in the implementation of dubious transactions and transactions, the prosecutor sent an administrative statement of claim to the court demanding to restrict access to this information. 

The Kungursky City Court of the Perm Territory (permanent judicial presence in the village of Berezovka) satisfied the prosecutor's demands.

After the entry into force of the decision, access to this information will be blocked.

Hi,

if I'm unemployed currently and want to make some money out of my savings which I have (and other investments), does it make sense to start trading now? If yes, should I do it as P2P trading? Or on an exchange?

I do have a fairly good understanding of BTC and the use of BTC in India is quite popular. Since BTC is more popular is it better to trade BTC or some other crypto?

Any tips would be helpful especially from folks who have/had started trading as a fresher.

Also, I already have a higher level verified account on a P2P platform, in case I'm going for P2P, should I consider this platform?",1623785470,42,2

Just today, two separate podcasts under two separate genres had extended segments on Bitcoin being an environmental disaster that shows the shortsightedness of human beings and how a corrupt politician like El Salvador‚Äôs president embracing it just shows how it‚Äôs useful for criminals and ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù only. I was so sad because I love the pods and hearing their ignorance was disappointing. Then I perked up at the realization that, honestly, this is just a reflection of how early we really are. I think it‚Äôs easy for us (at least me) to believe my echo chamber of the books I read and subs I follow are reflective of a larger consensus than it actually is. Talk to you parents, grandparents, siblings, coworkers; look at mainstream media; this is more reflective of reality.

o0jvym,systematicinference,Reductio ad absurdum of shitcoins,"Imagine you take a single Bitcoin transaction output, and you look at all the transactions that are descended from it (i.e. their inputs either are it, or come from a transaction that only uses inputs that match this entire parenthetical criterion). It happens that you can:
- see how much you own of these: You can look at the UTXO set for UTXOs that you control. In this case, you just have to restrict the UTXO set to just these transactions.
- transfer them to another person: It's just a normal Bitcoin transaction, so you can easily submit a transaction to send them.
- get double-spend protection: Double-spend protection comes from the Bitcoin blockchain itself.

These are all you need for a cryptocurrency; someone could create a wallet that only shows Bitcoins descended from a single transaction, and call that their own special altcoin, and it would be usable like any coin to the users of that wallet. (This is, essentially the same as, in fiat terms, going ""these dollar bills passed through the hands of {celebrity} so they're super special and collectible and have their own, separate, value from other dollar bills."")

But the hilarious part is, that you don't need the permission of the original transaction's creator to do this, and all such wallets would differ in only the selection of transaction. This means that you can make a single wallet for this *indefinitely large family of shitcoins*, and someone can just enter a root transaction ID into the wallet to make it act as a wallet for that particular shitcoin. If they enter a transaction ID nobody's ever used for this before, they are *literally creating a new shitcoin without writing a single line of code*.",1623778478,16,3

I'd like to do my part in supporting El Salvador. I'm interested in importing El Salvadorian goods to the US for Bitcoin and I'm wondering if anyone has any opinions on how to do this as easily as possible? (Maybe others are wondering as well!)  


My thoughts are as follows:  
1) I'm a US citizen, so I believe I'll need to be keeping track of the cost basis I acquire my Bitcoin at to pay my suppliers right? Is it that simple? I mean essentially I'll be paying for goods with digital property as far as the government is concerned. I think it would then make sense just to buy Bitcoin with USD on an as needed basis.   


2) I have never used the lightning network but I imagine this will be the most sustainable way to do business with Bitcoin in El Salvador. I'll need to set up my own lightning node I think? Plenty of resources out there on this, so don't need anyone telling me how to set it up. If anyone has thoughtful input outside of setup I'm all ears.

Lets assume I invest X$ and buy bitcoins..I wait for it to reach 2 times of its original amount..and as it reaches that amount I withdraw exactly the half..and then all my investment will be for free..How much time it would be needing to get it out is a question needs to answered..There is another option to go for daily trade in a manner to extract out the exact amount invested..

This means if/when it does explode to a worldwide mainstream digital currency our day to day transactions will be in tiny fractions of a bitcoin. With that said at what point do you stop just listing zeros and switch to something like scientific notation? For instance one day I might be trading 0.000000001 BTC for a soda at the corner store. Wouldn't it would be easier to read 1x10-9 on a price tag than try to squint and count zeros? How do yall think we will be referring to bitcoin in the future when dealing with fractions of botcoin?,1623900333,40,2

o15zhv,Annewhittle,Bitcoin is my Redemption. (A long story),"My boyfriend and I broke up when we had our second baby. As a single mom, it was very hard for me to be the father and mother of my children. I live in Vancouver and when the pandemic hit, finding a decent job and at the same time taking care of my kids was never easy (but I had to). It was the start of the pandemic and most companies are downsizing so finding a job is harder during that time. I felt like all problems in the world are towards me. I have bills to pay, electricity, internet, food, milk, and all other kinds of stuff. It was just too much so one day I met with my friend Sarah because I need to borrow some cash to sustain my baby's needs. During our conversation, she introduced me to Bitcoin. She explained that she and her husband invested in bitcoin and have profited a lot from it. She gave me a decent amount of money to borrow and gave me extra and said that I have to invest it so at least I have a passive income that I can count on. She helped me set my netcoins account (which was a local exchange here) and taught me how to purchase BTC and said that I don't need to do anything but HODL and forget about it for some time. So I said okay, and then resumed my daily activities which are tending to my baby, applying for multiple part-time jobs online (which luckily some good clients hired me because I need money so bad). I got so preoccupied with my work and tending to kids and I almost forgot about bitcoin until Sarah called me again 7 months after and asked me how I'm doing and also about the bitcoin I/she invested. I apologized to her and said I wasn't keeping track. She said that it is fine and she would meet me the next Friday. Long story short, we met and she helped me cashed out. My eyes burst into tears when I held $10k for the first time. Never in my life, I have held with that kind of amount in just one withdrawal. To show my gratitude, I paid Sarah the money I borrowed and also the extra money she let me invest and I give her some more. The rest were used to pay the rent and other utility bills. Now that I have a stable job and a passive income on the side, I'm not stressed anymore and I am so grateful for all the blessings that have been showered to us. Bitcoin is my redemption and I'm digging it. I finally believe that there is a rainbow after the rain.",1623853151,22,22

o14d49,Bat_is_my_last_name,Are we really going to the Moon this time? Hear me out," Everybody is still screaming ""to the Moon, to the Moon"" and they are posting so many bullish news (El Salvador, Taproot, Musk accepting BTC after 50% of mining energy is green etc..) and yet the price still drops, and when it rises the volume is still dropping (screaming contrary indication). In a strong bull market, every good news pumps the price greatly, and bad news doesn't affect the price too much. In a bear market it is the opposite. Look at the Ethereum for example, EIP-1559 is coming within 30 days, and people were expecting 5-10k because the deflationary system. Yet we see more and more weakness in the ETH market.

Also, people here in this Bitcoin sub are acting like they are in some shitcoin community and encouraging each other to HODL, which is funny and often lame while every single indication is showing the whole crypto market weakness.

I will probably get down votes for this, but at the same time I'm reading here how people are selling their houses and want to be paid in crypto, investing ridiculous amounts of money and life savings into crypto (which shows too much greed) and denial of the crash.

I',m not saying that the crash will happen 100%, but currently there is much more probability that we will test new lows then the new highs. Personally myself, I have stop-buy orders set really high since I don't like how the market looks right now - and I will happily buy more BTC as soon as volume, sentiment and few other indicators start showing the real and genuine price recovery.

Every podcast, YouTube video, and reddit post was hype about going to the moon and how many hundreds of thousands of dollars BTC would be worth by summer and by the end of the year.

I wanted to make a significant investment and I did. It took a while for me to move some semi-illiquid money around the system. By the time I had the funds available, BTC had been dropped down to around $53k... What a deal! There was no DCAing, only jumping in immediately on this amazing discount before the rocket really takes off.

Fast forward to today... Had I DCAed, I would be in a much better place. NOBODY expected this crash so it seemed like a bad decision to DCA. And now I'm on the verge of making a second significant purchase. And again, my choices are to spend 100% and buy while I can at this discount, or DCA and pray I don't wake up one morning to a $60k bitcoin again.

Already know that nobody can officially give financial advice. I will not take any response as financial advice nor make a decision based on any ones response. I've just wanted to have this conversation about DCAing for a while and thought this was a good framework for the discussion.",1623847473,12,2

Specifically, the commission is asking the public to consider whether they believe the Bitcoin ETF would be susceptible to manipulation and designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.

The SEC also asked people to weigh in on ‚Äúthe suitability of Bitcoin as an underlying asset for an exchange-traded product,‚Äù and the liquidity and transparency of the Bitcoin (BTC) market.

My response:

Bitcoin has the largest digital coin market cap at $700 billion and continues to lead providing digital coin liquidity. Bitcoin‚Äôs liquidity reduces the risk of manipulation compared to other digital coins. 

Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain is more transparent than any fiat currency.

Bitcoin is decentralized and is caped at 21 million coins. There are no pre-mined coins and 21 million cannot be manipulated. The same cannot be said about the centralized digital coins or fiat currencies. WHERE IT COUNTS MOST, Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized design and cap prevents fraudulent and manipulative acts.

1. I do not believe that the proposed Trust and Shares would be susceptible to manipulation any more than any other ETF, and in fact, I believe it is far less susceptible. Unlike with commodities such as gold and oil, Bitcoin has a fixed, predictable supply. One new block is mined every 10 minutes on average, rewarding 6.25 BTC to whomever successfully mines the block, and a total of 21,000,000 BTC will exist. No more, no less.


Being that Bitcoin is decentralized and that changes to the protocol cannot occur without overwhelming consensus, it is not possible for malicious actors to increase or decrease the amount of supply that exists. Granted, anyone can add or remove liquidity from order books, but Bitcoin has a market cap of hundreds of billions of dollars. It's heavily traded at all times. The risk of manipulation is thus minimal at best.


In regards to the transparency of the Bitcoin market, it could not possibly be more transparent. Every on-chain transaction since the beginning of time is accessible by all. This makes Bitcoin absolutely, 100% suitable for an ETF. Those who want to can already hold things like GBTC shares or shares of companies like RIOT and MARA (as well as MSTR, TSLA, PYPL, et cetera). They loosely track the BTC spot price (some more than others), but investors are given additional volatility beyond that of the actual BTC price with these investments. A Bitcoin ETF would 100% solve this problem and protect investors.


2. Bitcoin's market cap was under $10B for most of 2016. It lacked institutional demand at that time, and was in fact not far removed from the Mt. Gox debacle. Such an event is extremely unlikely to repeat itself now that the market cap exceeds $720B at the time of this writing (and it was over $1T earlier this year). Companies like Tesla and Square hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet. The market is much more mature, and it is mostly traded on reputable exchanges like Coinbase.


3. Though Bitcoin *is* mostly traded on reputable exchanges, investors do not have the same protection they would have with an ETF because cryptocurrencies are not treated in the same way as stocks. There is a saying in the world of crypto: not your keys, not your coins. However, not everyone wants to be their own bank, so to speak, and there have been many instances in the past where people have lost their private keys and thus lost access to their Bitcoin. An ETF would bring the best of both worlds.


4. In regards to the CME and Bitcoin futures in general, given the daily trading volume, it'd be extraordinarily difficult for a single entity to manipulate the market as you described. Macro factors such as inflation, threats of strict regulation and bans around the world, changes to the tax code, companies selling, or even comments from Secretary Yellen or Chairman Powell can negatively impact the price. Yes, people do sell on spot and also short Bitcoin in such a scenario. However, they do this with other things as well, and it's simply an investment strategy of getting ahead of something. Instances of the price spiking or falling off a cliff for absolutely no reason in the absence of these other factors are quite rare indeed.


The Bitcoin market is huge, and it is global. TSLA sold $150M worth of Bitcoin in order to see whether they could do so without significantly moving the market, and nobody would have had any idea if not for their quarterly earnings report. No one country is capable of dominating the Bitcoin market.


5. Continuing with the point I was making previously, the amount of money it would take to actually manipulate the Bitcoin spot market through a Bitcoin ETF would be unfathomable. It would be so cost prohibitive that anyone who did try it would seriously regret it and would lose a lot of money. There are simply too many players involved and too much money involved for such a strategy to bear any fruit.¬†


Bitcoin is not the same as low cap altcoins, and should not be viewed as such. It's easy to lump Bitcoin in with the shenanigans that take place in those markets, but they're about as dissimilar as OTC penny stocks are to AAPL.¬†


It is absolutely true that the price that the Sponsor uses to value the Trust's Bitcoin is not particularly important. When Bitcoin is considerably less or more on any given exchange, arbitrage traders *very* quickly close the gap.


In conclusion, I am of the opinion that a Bitcoin ETF is long overdue. I hope you will agree.",1623951705,21,13

A lot of us weren‚Äôt into stocks, bonds, or anything tied to the system. For obvious reasons this protocol called to us. 

If you‚Äôre made for it put in everything you have, especially if you have no dependents. Only you will benefit or perish because of your decisions. Most of these people don‚Äôt care about you. They want to boast internet blabber to feel validated. In 5-10 years would you rather deal with knowing. You listened to some chump that thinks this is the stock market? Facing the reality you didn‚Äôt go all in to your ability? While your decisions could have secured a future for yourself and others. Or the potentiality the a** to mouth lurkers of Reddit were right. You ended up loosing your fiat, and learning a life lesson. The decisions yours don‚Äôt listen to people on a forum. As SWIM is typing this he‚Äôs not suggesting you do or don‚Äôt do it.

Then I wanted to test the 730 daily MA as a fair value, its the green line in this chart

The odds of such an approach not ending well are too high,‚Äù the governor said.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey talked about cryptocurrency regulation Monday at the annual conference of financial trade body The City UK.

He was quoted as saying: ‚ÄúWe must, both domestically and working with international partners, ensure that we understand and respond to the public interest issues that arise here.‚Äù He said it will allow the Bank of England to protect financial stability while allowing innovation to happen ‚Äúin a world where the public interest is well defined and protected.‚Äù

Emphasizing, ‚ÄúWhat we cannot have is a world where innovation gets a free pass to ignore the public interest. The odds of such an approach not ending well are too high,‚Äù the governor detailed:
Governor Bailey has long been a critic of cryptocurrencies. Last month, he said cryptocurrencies are ‚Äúdangerous,‚Äù reiterating that they ‚Äúhave no intrinsic value‚Äù and ‚ÄúBuy them only if you‚Äôre prepared to lose all your money.‚Äù

He also talked about stablecoins, noting that they ‚Äúhave the potential to be systemic in terms of their importance for the financial system and its stability.‚Äù Bailey elaborated, ‚ÄúA key requirement will be to ensure that, unless the stablecoin is operating as a bank, the backing assets for stablecoins cover the outstanding coin issuance at all times.‚Äù

Moreover, the governor of the Bank of England warned against using cryptocurrencies for payments, stating:
Addressing the Bank of England‚Äôs work on a central bank digital currency (CBDC), he said the bank and the U.K. Treasury are weighing the potential of creating one. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to engage with users, the technology sector, to understand the potential for these things,‚Äù he said.",1624052289,21,2

Furthermore, there‚Äôs an area in El Salvador called ‚ÄúBitcoin Beach‚Äù with a small group of beach villagers that are attempting to leverage bitcoin on a daily basis.
The Bitcoin Beach resident‚Äôs official Twitter account has amassed more than 27,000 followers since its introduction in 2019. The account grew massively following El Salvador‚Äôs president, Nayib Bukele officially announcing the legal tender plans. The Twitter account shows all the action that‚Äôs been taking place in Playa El Zonte since then.

‚ÄúBitcoin Beach team working late to produce educational material for 6 million future Bitcoiners,‚Äù the Twitter account tweeted on Wednesday sharing a number of pictures of the progress. According to the residents of the village, a great number of entrepreneurs are showing up to the beach to visit or help the bitcoin economy flourish.
The residents of Bitcoin Beach have shared a myriad of photographs covering the work that‚Äôs been done so far in the area. ‚ÄúDesks have all filled up at Hope House Bitcoin Beach shared workspace with bitcoin companies streaming into El Salvador ‚Äì So of course we are building more space,‚Äù the group stressed the other day.

o2yyo8,WatchYourCharts,"SOLUTION: Solar + Hydro Powered Bitcoin, Plus Recycling Initiative","The best solution is to switch Bitcoin mining from coal powered electricity to energy that is created by solar power and hydro power. At least we could announce this as our ""goal"" and in the coming years take concrete steps, 1 step at a time, to make Bitcoin clean and shiny like my toilet bowl after I scrubbed it with bleach containing cleaning liquid.

We could also announce Bitcoin mining hardware equipment recycling initiative, ensuring that all components used to mine Bitcoin are properly recycled, without damaging environment.

The decision to go green would have multiple benefits for Bitcoin buyers and miners:

1. Instead of being in conflict with left-wing extremists and their climate change agenda, we could simply join them and invite them to buy some shiny clean and eco conscious Bitcoin.
2. On the other hand, we could use our newly created green economy to criticize legacy financial system for being dirty, using too much coal powered energy, and destroying the environment; thus, earning credibility among eco conscious population who is sceptical of cryptocurrency.
3. Once the dust settles, Bitcoin can finally start to enjoy wider acceptance and can increase it's market dominance to a fair market value level, like $1 million per 1 Bitcoin, and then in the following decade or two, 1 Billion per  1 Bitcoin, and higher.

In conclusion, we have to be smart. We can't just swim against the tide. Tell ""them"" what they want to hear, satisfy their left wing extremist agenda, let them hear ""Yes, we care"", and then we focus on business. But first we have to tell them what they want to hear. They are narcissist, sick, demented people, and all they want to hear is acknowledgment that we believe that climate is changing, and that we want to protect the environment.

Tell them what they want to hear. Let's move forward.

Solar + Hydro powered Bitcoin with Recycling initiative is something that needs to be widely circulated, so left wing psychopaths feed their inner sickness with a feeling of vindication, followed by a feeling of Bitcoin's acceptance.",1624046657,10,0

I literally am on Meta Mask all day and use sites like uniswap and pancakeswap. Once again I missed out on cake as well. It just gets so annoying missing out on all these crypto.

I value the communities opinion. I know a ton of people that got lucky on btc and eth but ever since they have been losing on other buys.

I've been studying how to set stop losses so you don't break the bank and also shorting and longing positions but this stuff is very hard and I looked up the statistics it says less than 1 % become professional crypto day traders.

o2vf1x,SommePooreChumb,Making digital currency into tangible coins,"I've been researching into different technologies and into the function of money for most of my life and purely out of curiousity.
 
I've been imagining different possibilities in modernizing currency beyond paper in a wallet or digits on a screen by essentially combining the two in a fundamentally different way.

There is a new technology called 5D(dimension) data storage which scientists are developing in order to store terabytes of permanent data into a crystal-like structure which is viable for billions of years according to their estimates.

This technology has the ability to store massive quantities of coded information or software which is able to be read and verified as legitimate using hardware that is not exceedingly expensive or difficult to use.

If a bank were to store the entire blockchain and hashcodes of a certain transaction (I apologize ahead of time for my lack of understanding to how cryptocurrency functions) onto the physical crystal medium with a certain amount of cryptocurrency you essentially are making the money, proof of the money, and the software to protect modifications to the money on the one coin.

Throw a protective 'shield' barrier of a sort to prevent deformation or damage to the crystal and you've got yourself digital currency that is impossible to hack and/or modify while retaining complete anonymity of the owner and who spends it because the coin does not record (that's impossible without the writing device). 

The money coin would change hands anonymously since there is no record or collection of each coins creation or destruction. 

There could be if the bank requires it or the federal government mandates it but all currency that is 'printed' without tracking information is totally anonymous.

The next issue is that the idea of money is something that is valued or devalued depending on confidence of the item of value such as gold or cryptocurrency.

If people believe a gold bar is worth a car then it is. If people believe a bitcoin is worth $40,000 then it is.

How do you prevent money from being devalued due to excessive 'printing' of monies into the market? You isolate each individual money into it's own entire financial system on one ""coin"".

Essentially each coin is given a certain and definite financial value due to the code and the work associated with it's creation.

When you print a coin you cannot artificially attach a numerical value to it like fiat currency such as the US Dollar and say, ""it has this value because it's backed by our debt"". 

Using a physical 5D optical storage Bitcoin creation method would require actual work and proof of work and the entire blockchain being downloaded (laser etched) into the crystal coin as well as the information of the producer and their licensing information, date of creation, unique identifier code to eliminate duplicates, and finally the permanent numerical value of the coin which does not change according to inflation.

The physical coin contains the entire financial system (blockchain) and software verification (communications with the reading device) to allow the user(owner) of the coin to spend it.

To destroy a coin is a simple matter of laser burning the coin or physical destruction and since most crystals used for these coins are cheap and readily available it would allow the rapid creation and destruction of any amount of these coins to fit any financial circumstance such as government notes in the $500,000 range being a single coin.

I've rambled on in my mind about this and I know it's financially and physically/scientifically possible at this moment but I wanted to know what you people think since y'all are definitely smarter than me.",1624037625,22,3

BTCs spikes/crashes in relation to dollars is not indicative of BTCs value, it‚Äôs indicative of **the US dollar value.**

One BTC is not worth $32k dollars. ONE DOLLAR is worth 1/32,000th of a BTC.

That‚Äôs how little the US dollar‚Äôs worth has become.

BTC *will* become legal tender globally at some point.

For me, price is irrelevant because I‚Äôm thinking in 2030/2040/2050 money not today‚Äôs fiat dollars.

o52ahy,rsm1615,Islamic Cleric Explains Reasoning Behind Crypto Prohibition,"A decision by a prominent religious body in Ingushetia to prohibit dealings with cryptocurrency has sparked controversy in the predominantly Muslim Russian republic. Critics have taken to social media to express their disagreements with the ban, pointing out that the treatment of bitcoin in Islamic jurisdictions is not one-sided.
At a meeting in mid-April, the Ingush Council of Alims adopted a ban on the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies by Muslims in the country. The Islamic clergymen said at the time that they took the decision after studying Islamic sources and reaching a conclusion that the religion prohibits the trading of electronic money.

Deputy Chief Mufti Magomed Hashtyrov has since been compelled to explain the council‚Äôs position. This week, he told the local newspaper Ingushetia that cryptocurrencies, as a means of payment, have no physical representation and their exchange differs from the trading of goods in a physical marketplace. The latter is not prohibited for Muslims. The theologian revealed that the council had already intervened to resolve disputes over cryptocurrency, even between clerics in one case, and stated:

Only honest labor brings people together, and virtual easy money quarrels them.

Hashtyrov then insisted that ‚Äúcryptocurrency, for now, is neither money, nor it is a commodity. When it becomes publicly available, legally accepted means of payment, with a state guarantee, then we can talk about money, but not today,‚Äù Ingushetia quoted him saying.
The newspaper shared the article with Hashtyrov‚Äôs comments on Instagram and judging by the reactions, not everyone agrees with his interpretations. As reported by the Caucasian Knot portal, Ingushetians have commented that their country has more pressing issues to deal with than banning crypto transactions. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of problems in the republic. But the clergy and authorities are ‚Äòfixated‚Äô on cryptocurrency,‚Äù wrote a user with the handle ‚Äòtumgoev_111_06.‚Äô

‚ÄúBan the sale of alcohol, condemn corrupt officials,‚Äù suggested someone named ‚Äòkaddafi.‚Äô ‚ÄúThey just found something to talk about and sort out,‚Äù added a user called ‚Äòeva_mango.‚Äô Others have challenged the validity of the imposed ban: ‚ÄúI have been trading cryptocurrency for two years! Before I started, I read a couple of articles on Islamic forums, where it was clearly stated that there is nothing forbidden in this, if you don‚Äôt trade futures,‚Äù noted ‚Äòtsoro.1.‚Äô Then ‚Äòdzurdzuk666‚Äô wrote:

Not money, not commodity, in what sense??? If at any time you can exchange it for money and commodity‚Ä¶ Paper money is trash too. But we use it.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs exactly ‚Äòeasy‚Äô money. Knowledge and ability are needed to use it. It seems to me that this issue has not been fully studied by theologians,‚Äù suggests a female commenter with the Instagram handle ‚Äòangry_hare_4,‚Äô quoted by Caucasian Knot. The portal has also published another, better qualified opinion on the matter, that of Gapur Oziev, associate professor of economics at the International Islamic University in Kuala Lumpur. Oziev, who has been teaching Islamic banking and finance since 2008, was surprised by the Ingush clergy‚Äôs decision on the matter.

‚ÄúThey have announced a very old version of the fatwa. At the moment, there are a lot of scholars who do not directly prohibit it, although they condemn everything related to cryptocurrency,‚Äù he told the online edition. ‚ÄúThere are more questions than answers. There are many dubious things, and the hadiths say to avoid the dubious. However, since there is no explicit text in the Sharia under which it would be possible to prohibit cryptocurrency, it‚Äôs not worth saying that it is haram,‚Äù Oziev emphasized.

While the motives vary between the members of this diverse group, the results indicate that the Australian nation‚Äôs overall interest in decentralized digital money remains strong.
The poll has been conducted among 1,000 Australian residents by the comparison website Finder. The company is actually among the first in the country to offer employees the option to take a portion of their remuneration in cryptocurrency. The platform has now found that 24% of Australians, or around 4.7 million, are ready to accept bitcoin (BTC) as part of their salaries.

The company is actually among the first in the country to offer employees the option to take a portion of their remuneration in cryptocurrency. The platform has now found that 24% of Australians, or around 4.7 million, are ready to accept bitcoin (BTC) as part of their salaries.
Of those who would be willing to be paid in BTC, Finder pointed out, 14% have said so because they are convinced it is going up in value, while another 10% admitted a bitcoin payment would help them to invest in digital currency before tax.
Taylor Blackburn, personal finance specialist at Finder, notes that the cryptocurrency has seen impressive growth in the past year, ‚Äúdespite its recent drop and sometimes volatile nature.‚Äù Commenting on the outcome of the study, Blackburn further emphasized:
With more Australians looking for inflation hedges, yield-bearing assets and alternative investment opportunities, it‚Äôs not surprising that this many people are willing to be paid part of their salary in Bitcoin.
According to the survey, Generation X Australians are more likely than others to view a crypto salary as a wise investment. 22% of the respondents in this age group think BTC is going to appreciate even more over time, along with 19% of millennials. For comparison, only 1% of baby boomers and 13% of Generation Z share their optimism.",1624301052,6,1

o51lym,Megsve,Bank of America Evaluating Crypto Opportunities,"Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo have shared their policies regarding cryptocurrency before the U.S. Senate banking committee. The three banks are in different stages of offering crypto services to their clients. They also lag behind some of their peers, such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, in offering access to investments with exposure to bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.
The CEOs of Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo gave their testimonies on cryptocurrency before the Senate banking committee last week. The committee, headed by Senator Sherrod Brown, summoned the investment bankers for its annual oversight hearing on Wall Street firms.

Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said that BofA was keeping distance from bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the bank continued ‚Äúto evaluate the opportunities, risks and client demand for products and services related to cryptocurrency.‚Äù Noting that his bank holds more than 60 blockchain-related patents, he emphasized, ‚ÄúWe still have not found a use case at scale.‚Äù The Bank of America executive confirmed:

Currently, we do not lend against cryptocurrencies and do not bank companies whose primary business is cryptocurrency or the facilitation of cryptocurrency trading and investment.

Bank of America‚Äôs analyst said in January that bitcoin was the ‚Äúmother of all bubbles.‚Äù Nonetheless, the bank‚Äôs most recent fund manager survey saw ‚Äúlong bitcoin‚Äù as the most crowded trade. In March, the bank says the only good reason for holding bitcoin was ‚Äúsheer price appreciation.‚Äù
Senator Brown is skeptical of cryptocurrencies. He recently sent a letter to the new Acting Comptroller of the Currency, Michael Hsu, urging him to review the cryptocurrency regulation under the purview of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).
Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser talked about her company taking a ‚Äúmeasured approach‚Äù to cryptocurrency as the bank sought ‚Äúto understand changes in the digital asset space and the use of distributed ledger technology, including demand and interest by our clients, regulatory developments and technology advancements.‚Äù The Citi executive noted:

Before we engage with cryptocurrencies, we see it as our responsibility to ensure we have clear governance and controls in place.
Citigroup is reportedly planning to launch crypto services as the firm sees a ‚Äúvery rapid‚Äù accumulation of interest in bitcoin. In March, Citigroup says bitcoin was at a tipping point and could become the preferred currency for international trade.
Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf said that his company was close to announcing a pilot project using blockchain technology ‚Äúto complete internal book transfers of cross-border payments within our global branch network.‚Äù However, in terms of cryptocurrency, he said:

We continue to closely and actively follow developments around cryptocurrencies, which have emerged as alternative investments products, though their status as a currency and mechanism of payment remains fluid.
Darrell Cronk, the president of Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said last week that his firm is in the final stages of adding an actively managed cryptocurrency investment strategy to its platform. ‚ÄúWe think the cryptocurrency space has just kind of hit an evolution and maturation of its development that allows it now to be a viable investable asset,‚Äù the executive opined.",1624299323,0,1

Money can be used offline and and easy transported , counted , distributed , to anyone anytime anywhere. 

Money is  (or was , not too educated on this) or partly , backed by gold . 

Governments accept and recognise the legitimacy of their currencies.

The price of things can be made simply. Not 0.00000023 BTC.

A transaction with currency is instant. BTC often takes me 45 minutes to complete a transaction . 

And then my biggest point would be if the world came to a near end disaster movie type thing..... I want currencies and gold bars not a hard drive with a bitcoin.

And that mindset exists now when everything is safe. A bar of gold is undeniable. It's engrained in human society for thousands of years. It's been lusted after for centuries. It is in all the religious texts, our history , jewelry etc. Gold will always be valuable

As if that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, China‚Äôs plan for a nation state digital currency is similar to North Korea‚Äôs internal ‚Äúinternet.‚Äù  As we have discussed over and over again, open systems beat closed systems. The Chinese approach of banning an open monetary network in pursuit of a tightly controlled monetary system is unlikely to be seen as an advantageous strategic move for their citizens. But just like North Korea, this decision will be helpful in continuing to consolidate power and ensure the longevity of the dictatorship.‚Äù - Anthony Pompliano",1624318172,9,1

I'm wondering if anyone in the community can share their experience with the above methods and/or their recommendation. Did either of these methods not work for you? Does one require significantly more maintenance than the other? Etc...

For clarity, I'm most interested in:

1. Learning more about bitcoin by building and running a node - ***especially from a technical perspective***. This means building things from, more-or-less, scratch. This is why I am *not* considering something like myNode. Also, while I don't have too much linux command line experience, I do have years of python experience, so I'm excited about the idea of learning more about linux.
2. Supporting a global payment system by running a node and, ultimately, routing lightning transactions.

Obviously, both **RaspiBolt** or **RaspiBlitz** will enable me to support bitcoin. However, from what I've gathered, **RaspiBolt** is a more technical setup and would provide more opportunities to learn about the nitty-gritty computer science elements of bitcoin.",1624358055,4,1

The only Self growing currency. THE LILAC SPACE DOLLAR (LSD) COMING August 2021. Ending Global poverty, &amp; more in &lt;10 years.","Lilac Tech owns a wide variety of technology from Aerospace to Crypto Currency. August 2021 Lilac is releasing the Lilac Space Dollar (LSD). The currency is backed in gold, tech, diamonds &amp; more. Providing 100% Liquidity, Preventing price loss and Changing the entire crypto/finance world forever. 

What makes the Lilac Space Dollar the best Crypto currency/investment in the world?

- 1% minimum daily return; No price loss. This is made possible by a few factors:
      -Every Lilac Space Dollar is backed in a stable combination gold, diamonds, silver, other crypto, USD, technology, and Land.
     - Self driving currency. The L in L.S.D. stands for Lilac the reason for this is Lilac helps drive and stabilize the currency price. To end poverty I donated  5% profit royalty of Lilac Tech to be devoted to buy LSD off the open market driving the currency forever. 
     -Lab Diamond and precious metal mining Self driving currency..... 
Lilac Tech has developed the worlds most advanced and prolific diamonds, precious stones and other precious metals. Expanding the market cap by millions eventually billions everyday. 

-Created and operated By Lilac Tech a United States, Washington, DC based Tech company. Our office is 2 Blocks from the White House on K street. 
-Lilac Space Dollar Created by Engineers and scientist that were actively designing the solution to poverty and financial struggle. 
-Crypto Currency with a purpose. Once LSD Market Cap passes 10 trillion we will begin universal basic income for every human on the planet. As the market cap expands so does the universal income amount. To rapidly increase the growth of the Market Cap Lilac Tech has created a variety of advanced technology from Space mining to Lab Mining. Lilac Tech has begun Lab mining diamonds, precious stones and other precious metals. Expanding the market cap by millions eventually billions everyday. So all the precious metals and gems mined by a Lilac are used to grow the LSD. 

The purpose of universal income is to end poverty and provide the world with a consent to work model. Which means you have to want to work, not the current system where people are economically forced into labor.


It‚Äôs time to work together to collectively make our lives better. We have to remember We the people created the economic system we have to take action to fix it and improve it. Otherwise it will remain flawed.

Smile","A few months ago Michael Saylor and Ross Stevens had an amazing talk [Bitcoin MacroStrategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoobUKNttmw) ( i think i've rewatched it at least a dozen times).  In their talk Ross Stevens quoted the 28th Governor of the Bank of Japan, Masaru Hayami. I decided to dig around and look for the speech in question; it's a worthwhile read (translated):

[https://www.bis.org/review/r000324c.pdf](https://www.bis.org/review/r000324c.pdf)

A decade before Satoshi Nakamoto published the white paper, central bankers already knew the writing was on the wall, and they had no solution.  Like Jeff Booth notes in 'Price of Tomorrow"", inflationary money in a world where technology deflates everything doesn't make any sense. It was after reading this, and trying to put myself in his shoes I realized what Ross Stevens meant by ""(central bankers) getting punched in the face"".  

Sadly Mr. Hayami passed away in 2009 so he likely left this world without a solution to his painful problem, I wonder how he'd feel about where Japan is right now with stagnant wages and rising living costs.  I imagine he'd feel horrible, hopeless even.  Central Bankers are literally operating in a hopeless fashion, we see this everywhere.

Although it's hard not to be pissed about Central Bank policies around the globe that literally rob everyone of their hard-earned money by debasing their savings,  I do think we get carried away labeling Central Bankers as villains.  They are in fact humans that are up against problems that they cannot face with the tools they have available today.  They wake up every morning to try to solve a hopeless problem.  ""Own nothing and be happy"" is literally their solution today. They know how dumb it is, but they have no choice but to shove it down everyone's throats.  Not a job anyone would like to have.

Does Bitcoin fix this? Hell yeah! But can Bitcoin fix this right this block? Probably not because there's still a lot of work to do to grow the network to become a sufficient size to become a useful tool to help humanity manage resources and price them appropriately. As [the mycelium example](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjBq--746rxAhUCSX0KHSuNAJgQtwIwAXoECAIQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DuTgDQ56Su38&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ZlKmnAZquACDdYecrrprm), the network still has much to evolve in order to break down greater variety of resources.

While I think battling critics and debunking their false narratives are worthwhile endeavors that push Bitcoin forward, we're literally arguing with hopeless people who dont want to see the light at the end of the tunnel and instead only know to spread their hopelessness to others. Step away from that nonsense from time-to-time

Ignore their pessimism and ego, smile and spread cheer, keep moving forward.  When people see that Bitcoin is surrounded by people hopeful for the future they'll follow along and join the party on their own, we shouldn't have to expect everyone to read thousands of hours of materials to join in and learn to scold naysayers like schoolchildren.  People are naturally attracted to groups that smile all the time, and Bitcoiners should do that more often despite how fucked the world is.

o5hthv,LieliSan,a different view on the sell off,"For my understanding BTC is as valueable as it is because of it's security among other factors. So when the hashrate drops by a significant amout the safety does as well. At least on paper. This means you are storing your value in a ""safe"" that is not as secure as it once was so you might take some value out of the safe to put it somewhere else. I could at least imagine this is how some people or institutions that stored hundred of millions in BTC.
But why is it less secure and is it really? In theory there couldn't just be this one actor that has accumulated so many miners that he could do 51% attack. But in China were so many miners located that in theory if the government took control over all of them they could try harming the network. This isn't happening because We see miners leaving the country with their hardware so I don't see why it should be that much less secure.
What I don't understand is why people and institutions that own millions in BTC don't do enough research to see this. Sorry for my bad english, it's not my mothertongue.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently got into crypto (2 months now) and over time realized the supremacy of Bitcoin. I am addicted to this movement and to this revolution because I know how much centralized systems can be harmful, criminal and unfair. I am from Lebanon, if you can do a bit of research, you can find the perfect example of centralized system criminalities. 

&amp;#x200B;

After comparing Lebanon to similar hyperinflated nations, I realized that those nations usually have a decent hash rate ( Venezuela, Iran, Turkey...).  Why dont we have large scale mining?

As I dig into it, and after asking a lot of the Bitcoin society here, I have these conclusions:

* the electricity in most of Lebanon is unstable (regular power outages)
* uncertainty of the future in regards to electricity

&amp;#x200B;

Hypothesis:

* Let's say there is 24/7 very cheap  renewable electricity ( between 0.03/0.04$ Kwh maybe less), how can I contact mining companies ? 

Building on that hypothesis :

Where I live, the sun is up for 11/12 months, so I contacted a Solar panel company and they are making a quotation for the price of such an independent renewable electric power for x amount of antminer computers.

&amp;#x200B;

 Conclusion:

If we solve the electricity problem, Lebanon should be a good if not a great destination for mining. But is there any possibility of getting help for  financing that electric infrastructure ? Or mining companies would only invest on already existing electric infrastructure? Whether the answer is yes or no, I would really appreciate your help on finding a way to contact such companies. 

And it would be my pleasure to hear your advice and maybe to find someone from you to help me along the way as this is a huge opportunity to my country, to miners and to Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading.",1624345164,25,1

o5gres,ANAL-Inverter-2000,I've experienced 3 market cycles now and it always feels like this.,"Storytime. I think I can almost be considered an OG by now. Recently, I've started to observe my emotions more seriously during the market moves and I've had valuable insights while doing so: *what I am feeling right now is probably very close to what many other investors are feeling*. This is great to know. It helps me to estimate how the market might react in real time.

I've joined this sub I'm 2013 and my first big buy was in Dec 2013 during an *epic* leg up. Bitcoin crashed upwards like I've never seen again. Incredibly, though, I almost timed the top perfectly and bought in right before it crashed down again, ultimately moving from around 1k to 350 or so. Imagine my feelies. I was naive and very new. But the reason I've joined was a bit different than the reasons moon bois are joining today. Back then, Bitcoin was pure magic. And it was subversive. It was a big F U you to the banks. That was the selling argument. And it was always clear to me since then that Bitcoin is either going to 0 or to infinity. I still believe that today. 

After my first buy, I was in the red immediately. Double digit percent loss. But my conviction was strong. I've spent the next months reading and understanding BTC. I've practiced with lots of different wallets, I've sent transactions around (they were still free back then, yes, 0 transaction fees) and generally got comfortable with using it. I noticed that, yes, this technology is insane, and yes, I can send anything to anyone, it takes a couple minutes, and yes, its almost free, and yes, nobody can do anything about it. 

Remember, I was a complete noob that was down 25%, 50%, 65% his investment. But I'm not an iditiot. I know it will go to infinity and the chance of it going to zero is so low that I've decided to keep buying like a retard. I've started putting almost all the money I've got into it (I was a very poor student back in the days, don't get too excited). I figured ""the lower my buy-in price is, the earlier I will be in the green"". Long story short, I've been red for almost two f*cking years. Can you imagine being red for two years and still keep buying? One part of me was extremely scared (""I am YOLOing all of my money into this thing that might just fail"") and extremely bullish at the same time (""this shit will go to infinty but it might take a couple decades""). 

Then 2017 came and we've experienced a wild increase of the price to 20k. Even my family got involved at some point because they've seen my huge gains and got FOMO. My mother turned her 5k into an equivalent of 50k. They started to interfere with my plan and give me (well meant) suggestions on when I should sell. Of course they didn't get it, they are too old to imagine a cyber future where this stash of satoshis will be the ultimate commodity. There was insane FUD around, including the biggest FUD I've ever seen, which was the block size wars (look them up if you don't remember it). Then the crash of 2018 came and everything evaporated. 

However, from this bull run onwards, I've never been in a loss ever again. The price never went lower than my average buy-in but that actually made my feelies even harder to manage. Now my thoughts weren't ""Oh no, you could end up with a loss"" to ""OH NO YOU MIGHT END UP BEING TOO STUPID TO TAKE A PROFIT"" which was way more frightening and ego-crushing. Although I had hands made of diamonds, I've had several moments in the year-long crash that followed where I almost sold. We saw 20k, 10k, even 6k, and I still believe that the fact that I use a hardware wallet (and not keep my sats on an exchange) is what ultimately saved me from making one of the biggest mistakes of my life, which would've been selling my stash at 6k.

Fast forward 2020. How things can change. The covid crash to 3500 was completely different. I've seen the price drop in real time which triggered the most bullish sentiment in me that I've ever experience. Without a doubt of seeing this as an incredible opportunity to buy, I threw a bunch of money in and converted it to BTC. I knew that BTC was on a fire sale! And then we've seen the beautiful (but this time not so mind-bending) bull run of 2020. 

Now, BTC is not only about cypher punks anymore. The game is world domination. I started to understand the waaaaaay bigger implications that this will bring to the world. Money is broken. The world is broken. Our governments are going nuts. Our politicians are noobs. And society is full of fear. I wonder if there is an asset that is invincible and that spreads freedom tech by infiltrating the hearts of people by promising them huge gains... Mhhhh! 

And now we're here. I look around this sub and all I see is myself. Many new people in this sub, many people afraid of losing their hard-earned money. I completely get it. It's how I felt. It is a lot harder to stomach if you haven't put in the time to learn about the tech. But that's why we're in this sub, to support each other. And I'm not saying that to sound corny, I'm saying that because I've experienced it 100% myself. Without this sub, I wouldn't have been able to recharge my batteries, rethink my strategy, reaffirm my conviction, and observe the development of bitcoin in real time. I wouldn't have seen masses of people giving emotional support to each other, because at the end of the day, this is what controls these price movements. Emotions. 

So, if you feel afraid right now. If you feel like you've made a huge mistake, if you feel like this could've been a bad decision, then good, this is what a huge part of the market is thinking right now. Observe your feelings, judge them with distance, extrapolate them to the masses of people also looking at exactly the same chart as you do. And start using that information *for you*. Fear is a part of the equation and the reason I've written up this long-ass post is so you can appreciate this without having to go through hell first, like I did. What you are feeling right now is almost ""priced in"". Money can be made when there is blood on the streets. 

That's my advice. Do not buy the next best shitcoin. Nothing is even close to becoming a ""replacement"" for BTC. Ask yourself why you like Bitcoin, learn as much as you possibly can (I highly recomment listening to the hundreds of hours of articles in the Bitcoin Audible Podcast) and keep stacking if you know why you're doing it. That's it, I'm out! Peace!

o5gacl,BTCqwer,What major changes have been brought about by Bitcoin's first major upgrade in 4 years?,"On June 13, the hash rate of mining pools supporting Taproot upgrade on Bitcoin's entire network exceeded 90%, reaching the minimum requirement for lock-in upgrade, which also means that the Taproot upgrade will be officially activated in November this year.

Regarded as Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúmost ambitious upgrade‚Äù in the past few years, Taproot does represent extraordinary significance in the eyes of the industry, especially Bitcoin enthusiasts, and even ‚Äúthe most important of the Bitcoin protocol upgrade proposals so far. Sex once"".

However, compared with the Ethereum EIP 1559 proposal that has caused great industry debate, the industry voices caused by the Taproot upgrade are not loud, and many friends have not even heard of it. Then what is the Taproot upgrade? What kind of change is coming?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iad4i0f2hr671.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d304fb806e301cf5d696300e2409aaf977bfea7b

Taproot activation

Bitcoin will be updated at regular intervals (soft forks of the network), and new features and information will be introduced to Bitcoin mainly in the form of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs).

The latest Taproot upgrade is a compilation of three BIPs ""upgrade package"", that is, the Taproot upgrade includes three parts: Schnorr signature (BIP 340), Taproot (BIP 341) and Tapscript (BIP 342):

1. BIP340-Schnorr signature

The Schnorr signature plan has long been listed on the wish list of many Bitcoin developers. As a cryptographic digital signature scheme developed by the German mathematician and cryptographer ClausSchnorr, it is mainly known for its simplicity and efficiency in generating short signatures.

One of the main advantages of Schnorr signatures is that they can obtain multiple keys and generate unique signatures in complex Bitcoin transactions. This means that signatures involving multiple parties can be ""aggregated"" into a single Schnorr signature, so it is called an aggregate signature.

So in a nutshell, Schnorr signature is mainly to save space and reduce costs, and it is also known as the biggest technological update after Bitcoin Segwit.

2. BIP 341 ‚Äî Taproot

Taproot is a solution based on Schnorr signatures. It can contain complex transaction conditions and fund usage details, and then provide all these contents as a new fund usage condition (new lock) to the outside world. This new usage condition And the unlocking method (new key) under the conditions of use is supported by Schnorr's linear feature.

This provides users with the ability to choose between complex arbitrary scripts and simple payment to a public key when consuming (not collecting money). In addition, key aggregation makes all Taproot output look similar.

So because multi-signature output, single-signature output, and other complex smart contracts all look the same on the blockchain, many blockchain analyses will be unavailable, thereby preserving privacy for all Taproot users.

3. BIP 342 ‚Äî Tapscript

BIP 342 adds and updates several opcodes, which are part of the machine language instructions that specify the operations to be performed. These new scripts help verify Taproot costs and Schnorr signatures, collectively referred to as Tapscript, which maximizes the flexibility of P2TR spending and is also conducive to future upgrades.

It will improve script functions and privacy, and can help make smart contracts more efficient and private by displaying only the relevant parts of the contract when spending.

In short, the core of Tarpoot's upgrade lies in Schnorr signatures, and Taproot, based on the Schnorr signature algorithm, can bring new combinations and possibilities for Bitcoin in terms of performance, privacy, and even smart contracts.

Tarpoot upgrade

The most important one in the Bitcoin protocol upgrade proposal

As we all know, Bitcoin uses digital signatures to unlock the unspent balance in UTXO to complete the exchange. Specifically, a simple exchange can be disassembled-taking A to B as an example, the actual process can be divided into ""unlock "", ""Lock"" two steps:

Unlock: A provides his own private key and completes the unlock, thus proving that this bitcoin belongs to him and can be called;

Locking: A uses B's public key to lock the bitcoin, and then transfers it to B, so that only B can use its own private key to unlock it;

That is to say, Bitcoin needs to be locked with a public key and unlocked with a private key, so as to realize the transfer and exchange of encrypted currency. The public key and private key are generated through digital signature algorithm, and the Schnorr signature mentioned above is new Signature algorithm.

Its most prominent feature is that it can aggregate multiple public key or multiple private key signatures into a new public key or a new signature, which can be simply understood as turning multiple locks that need to be unlocked at the same time into one lock. The bunch of keys used to unlock becomes a key.

So from this perspective, the Tarpoot ""upgrade package"", which is regarded as the ""most important one in the Bitcoin protocol upgrade proposal"", may bring many changes to Bitcoin.

Performance-the expansion effect similar to Rollup

First of all, the improvement in performance is the most direct. Because Taproot, which is based on Schnorr signatures, can contain complex exchange conditions and details of fund usage, and then provide all these contents as a new fund usage condition (new aggregated signature lock) to the outside world.

This reduces the amount of data transmitted and stored on the blockchain, making a single block contain more transactions, thereby reducing costs, and achieving a capacity expansion effect (in fact, I think it is a bit like Rollup on Ethereum).

Privacy-Enhance the privacy options of the Bitcoin network

Secondly, from the perspective of privacy, it will also receive the greatest blessings. Although the Schnorr signature will not make the personal Bitcoin address on the public blockchain more anonymous, it will make simple exchanges indistinguishable from those that are more complex and consist of multiple signatures.

At the same time, this also allows users to cover up complex smart contracts as ordinary Bitcoin exchanges, bringing greater privacy to users.

Bitcoin's ""difficult payment"" road

The upcoming Ethereum London upgrade in July includes 5 proposals including EIP-3198, EIP-3529, EIP-3541 and EIP-3554 in addition to the highly anticipated proposal EIP-1559.

Unlike the booming ecosystem where borderless innovations continue to emerge in Ethereum, Bitcoin's upgrade has always been very small. I believe that many friends have even felt that the development of Bitcoin may be at a standstill.

Especially since 2020, everyone seems to have gradually acquiesced to the positioning of Bitcoin as a ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù, and forgot that it once triggered heated debates in the industry, and even the payment attributes of ‚Äúglobal currency‚Äù behind the ‚ÄúBCH fork‚Äù. It seems that in terms of technology applications The upgrade is not that important anymore.

Lightning Network: Bitcoin capacity

Just like the ""Lightning Network"" dedicated to Bitcoin micropayments, after nearly three and a half years of hard work, the number of locked Bitcoins finally exceeded 1,500, an increase of 42% compared to the beginning of 2021, setting a record New high, it looks like a good result.

But at the same time, in the past year, the total issuance of Bitcoin pegged coins on the Ethereum chain has almost started from zero, breaking through 252,000. The Bitcoin Lightning Network has been promoting hard for several years. The fraction of ""ERC20 Bitcoin"" is not comparable.

The Taproot upgrade can be regarded as a timely rain, strengthening the usability of Bitcoin in terms of payment performance and privacy, including the Lightning Network. If Taproot is used, the privacy of the Lightning Network can be improved by making the channel look like a regular Bitcoin exchange. Perhaps it can make up for Bitcoin's status as a ""global currency"", making it more advantageous in its positioning and competition with ""digital gold"".

However, whether it is the increasing popularity of ""digital gold"" or ""global currency"" is the original intention, perhaps Bitcoin is no longer the same species as all other cryptocurrencies including Ethereum.",1624343307,3,1

**Just posting this for a healthy discussion, trying to avoid polarization :)**   


Just read Nassim Nicolas Taleb's paper on Bitcoin. Given I've tremendously enjoyed his books and learned a lot from them I generally tend to have a lot of respect for his opinions.   


However, I'm not convinced. I believe he makes a good case on why BTC will not become a ""currency"" (which is no surprise), but as a store of value, I do think BTC has a bright future. In my humble opinion, it is really about how big of a community believes there is value in this asset, rather than new coins to be mined &amp; collection of fees.   


Very curious to hear some thoughts, given I'm aware I might be biased as a 'fan' of N.N. Taleb :)

The bull market is scary, exciting, but also stressful.

You keep checking the price, you FOMO in, break your DCA strategy and instead of the usual bucks you throw in your month's salary. Month after month, enjoying your portfolio reaching ATH.

But still, the anxiety is there, you're thinking ""should I maybe sell a few, in a chance to buyback?""

or ""Are we there yet? Are we getting to 100k? What's going on?? Gotta read the news, again and again and again"".

And now poof, it's gone (not forever, obviously). And the anxiety makes way for the depression, because you didn't sell a single sat when you could. And the excitement fades away, your portfolio returns to its normal size. Pop! Bubble burst!

Maybe it's not the end of this run, of course. But maybe it is.

I am a big fan of Richard Wyckoff. He talked about market dynamics, supply/demand, big investors entering/exiting based on their rules, etc in early 1900s and his wisdom still applies to markets today. I have been studying his stuff for over 3 years and it helped me make a living out of trading (part time for now, but I can if I wanted).  


I think we are in ""Accumulation Phase"" where big money buying taking advantage of panic. This is how big money enters to markets. Willy Woo and other people posted on-chain analysis work to confirm this, but I'll only share one chart here trying not to use a lot of fluff and technical language. 

[These two blue lines are logarithmic channel starting from March 2020. We are bottomed there as of now. It can also be seen as a confirmation of bottoming.](https://preview.redd.it/ritnvr9vut671.png?width=1508&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7af7dea2a3780e17ef6f9334c4ff6b548effdab)

Selling Climax --&gt; Look how big is the volume. This is the top of the panic. People dumping like crazy because they are afraid. This is after Elon Musk &amp; China FUD.    


Automatic Reaction --&gt; This is the rally right after the selling climax. Most of the time, we expect price fluctuating in between those two lines. I use purple box for that.  


Secondary Test --&gt; Price forces to go down again, but look at how it settles \*above\* the selling climax. Suggesting a trading range (between two lines). See how volume is decreasing and everything is stabilizing.  


Spring --&gt; This is the second/hopefully last big attempt to the down with huge down pressure. This is continuation of China FUD. Look at the volume and effort for downwards. So it is a trick to make people who are stressed and can't take anymore. Usually after everybody sells this point, price tends to recover quickly.   


There are of course more to this analysis but I don't wanna clutter and confuse people further. Here is the accumulation schema

I‚Äôm fairly new to crypto and have been buying some BTC on BlockFi. Zero trading fees.

Plus you get 5% for staking and leaving your BTC on their exchange.

I don‚Äôt understand why everyone says not to keep your coins on an exchange and put them in a cold wallet.

I get the whole ‚Äúnot your keys not your coin‚Äù but I think that‚Äôs being a little paranoid.

It‚Äôs not like these bigger exchanges are some amateur sites with zero security and are going to get hacked. Some of them have, like binance, and have fully refunded their customers accounts that lost funds.

Good morning again ladies and  gentlemen and welcome back to my daily look into the king of crypto...  Bitcoin! Today I have the daily time frame pulled up after tumbling from  support. Things look pretty bearish considering. Now that we lost some  key support what is next for the King of Crypto? Can we reverse this  mess we're in? All that and more on this episode of trading with Tim...   


Okay  so the elephant in the room. That is the figure of speech I should use  today I imagine. We lost the slightly ascending support of the bear flag  (or channel) we have been in since May 19th. No surprise there. This is  a continuation pattern which is just a continuation of the previous  trend. We dropped, consolidated briefly. Faked out a few bulls.  Ultimately we dropped from the support. The writing was on the wall...

&amp;#x200B;

""Writing  was on the wall"" Tim you sure say that a lot... What does it mean?""  Well that means the resistance was so stacked that nobody in their right  mind would have expected the bulls to overcome the bears in this  situation. The bears had the advantage and will for the next few weeks I  imagine. At least until we can get these indicators to seperate. The 50  MA needs to move away from the 200 MA and the 100 EMA etc... All those  indicators are currently stacked right on top of each other and as a  result the confidence necessary to break through resistance that we are  experiencing is just not there.

In a few weeks  hopefully these indicators will no longer be directly on top of one  another. But that requires that the candles either drop significantly  from here or they go up. Either way that would make the 50 MA stray from  the 200 MA and the cloud. This would allow resistance to sort of  unstack itself so to speak. Does that mean bull run is back on? Not  necessarily. That is just the first step in turning this market around.

Now  that we lost the support of the bear flag where is the next support?  Well looks like we are about to test 30k. It has held since January  basically. But the more we test this support the more likely it is to  fail. So if 30k fails there is plenty of support below us but 25k is  among the more likely supports to hold its ground IMO. But 20k is  absolutely the strongest support below us at the moment. I know 20k is  something none of you want to hear but the writing is on the wall :)   


I  hope you can all enjoy the red candles. You can profit off the red  candles just like the green ones. You get USD on the way up (green  candles) and on the way down it's a great opportunity to increase your  Bitcoin. This will put you in great shape the next time we make a break  for 6 figures. ETH is at 1800, we are already testing 30k. It is likely  to fail IMO. So be prepared.

o4he7o,Wawwawowwa,Problems with dumping the contents of an old .dat wallet,"I have this old wallet.dat file, originally created in Bitcoin Core around 2015-2016. Now, I'm trying to move all my Bitcoins from this wallet into an Electrum wallet because I simply cannot get Bitcoin Core to sync and load my wallet without problems (I've tried on several different platforms with different errors and I've given up on this route for the time being).

Anyhow, my mission is to export all private keys containing unspent transactions so that I can sweep them into Electrum. The first thing I did was to make a wallet dump using [jackjack-jj/pywallet](https://github.com/jackjack-jj/pywallet). This gave me all the addresses starting with ""1"", some of them contained in the list of receive addresses in Bitcoin Core and some of them being change addresses. However, some receive addresses, starting with ""3"" were obviously missing from this dump.

So, I fired up a fresh install of Bitcoin Core and used the dumpwallet command to export all my keys. This gave me a lot of addresses beginning with ""3"", including the missing receive addresses from the pywallet dump. However, not all addresses beginning with ""1"" that I found using the pywallet dump showed up for this Bitcoin Core dump.

So,  what I'm left with are two non-identical subsets of keys, and I don't know if there are more that I haven't been able to retrieve. However, if I were to understand why the two programs gives me different outputs, maybe I would be more confident that I've located them all.

First of all, I don't know why I have a mix of addresses starting with ""1"" and addresses starting with ""3"". Without really knowing, it seems like my wallet is some kind of mix between a HD wallet (generating addresses starting with ""1""?) and an old wallet where each address is generated individually (addresses starting with ""1""?). Since my wallet is filled with keywords suggesting a HD wallet (for example derivation paths and master private keys), I guess this is the case. If so, I still don't understand why Bitcoin Core won't dump all of the keys that pywallet can find. At least pywallet feels more consistent, since I only get addresses starting with ""1"" (I guess support for addresses starting with ""3"" are lacking).

Further, there are two things I really don't understand. If I have a HD wallet, shouldn't I be able to generate an infinite addresses? I realize that Bitcoin Core can't print all of them since I don't have an infinite hard drive, but how is it decided which one will be shown? Some kind of internal track record of all my transactions? Also, when reading [the wiki page about addresses starting with ""3""](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash), it says ""To spend bitcoins sent via P2SH, the recipient must provide a script matching the script hash and data which makes the script evaluate to true."" Does this mean that the private key contained in my dump from Bitcoin Core won't be enough?

Sorry for this brain dump about my wallet dump, but I've been looking into this for months now. I would really appreciate any help.",1624230268,4,1

The  market's crashed and I tell my friend, who managed to garner the least  interest in crypto, that now's a great time to buy since coins are  pretty much cheap, and that he's going to regret it when it all  skyrockets.

Nevertheless his  confidence in it seems to have been shaken by the recent drop, and in  spite of roughly grasping the value of cryptocurrency as a game-changing  tech, he keeps pussyfooting, stating that there isn't enough factual  information that Bitcoin and the crypto market are truly going for a  massive rise some time soon.

Granted,  I'm really into crypto as a ""rational believer"", i.e. I have too much  logic-based faith in it (and equal disbelief in the current financial  system) not to invest in it and hodl. Therefore I must admit don't  really follow what's going on, save for the big changes ‚Äì as much as I  like crypto, my life doesn't revolve around it.

My friend on the other hand would need some concrete indicators that it's indeed going to get big soon. What would these be?

**The China Ban**

China has taken another step to ban Crypto-currency. About 65% of the world‚Äôs Bitcoin mining took place in China as of April 2020, according to an estimate by the University of Cambridge. One of the strongest critiques of Bitcoin has been a 51% attack (a bit complex, we will speak generally here) against the network. This involves controlling over half of the network and using that control to manipulate, steal, and fabricate Bitcoin. **This critique had extraordinarily little validity due to a lack of financial incentives to do so, but now it is completely removed as a possibility.**

**Financial Institutions Across China**

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Last month, China imposed new sanctions on financial institutions. ‚ÄúChina has banned financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions, and warned investors against speculative crypto trading.‚Äù - [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-financial-payment-bodies-barred-cryptocurrency-business-2021-05-18/)

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The institutions cannot advise towards registration, trading, clearing, and settlement, or any other facet involving the processing of Crypto, this means no Exchanges are allowed to operate. Inner Mongolia didn‚Äôt think these actions were enough, as reported on May 25th.

**Inner Mongolia**

‚ÄúThe Inner Mongolia Development and Reform Commission said in the proposed rules that telecommunications companies and internet firms which are engaged in crypto mining will see their business licenses revoked by regulators.‚Äù - [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-inner-mongolia-escalates-crackdown-cryptomining-2021-05-25/)

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If you provide telecommunications or internet to miners, they will take your business from you. ***Read that again.***

**PANews Report**

‚ÄúPANews reported on June 17, according to an insider who told PANews that the Sichuan Ya'an Energy Bureau and the Science and Technology Bureau held a meeting today and made a resolution to clean up and rectify Bitcoin mining companies in Ya‚Äôan. In addition, mine owners have been notified that due to the discussion of Bitcoin and other virtual currency mining at the meeting of the Ya'an Municipal Government in Sichuan on June 17, all power stations in the region will be shut down before 22:00 for self-examination, and the specific power-on time will end tomorrow. We will notify you later. According to news from the block rhythm, Sichuan Ya'an has implemented a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù policy for mines, and all mines must be shut down before the 25th, including electricity consumption and hydropower disposal.‚Äù ‚Äì [Release Here](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/1623943956574073.html)

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúOne size fits all‚Äù, this means electric, coal, hydropower, it‚Äôs all irrelevant. If it‚Äôs a mine, it‚Äôs getting shut down. Ya‚Äôan controls 10% of Bitcoin mining in Sichuan. They were demanding the closure of 26 suspected cryptocurrency mining projects by Sunday. As of today (Sunday, June 20th), the hash rate has fallen, and the mines are offline.

**Screen, Cleanup, and Terminate**

The Sichuan Provincial Development and Reform Commission and the Sichuan Energy Bureau issued a joint notice on Friday, ""screen, clean up and terminate‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe had hoped that Sichuan would be an exception during the clampdown as there is an electricity glut there in the rainy season. But Chinese regulators are now taking a uniform approach, which would overhaul and rein in the booming Bitcoin mining industry in China,"" Shentu Qingchun, CEO of Shenzhen-based blockchain company BankLedger

This hydropower generated from the rainy season will be wasted, it was actually more harmful to ban the mines here. The Global Times estimates 90% of China‚Äôs Bitcoin Network is estimated to be shut down, equal to one-third of total processing power.

Miners were told to shut down by June 25, which includes the consumption of electricity and the abandonment of using hydropower.¬†

**Eradication**

‚ÄúA Ya‚Äôan government official has told at least one Bitcoin miner that the city has promised to root out all Bitcoin and Ether mining operations with a year, said a person with knowledge of the situation.‚Äù - [Bloomburg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-18/hydro-rich-chinese-city-is-said-to-clamp-down-on-crypto-mining)

**In Closing**

Authoritarian regimes will always seek to undermine and manipulate any policy they can for their own benefit. Bitcoin mining was a profitable venture that appeared as no threat; therefore, China strove to be the center of mining, which it was achieving.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† China also has a deep understanding of technology, specifically Blockchain technology. With Nation-state adoption from El Salvador, those that are latching on to the Bitcoin Standard do so because they want non-inflationary (or programmed inflation), programmable money that cannot be manipulated or controlled by anyone. The boom of China‚Äôs hybrid Communist-Capitalism has largely been driven by their capacity to manipulate their currency and allow cheaper manufacturing to flow through their nation. Adopting the Bitcoin Standard is willfully giving up the most successful economic tool they have as a nation-state.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The exodus of miners fleeing China from the repressive regime will largely impact the growth of another nation-state that welcomes these refugees. This will create competition in order to drive miners from one country to another, resulting in greater decentralization, and show the flexibility of this network to adapt overnight, further strengthening the core of Bitcoin.

Just from growing up loving to play every type of strategy game devised, China is on a path to world domination, and they are realizing that Bitcoin is a factor they didn‚Äôt take into account for their 100 year plan to world control. 

Typically to ‚Äúwin the game‚Äù you first collect as much resources as possible. (World reliance on manufacturing) Then you start taking other‚Äôs resources from them. (Foreign investment in land and currency) Lastly when the rest can no longer afford to replenish their resources, it‚Äôs easy pickings to snap up more territory. (China is Currently flexing military power on the world stage) 

As I see what has happened over the last 30 years in Geo-politics. It‚Äôs pretty close to what China has been employing. 

Having a currency they are unable to manipulate, or control, available to the world. Puts a major thorn in the side of the plan to world domination.

For example the fiat dollar is, in my opinion, backed by the assets it can buy. That is houses, computers, tech, weapons, etc. Yes the government has control over the fiat dollar (can print fiat and manipulate interest rates etc.) Now if we change what the dollar is backed by to, let's say, gold or BTC. The government can still just print more money and inflate the economy in the same way, right? The value of the dollar would be diluted, just as it would be diluted in the current system. Or is the caveat here that the government wont be able to fluctuate the \*interest rates\*? Because the interest rates are bonds?

The sentiment from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank is that they will only back digital coins that are issued by other central banks. Nationalists that are interested in protecting the value of their currency as well as the banking elite will always attack bitcoin. We have seen that happen in Turkey. Turkey's lira is experiencing rapid inflation so many of investors have started to put their money in bitcoin for safe keeping. Unfortunately Turkey has banned all cryptocurrencies.

China's digital yuan has the capability of tracking people's spending habits, where they send their money and potentially where they live. When you look at the future of digital currency, it may be headed towards the CCP's goals. There will be absolutely no freedom with spending habits being traced.

o3xorq,simplelifestyle,China Bitcoin mining ending are awesome news,"Moneybadger don't give a fuck.

These are fantastic news for Bitcoin:

* Bitcoin mining gets more descentralized.
 
* Bitcoin mining gets more clean (renewable energy sources).
 
* Bitcoin miners in other countries become more profitable.
 
* Bitcoin miners all around the world get cheap mining rigs from China.
 
* Mining difficulty automatically adjusts as per protocol, neutralizing the effects of less (or more) mining rigs coming on/off line.
 
* This kills the FUD about: ‚ÄúChina controls Bitcoin!‚Äù (China will have no miners, no exchanges, no nothing to ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô)
 
* This kills the FUD about: ‚ÄúBitcoin uses dirty energy!‚Äù (Bitcoin mining uses mainly clean energy but in China part of the mining was being done with coal).
 
* This kills the recurrent FUD: ‚ÄúChina bans Bitcoin!‚Äù (there‚Äôs nothing left to ‚Äòban‚Äô for them in the future).",1624163846,76,5
o3xk4c,abalcs81,China's mining situation is so bullish,"I know plenty of newcomers in particular are scared right now but it's incredible that roughly half of bitcoin's mining hash comes from China, who in turn are banning it in basically every province, and because miners are location agnostic they can simply move to another country with cheap energy anywhere on Earth.  It's a:

* win for the decentralization of mining and fears that China controlled such a high % of it
* win for the US  as many Chinese miners are looking at places like Texas, Wyoming, Florida..etc.  It certainly won't all come to the US but many will.  Canada, too.
* win that **even  more** of bitcoin's mining will come from renewable energy sources as a result

Fundamentals are always the most important thing and these outcomes from this latest round of 'China bans bitcoin' news will put so many nagging pieces of FUD to rest in my opinion, finally.  The network is enduring yet another major ""attack"" and shrugging it off like the bulletproof beast that it is.  Block by mother fucking block.

Time always catches up with bearish price action.  Don't sweat it, just keep stacking sats while the gettin' is good and appreciate that bitcoin was meant to weather storms much worse than this even.

o3w4q3,jspri,Smartbit.com.au block explorer is closing down. Thank you!,"Hi All,

After about 6 years of operation the [smartbit](https://www.smartbit.com.au) Bitcoin block explorer will be shutting down on the 31st of July this year.

We have loved supporting the community with a free service and believe we've helped to promote and support #bitcoin. We're proud to have built a service which is being used by many well known Bitcoin services such as Bitgo/Mycelium/Brave browser and many more.

In addition to building one of the first Bitcoin only block explorers which has served many millions of page views, and an API that is currently getting millions a hit per day, I've also had the pleasure of personally responded to 100's of support emails from many new Bitcoin users about their transactions.

As per the message I put up on twitter [https://twitter.com/smartbithq/status/1406439048709742592](https://twitter.com/smartbithq/status/1406439048709742592) we would love new owners to continue running Smartbit and potentially take it to another level. If we don't find new owners by the 31st of July we'll need to turn off the [smartbit](https://www.smartbit.com.au) services.

We would appreciate upvoting and sharing/liking the tweet for exposure.

Thanks for taking the time to read the post!

o7a0tf,dtrmblog,Question to a bitcoin maximalist: How do you solve this?,"How does Bitcoin solve this? Especially since more than half of Bitcoin haven't been moved within a year. And the last update basically removed some of the ability to identify bitcoin stored for very long.

Are you aware that the adoption of bitcoin as a currency means that at some point (since a currency is generally used to transmit the information for some exchange of value) you are actually eligible to an equal amount of value to the amount of bitcoin you possess? 

Whatever inflation can happen with $ or ‚Ç¨ is nothing compared to when some of the whales starts to spend their bitcoin. Martin Shkrelis overpriced drugs are harmless compared to this leverage the bitcoin industry has.

I see bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency for that matter) dead in the water if it isn't correlated to any existing distribution of value of the whole market or some part of market. Bitcoin is to small right now to really see that effect but the moment some countries have adopted bitcoin as a currency you guys have to be very responsible spenders if you don't want to be responsible for an upcoming crisis! (I'm just guessing that almost none of you whales has any participation in any real world economic endeavor proportionally to the amount of bitcoin you possess.) Thus the more bitcoin is spread the more there will be resistance in adopting it.    

Discuss!

Has the above problem now been solved? If only partially solved, then what % are we talking about now, 50%, 80% or 20%? As I understand the Lightning Network has been implemented more than a year ago by now. Is Bitcoin transfer speed now competitive with Visa or we are still far away from that point?

I took 85%\^10 (15% inflation each year over 10 years) = .196 \* 406K \~ $80K worth of actual buying power on the $406K on paper. Is that right?

Whereas if I liquidate 100K today, pay 40% taxes and then buy roughly 2 BTC, if BTC grows 10% / year and I still do my 10K contribution, the value of my BTC will be \~ $330K with $330K of buying power.

Is that his argument for why storing value in currency (my 401K, which is similar to his treasury) is a terrible idea?

2) Bitcoin is more environmental friendly than the current currencies= more push for replacement.

3) The whole world is now working together to make environmental friendly narratives because it has showed that we negatively affect it as humans. 

4) China releases FUD to keep Wyckoff pattern in check. ""Reiterating the ban on BTC"". Shortly after deleting the comments. China realised that also Bitcoin would help their climate.

5) Bitcoin is going to break out I don't when but not too long in the distant future. I strongly believe that Elon made the tweet on the 25th of June because it was about to breakout from 35k which would be too early, invalidating the Wyckoff pattern.

o7irtj,ramst,Why can't a stable coin have unlimited supply?," There has always been a big discussion about Tether and their reserves, or lack of. This week, it all started again. Same thing.

I agree with the fact that they should be honest and let a 3rd party do a proper audit. If they promised that 1 USDT would backed by 1 USD then they have to be able to prove they have those USDs in their bank account. It should be clear. Period.

Now let's forget about Tether and let's focus on why do stable coins exist. What is the point of having a stable coin? The whole point is so that you can trade your crypto for it if you fear the market would crash. You can keep it in a stable coin without having to put it in your bank account.

What I care as a crypto trader is that the stable coin actually delivers on the promise of keeping it's value constant. That's all I care as a crypto trader. That the value stays the same. 1 stable coin equals 1 USD today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

The problem with Tether is that they laid about their promise of keeping a 1 on 1 reserve.

But what if they wouldn't have had this 1 on 1 pegged promise.

What if they would have said instead, from the bigining: we have created a stable coin, it's pegged 1 to 1 with the US dollar. We don't keep reserves of USD. Why? Because we don't need to. Our promise to you is that 1 USDT will always equal 1 USD. We achieve that by using an oracle that always matches the price of USDT to the price of USD. That's it.

We will also have an uncapped supply. Does that impact you as a holder of USDT? No, it doesn't. Remember that the price will always be 1 USDT = 1 USD

Would that work in practice?

I would love to hear your opinion on this.

He mentioned there will be two types of wallets... one for the people and one for companies.

Apparently the wallet also is compatible with other Bitcoin wallets... 

You will be able to pay taxes with BTC... except you won‚Äôt need to pay taxes for the BTC you hold.

o7ghkj,dmc0,At this point fuck Bitcoin (Let me explain),"At this point fuck Bitcoin. This perpetual sideways trading has opened my eyes to some things that I want to get off my chest. First, logical has left the building when it comes to trying to drawing a correlation between btc price and news. When El Salvador made btc legal tender (probably the biggest news in crypto history at this point) noting but crickets. Im realistic I didn't expect it to make a new all time high or even hit anywhere close to 60k but moving back to 45k and stating there at the very least would have made sense. Now Parguary has a bill to do the same. Still nothing.

Look at what happened to Nike stock price today after the earnings call. It doubled its earnings last quarter, and the stock price reacted accordingly by shooting up around 10% today. That makes sense. Thats healthy. I can understand that.

I think we need to starting coming to terms with the fact that Bitcoin is now out of the control of retail investors and is no longer following logic. Big money has taken over and they are clearly suppressing the price. I say its time the community comes together to find a smaller project that we can pump. Let's move on from btc and at the same time break this obnoxious connection between btc price and alt coin price. There is no reason anymore for every damn alt coin to dump when btc does.

BTC rallied for 3 days. However, the candlestick theory and indicators suggests that the odds could swing bearish again. 

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC - Daily](https://preview.redd.it/dxmyelvz7c771.png?width=2510&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=975b4ff67754e5f28cd1da4fa2a8668cf0ee1c5c)

**Candles Perspective**

There were three green candles over the last three days. The last two were very weak and were made on a falling volume. At the same time, the price failed to close above 8 EMA (just 15 point below!) and close above the last long red candle.   
There are likely two notable combos in play, a Three While Soldiers and a **Falling 3 Methods**. While the former is not well supported by indicators, the latter has **the higher odds** of completing. If it is so, expect a sizeable red candle today-tomorrow, possibly closing at a lower low.   
The perspectives for tomorrow:  
\- If the coin closes above $35.7k, a reversal would be confirmed.  
\- If a red candle closes at a new low, the downtrend could accelerate.

**Elliot Waves Perspective**

BTC completed a minimally acceptable formation of 5 waves down that I marked with Blue on the daily chart. 

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC - 1hr](https://preview.redd.it/6e10paz48c771.png?width=2493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c85c6a3f048bec6fba4fe0d196ff8ee94537068c)

On the hourly chart I placed a rectangle that I consider an inflection area. If BTC advances through the rectangle, I would expect it to continue the rally and complete wave B by approximately the end of August (blue count on the daily chart). 

If the coin choses to continue down (odds slightly favor this scenario), it could complete wave (C) in Green or Alt (A) in Blue (daily chart) in the next several weeks. The targets for this scenario remain unchanged:

1. (C) = 0.618 x (A): **$19975**.   
Note that this target is just a tad above the Long Term support of **$19870.6**. If this support breaks, $BTC could see a 4-digit prices in the nearest future. The long term waves/forecast will require a full recount if LT support breaks.
2. (C) = 0.786 x (A): **$14176**. 
3. (C) = 1.0 x (A): **$6789**. 

**Long Term Forecast:**  
Both Green and Blue scenarios have been on the long term chart for a while. It looks like this month a decision will be made.

I see a lot of people being way too rigid about admitting that Bitcoin isn't perfect.  


As /u/[**BrownBear521**](https://www.reddit.com/user/BrownBear521/) said in another thread, companies hoarding Bitcoin could potentially be a problem. Hoarding is a big problem when it comes to deflationary currencies. It can create a vicious circle called a deflationary spiral: Here we have a deflationary currency (Bitcoin) so people hoard it in order to get rich. They keep it for themselves without spending it, resulting in a lack of Bitcoin available in the market, which makes the price go higher faster. So people hoard it more and more. It makes Bitcoin a very good investment, for sure, but it doesn't make it a good currency for the economy, as it disadvantages the merchant and advantages the hoarder. Doesn't sound very anticapitalist to me.  
Unpopular opinion: We should find a way to redistribute the Bitcoin.  
A former trader named Anice Lajnef suggests a fork to create a melting currency out of the Bitcoin, which means there would be a negative rate on your savings. The Bitcoin, for investers, would stay. And the Melting Bitcoin could be adopted for a healthy and more egalitarian economy.

Also you can't buy a house, pay taxes, etc. You can pretty much only transact with the informal economy, the black market, and individuals who are willing to accept bitcoin (which would be a crime, in this scenario, and fairly trackable since everything is on a public ledger).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OekM65zPbc

Craig has continued to make the claim that bitcoins can be seized by court order of a government pressuring the miners. If the miners of that country obey the court order to not process the transaction from a censored address, could that actually prevent a transaction?

I believe he is claiming this because the majority of miners are in china, and these miners could blacklist a bitcoin address in theory. 

However, if this government attack were successful on that bitcoin address, couldn't all the other miners around the world choose not to connect to the chinese miners? The non-chinese miners could choose to blacklist the chinese miners to avoid censorship in the future, no?

And, couldn't the blacklisted bitcoin address simply sweep those coins to a new address, bypassing the miners, and changing addresses at the same time to avoid being censored?",1624424756,29,1

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the way I understand it is if there's a large amount of hash power removed from the network it will take a bit longer than ten minutes per block to mine each block. And the difficulty adjustment occurs after a certain number of blocks (which generally about two weeks).

Hypothetically if there were a super massive amount of hash power directed at the Bitcoin network to drive up the difficulty insanely high then just completely destroyed could it take down the Bitcoin network? I think the way I heard it was it could push the difficulty up so high that the legitimate miners would take a year to reach the next difficulty adjustment. I believe the concern was that a nation state would direct a massive amount of hash power at the network then remove it all at once.

Clearly this wasn't an issue during the difficulty adjustment back in May, but just curious what amount of hash power the network would have to lose for this to be a serious concern.

Also, if there's a gradually decreasing hash rate will that mean there would be fewer new coins created per hour because the blocks take longer than ten minutes?

(When he first came across Bitcoin) I thought it was very smart. But a lot of good ideas just vanish. Bitcoin just keeps growing and growing, not only in price.

Measuring Bitcoin against dollars kind of defeats the point of Bitcoin. 1 BTC = 1 BTC

At the beginning, I thought Bitcoin was beautiful and now I'm even more convinced about it since it has withstood the pressure of time and changes in global political landscapes, social media exploding... you have all these changes but Bitcoin has not only persisted but its impact keeps growing.

It is not just a very good idea anymore. At the beginning it was interesting. Now it's a reality.

Of course, classical economists don't like it. It's not that they don't understand but they don't want to understand it. It would mean all of their preconceptions, their theses, their works, their books would be meaningless because they were wrong.

This would be the largest reduction in hashrate in the history of Bitcoin network, and has the following implications:

&amp;#x200B;

* Transactions are currently more expensive/slower to confirm than usual.
* Other miners online will be proportionately more profitable, however the dip in price may offset this if they choose sell immediately [(although miners seem to be currently accumulating, signalling that they are profitable and are bullish on future price)](https://twitter.com/glassnodealerts/status/1405093573549232130)
* The price of bitcoin could be impacted in the short term, as there are [some who believe that hashrate is a leading indicator of price.](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/does-hash-rate-follow-price-or-does-price-follow-hash-rate)

On Wednesday morning (EST), Bitcoin‚Äôs overall hashrate has continued to drop and is now below the 100 exahash per second (EH/s) region. During the last 24 hours, people acquainted with Chinese miners have been describing the latest hardships bitcoin miners are facing.
Hashrate Migration Is ‚ÄòDestined to Be a Long Process‚Äô
Notices stemming from government officials in five Chinese provinces noted that bitcoin mining operations must cease immediately and this has caused a lot of anxiety among some bitcoiners in recent times. On Tuesday, June 22, Bitcoin.com News reported on the hashrate shifts and how mystery hashrate and stealth mining has started to increase following the crackdowns. Bitcoin.com News also explained last week how it is extremely difficult to pinpoint the exact quantity of hashrate that resides in mainland China.
The community can see that the hashrate is now below 100 EH/s and has lost between 15-25% since the Sichuan crackdown. Meanwhile, residents of the western hemisphere have been in the dark in regard to how much hashrate is actually in China, and where mining operations are relocating. However, the regional reporters at 8btc have described some of the events taking place in China, alongside Foundry Digital‚Äôs executive Kevin Zhang.
‚ÄúChinese miners are not familiar with the overseas environment, and moving overseas is destined to be a long process,‚Äù 8btc disclosed on Tuesday in a Twitter thread. 8btc‚Äôs thread stems from translated commentary from a miner dealing with the crackdown situation. ‚ÄúToday, a mining industry insider posted that Chinese miners actually tried to ‚Äòmove overseas‚Äô a few years ago, but it turned out that the overall domestic cost is still the lowest,‚Äù 8btc continued.
‚ÄúSpecifically, bare electricity in Canada and the U.S. is mostly at 0.3 cents, but construction + labor + operation and maintenance + taxation, and various environmental protection standards, have long cycles and high costs,‚Äù the regional report translated by 8btc details. ‚ÄúElectricity prices are cheap in the Far East, but miners are worried about the instability of the local situation. Georgia and Kazakhstan have electricity, but the process is sometimes the same as Vietnam and India.‚Äù
The translated account from China further says that the temperatures in Malaysia and Thailand are too high. Moreover in Africa and Iran, Chinese miners have seen advertisements to set up shop there, but no one knows ‚Äúwho actually went there.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt the same time, Fenghua International Express disclosed that it had airlifted a batch of bitcoin miners to Maryland, USA,‚Äù the thread further added. ‚ÄúIt is reported that this is only the ‚Äòvanguard‚Äô in the army of bitcoin miners that China has shut down, accounting for a very low proportion.‚Äù

8btc‚Äôs thread concluded by stressing: ‚ÄúLuckily, we now have passionate people like [Arman Batayev] from Astana Financial Innovation Centre and [Guy Deriq] from Uganda [who] can help Chinese miners move abroad. Would love to see more people like this coming out.‚Äù",1624473498,3,1

I have a majority in webull and Robinhood.
Both in red due to last 2 months.  Which I was fine with since I was holding long term anyways.

But frankly my plan was just till wait till it was green and start slowly selling so I can rebuy on the exchange and have in my wallet.   If btc is worth 80K.  Doesn't matter to me if have to ""rebuy"" over at coinbase at that rate. Since I'll just be transfer funds locations.


The hard part is with the current price point I would hate to sell. And then have it go up on me while I bring the cash over to rebuy in.   

Has anyone else faced this issue?   What's a good approach to reduce that lapse time.

The money I have to invest I have been putting into btc on coinbase pro.   But most of the money I have invested is on the other platforms... Which technically you don't own any actual crypto.

o8b4ho,EngineVast,El Salvador: Don't FUD and take stupid conclusions,"I just saw there is a ton of negative comments and FUD around the recent video of the president of Salvador talking about bitcoin. 

Please, first think, educate and then talk.

**1. He said instant transactions and no fees** 

Yes, he said that. He talks about the wallet (Chivo) they are ruling out at September. If you use their app (as salvatorian) you will get 0 fees and 0 waiting time.

**2. But it's not decentralized **

You are not forced to use their app, it's optional.

The benefits of using their app as Salvatorian:

* 30 usd in btc free
* instant exchange between usd and btc
* no transaction fees
* instant transaction 

Cons

* need to kyc
* centralized

Obviously they need to kyc people that want to exchange btc to usd throught their app. Nobody wants a drug dealer or a child abuser to change money in their app.

You can freely use any wallet you prefer, nor mandatory to use their app. Take it as a bank. They offer their bank (Chivo) with lot of benefits and some cons, but you can also have your preferred bank (coinbase...) or have your btc in your pocket (hardware wallet, cold wallet...).


El Salvador is doing a great thing for Bitcoin. Obviously isn't a perfect way, but they can't (and don't want) just educate and promote the masses to use their own hardware wallet or cold wallet, or decentralized, because of:

* too complicated 
* they would aim people to go out of their radar 

If you build a business, you want to somehow have a control of your employers (so they can't steal your money), the same applies to the countries.

I've got an issue with an Electrum wallet &amp; with its transaction: 

¬†¬†¬† ‚Ä¢ In September 2019 I have transfered coins from an¬†¬† ¬†Electrum wallet on Windows OS to an Electrum wallet on Tails OS¬†¬† ¬†and the coins got stucked on that BTC address &amp; I can't get it back - I assume that address was created in different derivation path¬†¬† ¬†transaction ID:¬†https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/3eddcdcf82569329f2a110bda01e8dd889afd6df2501638f79fb92a5631e5c6a¬†¬† ¬†(2nd address in the screenshot) *Fiat currecny is at the time of transaction 

¬†¬†¬† ‚Ä¢ Had created a post on bitcointalk.org (in Spt. 2019) &amp; June 2021 regarding that problem, after some inept tries through the suggestions I've¬†¬† ¬†got, I failed &amp; leted it go.¬†¬† ¬†here is the link, in case it helps ahead:¬†https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5187469.0¬†¬† ¬† 

¬†¬†¬† ‚Ä¢ One possible scenario is¬† ""file corruption bug""¬† of Electrum wallet¬†¬†¬† -¬†¬†¬† described¬†¬†¬† on bitcointalk.org


¬†¬†¬† ‚Ä¢ You can check out my new post on bitcointalk.org¬† - the whole issue is described there more detailed :¬† 
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5345262.msg57291953#msg57291953



Now, I don't quite remember how &amp; what happend but here is the thing: 

¬†1. I've created an Electrum wallet on Windows &amp; Tails OS (will refer to it as E_Wind &amp; E_Tails)¬† 

2. Did a test transaction of BTC 0.000112 from E_Wind onto E_Tails - I could see the transaction straight away in Tails wallet. Was remarkably for a quite a long time displayed as ""unconfirmed"" &amp; later on as ""not verified"" though, but I could see it at least in the wallet.¬†¬† ¬†transaction ID:¬†https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/888f769c2d2585d1d6f0070f11d5820c249aa895fab983ce3eda7e1a667e7308¬†¬† ¬†(1st address in the screenshot) 

3. Then I did the bigger transaction &amp; that transaction I couldn't see ever since. 

¬†4. Turned out that the E_Tails was outdated but I was unaware of that, &amp; so I tried different options to do something about, like followed the guide lines on tails website:¬†¬† ¬†to delete the wallet and recover it again 

5. So I did it. Deleted &amp; recovered again - didn't work. 

6. I couldn't see the transaction because I couldn't connect to the servers because it was outdated.¬†Which means I created E_Tails offline 

7. Then I understood that E_Tails is outdated on Tails OS and so I updated it to V. 3.3.8And here is where the SH!T starts boiling



8. Since I've created it offline on outdated version &amp; followingly deleted, as suggested in the guide lines - now that wallet was ""gone""! 

¬†9. As the E_Tails was now up-to-date, I wanted to recover that wallet¬†¬† ¬† Typed in the same mnemonic phrase, as before (when I tried to fix it myself without the guide lines) &amp; now all of a sudden I get a¬†¬† ¬† different wallet with different addresses. 

10. Ever since I type in the seed I always get this ""newer"" wallet and never the 1st one with the funds!



Here is what I assume: 

¬†¬†¬† The seed has generated in first place a wallet with a different derivation path. The seed has¬†generated the wallet while I was offline in Electrum manager - seems like that it was generated as a cold wallet/hardware wallet. 

Here is why I assume:
¬†¬†¬† As I type in the same seed in Elcertum wallet &amp; check the BIP39 box &amp; following type the derivation path m/44'/0'/0', I get different addresses that I have used, after I updated the E_Tails (I see transactions on this addresses), opposed to if I just type in the seed without derivation path (there I see only 1 transaction on 1 address). 

Here is the catch:
¬†¬†¬† If I check the BIP39 box and type in any derivation path (I tried planty of them) then Elcetrum¬†¬† ¬†tells me ""checksum failed"" &amp; once I go ahead and am already in the wallet: go wallet &gt; seed¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†I can't display the seed.¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Where as if I just type in the seed without derivation path, I am able displaying the seed.



The point is - I need the correct derivation path - at least it is what I assume.
¬†¬†¬† Q: How to get the correct derivation path for the 2 addresses where the funds are at? 

I tried iancoleman.io, the modified tool for Electrum wallet. (not the original iancoleman.io) 
¬†¬†¬† I'm able of getting out the initial wallet with its addresses¬†¬† -¬†¬† but I need the one with different derivation path¬†¬† -¬† and this I am not able to find in that tool 

There was another good website bitcoinfunction.com Somehow is not around anymore.
¬†¬†¬† Q: Does anyone know websites alike?
¬†¬†¬† Q: Could seedrecovery.py work, does it recover derivation paths? - It helps recovering the seed, but I know my seed, I don't need to recover it, right.


I have the right seed, I just need right derivation path or the right account 


To make something clear:¬†the seed is absoulute correct¬†beacause I've used the same one to recover the ""lost"" wallet ----before I did the update---- and I did recover! 

Here you can see the screenshot with the addresses of the ""lost""wallet.
https://anonfiles.com/vdA86d26u4/ElectrumWallet_Tails_BTC_addresses_jpg 

That is the address I need to recover &amp; where the funds are at: 1LP6LQ726YJR9wkPLnHWJEfH335DDuiNtL (in screenshot second from the top) 

Shall my assumption be incorrect, you're very welcome telling me what you think but be reasonable - stuff like wrong seed &amp; etc. is out of question!

Hope you find it interesting and a nice addition to your own confirmation bias as to why Bitcoin is and will be lifechanging. Also, thank you for reading.

# First, a couple of caviats;

\- I am not a Bitcoin OG. I didn't know about it in 2013. I hated it in 2017. I FOMOed in 2018. I was surprised in 2020. And I love and understand it in 2021.

\- I am not a financial advisor, and I am speaking on behalf of the company I own which employs just south of 20 people.

\- We don't have a massive treasury and are inexperienced as a company investing in assets and other instruments

\- English is not my mother tongue, so bear with me.

\- Fuck you Elon.

&amp;#x200B;

In this piece I'll do my best and explain from a small corporate perspective why accumulating Bitcoin became part of the corporate strategy and unanimously accepted by the general assembly.

# First, some background to who we are as a company

I founded the marketing agency back in 2017 and we quickly hired alot of people and attracted great clients. Our work is a combination of video production, copywriting, graphic design, web, podcast and everything social media. Basically, we are a marketing department that our clients ""subscribe"" to for 12 months with certain limitations for a fixed price. Our projected revenue 2021 EOY is about 2,5M USD.

We are known for being provacative, experimental and the ""go-to-place"" for small B2B companies to jumpstart their marketing game.

Again, our business model is not very scalable. It's human trafficking (it's a joke!!!) - we need one guy or gal to do some work, and that work can only be done so many times in a day. If we want to do more of that work, we need to hire a new guy or gal and so on. And if you don't have BCG or McKinsey in your logo - the ability to scale on premium price is very difficult as well. The avarage profit margin in Norway in our industry is about 3-4%. Eeeew. The ""only"" way to make big buck with this kind of business model is either scale massively on people, price or both. The cost that makes up about 85% of the total, is rent for office space and labour cost, so it requires alot to make that happen. It's very risky to scale an agency business with people if you don't have alot of cash on hand - which we don't have.

We've been in business like I said since 2017 and so far we have not made a meaningful profit yet. We have OK salaries, but that's it. We are smart, creative and driven people - so the salary, even though it is OK, it is not extremely good. And we do want to create a company that can pay out significant dividends to make up for the struggle of building, running and owning a company. With current model, that seems to be a stretch medium-term.

# The Pandemic Gave Perspective On Things

Like most other places, within a week from March 9th to March 12th of 2020, the semantics went from ""yeye, I don't care"", to; ""OMFG"". It literally turned most of our business upside down and was a really chaotic experience. The unthinkable paradox happened; everyone wanted to sell something, but none wanted to buy anything. Except fucking toilet paper.

Marketing, and especially external marketing consultants, is not business critical to everyone, maybe even anyone, during a world crisis. And obviously we faced a lot of pushback from our clients. So we are grateful that most stayed with us, but some left. Leaving our business extremely volnurable as we don't have the liquidity to simply shut down.

A few months in during the pandemic, my partner told me: ""Dude, Bitcoin just hit 30k"". We had been speculating somewhat back in 2017 and found crypto to be somewhat interesting, but at the same time a piece of shit idea. And I remember thinking to myself that we were going to see another meltdown like never before with crypto. But, then I started reading about it. I read about Michael Saylor, Tesla's purchase, banks recruiting experts, ETF's trying to be accepted, Queen Cathie Woods, white papers, Cointelegraph, Bitcoin Magazine and so on. Not only that, but our very own Kjell Inge R√∏kke (one of Norway's wealthiest) just put 60 million dollars in it and started a crypto company. 

I am not the smartest guy in the crypto room, but these guys are - and now I was on my journey of juggling a struggling company during the pandemic, firing bad people and also putting in the first 1000 hours of understanding Bitcoin, the money system and how this will be adopted as a revolutionary technology 5-10 years from now. 

And then I realized...

# Why Bitcoin Is Not A Risky Bet (for us)

I've done several bad hires - actually a couple to many because of my own naivity. During the worst period of corona last year we knew that we had 4 bad hires in our organization. That is pretty significant as we were only 15 employees at the time.

This might be a controversial line, but hiring **bad** people is a zero-sum game in which the employee is the winner and the employer is the loser. A bad hire is the true Rat Poison Squared as the faggot would say.

Now, most of you I assume live in the US and I live in Norway. Two completely different hiring/firing laws. In Norway, you simply can't fire someone ""just because"". Making the bad hire outcome even worse, since the process of firing someone that don't create any value for the company is a tedious process - time consuming, energy draining, lawyer fees and always a ""settlement package"" including minimum 3 months of salary. I know of entrepreneur peers that simply went bankrupt because of a few bad hires early on that just dragged the process so long that the company didn't have any liquidity left. And yes, I agree that the employer has a responsibility of not making those mistakes. But, come on bro. 

The point I'm trying to make here is that if you have made a bad hire; it is like watching your stock go from whatever price to 0. It literally is a 100% loss. And the chances of getting even the slightest amount of value from a bad hire is also near 0%. Bad hire bad. Good hire good. 

So I thought to myself at first in winter 2021. What if we trim our agency to become a truly premium business, work on upskilling people, and invest in what we already have and add a few seniors to our team, and then re-invest the hypotethically cost of bad hires in Bitcoin? Either we double in size and go from about 20 people to 40 and making 5M revenue with 10% margin and along the way waste a shit ton of money on bad hires. Because, trust me, bad hires comes with volume in recruiting. There is no way past it. 

Or we invest and accumulate Bitcoin and dream about a 10x return within the next 4-5 years with alot less company risk, governance, stress and hazzle. I liked the latter idea so much that I wanted to pursue it as a core strategy for our company and change my role from being just a ""CEO"" to Master of Coin. A fun ego boost as well. 

I needed to convince the group of equity partners and also the small board we have. And I'd like to share with you guys how I did it.

o94ed4,thorosaurus,Am I 100% doing this Coldcard thing right?,"Upon receiving it, I updated and verified the firmware, and it has been 100% airgapped ever since. I use a 9v battery to power it, have not plugged it into a computer, and it hasn't had an SD card since the firmware update.

It's for long term storage and is to remain 100% airgapped. Bitcoin goes in and doesn't come back out again until time to buy moon lambo.

After updating the firmware, I generated test wallets by throwing dice, and verified them using the python script from their website. After being confident that it was faithfully encrypting the dice throws, I generated my actual seed, which I of course didn't verify, but backed up by engraving the 24 word seed on stainless steel.

I then sent a thousand in BTC to the first address listed in the address explorer on the device, after which I wiped the seed and restored it using the backup I had engraved, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes recording it. The restored wallet showed the same receive addresses in the address explorer.

I'm now sending small amounts to subsequent addresses in the address explorer, in order.

The only thing I haven't done is test sending BTC out of the wallet, since that would require breaking my airgap. Which leads to my main question.

Are there any possible mistakes, errors in firmware, etc. at this point that could still mean losing the BTC I send to this wallet? Or am I 100% good to go and have nothing to worry about?",1624823950,31,1

find proper arguments against bitcoin on this reddit. I see manly
negative news articles about some regulation and other news that seem
bad for btc. But no fundamental discussion. What I found so far are these:

1) Price is to volatile, or It has no guaranteed value and it's a bubble
2) It's not accepted yet and you can't pay in most shops
3) It faces harsh drawbacks from government/the people who do not want
to give away their power of printing money, so they will somehow stop it.

4) There are thousands of coins out there = inflation. I deem that not
to be true since every POW system that has a smaller hashrate that
bitcoin is theoretically ""hackable"" by the hashingpower provided by the
btc miners, plus compare the hashing power to any other network or
supercomputer in the world, do the math yourself, it's not that hard)


I myself find some aspects not good, like that it will - if it succeeds - change or party crash the economy. Like there is not so much incentive to spend the money or btc now when (in btc terms) there is almost no Inflation. (Which in my opinion would make a positive impact on the enviroment since people won't waste their money on useless and short-lived products)
The environmental standpoint of course, but all the energy goes directly into the cryptographic security and the immutability btc offers (not security in terms of $ - that's just determined by supply and demand) so it makes it more resilient to being hacked wich ich almost impossible.
It's just like an unbiased accounting system in my eyes. Though you have to compare it to the traditional banking system with all those buildings and ATMs running around the clock and whatever else the banking system needs.

I would love to hear some constructive criticism, for me personally it seems like a system that will (at what price however, probably going up) continue to exist.",1624821829,18,1

That same house is now $1.8 million after property values in that area skyrocketed. During the early 80s, the minimum wage in San Francisco was $2.50. I've also noticed that the cars in my area are very expensive, new vehicles are now priced at 27,000-39,000. These are new Kias, Hondas and Toyotas in San Francisco dealerships. Five years ago, prices for these same vehicles ranged from 18,000 to 26,000. 

The US dollar annual inflation rate is now 5%. I know that the US dollar is still better than other countries but the cost of living has risen and the wages haven't climbed very much. With bitcoin, I see my dollar's worth appreciating. I trust in bitcoin, despite its market volatility, its overall value seems to be climbing every year.

We launched a web app for the Bitcoin Lightning Network community about 24 hours ago. The news received [many retweets](https://twitter.com/BTC_LN/status/1408787662207557637) and likes on Twitter, and lots of positive feedback [on the LN subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lightningnetwork/comments/o8bqjw/join_a_ring_of_fire_for_incoming_liquidity_on/). I was encouraged to post the site here as well:

[https://lightningnetwork.plus](https://lightningnetwork.plus/)

The web app allows lightning network node operators organize liquidity swaps (aka rings of fire). The main benefit is that for every channel you open, you also receive an incoming channel, thus you double your node's capacity and you allow yourself outgoing and incoming capacity at once.

The idea is not new. Node operators have been organizing these swaps for quite a while on forums and on telegram. This web app just makes it easier to do it. It holds your hand throughout the process so even new node operators can benefit from the concept.

The next step is the most interesting. We will have an API to this LN+ engine and database, and thus wallets can plug into it. From a user's perspective this will mean they can click a button, provide a capacity and they will automatically be matched to a triangle, the outgoing and incoming channels will be open automatically as well. In result they will have both incoming and outgoing capacity at once. This would make using LN easier, and will also decentralize and strengthen the network further. LN nodes will be organized into mega structures of multiple triangles. A mesh rather than a spokes and wheel topology.",1624814604,16,1

From that point until now, we can see possibly a finished ABC to the upside making the blue wave (A), and developing maybe a 5-3-5 wave structure down to blue (B) wave.

What can we expect?

If this last movement, in effect, is an ABC, we could see a 3 waves down, and then 3 or 5 waves up to complete a higher degree ABC (blue ABC) up, and then, a 3-3-5 movement down (more time consuming) or hopefully, an impulsive 5 wave structure down to finish the wave 4 of 3 of 3.

This is not a financial advice. This is just my thoughts on the Elliott Waves Theory. Im not Elliott, I could be wrong. Please let me know what you see on the charts! :)

[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54261382](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54261382)

Chinas  DCEP is very different to Bitcoin. DCEP is controlled by the Chinese  Central Bank and gives the Chinese government huge data access to  everyones transactions and unprecedented control over the monetary  system.

China has openly stated it objects to  the USD$ SWIFT &amp; CHIPS global banking system hegemony which enables  the USA to have considerable power by placing banking sanctions on  nations or entities the US does not approve of. Therefore China has  stated DCEP is intended to enable an alternative means of payment  outside of the USD$ SWIFT &amp; CHIPS hegemony...and DCEP may  well  enable this...if it does the USA potentially loses huge strategic and  economic power. The USA today and for the last 50 years has not enjoyed  trade surpluses but has financed chronic trade deficits via the  seigniorage it enjoys as the creator of the global reserve currency.  USAs massive debt pile approaching $30 trillion is only viable as long as the  USA continues to gain seigniorage via its reserve currency issuance.

If  China, which expects to become the largest economy on the planet within  the next 10 years requires trading partners to settle imports and  exports via the much more efficient DCEP system rather than the US$ who  could object? If this happens the USA is bankrupt.

At the  same time Bitcoin is now established as an alternative to both the US$  and DCEP. Bitcoin stands outside of any direct nation state or private  entities monitoring, control or debasement.

Bitcoin treats all people equally without fear or favour.

Bitcoin alone provides an alternative to Chinas Autocracy and the USAs fiat debt slavery.

I won‚Äôt be able to go much above 0.1 of a coin (if at all) but if bitcoin become widely accepted do you think this is enough for the average person?

My plan is to get 0.1 of a coin by 2022 and then hold this amount for the future and then move my spare investment money that I would spend buying Bitcoin to the next investment (get a mortgage - no more spare cash to get Bitcoin) Would 0.1 of a coin be enough as a baseline to own for the future etc?

I have a few reservations with Bitcoin, particularly the fees that exchanges charge etc. It seems like there is a push to make Bitcoin 1 world currency, and people seem to want it to be controlled via exchanges who charge? 

It‚Äôs seems like it‚Äôs almost a perfect way to implement a 1 world currency with the exchanges holding all the coins and charging us to use it (which sounds eerily like our current banking system) only now digital and easily removed / banned / locked out etc. We have huge companies and whales owning thousands of coins therefore equality is not something that can be achievable via Bitcoin, we will have extreme wealth and those without (poor) it seems to me that Bitcoin is a great concept but the people are corrupting it via hoarding, creating exchanges (central bank) that charges your for its use (eventually they will own vast amounts via charges) for others to get coin they will need to ‚Äúloan‚Äù coon from a whale or an exchange and possibly pay back interest?

It seems like ‚Äúwe the people‚Äù are pushing Bitcoin into a very similar corner as our current financial system and billionaires, exchanges, those without etc which does (rightly or wrongly) set alarm bells ringing in my head.

Reading posts of people saying ‚Äúthose who don‚Äôt invest can suffer‚Äù, ‚Äúboomers can be left out on the cold‚Äù does not lead me to think this is what/how/why Bitcoin was created. I initially thought it was that everyone would get Bitcoin and we would create an equality where it would be traded for services and skills etc. 

Now it seems people are trading it, using it for gains in fiat, mocking others who arnt invested and has a lot of toxicity and hostility in the area a.

it seems like bitcoin has been games and corrupted and it‚Äôs vision distorted by greed, people trying to buy it all to get rich? That was never the point of the intent of Bitcoin, in fact it was the entire polar opposite! It was about financial freedom and equality but it seems greed has infected it.

The untitled piece, painted in 1984 and celebrating the start of the digital era with the depiction of a computer, has an estimated value of 3.9 million pounds - 4.5 million pounds ($5.42 million - $6.25 million).

The auction house said buyers could make the full payment - the hammer price and full premium - using ether or bitcoin.

This is a spreadsheet that I have developed for myself gradually over a few years. I have found it very helpful for keeping track of my crypto holdings (good for tax purposes). No need to trust third party apps to keep your personal information - track it yourself.

There is a lot in here;

Automatically updates prices from coingecko. The top 1000 coins included. Just select which ones you want to track by typing in the ticker symbol.

You can choose your local Fiat currency and get live conversion rates for any fiat currency.

I don't record details of every trade. Just keep track of your crypto purchases (from fiat) and what coins you currently hold. The spreadsheet will calculate the rest and keep a record of how your portfolio and holdings have changed over time (it logs this data every time you save the sheet)

Fantastic instability influencing numerous digital currencies, with a market capitalization that lost a fourth of its complete worth in June 2021 alone. Turns with numerous causes and results that are not just the shortcoming of Elon Musk. Causes fundamentally from China and the United States Several variables may clarify why Bitcoin, which addresses 47% of the worldwide crypto capitalization, has quite recently fallen essentially beneath the $ 30,000 edge, just to fall back to values ‚Äã‚Äãequivalent to those of January 2021 . One of them, the most genuine, comes from China. Beijing has essentially expanded the tone against crypto mining in its region in June 2021. The conventional restriction on crypto-mining in the two principle delivering regions, Xinjiang and Sichuan, presently stretched out to the entire nation, is a horrible hit to Bitcoin, which is 80% sabotaged in the Middle Kingdom. Restless, in addition to other things, to accelerate the execution of its ecological strategy, to accomplish carbon impartiality in 2060, Xi Jinping's administration isn't tarrying. Another significant reason is essentially the unpredictability of Bitcoin, which is vital as a rule and especially highlighted for the current year by Elon Musk's tweets. The last mentioned, from the United States, figured out how to consistently increment or decline the worth of Bitcoin with a basic tweet on the informal community. Profiting with the absence of guidelines of cryptos, Musk's comments, generally talking in the interest of Tesla, have at times made the cost of Bitcoin vary by 10% fifty-fifty per day. At long last, it's anything but a validity issue that impacts the cost of Bitcoin. The reception of this crypto as cash having legitimate delicate similarly as the American dollar in El Salvador doesn't pass for the World Bank and doesn't go for the increment of its worth. Moreover, as indicated by Les Echos referring to a Bank of America-Merrill Lynch study, 81% of resource directors studied in June 2021 ($ 667 billion in market capitalization gathered) consider that Bitcoin is today a monetary air pocket. . What to place lead in the wing of the crypto. Outcomes everywhere in the world The new choice of China, corresponded with the fall in the cost of Bitcoin, strikes over every one of the diggers, predominantly Chinese, who can presently don't take part in the innovative action of Bitcoin, just as another crypto. On the negative side, many positions will vanish following the conclusion of organizations spend significant time in mining. 172 000 exchanging accounts on particular stages have effectively shut since last Sunday. Another adverse consequence concerns people depending on Bitcoin exchanging to make a decent living, since the value, which tumbled to $ 26,400 on Monday, June 21, is the greater part however high as it seemed to be two months prior. Enough to create numerous frenzy deals among those generally subject to pressure, a response that won't stop the overall fall in the cost of Bitcoin, an incredible opposite. From a positive perspective, in any case, Bitcoin, which utilizes more energy, ought to decrease its carbon sway for some time. This could likewise energize considering mining that utilizes less power, conceivably through energy created more practically than as of now. the fall in the cost of Bitcoin could well progress forward a bigger scope, the developing vulnerability encompassing the fate of a crypto like Bitcoin, forthcoming answers for its mining, come off on all digital currencies. This prompts an expansion in instability, which indeed expands vulnerability about them. There is by all accounts a genuine doubt of computerized monetary forms and the ten world debuts have seen their costs fall by 18 to 25% in June alone. What's more, the dip under the mental limit of $ 30,000 for Bitcoin, notwithstanding the most recent measures from the Chinese government, implies that the fall in its cost may not stop there. Novices and experts the same should have solid backs‚Ä¶ Especially since Elon Musk has not tweeted for a couple of days on crypto. Until when?",1624937588,6,1

We can use blockchains for financial transactions without using cryptocurrency. Also, Nakamoto's paper strongly suggests that the advantages of using crypto were intended for merchants and not for payers. The first paragraph of the body of his paper is devoted to how ""reversible"" financial transactions (i.e., credit card disputes, as he defines the term) are costly for merchants. The paper does not open with any mention of concerns over anonymity. 

2) Nakamoto also proposed transaction fees to offset the costs of the  tremendous CPU time and energy required for the blockchain. So, reversible transactions are too costly...but the energy consumed by cryptocurrencies annually is more than some countries like Italy consume in a year...and is expected to grow. And, it's going to be offset by...FEES? How is this a good idea or a good alternative to traditional banking? The crypto exchanges already charge a lot of transactional and other fees.

I am pissed because I have a strong opinion on favour of Bitcoin. And... I'm really not a person of strong opinions. I dislike having strong opinions. I had learned earlier in life that if you have a strong opinion on something, you are already losing. There must be something you did not understand yet.

Yet, I am pissed, because I want to find good and convincing contrarian views on Bitcoin. I have the feeling that all of the economists writing against Bitcoin are weak and mostly doing it just out of the blue: none really give signs of understanding the protocol. Arguments such ""naturally formed ponzi"", ""tulip mania v2.0"", ""deflationary=bad"", ""infinte value? = scam"" and other analogies tend to be incomplete and always lack data or evidence. It just does not make the cut for me that you are a Nobel prize if your text does not show you to have invested the minimum time to understand the protocol.  


Krugman, Roubini, the crazy dude on r/CryptoReality, they only have partially sensible arguments. And I am really pissed, I need to be convinced it is better to be in the middle ground, I want go to the next page in my life. Aren't there better thinkers? C'mon there must be provable facts against Bitcoin's monetization, right? Does anyone has really excellent contrarian texts?  I need to become a regular human again and stop thinking 24/7 about this unstopabble force.

I am really pissed.",1624991989,263,1

oae6i8,somewheres,Teach a man to fish... Educating the less fortunate.,"Hello fellow bitcoin holders. As many of you know El Salvador will, as of September 7th, provide an app that will allow its citizens to use bitcoin as legal tender. Having lived there until I was 10 and I've kept up to date on the general situation in the country (I would love to retire there) The news was a positive and welcoming message, if nothing comes from this at least it was a nice PR and a lot of people heard something, for once, not related to violence in El Salvador. Back in 2001 when El Salvador made the US dollar it's main currency many people lost money due to people taking advantage of the situation and lack of education. Many people traded their hard earned money for fake money, since some of them didn't know what the US dollar looked like. Fast forward to today and my only fear about making bitcoin legal tender is a repeat of what happened in 2001. My idea: create a small blog/website with information on what it is, and how it works. People are afraid of what they don't know. This would be free there would be no fees or information taken from anyone it would be strictly to educate. Focus on the types of scams out there and how to keep your digital wallet safe. I'm here asking for your opinion, resources of information, help if you wish. I want people to embrace it and maybe feel safer knowing what it is they are getting. Any feedback would be appreciated.",1624991234,3,1

**Mpex founder and Bitcoin evangelist Mircea Popescu reportedly submerged off the coast of Central American country, adding to the mystery encompassing the person, his reputed bitcoin fortune, and what it'd mean for the longer term of the network.**

**Father of ‚ÄúBitcoin Toxicity‚Äù round-faced No Shortage of difference**

**Just like the onymous Satoshi Nakamoto sparked an exciting search for the verity identity of the person or persons behind Bitcoin, the network has reportedly lost one among its most enigmatic and polarizing figures of the last decade.**

**Mircea Popescu, a Romanian national and noted Bitcoin maximalist WHO secure to dump over a million bitcoins if block sizes were adjusted, purportedly submerged off the coast of Central American country on Gregorian calendar month twenty third. Confirmation of his passing has been scant, with retailers originally coverage that a Polish national had submerged.**

**A relatively mysterious figure at intervals in the community, very little is thought regarding Popescu except for his blogging on Trilema, support for security-focused ASCII text file comes, and dedication to keeping the Bitcoin network unchanged despite imply larger block sizes.**

**After blogging on cryptocurrency in its early years, he supported bitcoin exchange Mpex in 2012, which later became the target of a United States of America Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation. Satoshi DICE, a preferred gambling website that solely accepted bitcoin, was listed on Romanian-based Mpex by Eric Voorhees.**

**Eventually, the listing became an area of the SEC investigation when the regulator approved the giving. Voorhees was later punished and made to shop for back the shares that were listed. Popescu was far-famed for angling the SEC throughout the case, going to date on post his correspondence with the social control team in his Trilema journal. His eccentricity was on full show as he was taken off to dismantle the SEC‚Äôs requests and lay vacant the holes in their arguments for data regarding Mpex and consumer activities.**

**Despite the limited illustrious regarding his personal and skilled endeavours, Popescu‚Äôs commitment to ASCII text file systems is acknowledged. when the ASCII text file package Open BSD, which has been around since the Nineties, saw funding problems, Popescu gave $20,000 in 2014 to stay the non-profit foundation behind the code running. Given the security-centric approach of the OS and Popescu‚Äôs leanings, Mpex extensively utilized the technology in its platform.**

**Mired indifference for years, Popescu left behind several quotes and sayings, a number of that painted a reasonably negative image of the person himself. Yet, none of his antics was taken thus seriously as his promise to dump 1,000,000 bitcoins within the market if changes were created to Bitcoin block sizes (this reportedly occurred in 2016), earning him the appellation ‚ÄúFather of Bitcoin Toxicity.‚Äù Eventually, Segwit2x, Associate in a Nursing initiative designed to double the block size to 2MB, was abandoned and cemented the network‚Äôs use of the 1MB block size.**

**Despite ne'er being confirmed, it had been inferred that Popescu did command management over that immense swathe of 1,000,000 bitcoin, which, if true, created him doubtless the sole bitcoin wealthy person (owner of over a million coins). However, this figure was ne'er confirmed. It did produce issues in lightweight of his alleged death, though, that a million bitcoins may hit the market and cause costs to careen lower.**

**For now, the case remains shrouded in mystery amid the shortage of formal confirmation of his passing.**

Strike is not an wallet. It is marketing itself as an app. Think of it as a dealer who has its all LN node and an account one exchanges. Here is what it does:

+ It dominate the funds in USD to protect its user from volatility  
+ When a user fund their account with an onchain tx, consider it as a sell off on exchange. The user will have the fund as USD on their Strike app.
+ Strike users can make payments on LN for no fee as Strike already operate a LN node
+ Strike users can make onchain tx but it will be subjected to tx fees ( just like you do btc withdrawal from an exchange)

Currently, Bitcoin's smallest unit of account is 1/100,000,000th or 0.00000001, also known as 1 satoshi. For those of you that aren't aware, this parameter is set in [src/amount.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/amount.h), line 14,

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000;

If we wanted to change the smallest unit of account, then all we'd have to do is change this parameter, COIN, as follows...

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000000; // for a change to millisats

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000000000; // for a change to microsats

static const CAmount COIN = 100000000000000000; // for a change to nanosats

I'm not exactly sure how updating this parameter might affect other parts of Bitcoin's source code, but this is outside the scope of this post and I'll leave that discussion to the experts (or maybe I'll tackle it in the future once I have a better understanding of Bitcoin's code in its entirety). What I would like to focus on instead is how reducing the smallest unit of account would extend the halving schedule past the well-known and ""final"" 33rd halving, which is estimated to take place around the year 2140.

In his article, [Dissecting the code responsible for the Bitcoin halving](https://ma.ttias.be/dissecting-code-bitcoin-halving/), Mattias Geniar does an excellent job explaining why, with sats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin will only have 33 halvings so please check out this article if you want the full explanation. In summary, in the function GetBlockSubsidy(), located in [src/validation.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L1238-L1249), the initial block subsidy, nSubsidy, is defined as 50 BTC and converted into the smallest unit of account (sats). Then, in the next line of code, there is a clever way of calculating the current block subsidy by taking nSubsidy in its binary form and removing the same number of bits from the right side of that binary number as the number of halvings which have already occurred. So, for example...

**sats**:

The initial nSubsidy is equal to 50 \* 100,000,000 = 5,000,000,000 sats. Written in binary, we get 100101010000001011111001000000000. And now, after 3 halvings, we can calculate the current block subsidy by removing 3 bits from the right, 100101010000001011111001000000~~000~~. Converting 100101010000001011111001000000 back to its decimal form gives us 625,000,000 sats (or 6.25 BTC). Great, the code and math all checks out!

As you can see, the maximum number of possible halvings is equal to the number of bits it takes to represent the initial nSubsidy in binary form. So, with sats as our smallest unit of account, the initial nSubsidy (5 billion sats) in binary form, 100101010000001011111001000000000, only has 33 bits (go ahead...count them...I did!). Thus, after the 33rd halving, there will be no more bits to remove, ~~100101010000001011111001000000000~~, and the block reward will go to zero.

Now, let's do the same exercise but with millisats, microsats, and nanosats.

**millisats**:

The initial nSubsidy would be 50 \* 100,000,000,000 = 5,000,000,000,000 millisats, which in binary is 1001000110000100111001110010101000000000000 (43 bits). Thus, with millisats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin would successfully complete 43 halvings until the block reward goes to zero around the year 2180.

**microsats:**

The initial nSubsidy would be 50 \* 100,000,000,000,000 = 5,000,000,000,000,000 microsats, which in binary is 1001000110000100111001110010101000000000000 (53 bits). Thus, with microsats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin would successfully complete 53 halvings until the block reward goes to zero around the year 2220.

**nanosats:**

The initial nSubsidy would be 50 \* 100,000,000,000,000,000 = 5,000,000,000,000,000,000 nanosats, which in binary is 100010101100011100100011000001001000100111101000000000000000000 (63 bits). Thus, with nanosats as the smallest unit of account, Bitcoin would successfully complete 63 halvings until the block reward goes to zero around the year 2260.

One thing worth mentioning is the hard coded upper limit to the number of halvings, which is currently set to 64. I assume the reason this limit is set to 64 is because anything higher would require nSubsidy to change its data type from int64 to int128. This change is technically possible, so one could imagine a future where we simply continue shrinking the smallest unit of account and the block subsidy never actually runs out or goes to zero...it just keeps getting smaller and smaller. This could continue as long as our computers are able to work with these increasingly large initial nSubsidy integers.

Naturally, one might then ask, if the block subsidy never runs out, won't we exceed the 21 million BTC hard cap? Quite beautifully, the answer is, no! This would remain the hard cap and instead of exceeding it, we would just keep getting closer and closer to it the more we reduced the smallest unit of account. It would remain an asymptotic limit! This might actually prove to be a better policy since most of us already believe there will actually be 21 million BTC in total when in reality there will only ever be 20,999,999.97690000 BTC (assuming we stick with sats as the smallest unit of account). Ok...one last calculation below...the number of BTC that will be mined in total for each unit of account if adopted...

**sats:** 20,999,999.97690000 BTC by 2140

**millisats:** 20,999,999.99997060000 BTC by 2180

**microsats:** 20,999,999.99999995800000 BTC by 2220

**nanosats:** 20,999,999.99999999996010000 BTC by 2260

Again, as we choose to use smaller and smaller units of account, we inadvertently extend the timeframe of the block subsidy and only get closer and closer to the asymptotic limit of 21 million BTC but never actually reach it or exceed it. This could literally go on forever and we would never run out of block subsidies (not that they would be worth very much...miners would still make the majority of their revenue from transaction fees). But, to me, there's something beautiful about the idea of the block subsidies never running out (never going to zero) even as we go way into the future...possibly until the end of time. I believe the Bitcoin block subsidy, no matter how small, is part of what gives Bitcoin life and is something which, if possible, should never stop flowing.

I would appreciate any and all feedback, comments, and corrections if I've made any mistakes. Thank you for reading this whole post!",1624977789,52,1

Hey folks! A while ago, while registering to a chat communicator, I noticed that the only user identification method of the chat communicators is the user phone number.

I was pretty pissed about that; that is why I decided to create a new messaging system that works without that specific identification. I‚Äôm solving that problem by using the crypto wallet pair of public and private keys to identify and encrypt the communications. I even implemented the option of making transactions in-chat; for example, you can exchange tokens, coins, nfts, etc. The project is currently under development; the MVP is going to be ready within days.

I shared this with you because I wanted to let you know that I created this project and because I‚Äôd like to receive some feedback from you. Would you ever use it? What would you like to see implemented / what would you change? All feedback are accepted.

Right now at these low prices it is almost impossible to find a single profitable mining rig in terms of BTC for BTC.

Did you know it only costs Marathon $4100 to mine 1 BTC? They also get EXCLUSIVE rights to Bitmains new batches of ASICS. They also made a deal with an energy provider for a guaranteed $0.02kwh rate. 
They‚Äôve stopped buying rigs and started buying bitcoin at $31,000. They haven‚Äôt even plugged in a bunch of their rigs. 

By keeping these prices low they basically guarantee no new competition can come up. And I have a feeling it‚Äôs going to stay this way for a while with this chip shortage.

After a decade in this space, those who start small statistically tend to end up with more in the long run than those who go all-in off the bat and panic sell for a small profit or large loss; just to get burned by Bitcoin resulting in them hating it out of hubris","I never recommend starting with large amounts if you're not ready for the emotional pain of seeing it potentially go down putting you at risk of panic selling. Instead, start with dollar-cost average purchases every week or every paycheck. Something you won't miss or won't sting if it all goes down 50% to 80% one day. If that's $10 dollars at a time for you then start with that, if it's $50 dollars at a time for you then go with that. Let that grow and work for you. It will motivate you to study Bitcoin to see why the value grows like it does once you see your own invested value starting to move up. Once you understand it enough to know why you hodl despite the temporary early-day volatility, then I would say it's okay to throw in such large amounts.  

 Invest responsibly people, only invest what your level of knowledge of an asset can tolerate. Use your investments to grow interested in an asset so you're motivated to look into it and understand it. Make your first dollars like a scouting party, have them go in and report back what they learn, and only after you've fully understood an asset thanks to the interest your scouts grow in your mind into understanding the asset's underlying fundamentals, only then should you invest with what that higher level of your knowledge of the asset will allow you to do so. This way, can you become the next Warren Buffet talking down to quantum coin buyers in 80 years or whatever the heck the next big money-making revolutionary network will be.

&amp;#x200B;

As for where to onboard, that depends on where you live. If you're in America, then your best bet is a place like Coinbase Pro. Free to use, and their fee for a 10 dollar buy is only around 5 cents. You can also use blockfi since they have no fees, but they tend to have a hefty markup.

\---

**INTRODUCTION**

Hey everyone! This took me around 300 hours of dedicated work (tons of research and sleepless nights). But I'm finally finished with it and I'm proud to present to you the ultimate, the most complete crypto YouTuber tier list &amp; analysis chart you have ever seen, with so many informations that will blow your mind (hopefully).

\---

**WHAT IS THIS?**

[A quick look at the Tier List &amp; Ranking tab.](https://preview.redd.it/7m0nizxa93371.png?width=2341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf6c33209c07a198ba02d43d9e212f2d83c24101)

It's a comprehensive chart of more than 110 crypto YouTubers/channels that incorporates tons of written information and mathematics-driven statistics that helps you to identify the quality and trustability of the given content creators. The chart features roughly 17 different types of data (written and mathematics-driven) for each and every YouTube channel.

This list doesn't just show you which YouTubers you should subscribe to and why, but also which ones you should avoid and/or which ones you should prioritize if you are looking for price predictions, or guides etc. It paints a complete picture. Or at least as much as it is possible by the work of one man.

\---

**WHY I MADE THIS CHART?**

[A quick look at the recommendations tab.](https://preview.redd.it/k8wmq00d93371.png?width=1157&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e668cbdfeda2a41b735efec8806d85901c69264)

Crypto is going mainstream. Right now, an overwhelming majority of rookie investors/traders rely first and foremost on YouTube content creators to make their financial decisions and/or to educate themeselves, but it is just as true for the most part in the case of more experienced traders (there are many reasons behind this, but these are irrelevant here).

So I felt it was important to create some kind of a comprehensive and content rich source that provides as much information and help to people as possible when it comes to these YouTubers they (want to) follow, so they can eventually make the best financial decisions and so on and so forth.

\---

**DISCLAIMERS**

[A quick look at the Useful Informations tab.](https://preview.redd.it/qrraqqze93371.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b2f8fe657472110bc52412efaf2765ee7f6d80d)

I'm one man. Even though I have spent 300 hours (more than 2 months) making this chart, it more than likely has some flaws, miscalculations, misjudgements about a channel or person, contradictions etc. It's practically unavoidable when we are talking about this amount of data (you'll see). Also,  I can't know everything about every YouTuber.

But that's partially the reason why there's so many different types of data for each and every YouTuber. Even if you do not agree with some data (that are less math-driven and more subjective) or even if there's a mistake somewhere, all of the data combined together will more than likely paint a realistic picture about the given content creator.

Oh, and I'm also not a native English speaker so sorry for any grammatical errors. Plus I know that token and coin is not precisely the same but for conveniance, I used them interchangably in the chart.

\---

**HOW TO SUPPORT ME?**

[A quick look at the Currency Summary tab.](https://preview.redd.it/w2wbmr9h93371.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca34a07c044d073784d3c01154a6b7546523647b)

Just to make things clear, I'm not some kind of a rich crypto invenstor/trader... far from it. I'm from a relatively poor country and I'm someone who has started crypto only a couple of months ago and invested his spare 660 dollars into proven, good quality coins... a couple of weeks before the big crash... so... you probably guess the ruest. I don't even have money for a new chair so I made this list with continuous and immense back pain because I used this [broken chair](https://i.imgur.com/ZEuhBJH.jpg) while I was working. I still wanted to help people the only way I could in the crypto space.

Now, I would be very humbled and would deeply appreciate it if you would consider doing the same and supporting my work if you found it in any way helpful. This chart is extensive and content rich, I made sure of it, but it's still just a rough blueprint / foundation on which many things can be build upon. And I'll gladly do that if there's enough interest in it and I'm more than happy to let the community to get involved too in this project to help to perfect it.

But for the continuous development of this chart, I need your help. **You can support me by opening the chart, then clicking on the Donation/Support tab (there, you can see all the possible options). Additionally, if you want it, I'll display your name in the Donation/Support tab of the chart so everyone can see that you supported my work.**

If you wouldn't like to support me this way and/or you can't, please, share my work and leave a like on it if you find it helpful so it can reach more people.

**THE CHART**

[Every single YouTuber\/channel has an overview\/introduction. Here are a few examples.](https://preview.redd.it/p4llb1zz93371.png?width=1444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f3c41073cd02446e63a3b846b754c45d23e8711)

I was thinking about explaining how the chart works, but pretty much every single column/row in it has some kind of a written explanation paired with it. The chart has everything you need to won't get lost and to be able to understand every information and data it contains.

nriihm,xmrk-btc,"Spanish inquisition says I am a scammer, because 0.5% of 1000 is 50 and bitcoins are euros","# Sumary

Triangular scam, I sell bitcoins - 185 eur worth in that case. A pays me (cash deposit in my Spanish bank account), I send BTC to C, who contacted me on localbitcoins for that purpose. Later it turns out that A expected C to send money to Venezuela, probably with better than official exchange rate. C just keeps the bitcoins and stops talking. A files criminal complaint for fraud, and I am sentenced as guilty, because I was an accomplice. The sentence says that my fee/profit was too high, because 0.5% of 1000 euros is 50 euros, applying some strange Spanish math (in the rest of the world, 0.5% of 1000 is 5), and this is way too much for a simple resending of money. Moreover, my role was supposedly superfluous, A could have sent money ""directly"" to C. I should have known all that, so I acted in willful blindness. More details at the end.

[The sentence in Spanish](https://www.poderjudicial.es/search/AN/openDocument/a8cada954cf80d5a/20170919). [Google translation with some minor tweaks](https://pastebin.com/nTuvkcKd), far from perfect,  but seem comprehensible. 

The highlight:

Si la comisi√≥n era como dijo el denunciado de un 0,5%, una sola transferencia de 1.000 euros generar√≠a un beneficio de 50 euros para el recurrente por el solo hecho de hacer una transferencia y no respondea las reglas de la l√≥gica que, si el negocio fuera legal y il√≠cito, la persona que finalmente recibe los bienes, esta persona ""se deje por el camino 50 euros"" puesto que nada impedir√≠a recibir directamente el ingreso y ahorrarseel paso intermedio de que el dinero vaya a otra cuenta y de esa cuenta finalmente llegue a la suya, ahorr√°ndoseas√≠ lo que pod√≠amos denominar ""la comisi√≥n"".

Translation:

If the fee were - as the accused has told - 0.5 %, just one transfer of 1000 euros would generate a profit of 50 euros for the appellant, and it is illogical that if the business were legitimate, the person who finally receives the goods, this person ""leaves 50 euros on the way"", because nothing would prevent to receive the funds directly and avoid the intermediary step ... thus saving ""the fee"".

# Disclaimer

 This is not a new case, I should have much written earlier about it. And I did, on bisq forum, and it did not generate as much outrage as I hoped. And I was inspired by [recent reddit post about ""illegal"" torrenting of Ubuntu, which got coverage in Ars Technica.](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/fake-dmca-takedown-notice-targeted-ubuntu-downloaders-yesterday/)

# Euros are bitcoins, so no taxes when selling btc with profit, right?

So if A has only euros and C wants only bitcoins, A can somehow magically ""directly"" send those euros to C, and C receives bitcoins, and a BTC seller is superfluous. I wonder how can this be the case, unless euros are bitcoins. By the same ""argument"", any service which allows you to pay with bitcoins where euros are accepted (for example Bitrefill) is inherently fraudulent - you do not need Bitrefill, you can send bitcoins ""directly"" to a shop which only accepts euros, no? 

This is just a misapplied analogy of the traditional non-BTC scam, where the middleman / mule receives stolen money by bank transfer, and is supposed to resend it to the scammer using Western Union or similar. Back to taxes, Spain does tax profits from bitcoin sales (there are countries which probably don't, I read something about Portugal). And it uses FIFO to compute taxes, which is rather aggressive for day trading. 

My argument here is that Spain cannot have it both ways, they cannot claim that euros are bitcoins to convict me and collect the fine for my ""fraud"", and then say ""oh, we did not really mean that, of course bitcoins are not euros, we want the share of those profits you made by selling BTC in 2017"". 

I would also like to exploit this strange math. The income tax rate is about 20%, which is twice the taxed income, according to the same strange math the judge used. I guess this would be a confiscatory tax rate, which is explicitly prohibited by the Spanish Constitution. But I guess they will just tell me to use the normal math. If they felt very generous, they could even say that if there are various interpretations - in this case 20% and 200% - the one which does not infringe the Constitution should prevail. And I think they will not even bother coming with some elaborate legal argument.

# I am not a scammer/bad guy because:

My best argument is that the scammer had a positive feedback on localbitcoins, he had made more tha 10 trades before contacting me. I was cautious about new users, I would not allow a new user to openly do third party deposit. Moreover, the victim paid by cash deposit, so I was sure this was not a case of hacked bank account. And surely, many attacks and frauds are possible, but are they feasible? It is very possible to waste much time and effort defending against attacks which nobody is even trying. Every defence has a cost, and for example when I insisted that buyer put payment message in form ""I am $mynick"", some people screwed up, put only their nick, or did not substitute their nick, or put the trade number only. Maybe the buyer even lost the bank slip/receipt.

Note that I wrote to localbitcoins support, suggesting they make it obligatory to include ""I am $mynick"" as a payment message/reason for payment, and they did not like it. Also, bisq recently changed their rules, the payment message should be empty. This suggests that that particular fraud is not very frequent and not worth effort and inconvenience to stop.

# The spanish judge should be prosecuted

I consider him guilty of perversion of the course of justice (""prevaricaci√≥n"" in Spanish). OK, to err is human. But after he erred, I filed a plea of nulity, pointing out the errors. And he refused to correct anything.  And I accept that if I made 5% profit (50 of 1000), it would be too much and suspicious. But it is really 0.5%, or 5 of 1000, and this changes nothing? I even argued that the victim had account in La Caixa, which would have charged 3 euros for this magical ""direct"" transfer (SEPA or not), it charged 0.1 % of the transferred amount or 3 euros, whichever is greater. For 185 euros, 3 euros is 1.6%, three times more than my ""suspicious"" profit. 

At the very least, ignoring my plea of nullity shows bad faith. 

Also, sentencing the judge is a grounds for reviewing the sentence against me, and probably the only viable grounds now. 

# Random notes:

Surely this is just a small case, so some errors should be tolerated. But if it was about real prison time, not just about paying fine, judges would take things more seriously and avoid or correct their mistakes. If you don't believe, just ask Romano van der Dussen. Indeed, they were unbelievably quick in his case - it took them only 12 years to correct. I mean, I cannot compare myself to the poor Dutchman, just pointing out how little those judges sometimes care even in such important cases. And I have made a few formal complaints about Spanish judges, with absolutely no consequences. According to the Constitution, only the King enjoys immunity; in practice, judges also do. 

# Case history:

  \- oral hearing at first instance - not sure what I am accused of, as they only sent me summons and copy of the criminal complaint, which does not explicitly tell that I am C (the scammer), it just says that A contacted C (a Facebook profile of the scammer) and A gave euros to B (me). I was not allowed basically any defence at the ""oral hearing"", no interrogation of the victim, no final speech, or any speech other that answering questions. Sentenced as a scammer, I am C, no middleman here. Have to ""return"" those 185 euros to A, and pay 120 euros fine, or spend 15 days in jail.

  \- appealed, and the sentence is modified, the court accepts that I was a middleman, but I could and should have known that it was a fraud, so I was an accomplice, so still guilty, the punishment remains the same

  \- filed plea of nullity (""incidente de nulidad"") - arguing that I could not have defended myself against the new accusation, also complained that I was never given chance to examine the communication between A and C. Also mentioned that 0.5% of 1000 is not 50. This is handled by the same judge who gave appellate verdict, and his response is that I cannot introduce new evidence that late, I should have done it earlier. Conveniently, the judge does not mention what is that new evidence (the communication between A and C? This is hardly new, and I did not want to introduce it, but to see and read it.) And my other 2 points are NOT ADDRESSED AT ALL. 

  \- Constitutional Court - does not admit my complaint because it lacks constitutional relevance. But they first forced me to pay a lawyer, even though I filed without a lawyer and could not change anything after filing. The constitutional case law says that a complaint is relevant and should be admitted if I mentioned constitutional case law in lower court and it was disregarded. I think I did exactly that, I mentioned a case about changing the accusation in my plea of nullity. Note that the Constitutional Court dismisses 99% of the individual complaints filed with it, citing lack of relevance. Surely this ratio is because Spanish courts are perfect and would almost never ignore explicitly mentioned constitutional case law. Or perhaps litigants and lawyers are dumb and almost never mention constitutional case law with the view of using it later as an argument before Constitutional Court.

  \- ECHR - says I filed one day late, which is probably true, they use different rules for weekends than Spanish courts. I filed it in English, to avoid the Spanish section of ECHR, and it probably helped, at least I saw a very generic dismissal by ECHR in another case, in Spanish. Anyway, my case could have been dismissed because of too small amount at stake, although I preventively argued that it was a criminal case, and I could have gone to jail, so it should not be just about the amount. But I do not see how Spain could have prevailed on merits, how could they reasonably explain what they did.",1622740188,22,1

It's an endless shitstorm as moneyed interests close to the dollar spigot finally see Bitcoin for what it is: A direct threat to monetary expansion and Central bank authority. Put your shields up, and prepare.","I am amazed at how quickly the authorities have ""awoken"" to the Apex Predator in the room.  I have always known why I'm in Bitcoin.  For me, it has always been around the following core values:

Decentralized, with no controlling authority.  A finite supply.  Freedom from banks and debasement of what I've worked hard to acquire.

Saifedeen Ammous says without hesitation in ""The Bitcoin Standard"" that Bitcoin is a direct threat to Central Banks.  Many of us have danced around this issue, and tried to downplay where Bitcoin is going.  Even Saylor is careful to couch his answer to the repeated question, ""Is Bitcoin a threat to currencies and the Central Bank?""

I used to answer the same question with, ""The Central banks, and especially the FED, are too moribund and slow; hell, they can't even understand how--or the how important it is--to implement a CBDC.""

There is no doubt in my mind the authorities are fully awake now, and in attack mode.  Latest was Ms. Rowland with the Irish Central Bank just today attacking Bitcoin.  She is headed to the EU Central Bank to play a major oversight role.  Many here on Reddit have commented on the shitstorm of unprecedented proportions: crime, energy use, investors will lose all their money... .

All of us are going to have to get a lot tougher.  Right now, the Bitcoin community is under attack, and it is not going to let up as adoption and success increase.  After this huge correction, which I personally feel was manipulated by many interests, the only way to be successful in the long run with Bitcoin is to ""circle the wagons together, and hold the line.""

np5he9,GreatJobKeepitUp,I'm so sick of the energy argument,"Everywhere I go people put down crypto for its energy consumption. I'm fucking sick of it. Every day people sit at home, run their heat or their a/c. Watch videos of stupid shit. Ride their car around. They do all these things which burn energy. 90% of it is completely for themselves, their survival and most of all their pleasure and comfort. AndI'm fine with that, I do it too. But I hate that all of that is just taken for granted, no questions needed. 

Why in the name of sweet fuck is bitcoin the one thing people care about the consumption of? Nobody ever questions the intrinsic value of energy until needs start creating coins? Nobody ever breaks down the energy consumption of their daily life because they would reveal the fact they are wasteful.

 We've never heard anyone question how much energy the financial system uses until bitcoin started getting shit on. Ive never heard someone question the consumption of Twitter and whether or not that is a necessary service in this age of climate change. My theory is that the fact that a miner makes money makes people jealous so they paint them as selfish world killers.

Further wtf. There are oil and coal barrons spending their whole selves on keeping this dirty fuel in our society as long as they can. Why the fuck are we fighting with people about which technology should have to be banned when these pieces of shit are still poking holes in the ground. Let's ban them instead of the tools we want to use. 

I'm hoping going forward people see the benefit of fully democratized trust and truth and start evaluating energy consumption based on utility and not just megawatts.",1622473517,213,6

ns2yvm,SohailKhanzada,How to deal with Market Manipulation by Musk,"I‚Äôm seeing a great deal of frustrated posts about Elon Musk‚Äôs influence in the market and how it somehow discredits crypto as a whole if he is able to affect the price.

It‚Äôs important to realise that crypto/Bitcoin is a brand and just like any brand it is affected by public perception and psychology. As an example, if Tim Cook says something irresponsible about Apple, it would make the price of the Apple stock inevitably go down which has happened many times. This is the same for every company/brand in the world. 

In Apple‚Äôs example, it doesn‚Äôt mean Apple is not a worthy stock just because it fluctuates in price whenever Tim Cook says something negative, this is just how branding works. 

Also there‚Äôs the psychological factor, where Elon Musk followers see a negative tweet, they anticipate that this will cause a drop in the market so they sell. This in turn gains momentum as other retail investors see the negative down turn so it goes down further. It‚Äôs a negative feedback loop which is present in every market not just crypto.

Learn to embrace it, be ok with it and understand the psychology behind it is the best thing you can do. 

Moreover, it's good that he keeps tweeting. The more he tweets, the the more he will lose his ability to manipulate the market. Once people get used to his tactics, his tweets will no longer affect the market.

A quote from Planatir founders brought this thought further along, and ask if others share these concerns.

 ‚Äúwe saw the government, frankly, wasting billions of dollars on things that were 20, 30, 40 years behind what we had done at PayPal. Because at PayPal, when we started arresting the bad guys, we got to know these guys in the government. They started asking for our advice. Then after 9/11, they were spending so much money on these wasteful systems that we said, wow, this is a huge opportunity. We have to take the lessons from Silicon Valley and go bring them to the East Coast, where they don't have the same technology culture, and we can help them out.‚Äù",1622904927,10,1

nu6cok,simplelifestyle,PSA: This is important to have a fact-based subreddit.,"Suspect of anyone consistently posting/commenting negative stuff without any fundament, even when they can make arguments that on some level ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù without a proper context and knowledge basis.

It‚Äôs very easy to ruin, or at least severely affect the reputation/perception of anyone by presenting a false narrative attractive to our paranoid minds.
Those attacks, like the ones against Jack Dorsey, lately against the President of El Salvador, and many other people doing great things for the Bitcoin ecosystem and helping adoption, have been increasing lately. 

Is not about ""worshipping"" anybody, but just objectively recognizing their contributions. Those negative narratives spread like wildfire if it is not promptly fact-checked and debunked. That‚Äôs how the masses are easily manipulated, but we can make a difference on r/bitcoin. 

For sure some powerful people feel threatened and it is not difficult to imagine they would spend some of their money on PR and Narrative-Control to spread Anti-Bitcoin FUD, spam forums, pay ‚Äújournalists‚Äù and media, hire armies of cyber-trolls, etc.

What can you do?

* Take a few seconds to verify the information by googling it.

* Check the post/comment history of those posting negative comments to discern between legit occasional dissent and 100% anti-bitcoin narrative, lies and misinformation and without providing any reliable source for their statements.

* Take a few seconds to tag and report those users and even maybe fact-check them with sources to prevent the spread of their misinformation.

We don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúworry‚Äù about that, and we know ‚Äúthat exists on all forums‚Äù, but if many of us take just a moment to do even just one of those 3 points, we will be enjoying a more fact-based subreddit and would be substantially decreasing the unnecessary drama and FUD generated by those users.

Remember: Fact-checking is NOT censoring or gatekeeping.

nug6kx,Spaceseeds,A moment of silence for all who did not believe.,"Just wanted to put it out there that it feels good. I'm sure many people all feel the same way to hear this news about El Salvador. It could be easily overlooked by many with only first world problems but it goes without saying that this is a major step for the whole crypto space. 5 years ago no one really believed countries might adopt it as some form of payment but here we are. Crypto doing what it was set out to do, giving a country where 70% or more don't even have access to banks a way to transact and store money. Nevermind the FUD and the price for a bit, this is the equivalent of neil armstrong taking that first step on the moon. Before this we were in space sure, but the ecosystem just evolved to take us to land on other worlds now. Once a few more countries adopt the bitcoin standard it will have a cascading effect. It won't be overnight and many people will hardly realize it's happening until it's too late for them. Don't be those guys, if you are here now you are still early for what many people here have seen as a distant dream that would hopefully have it's moment one day. The day may be here sooner than many thought, or it may not.

A lot of people only came to bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme and soon enough they will be proven wrong like they are every time. Bitcoin was meant to HODL. If you do not have a hodling portfolio you are approaching Bitcoin wrong. By the way, the same results are had by hedge funds. No one is beating the returns of just HODLing Bitcoin for years. It's been proven time and time again and if you can show me one piece of data that shows otherwise I'd like to see it. Stop trading, start HODLing. 21 million is not a lot of coins to go around. I know it's boring at parties while your friends are all making bank on shitcoins, and so you can still do that, maybe even stack some more SATS but don't fucking stop the HODL. Don't be the person who can't control their emotions. Be the guy who you heard about who got in bitcoin early enough that he made bank. 30k will seem like nothing once we hit 150k.",1623081893,5,1

nuf0bn,Unusual-Cheesecake70,Do you want cheaper prices or stable prices? Bitcoin can offer customers lower prices,"Say you sell food whole sale. What costs go in to your prices? Do you have to pay for the ability to accept dollars as payment? Do you pay to accept debit cards and credit cards? Do you have to pay to have a bank account? 

You can eliminate those costs entirely by only accepting bitcoin. You can lower your prices lower than any competitors. The only way your competitors could match those prices and not go out of business would be to copy you by only accepting bitcoin. But if you get competitors that do that the demand for bitcoin goes up so the value of your bitcoin goes up. So this encourages competition! 

The key is to make it cheaper for customers to buy and send you the bitcoin than it would be for them to pay in FIAT somewhere else. You can undermine entire industries and force change. 

Make your business about making bitcoin not dollars. 

‚ÄúBut what about vendors that only accept fiat?‚Äù

nudk7i,SpockSays,A question for American bitcoiners that are enticed and intrigued by the recent news from El Salvador...,"It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see if/how many USA citizens that are bitcoiners will choose to renounce their USA citizenship over the course of the next decade in pursuit of taking citizenships with more favorable taxation and/or living in countries with better opportunities for bitcoiners.

El Salvador is just one early example for countries that will incentivize bitcoiners, but you can be sure there will be many more countries to come. There are already plenty of places in the world that have low (and even 0%) income and capital gains taxes that isn't specific to bitcoin.

Ok, here is my point:

USA, Myanmar, and Eritrea are the only countries to impose world wide taxation on its citizens that choose to live abroad. Sure, for US citizens living abroad, there are some ‚Äútax credits‚Äù and things like the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)‚Ä¶ but those benefits are actually very limited to the scope of ‚Äúdouble taxation‚Äù and ""earned income"" and don‚Äôt allow you to legally avoid taxes to the extent that you really should be able too.

**Put simply, Americans who choose to live in El Salvador will have zero benefit to the bitcoin taxation policy that is in El Salvador, while pretty much any other expat of almost any other citizenship would get the benefit.**

I, as an American, cannot live in El Salvador and sell/spend/trade bitcoin without Uncle Sam making sure he takes his cut. The same cut he would have taken from me if I lived in the USA.

**If I were a citizen of any other country in the world else (not USA, not Myanmar, not Eritrea), I could move to El Salvador, and trade bitcoin all day with zero tax consequences, because all other countries do not impose world wide taxation on its citizens that choose to live abroad.**

American bitcoiners, what do you think?

Do you think the USA will change its world wide taxation policy to bring it in-line with basically every other country in the world?

As an American, all I want is freedom from worldwide taxation, full stop. It‚Äôs not much to ask for considering every other country in the world does it that way. (Aside from Myanmar and Eritrea).

Id love to keep my current citizenship, but I honestly feel that the USA has me backed up into a corner and has burdened me with this kind of ‚Äúultimatum‚Äù where I have no choice but to renounce in order to be treated fairly, without being punished with unjustifiable world wide taxation just for ""being an American"" that lives abroad.",1623075250,49,1

The concept of Money is something a lot of people take for granted. You grow up with it or in some cases without much of it ... if fortunate enough getting some pocket money for chores, later earning it from a job of some sort ... You can get stuff with it like a bicycle or a bag of pasta.
Very few people would consider there was any choice in the matter of money itself, it appears on the surface of it to be a neutral medium to earn and buy with.

One of the most disruptive and therefore revolutionary aspects about Bitcoin is simply that it highlights the fact that there is a choice when it comes to money itself. 
That there is a choice being overlooked. 
That traditional money is not a neutral medium.

And then of course all the other aspects follow - It's global and not owned by any government or organisation, etc. etc.

Price appreciation is great for now and will award all those who enter this new economy early, but when that eventually simmers down and in times of a correction or a bear market, it's the fact that I own my own money that is most valuable to me.",1623074048,0,1

They probably must ""maintain"" a good amount just to always have some backed for people trading. But what I'm really asking about is how much they have on hand. In the same way Apple has millions of USD on hand just for the sake of it.

I worked with a guy a few years back who came up to me and asked if I had any investing experience. I said I had made about $900 buying and selling Bitcoin. He says, ""Bitcoin...oh yeah I bought $100 worth of that stuff when it first came out.""  My jaw hit the table. I then did some calculations and told him what he could be potentially sitting on. At that moment Bitcoin had just hit $10,000. I told him he needs to find it asap.  He said he would look around the next upcoming holiday when he drives to his relatives house. Apparently it was on their old computer.  My day, week, and month was shot. This was all I could think of. I watched videos about recovering wallets. I downloaded Bitcoin core, electrum and bought more Bitcoin. At the time I had none of my own and hadn't played around with wallets much, just bought/sold on coinbase. We eventually were talking about me helping to recover it and he offered me $1,000,000 for my help.  I told him I was thinking more like 5% and he agreed to that. I wanted some sort of proof like an email receipt. He says it was in an old Gmail account that he no longer has access too since he doesn't have the same cellphone number that is attached to it. The cellphone number is now in use so it's not accessible.  He doesn't remember how he bought it either.  At this point I'm getting a little peeved. This guy is not helping much while potentially holding millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.  I understand that it's his but I'm a little invested at this point. We eventually found out that his relative sold the computer a number of years back at a rummage sale.  I still had so many unanswered questions. Did they back it up, did they keep the hardrive, did they wipe it, etc. At this point he is no longer helping and wouldn't let me talk directly to his relative.  I believe he is in denial that it ever happened so he doesn't have to live with the thought of losing it.  We work in different trades now so I don't talk to him much, just the occasional Facebook banter.
I still think about it, I mean who wouldn't. Definitely feel like we didn't try hard enough.

I think Bitcoin and LN will be a settlement/payment network for any currency thanks to RGB in the future. To explain RGB, I show how RGB core concepts allows you to take a fresh look at what Bitcoin is technically. This post is for people who want to understand how RGB works under the hund without any code and how it uses Bitcoin and LN, it is quite technical.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to read my explanation for free, I shared my post in the reddit r/RGB_protocol so you can read it [there](https://www.reddit.com/r/RGB_protocol/comments/ni4n7t/my_explanation_of_the_core_idea_of_rgb/) :) (I hope we will see more activity on the RGB sub with its adoption).

The LNPBP association also made nice slides recently to illustrate how you transfert RGB asset on-chain [here](https://github.com/LNP-BP/presentations/blob/master/Presentation%20slides/How%20RGB%20works.pdf) !

nppr6u,skz-,RGB for Lightning Network. I'm so excited.,"""The classic example is CryptoKitties, those breedable NFT felines minted on the Ethereum network. Another perhaps less-familiar example comes from the RarePepe cards issued on Bitcoin using the Counterparty protocol.

RGB could have a leg up on these forms of NFTs because RGB would allow you to send the computer file for the NFT in the same transaction as the asset that represents it. When you send a CryptoKitty as an ERC-721 token on Ethereum or a RarePepe ‚Äúcolored coin‚Äù on Bitcoin, the file for the actual collectible has to be transferred separately. With RGB, both asset and collectible can be ‚Äúsent inside the same channel,‚Äù Zucco claimed.

A more salient use case for RGB, according to Zucco, would come from issuing tether on the protocol. Since all transactions are handled off-chain, Zucco said RGB carries with it the promise to be possibly more private than even the Lightning Network.

For something like the stablecoin tether, whose on-chain address on blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS and Tron can be easily tracked and, in extreme scenarios, blacklisted, this could bolster tether‚Äôs privacy and censorship resistance.""

nuvfmy,YoMomsHubby,Insight From The US National Debt Clock And Our Future,"Incredible Insight From The US National Debt Clock And Our Future

According to the US National Debt Counter the current debt of the country is 19.6 Trillion USD. Now based off the rate of the current debt increase the projected national debt in 2025, just 4 years from now will be a whopping 50 Trillion USD. More interestingly  is the ‚Äúsavings per family‚Äù. The equation is ""Liquid cash in personal savings for all US families divided by the number of US families."" The current number based on number provided by [CBO.gov](https://CBO.gov) the current amount that which families have in savings is 37K USD. But in 2025 that number dramatically increases, based off the current rate of debt increasing, to 515K USD. Thats insane. But this is somewhat of a foreshadowing of the next increase and thats for crypto. They use a ""dollar to crypto ratio"" the equation they use is ""The total US M2 money supply divided by the total market cap of ALL crypto."" Numbers provided by the National Reserve. (M2 is a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money) In 2013 the dollar to crypto ratio was 9,659 to 1. Right now is 2021 the dollar to crypto ratio is 11.56 to 1. in 2025 it project to be 0.77 to 1. From these stats I would infer that right now investing would be the most important decision your future would rely on. And I would say a no brainer. But its up to you to make that leap and think about your future today. It will change your life.

I'm not one for conspiracies, but it is almost certain that this will start the gears turning in Washington D.C., London, Berlin, etc.

The FUD will be fast and thick over the next few years as poorer nation state adoption becomes prevalent. The euro and dollar have much to lose, but the people who use those currencies or their own failing currencies have much to gain. We holders will be their backbone, and stand with them in solidarity.

Be ready. Have a strong hand and stout heart. If nation states see value in this, we've already won friends. It's just going to be a painful victory journey.

Figure out what side of history you want to be on. Cast your die.

Just that as a narrative could go a long way to pacifying the environmental concerns for many years. Post Elon tweet I have seen very little support for that idea. Everyone seems to be PoW or die.

I get that PoS encourages concentration of ownership but by the time of the next halving we are only talking about distribution of the last 5%. If PoS is proven to be secure I can't see that justifying the energy consumption. I see that it's difficult to get miners to agree to a change to prevent a hard fork but that does not seem insurmountable.

Is there any good writing on the subject that someone can point me to that explains why I am wrong? Are there any voices advocating for a move to PoS? 

I feel like the only story we have is that bitcoin enables renewables (i.e. the Square / Ark whitepaper). With Square Crypto committing an investment to test that theory, what happens if it's proven wrong? What percentage of global energy consumption will the general public accept before they start demanding that it's banned?

He's done several more of those recently, it seems they're increasing in frequency as well as he tries to cover his losses from the Elon Dump.

Tonight, though, he went on this whole rant about how Bitcoin is old technology and a conspiracy theory about Bitcoin and altcoin pairings. (he's recently gone full tinfoil posting 4Chan threads on his page due to a lack of good content) 

I've noticed that this is the trend and not the exception among altcoin shiller pages. They all try to use the same narratives about Bitcoin being old, or claim that it's or expensive to transact on. None of them ever mention the fact that you can get transactions approved for 5c/transaction or 1 sat/byte now on the network itself, right now. and they certainly never tell their viewers about layer-2 solutions such as Lightning Network.

I'm a day trader who spends hours trading equities daily, but recently started trading crypto. Some of my other trader friends were using a Bitcoin trading bot and so I'm trying that out. It trades 24/7, and will buy BTC contracts based on pricing/momentum signals. The benefit is that you don't have to do it yourself and it takes FUD/emotion out of the equation. As a fee, they take a % of the profits - so you only pay if it makes profit. Profits are rolled back into the account (which you can close or withdraw from) but if you leave the proceeds it compounds. I've only been on it for a week, but my other friends say they averaged 20% passive income each month.

nw5ip2,crypto_constantine,"New to reddit, Thoughts on El Salvador","Greetings All,

Very new here. I understand that I will be berated as spreading FUD. I promise I am not. I have been active in crypto for years, and truly got involved because I believe in the cypherpunk movement. But, I am so annoyed with the hypocritical notes of retail investors who speak simultaneously of social impact and moon. With that let's get started.

El Salvador ""dollarized"" in 2001. The goal of switching to another currency is to reduce inflation and increase FDI.  The impacts of ""dollarization"" were lackluster in El Salvador because : 1. Inflation was never a problem, 2. No FDI because of a failed education system and crime!

BTC as a legal tender in effect support similar goals, with one exception.  An appreciation in the price of BTC/USD will certainly have some benefits as it will increase reserves. At least until every other currency becomes useless and we are using a BTC standard then they will have BTC relative to other countries. Some who could afford to still purchase more btc than El salvador at cheaper prices. Resulting in a small transfer of wealth. But, I digress. In order for BTC to be truly impactful, it must bring in new investments.

So I ask very seriously, how many of you truly believe in the vision of a decentralized equitable world? If you do, you wont just go to El Salvador for a tourist vacation. You will relocate there, open a business, put your children in their school system, deal with the high homicide rates, invest in local entrepreneurs, buy El salvadorian products.

A new currency is important, its not a panacea. El Salvador faces so much corruption. Changing its money won't prevent the corruption unless the citizens finally rebelle.  El Salvador doesnt have the power of monetary policy already, BTC isnt freeing the citizens from that.  BTC is putting monetary policy of a country in the hands of whales to move the market at their will(if citizens actually convert. Few will).

No doubt, in a decade it is possible that BTC is stable, but for now it seems like we are celebrating the adoption of one type of tyrant for another. At least the USD is somewhat stable with stable inflation.  

I do hope for a decentralized future, one where we collectively care about the impact our decisions make on others.  Right now, there are too many moon boys and whales with little regard for their consequences.

In truth El Salvador and its citizens will not massively adopt BTC anytime soon. Their stable economy as a result of slow adoption should not be taken as a success of BTC.

A year of BTC tourism that increases tourism gdp for a year also shouldnt be celebrated.    

This post is not FUD. Its a hope that more people will look at crypto outside of their vacuum.",1623270549,15,2

nzolqm,Hi_Azuma,Need help answering some questions about bitcoin,"First I would like to disclose that I am a hardcore bitcoin believer. When I spend bitcoin, I do it through LN. It has always worked flawlessly for me.

I would like to have better responses for some of the following questions that sometimes come into my way:

\-Regarding scaling: 

If the entire population of Germany would use LN (around 80 million), and were allowed only 4 transactions in the main chain per year (to balance their LN channels), then the main chain would still not be able to handle the amount of transactions.  

My current answer:

 If we were to increase the capacity of the main chain right now, then the second layers will never grow and develop. It is only when the fees rise that some people will start to turn and learn about LN. I believe that when LN has grown significantly, and the transactions in the main chain have truly become too great to handle, is when most likely an increase of block size may be considered. Right now, the block chain keeps getting empty after some time. 

\-Energy consumption

Bitcoin consumes 1% of the energy of the world right now. What happens if the price goes up by 20x? Will bitcoin use 10-20% of the world's energy? Is it possible that one days it reaches 50%?

My current answer:

Bitcoin using 20% of the world's energy would put a serious strain in all of industries and the environment unless we have somehow found a way to easily produce renewable energy. Since we will always value essential goods above bitcoin I do not think this will come to pass.

If so, the velocity of their fiat currencies would accelerate, causing currency devaluation and exacerbating inflation as measured by their sovereign currencies. In the unfortunate event of hyperinflation, fiat-denominated debt would become worthless and dollar-denominated bonds unpayable.

While the Bitcoin network has not evolved enough to service an entire economy, in our view the demand for bitcoin in emerging markets could increase as its infrastructure scales and reaches critical mass.

nw0mx4,EkariKeimei,"Bitcoin‚Äôs electricity consumption / environmental impact is a bad objection, but everyone (not just BTC) needs a solution. [OC; Effort post]","*TL;DR: While the electricity consumption objection is often fallacious, there is a non-fallacious counterpart. We can and should address the environmental impact of activities directly and indirectly caused by Bitcoin. But solutions are not a prerequisite for Bitcoin‚Äôs wider adoption, nor should be taken seriously as such ‚Äì that is a red herring.*

The argument against bitcoin for electricity consumption has fallacious and non-fallacious versions.

Here is a common argument pattern:

* Bitcoin enthusiast says, ‚ÄúBitcoin solves problems X, Y, and Z for commerce and monetary policy. It should be adopted over other currencies.‚Äù
* Non-bitcoiner critic responds, ‚Äúbut Bitcoin uses such an incredible amount of electricity,‚Äù *without addressing how well it solves X, Y, or Z or admitting that Bitcoin solves real problems.*

On the face of it, this would be simply raising a *different* problem to solve, Problem E (whether the high electricity consumption problem or the environmental impact problem; I will lump them together as Problem E). We can grant this. Yet even if problem E is one we *can* solve and *should* be solved, it isn‚Äôt obvious how this is relevant to BTC. Insofar as it is irrelevant, it tends toward a fallacy in reasoning.

Among the different forms of the Problem E objection, there is a non-fallacious argument form. It brings up how some other viable cryptocurrency competes with BTC, in that it solves all the same monetary problems BTC solves, but *also* reduces or removes problem E while BTC does not (as much). Point taken as far as that goes (and I shall return to this below). However, there are many different fallacious versions as well. One fallacious version suggests that Bitcoin shouldn‚Äôt be adopted unless the electricity problem is solved. In other words, a prerequisite to bitcoin adoption is solving the renewable energy conundrum. An even more fallacious version of this objection suggests that *Bitcoin* should solve it or reduce it, by design, lest there is some immoral or irresponsible activity going on with BTC.

First, Bitcoin was not intended to solve Problem E. It is not its stated aim. But insofar as miners recognize this as a problem to be solved *in general*, individuals have a personal responsibility to reduce their own environmental impact where it is reasonable and appropriate to do so. It should be noted that disproportionately, Bitcoin mining relies on more renewable resources than many other currencies. So, if someone suggests that BTC does not solve problem E, that isn‚Äôt a failure of BTC or its mining community. It is a concern felt and addressed in part by the same community, even if it does not threaten the viability of their investment. \[The former point is simply analytic and straightforward. But the latter is an empirical question about the commonality practices of miners, and whether BTC miners are environmentally-conscious is contingent. I myself have a very small mining rig and I live just outside Niagara Falls region, where much of the power is generated by renewable power sources, such as the Niagara Power system.\]

The second point: Bitcoin should not be expected to solve problem E. On the one hand, it is not unique to Bitcoin to solve it, since all currencies face this issue. On the other hand, Bitcoin has no special relationship with electricity to generate a special obligation above the other currencies.

In the first case, every economic exchange with a monetary instrument intervening relies on resources to be spent (gold, mining and minting gold coin; greenbacks, printing ink on cotton; debit card, plastics, metals, and electronic infrastructure; etc.). In the modern market, the exchanges are increasingly becoming more and more electronic-based, whether charging a debit card at Target, NFC chips to swipe via Square, or buying on Amazon via PayPal. These all require electricity, and the consumption is very large when taken in aggregate. Rather than considering electricity as a bug or problem, Bitcoin takes this as a cue to creatively reuse the existing electronic infrastructure to solve other problems, as a way of making electronic exchanges more common and enhance their capabilities.

In the second case, Bitcoin‚Äôs electrical consumption is essential to its use, and in that sense, it is special in its relationship to electricity. But that does not entail that it inherits a special obligation to reduce its electricity use or promote renewable resources simply on that basis. Instead that would be on the miners, and it is in their interest to mine with efficient technology to reduce electricity waste. Insofar as miners have an interest in finding ways to reduce electricity waste, BTC blockchain remains stable while the environmental impact lessens. And so, if this were a good objection against BTC, then currencies that BTC competes with, including and especially fiat currencies, have just as much of a burden to reduce the byproducts of their use as well ‚Äì to reduce paper, electricity, water, etc. in printing, washing, distributing, and retrieving greenbacks. In important senses, these resources are even harder to renew without waste than electricity is. Furthermore, BTC‚Äôs environmental impact is indirect. It does not contribute to smog; it does not affect the Ozone layer; it has no CO2 output. It is very different from a Hummer or diesel-powered truck. The burden does not belong to BTC in a special way; and if we were consistent in this standard, then the objection loses its particular force. I see no similar calls for eliminating waste in greenbacks, though there are some reforms called for eliminating the copper penny (since it costs more to make than it is worth in use). By analogy, it is clear to me that electric, self-driving cars should be the future of transportation, but it is by no means electric car companies‚Äô responsibility to solve the problem of finding new electrical sources, when it already solves the bigger and more pressing problem of using fossil fuels. Society bears the burden of finding electricity sources as an environmentally-friendly energy, and just as those electric car companies have an interest in making it widely available for refueling, miners have an interest in widely available electronic infrastructure.

The third point: any environmental impact due to electrical consumption is a real problem to be addressed, but this a problem with generating renewable energy, not how it is spent. There are two sides of this. The first side is that there is a general problem with generating energy in creative and sustainable ways. The second side is that we spend electricity on countless other activities that we find valuable even though we know the cost, and if we are consistent in attacking BTC, then we should attack those activities too. The first side is very straightforward, so I won‚Äôt spend much time on it: as a society we need to rethink how we acquire electricity. Public fear and ignorance concerning nuclear power prevents us from powering cities and even states with an abundant resource. We are seeing more and more wind farms and watermills, and we need to reduce their negative impacts where we can. But this is a general problem for society to solve, not for Bitcoin in particular. The second side is that we should be consistent with our objection. If the sheer fact that some activity consumes a lot of energy is a major flaw, then we would need to apply this not only to currencies that use electricity (as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, etc.), but also the activities that are not currencies such as watching football or YouTube or porn sites, all of which consume massive amounts of electricity when taken in aggregate. And yet there is no call to take down the NFL or FIFA or YouTube or P0rnhub on the bases of their electrical uses, either in the production or distribution or consumption. Yet is Bitcoin mining causing a rise in electrical costs? Or is Bitcoin mining demanding even nearly as much as these others? Is it causing a bottleneck in access to sustainable energy? If Bitcoin mining causes a bottleneck in resources to electricity, then other larger offenders should be addressed first. If wider adoption changes this story, then that would be where the objection is relevant, but it is by no means a bar for entry in the first place.

The fourth point: Bitcoin should be assessed by its merits and demerits compared to its competitors. Bitcoin has two main competition categories ‚Äì fiat currencies and crypto currencies. For the former, BTC does not do worse. We could expand on all the benefits of BTC over fiat currencies (many of which are inflationary, guided by corrupt government practices, etc.). We could also extol BTC for the practical problems that BTC solves relative to the US dollar as it is used in the current monetary system, such as allowing cheap, verifiable, and anonymous wire transfers (in competition with Western Union, MoneyGram, PayPal, Zelle, etc.) without the use of a custodial bank account (in competition with JP Morgan-Chase, Wells Fargo, CitiBank, US Bank, PNC, CapitalOne, etc.; as well MasterCard, Visa, American Express, NetSpend, Green Dot, Rushcard, etc.) for which overdrafts are a predatory practice (charging for double-spending with hefty fines) and maintenance/inactivity fees are insult to injury (an account that has little use is penalized by taking away its funds in regular intervals until all funds are gone). BTC is not yet infected by any such nonsense while it gives control back to the owners. Pardon the slight tangent. All of these involve electricity consumption, but BTC does better on these other metrics, and so *ceteris paribus* we have an argument in favor of BTC rather than a single defeater, problem E.

Lastly, the only place where this objection has non-fallacious application is in distinction with other cryptocurrencies. Here we can focus on BTC‚Äôs relationship to its competitors in crypto. It is important that Bitcoin is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) design, rather than some other like Proof-of-Stake (PoS). I have my own reservations about PoS as a monetary design, but it is clear to me that C@rdano, which is PoS, demonstrates that decentralized finance can use significantly less electricity. Some reports are that it can use 99.5% less electricity than its PoW counterparts. muerehtE‚Äôs community plans to follow a similar model, to replace its PoW model with PoS, in order to improve efficiency (claiming the same percentage reduction), despite the material harm it will bring to its miners. (I say ‚Äòharm‚Äô in terms of comparative account of harm, where benefit and access to goods are removed or reduced compared to when there is no such intervention.) There are likewise dozens of other cryptocurrencies that were started with PoS by design like C@rdano, but unlike C@rdano are very early in development or extremely risky as an asset.

Let‚Äôs grant all of this. Let‚Äôs grant that PoS is more efficient in electricity, and let‚Äôs grant that it sufficiently solves problem E with respect to the burden any cryptocurrency might shoulder. The question in part is whether these other cryptocurrencies are as viable for use, unified by a philosophical front, and solve the same problems as BTC intended to solve. In C@rdano‚Äôs case, there is much to recommend it, but it lacks a unified philosophical position to generate principles down the road and remain future-proof. muerehtE is clearly a viable competitor, given its known practical uses and token-layer benefits (these all speak to its staying power). It will likely win a lot of market share when it eventually moves to PoS in the years to come (I say this tongue-in-cheek, since muerehtE has scheduled upgrades with repeated delays). But it comes with monetary and philosophical problems (non-deflationary monetary policy, for one) and the aforementioned harms to its own investors (the mining community). Smaller PoS currencies might merit some airtime, but I will remain brief. Moreover, I need not mention other PoW currencies like L!teCoin and Bitco!n Cash (since they have no advantages, or *nearly* no advantages, over BTC).

History as it is, BTC has much wider perceived value and demonstrated use cases across the globe. If this situation is going to change, then two things can happen:

1. BTC can lose its perceived value in favor of a different currency that is otherwise all-things-considered better than BTC at solving the problems BTC intended to solve. BTC is dominant and is projected to remain so. But this is contingent. Some competition might beat out BTC in some unknown future. If a currency can mimic BTC in design in every regard except being less energy-demanding, BTC would be competing solely based on brand/name recognition. Brand is valuable, but can be dethroned or at least mocked (as happens in commercial chains).
2. BTC can adopt a different model for blockchain verification that is less energy-demanding (e.g., PoS or some other). I hear from many in the community that this is an avenue that will not even be considered. Not only the miners will not allow it, but it also falls within some larger principle for how BTC operates. For that, I am not convinced that BTC must be forever PoW. This is all new technology and a decade of evolutions to tech make some upgrades inevitable when their advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages. Switching away from PoW might be one of those designs we revise.

nvzuwe,dolarestheguy,Dont call me haters. But... El Salvador news.,"A country adopted bitcoin. Sure.

But... this is not a good country. Not that I have anything against them. This is just my perspective, as a mere mortal who might not be as experienced as most of you. But you are welcome to discuss in the comments.

There is two perspective when it comes to piggyback bitcoin.

Those who already well established and decided to adapt bitcoin, and those who are not and were hoping to win the crowd of bitcoin enthusiasts by announcing their businesses now ""accept"" bitcoin.. which they will straightaway convert to cash anyway.

When well established company supported bitcoin, like what Tesla did, that is a major fucking good news. Its like when you invented something, and then the freaking Queen Elizabeth said ""oh, I like that. its cool""... all hell break lose. But when a slow dead business trying to piggybacking bitcoin... its like taking advantage of our interests and support. Its not the Queen. Its the random stranger who thought ""thats cool""... and your life goes on. Worst, if its a thief, or maybe a scammer, or maybe a killer who approved what you did as cool... its bad for your brand.

While I am thankful to the idea of a freaking country adapt bitcoin as a whole.. This is just random stranger, and we hope, not a thief, scammer, or killer.

\[url=[https://artdeco.community](https://artdeco.community/)\] ARTDECO \[/url\] is launching an NFT Minting platform where Creators and NFT makers can mint and also a marketplace where BSC NFT tokens can be sold.

 \[img\]https://i.imgur.com/0iziurG.png\[/img\] 

What is An NFT?

It is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art, music, in-game items and videos. They can be bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos like Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

The NFT boom is in full force as big brands, celebrities, musician‚Äôs athletes are minting their own NFTs to capitalize on the latest crypto trend, making millions in the process. While as an art lover you may not be able to afford some of the NFTs they are selling.

&amp;#x200B;

ARTDECO is looking to (as highlighted on their whitepaper) to make it easy for anyone to mint their own NFTs that represent ownership in their digital work. On their Web 3.0 Dapp platform that utilizes the Binance Smart Chain.

&amp;#x200B;

It is worthy to note that the Elon Musk inspired ARTDECO NFT project will be a marketplace for those assets, as well as a distributed network built on Binance Network that enables NFT creators mint and trade NFTs without a middleman.

&amp;#x200B;

The tokens that creators generate on ARTDECO are known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

&amp;#x200B;

Each NFT is unique, and unlike bitcoin they are not interchangeable. This unique property is known as Non-fungibility, which is why tokens on ARTDECO are called non-fungible.

&amp;#x200B;

Central to the platform is ARTDECO, the platform‚Äôs cryptocurrency. By owning ARTDECO tokens (ARTDECO Contract Address) users can vote on proposals that affect the platform, moderate creators and curate featured artwork.

&amp;#x200B;

About ARTDECO

ARTDECO is a marketplace aiming to link sellers (typically content creators such as digital artists, model creators or meme makers) with buyers who can select pieces they wish to purchase. To turn their work into an NFT, creators must first ‚Äúmint‚Äù a token using ARTDECO‚Äôs Dapps. Similar to other tokens on Binance, the NFT can be transferred between wallets using ARTDECO‚Äôs software.

&amp;#x200B;

ARTDECO leverages the Binance blockchain to embed within an NFT‚Äôs code the full history of its owners and transactions. Of note, when a transaction goes through, both the buyer and the seller have to pay transaction fees that go to the ARTDECO network.

&amp;#x200B;

One interesting feature of NFTs is the ability to program royalties, or the rights to future cash flows, within these assets. This means that creators on ARTDECO can set a percentage of future sales and collect them automatically by issuing a token. This is a major feature drawing creators to this technology, because unlike with traditional content platforms, NFTs can be designed to pay out royalties immediately. For instance, if a piece of digital art listed a 10% royalty, the creator would receive 10% of any consequent sale of that art.

&amp;#x200B;

Artdeco is currently conducting a public sale of 10% of its Total Supply on Bounce Finance at the price of $0.0003. Buying possible from

The bailout of the central bank cannot save the global economy. Only by switching to the Bitcoin system can the world be saved.

nyrr22,bigmatch,A super bullish narrative is about to unfold?,"So, imagine if the BTC starts to reverse this week or next week, and break the 40K (and maybe a retouch of 38K and make it support). 

The narrative that countries making it a legal tender is pushing the price up. (This could be fundamentally true but whales and instis could also manipulate it into a reality). Either or, it is good for BTC.

That narrative for me is very strong. It is basically inviting countries into a money-making narrative. Like, nation leaders will see it as a good risk-and-reward good move up to the medium term, because they will believe that making it a legal tender, (it is not necessary that they make it as their national currency) will pump the price. 

Here is the point that I am pretty sure finance people will be able to explain to them. The first adopters always benefit more.

nyqwac,pashtun92,The future of BTC after 2140. What is the impact of the max supply cap?,"Dear all,

This is one part of BTC I have an issue with. The maximum supply cap is 21 million. However, for btc to function as a global reserve currency, it requires a steady flow of inflation. Otherwise the economy cannot function and the gap between the poor and rich become larger and larger. Allow me to explain.

Lets say there are 100 people in the world and there is aproximatly 1 dollar per person in the system. If this population grows to 200, but the money in the system stays the same, then there will only be 0.5 dollar per person in the system. This will result in inequility, because those that were first, will have more than those that come later. As time goes on the gap will grow larger and larger.

In my opinion it would be better to have a max supply of 21 million in say over ~20 years and after that a fixed inflation rate of ~2% per year.

Do you think things will work differently? What are your thoughts?

Best regards,

Pashtun",1623568082,123,1

Most being extremely enthusiastic about this technology or maximalists altogether I think we can agree that majority of our thoughts about finance involve Bitoin. Many conversations weve found oursleves in, we might not have had the technical prowess to fully articulate what this technology truly is, or explain it in a way that appeals to the interest of the person we were speaking with. 

I' been talking to my family about bitcoin for over a year now and I was looked at as a lunatic for a long time and laughed at. Due to my persistance of explanation in a compassionate way, I can see im making progress and they are beggining to get it. I am now bringing financial literacy on unimaginable levels to the people that care about me and that I love and it's amazing to see them actually understand what's going on. I could have got frustrated, pissed off, yelled at them,  got an argument about it, or kept quiet and deprive them of the single greatest thing that they could do for themselves, but but I chose to keep talking about it. I made that choice because I know what this is will do for humanity. I know what it will do for the world. 

If you seek to understand and are a student of satoshi, please tell people you love and care about what Bitcoin truly is.Don't let someone laughing at you stop you from saving them. Keep on bringing awareness to it. If your reading this, you care, and we need your help. Your people need you, the world needs you.",1623302196,20,1

ÊåñÂ§ö wƒÅ du≈ç is much better. Êåñ wƒÅ in Chinese means ""to dig"" or in the case of Bitcoin, ""to mine"". The verb Êåñ is actually used to describe the mining of Bitcoin. Â§ö du≈ç still means ""more"".

Could bitcoin do better?

I'm imagining a plague or asteroid that kills 99.9% of humans.  0.1% (7 million people) remain, but most forms of government and infrastructure are destroyed.

I believe under this scenario, bitcoin would fall out of use.   Mining would probably stop for many years.   2016 blocks have to be mined at the current difficulty level before a difficulty adjustment can happen, and with very few mining rigs operational, that probably isn't going to happen.  With no fast worldwide communication, all that mining probably has to happen in a single physical location too - making it even less likely.

Presented with the possibility of many years of a non-functional network, I can't see anyone deciding to keep using it as currency.

The fed prints money
The fed lends the money to the banks for a fee
Banks have shareholders who get paid in dividends
Banks lend that money out to customers for a fee
Customers buy things with that money
When they spend that money they have to buy from a business that uses a bank. If they do not eventually someone else will. 
That business pays a fee. 
That business adds the cost of the fees the bank charges in to its prices. 
So the customer is paying for the businesses bank account. 
The fed also buys assets like mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds. 
The bank charges the Fed a fee. Even if they did it for free the fee would be charged to the other customers.
The bank takes those fees to pay it‚Äôs costs of operation and debts to the federal reserve. 
Let‚Äôs not forget the bonuses!
Whatever is left over goes to shareholders in the form of dividends. 
Politicians are shareholders in the banks. 
Politicians voted to print more money to get everyone spending money. So the fed had to print more money and lend it out charging EVEN more fees causing prices to go up which means the people have to pay more! The more we spend the more fees get collected, the more the banks can afford to pay their shareholders and the more their earnings/share goes up. 

Now you have money you want to ‚Äúsave.‚Äù You give it to the bank. Because of fractional reserve banking they get to spend 90% of your money. The more they spend, the more fees they collect, the more dividends their shareholders get. When the pandemic hit and they started printing money they told the banks they could spend 100% of your money however they wanted. So EVEN MORE SPENDING, EVEN MORE FEES, EVEN MORE DIVIDENDS FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. Don‚Äôt forget a lot of politicians are invested in banks! Either directly or indirectly through ETFs and/or hedge funds or other means. 

Politicians vote to lend money or just give money to other countries. 
They lend them dollars. 
You need to use the same bank technology to spend those dollars in other countries. 
The bank gets a fee. Those dollars eventually end up with the bank and in their shareholders pockets in the form of dividends and earnings/share. Remember politicians are shareholders in banks! 

Now when a bank lends out money they charge a fee because of ‚Äúrisk.‚Äù 
Unless I‚Äôm wrong they take on 0 risk because if you have it in your bank account they still get to use it to spend and collect more fees. If you spend it they collect a fee. And who you spent it with will spend it for a fee or put it on his bank account and the cycle continues. 
And all those fees go in to share holders pockets. Politicians are shareholders in the banks 


Bitcoin eliminates the federal reserve and the need for banks. Less fees, cheaper prices, less politicians getting rich by passing laws

I now have a portfolio that I am very happy with and proud of, I now want to take a break completely and focus on myself, family, friends etc.. I have enough faith in Bitcoin to know that short term price movements are not relevant, I am here for the next decade, maybe even longer!

o0zqd4,Crafty_Supermarket15,"Bitcoin is a one time per sentient species event: what does digital scarcity mean, Bitcoin's ""Je Ne Sais Quoi,"" and the first and only digital land grab","Prior to the first Bitcoin block and the absolute scarcity that the network introduced to the world, every single object or resource in the physical realm had no absolute cap of availability.  But now we have Bitcoin, the first truly scarce ""thing"" known to man. And it just happens to be digital. Yet, what does this actually mean--an absolutely scarce digital thing? 

Well in my view, it is something that can happen only once. 

Here is a hacked together logical proof replete with logical errors and random commentary:

PROOF:

1.) Absolute scarcity is not possible in the physical realm (barring extinction of living creatures and plant life of course).

2.) Therefore, absolute scarcity can only occur in the digital realm.

3.) Since absolute scarcity can only occur in the digital realm, what is it about the digital realm that allows that scarcity? With adequate security, computers have the ability to execute immutable rules.

4.) Given that all computers with adequate security can execute immutable rules, what differentiates Bitcoin from ETH, Shibacoin, Fortnite V-Bucks,  Fedcoin, or RuneScape party hats? 

5.) Bitcoin is a decentralized consensus based P2P open source network with absolute scarcity as its founding principle. All of those other digital tokens are subject to the whims of their owners with varying degrees of centralization and unpredictability. 

Still, this isn't quite satisfying, is it? After all, couldn't this sub just make a new bitcoin called ""hodlcoin"" with a 3.1 million coin limit, using exactly the same software as the bitcoin protocol. Yep! Could every sub on reddit do the same thing? Yep!  Then we would have a trillion new coins floating around with 3.1 million coin limits for each sub protocol (dibs on WSBcoin) and some of the protocols would probably even be decentralized.

So what is that extra ""je ne sais quoi"" about Bitcoin that makes it unique? Bitcoin is both a **discovery and an invention**. **Satoshi invented Bitcoin and discovered absolute scarcity in the process as a byproduct** (the potential for which always existed in the digital realm).  This is why absolute scarcity cannot be replicated. The discovery has been made.

Interestingly enough, this also aligns with what the world needs. The world only needs 1 absolutely scarce digital asset because Bitcoin can effectively store decillions of dollars of USD value **right now**. The price of a bitcoin in USD is essentially meaningless to the network. 

So then, what does all this word salad mean? Pretty simple really. This is the age of the digital land grab. Those who understand Satoshi's discovery earliest will be the landed gentry of tomorrow. Those who don't, serfs servicing the robots that replaced them for one years salary.",1623830679,40,29

Bizarro world: The Fed states that inflation will rise this year and the next...and G-old crashes to $1,787 USD despite being over $1,900 this week.

How in the world is then G-old a ""hedge against inflation""?

After those statements G-old should've soared.

But instead it crashed just because of this: On the same breath they said they expect a n even higher inflation this year and the next... they dropped a 'hint' that they 'may' raise the interest rate... wait for it.. in two more years... in 2023!

And we all know that is a blatant lie. We know they can't ever raise rates again, on the contrary, they will go negative on the next years.

And that was enough to sent G-old tumbling?

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gold-tumbles-toward-1-800-an-ounce-after-fed-signals-higher-rates-and-ups-inflation-forecasts-11623926417?mod=mw_latestnews


&gt; **G-old tumbles to under $1,800 an ounce after Fed ups inflation forecasts but signals higher interest rates**

&gt; G-old futures were headed for their biggest one-day loss in months on Thursday, following a hawkish turn by the Federal Reserve.
&gt; 
&gt; While the Federal Open Market Committee held its policy interest rate steady and made no change to its asset buying program on Wednesday, it also signaled an interest rate rise soon than expected, with its forecasts suggesting two increases in 2023. And the Fed lifted its inflation forecasts for this year and next.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúHigher yields increase the opportunity cost of holding the non-interest-bearing g-old, and prospects of a further rise in yields should cap the upside potential in the yellow metal despite the rising inflationary pressures‚Äù

o2ua8y,Truthbelow,From the view of a new mainstream investor,"Mainstream Investor here that just entered crypto. 95% of my money is in ""safe"" index funds, Real Estate and even some Gold. But I just sold 5% of my index funds to invest in crypto. Why would I get into crypto now you may ask, when China is cracking down on it, when it's environmental impact seems to be critisized publicly increasingly, when it all seems to be sloping downwards?

The answer is simple and you probably heard it all before - but here are the points that spoke to me, Mr. Mainstream investor, and drove me to finally take the plunge:

1 - I intend to use it as a long term store of value, like Gold and a way to diversify, not so much as a currency. The argument of limited supply of Bitcoin makes sense to me and seems like a good inflation hedge. ESPECIALLY if it gets outlawed and made more difficult to mine, in my mind this increases the value. Just look at other outlawed things like drugs, ivory etc. - while it may be ethically wrong, the value of these things increase as it gets outlawed as it is harder to get. In fact, the best way to fight drugs is to legalize them. So I am not to worried about the crypto crack down and instead welcome the drop these news are causing for me to get in.

2 - I was very sceptical of the transactional legitimacy of crypto in general, until Coinbase went public, Paypal made it available and generally other well-known companies started introducing it. That's when I finally started to trust the process, to actually put in my credit card numbers in an exchange to make the purchase. So even if it gets outlawed or frowned upon in other areas, the transactional trust is there now.

3 - By the time Bitcoin and crypto in general caught my attention, there were new all time highs every day. I don't like to buy at all-time highs. So I was lurking these forums for months without doing anything, waiting for an opportunity to finally get in. This opportunity is now, so I would say, expect a ton more people like me to enter the playing field soon. This should help stabilize the prices and make it less volatile, as the ratio of gamblers and day traders slowly shifts toward long term index fund type investors like me.

So yeah tldr I think there will be a wave of new retail investors like me that have been lurking for quite some time who will finally be loading up on this dip.",1624035835,59,14

o2rghy,rougetoxicity,What's your quick 2 min explanation/justification for bitcoin when uneducated people ask?,"How do you explain bitcoin quickly and easily for someone who doesn't know anything about it. Just the other day my wife said these two things... I did my best to try to explain, but I feel like I don't talk about it enough to be able to speak too intelligently on it.

""I just don't get it... its just fake digital money... there's nothing backing it up""

I replied that this is no different than our ""real"" money. The gold standard ended long ago, so there is nothing backing up our money anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

""They are just creating it out of thin air, as least money is real""

Money is only real in the fact that you can actually still carry around a 20$ bill. Most of our money is digital already anyway. Bitcoin is actually better as far as creating it out of thin air goes... the government can create more money whenever they want, but there is a strict protocol when it comes to creating bitcoins... 

&amp;#x200B;

""So where do new bitcoins come from?""

Bitcoin is built on a system of solving complex mathematical problems to establish security in transactions. These calculations take a ton of computer power, so people that ""mine"" bitcoin are really just the people validating the transactions. New bitcoins are created when blocks of these calculations get completed. The people that completed the calculations are awarded a set amount of new bitcoins. This is what makes them so valuable. There is a limited supply.""",1624029453,88,5

o2rf00,gianniconfalone1,What happens to traditional investing post mass adoption?," So I've got a position in bitcoin, but I don't want to make it 100% of my portfolio as some radicals in the community suggest; like Michael Saylor. (who I respect, but don't want to replicate his investment strategy) What sectors do you think will survive, or thrive if bitcoin has mass adoption and will cause long term deflation of assets, as well as demonetizing certain commodities.  I'm specifically curious about the real estate sector, even more specifically in canada. As everyone from canada knows the GTA is still in a real estate bubble. And if we believe that bitcoin will demonetize real-estate; then companies like Riocan, who have predominately GTA based assets, will be worth a fraction of what they are now?   


  If thats true then 2 more questions: 1) what assets are left to protect against all these issues (currency collapse/ bitcoin mass adoption witch introduces deflation and demonetization). (other than bitcoin, cause as i said i don't want to go 100%)  And second, Why did BAM buy up a bunch of properties last year in the US. Do they know something we dont?

so having the chance to add a disposable message in the tx cryptographically verifiable will let miners perfectly know how much fees are being providad by the UASF signaling

and who knows what other applicationg this might have in the future. I guess might be useful

nvc76y,Common_Individual251,"The FBI did not HACK bitcoin, if they DID the entire economy will probably crash","What we know is that the Hackers used a combination of P2WSH and P2WPKH addresses, P2WPKH addresses are native segwit addresses locked to the hash of a public key and P2WSH are native segwit addresses locked to the hash of a redeem script(multi sig).

&amp;#x200B;

For the FBI to break a P2WPKH address with no outs, both the hashing algorithm ripemd160 and sha256 would both need to be broken by them. and for the FBI to break P2WSH they would need to be able to break sha256.

If the FBI are indeed able to break sha256 and ripemd160, then there is a simple way for the hackers to prove sha256/ripemd160 is broken, and the only way to prevent these hackers from proving it would be by killing them or detaining them.. (which kind of defeats the purpose of the FBI hacking their bitcoin if they already caught the culprits).

&amp;#x200B;

All the hackers need to do to prove that the FBI has broken sha256 and ripemd160 is to spend from the ""hacked"" address again. if they do this then it 99.9999...% proves sha256/ripemd160 is broken and that we're all fucked, why?

There are a little less than 2\^256 bitcoin possible public keys in existence, a P2WPKH address is basically la 160bit hash of a 256 bit hash of a public key.

the pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m boxes where n&gt;m, then there must be a box with more than one item.

So if there are 2\^256 public keys and 2\^160 available addresses, then every address should have multiple corresponding public keys, about 2\^(256-160) or 2\^96 public keys correspond to each address.

what this means is that if the FBI can quickly and efficiently perform pre-image collision attacks on bitcoin due to some flaw or backdoor in both ripemd160 and sha256 then it is extremely unlikely- 1 in 2\^96 times unlikely that they would have produced the same public key that maps to the respective segwit address. this means that the hacker can just spend from the address again and reveal a non matching public key to the previous transaction and reveal to the world the first ever instance of a Pre-image ripemd160 hash collision. even sha1 which had its first successful collision attack in 2017 has never been successfully pre-image attacked, it's a difference of 2\^80 collision resistance and 2\^160 preimage collision resistance.

In the case of P2WSH it is just as unlikely if not more unlikely to produce a redeem script that matches exactly the hackers redeem script with the same sha256 hash.

&amp;#x200B;

Now if the FBI has quantum computers and can break ECDSA Secp256k1 and decided to steal their coins this way, that also means they can steal over 2 million mined bitcoin aka most of satoshi bitcoins, because back in the early days of bitcoin 2009 as far as 2011 most of the newly generated coinbases were locked into P2PK addresses which means that their public keys are visible on the public ledger and not protected by any cryptographic hashing function. and since Satoshi will probably never move his coins himself, when they do start moving you can be assured that someone now has quantum computers capable of breaking all of public-key cryptography (with the exception of newer quantum resistance algorithms)

&amp;#x200B;

side note: if ripemd160 and sha256 aren't broken and the FBI simply bruteforced it, then they would probably need a super computer that can computer hashes 57,896,044,618,658,097,711,785,492,504,343,953,926,634,992,332,819,972,534,718,970,658,887,840,038,912 times faster than the current bitcoin mining network

By the time some lucky person or group manages to perform a preimage attack on ripemd160 bitcoin would already have been upgraded to be resistant to it.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr the FBI has not broken bitcoin, it can easily be proven if they did and upon being proven everything that relies on crytography e.g the entire financial system, the internet would be completely vulnerable to attack

First of all, they want you to believe Russian hackers used a cloud server to house their private key. Lol ok!

Second, MSM coverage of this is deliberately vague and superficial, using the term ""Bitcoin account"" and not Bitcoin wallet.

Why? Because they want to run with the narrative that they broke into an actual Bitcoin wallet. Non-coiners and even some newcoiners will not know the difference.

Third, how do you like the timing of this? Jack Mallers Twitter gets blocked the day after El Salvador announcement, with signs entire Latin America may follow. Then FBI ""break"" Bitcoin wallet security. The press release was absolutely pathetic as if they managed to pull off some white hat gymnastics to nab the bitcoins.

FBI sequestered the private key information from the hosting service provider. My theory at first was it was either this or a centralized exchange wallet.

Centralized services must comply or they will be shut down. They're not Bitcoin's allies. They're obligate allies of the petrodollar tyranny.

Guess who else uses centralized hosting services in crypto? Pretty much the entire Ethereum network, all of the measly 3000 nodes. Bitcoin's L2 protocol Lightning Network has 21000 nodes!

&amp;#x200B;

That journalist who reported that the FBI ""cracked the private key"" probably bought the dip. If he didn't, then he should be fired because if he's that stupid, he's unqualified to cover Bitcoin.

The FBI should thank Satoshi because the Bitcoin blockchain allowed them to trace the hacker which they would not be able to when bad actors use the petrodollar.

So a pretty lame FUD in the end. Govt/state/national security level attacks are the boss battle for Bitcoin. We didn't come this far to lose the boss battle.

You wouldn't believe the things I've seen some people do for this paper that is melting in value faster and faster every day.

I don't know if you've heard of it, but the cultish behavior around it is crazy. I've literally seen people die over this thing; rob people of their lives over it, and in most cases, rob people of all their time over this thing.

Heck, I've seen my country go to war with poor countries over this thing, killing hundreds of thousands of impoverished people from poor countries just to protect their paper dollar when its world reserve petra dollar currency status is threatened even slightly.

It's a sad thing to see when a society is so enamored with a currency that is failing that they will literally work all their lives until their dying day just to try and save what little they can of it, meanwhile, it loses value so fast that everything they need to buy to just to live keeps costing them more and more of this worthless currency that they're struggling and slaving away to save. It's so worthless, that most cannot even afford to save meaningful quantities of it fast enough to keep up with the rate that it loses value. Hell, in reality, most have to take credit just to get by because this thing loses value so fast. Some end up taking loans so large that they can never pay it off in a whole lifetime of work, making them in a sense serfs, or in other translations of the word serfdom: debt slaves.

You'd think people would realize their currency is shit when lifelong debt is oftentimes their only option to get a roof over their heads or an education, yet everyone in my country loves this paper dollar so much they can't see beyond the charade of its ""In God We Trust"" and cultish image inscriptions like that pyramid with the eye on top.",1623174658,239,1

nv9pl7,arizona_lawsfacts,Is anyone aware of the suspicious circumstances surrounding bitcoin's drop?,"About 3 days ago there was news that El Salvador was going to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. As of yesterday, news broke out that the Department of Justice cracked down on a ransomware attack on Colonial and retrieved $2.3 million worth of bitcoin. At the same time, the Scotland Yard announced that bitcoin needs to be regulated to stop money laundering. These PR announcements sparked a panic with regular investors who did not want to be part of the ""money laundering/extortion"" picture. 

It just seems suspicious with the timing of these reports. All of them happened soon after the El Salvadorian president said that his country is ready to adopt bitcoin. Bitcoin was portrayed as some kind of savior to an underdeveloped country and then the next day the US media released negative news. They must've studied Elon Musk's affect on bitcoin's value, because they also quoted Trump calling bitcoin a ""scam.""",1623173827,33,1

My basic understanding of one use case for Bitcoin is that as the US dollar is devalued through policy and/or outside factors, BTC will rise as a main store of value due to the underlying security of blockchain technology and increased perceived value. Some commentors seem to also extend that thinking into Bitcoin becoming a globally used currency due to these, and other, factors.

I have a different perspective on the reality of the situation the world would be facing if the USD were to lose it's place and not have been replaced by another government-backed currency  (or at least one I haven't seen lurking here since last August). 

The amount of destabilization that would imply, and given the fragility of current geopolitics, that seems like it would mean war (somewhere/somehow). If there is a major conflict of some sort, or equivalent destabilizing force, would people really all pile their money into ""digital gold""?",1623173313,9,1

ny9itl,Etovia,How to crack additional passphrase (like for Trezor or Electrum?),"There is a seed (the one used in Trezor, so, 24 words), and the ""additional passphrase"" let's call it AP.

The AP was wrongly entered (twice) when generating the address (on trezor.io). The resulting address was verified on the computer screen (trezor.io) as well on the Trezor device using the function to show full address - addr1.
The address was of form ""3..."" that is wrapped segwit. 

Now when starting Trezor and entering what user thinks is the same AP, another wallet opens - with ballance 0 (while addr1 did received funds, verified it onchain).
That wallet shows other address, let's call it addr2, as the first address (derivation ""\0"") and does not have the address addr1 in old addresses (there are no old addresses) nor in ""new addresses"" (in \1 \2 etc.)

It seems user entered his AP incorrectly twice.
Let's cay it is around 14 characters, from 2 dictionary words and 2 digits on end.
User remembers the 2 words, and the number, but other wallet with other addresses is generated so he must be mistaken, right?
Trezor was original from vendor (not some re-seller or ebay).

How long would it take to try some kinds of misspelling, e.g. duplicated character or omited character?

How long for entire [a-z]{11-13}[0-9]{2} more or less? months? years?

On an energy per material (J/Kg) basis, nuclear fission is significantly higher compared to fossil fuels and renewables. The only thing keeping nuclear expensive has been **delusional** **regulations**.

For the past 50 years, there hasn't been an urgent motivator to develop ultra-cheap energy sources. But thanks to Bitcoin's massive network running Proof of Work, there is A LOT of financial interest in finding the **cheapest** energy resource.

Once several countries realize that they can radically deregulate nuclear with functionally no additional risk, there will be a global race to build bare bones Light Water Reactors to provide ultra-cheap energy for highly profitable Bitcoin mining.

Once energy becomes $10/MWhe, carbon sequestration will become **profitable** by means of producing carbon-neutral synthetic fuels and carbon-negative plastics.

This transition would mean that **more** global economic growth would lead to **negative** CO2 emissions.

We'll never recover from a 40% drop performed by over-leveraged idiots, wanna-be-memelords, oblivious and mislead ESG-FUDsters, and the 90% of ""investors"" who don't understand any of the actual technology and potential. Retail paper hands are still being played by pros, institutions and whales, meanwhile fundamentals are objectively getting stronger every day.

Now, while I'm at it: ""But what about Alts, BTC is old, slow, dumb and expensive!"". If there was anything to improve about Bitcoin it would be done (and is being done, BIPs and forks are a thing), majority decides what's best and what should be changed, and Bitcoin is democratically the best and being improved constantly (Not efficient enough? Segwit, Taproot, Lightning. Not smart enough? [Drivechain](https://www.drivechain.info/), Taproot again. Not safe enough? It's the safest currency on earth already.). Now if that's not convincing you, think about what happens if Bitcoin actually got flippened. Do you think this new #1 will never be overtaken by another, even better successor? Of course it will eventually. So why would you invest into that time bomb? If Bitcoin fails, crypto as a whole fails, and I can't see that fate for either at this advanced stage.

May I repeat at this point, it has literally become a legal tender, is being adopted by more and more private, public and government institutions worldwide, and the market barely cares, whilst dropping massively due to dog-tweets, imaginary FBI-""hacks"", usual China-banning and other random FUD. Ignore that noise of stupidity and manipulation. I'm personally not distraught about such bear phases, my weekly DCA brings in more Sats speeding up my way to a whole coin, but I'm worried about those of you who are scared.

At the most basic level, the blockchain is a chain of digital information blocks in which information (‚Äúblock‚Äù) is stored in a public database (‚Äúchain‚Äù).

# Story

Since the rise of personal computers and then the Internet, innovative resources have been developing steadily. One day, when it combined correctly, all these techs have led to the creation of a revolutionary technology such as blockchain:

During the 90s, various works on decentralized solutions for electronic payments appeared. As a result, the technology allowed transferring funds without the need to be dependent on any central supervisory or regulatory body. In 1991, the first work on secure blockchain appeared. The mechanisms described there were developing until Wei Dai described a decentralized solution for electronic payments based on public-key cryptography in 1998.

Meanwhile, someone under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto publishes... [read more!](https://guarda.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-blockchain/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=bitcoin-whats-blockchain)

# Benefits

* Speed. The absence of central authorities or intermediaries makes information available to all the network participants. Simplification of the data transfer process entails higher speed in the management of any information.
* Lower cost. It is cheap, not only because it reduces the overload process by eliminating intermediaries, but also because it makes it possible to optimize processes and communication. Thanks to blockchain technology, direct communication between systems and devices allow making the execution of operations more optimized.

**1&gt; China banning mining and Bitcoin transactions:** This is good for Bitcoin in the long term due to higher mining decentralization. Of course there is a short term sell off by miners who are moving to different locations, panic sellers and people using this to short Bitcoin.

One of China's biggest miners sent  this message after shutting off his Sichuan machines.  ""This is good news. There is no policy that can influence Bitcoin""

**2&gt; Macro economic factors in US economy:** In general overall market is not confident because of overvalued stocks and possible interest rates hike. Fed just said they continue to print 120 billion per month and they have no plans to raise interest rates until 2023. 

Remember technology is 10x deflationary. Even if there will be inflation, it will be temporary and technology will continue to bring the prices down. Which means Fed will continue to print money to keep the prices up. Printing more money means more debt, rising inequality. There is no way out of this and Bitcoin is the solution for people looking for the way out of this system.

o4xeva,eneskaraboga,"People who think TA does not work, please shut up","TA --&gt; Technical Analysis. So you are analyzing something, right? Shouldn't we analyze the data we have before making decisions?

Just because somebody's analysis didn't work doesn't mean TA does not work. Telling TA does not work is like saying math, biology, neuroscience do not work because sometimes scientists are wrong as well!   


TA and other types of analysis are a must for a healthy trading/investing business. We are not trying to guess what's gonna happen, we are just trying to increase our chances of success. Some people do it well, most don't.  


If you wanna pick one investment, say, Bitcoin and invest all you got. That's fine and you are probably safe in the long term. But, do not make comments on the stuff you have no idea. Just because you don't understand how it works does not mean it is not valid.  


I have been making a living out of TA and really don't like seeing uneducated ideas and shitting on something they don't understand and discourage people from analyzing data.   


No matter how you analyze (ta, fa, on-chain), you gotta learn to deal with numbers and charts if you want to make this working. Otherwise, buy whenever you feel like it and don't shit on people's work or careers.

o56jqy,Great_ass_n_titties,Common musings of a new bitcoin HOdLer.,"I became a Bitcoin maximalist 6 months ago. I started buying it at $30k and kept buying it till $62k when I ran out of all my savings. I am a HODLer. I have spent a lot of time reading and understanding bitcoin. I have also spent time reading the arguments for and against it. And I feel like very few people, if any, truly understand what Bitcoin is and how it works. Following are my thoughts and honest opinions on some of the most common questions and arguments I come across online. I don't claim to be an expert, so read it with a huge grain of salt. 

1.	Is this a bull or a bear market?

Don't know, and don't care. Bitcoin is not for trading. It is for holding. 

2.	 Can bitcoin actually fail and some other crypto become more more successful?

Maybe. It is certainly not outside the realm of possibility. 

3.	So why HODL?

Because I believe that it will not fail. Part of this belief is pure conviction, but majority of it is based on the timeline and on the tech, as well as human psychology. Believe it or not, a big reason bitcoin is unlikely to fail is because HODLs refuse to sell. Ever. 

4.	Is there anything that can convince HODLs like me to sell?

Aside from critical financial emergency, no.

5.	Do you know you are batshit crazy?
Yes.

6.	Are you not worried about losing all your savings?

No. I truly believe that bitcoin will not fail, so I am not worried.

7.	Do you realize you might be part of a cult?

Yes. 

8.	Aren't you worried you've been brainwashed?

No. My conviction stems from the effort I put into understanding Bitcoin and to an extent, modern economy. It made sense. I couldn't make it **not** make sense. And so I was convinced this is the right decision.

9.	Are you sure you won't regret this decision?

No, I might regret it. But I'm ok with that possibility. If there is any huge risk I am comfortable with taking, it is this. Nothing else has ever made more sense to me. 

10. Are you a libertarian or a conservative?

No. I'm a liberal.

11. Then don't you care about the environmental impact?

I do. But I believe the energy consumption is worth it. And I think this will become more evident as adoption increases. We don't question the energy consumption of banks precisely because way more people have bought into it. But the underlying infrastructure takes the same effort regardless of how many people adopt it. 

12. Do you think everyone will use bitcoin at some point?

No. Bitcoin is not user-friendly. It is not intuitive. 

13. Aside from money, what other reason do you have to put so much time and faith into this technology?

Because I can see that if it succeeds, Bitcoin will drive us into the next phase of technological progress. You cannot put a price on the value of **truth**, and bitcoin enables you to transaction with truth as money.",1624312219,20,1

Make sure to check them out! (Please do your own research)  


[VersoView](https://versoview.com) **/ VVT**

The first engagement platform with meaningful token-sized rewards: VersoView. Make sure to read my post to find out why their token $VVT is a must-have. 

VersoView is the home of PER technology. The future of how we Publish, Engage and Reward. Their goal is to build a bridge between the traditional business world and blockchain. In this post I will make you find out about this amazing project that will be a big factor in a huge change when it comes to creating digital content.

It's an organization with a team that's very experienced in the necessary areas to be able to built such a project as VersoView. 

Some recent announcements to show you how serious VersoView actually is:

* The $VVT just got listed on Bittrex. Bittrex Global‚Äôs premier trading platform is designed for those who grasp the power of blockchain‚Äôs promise, and want to be a part of the movement.  
 
* They just released their new website. The website expresses a whole new, improved and refreshing vibe which clarifies that this project is serious. 

  
The things that are coming:

* Versoview is finishing up their white paper. This full white paper will have over 70 pages (heard from a reliable source in their telegram).  
 
* There is a new staking program coming.

Versoview is a project that keeps surprising me with the steps they make and I am 100% sure their growth won‚Äôt stop. Make sure to check out their social media pages and new website to see why this project and their $VVT token are interesting

Vitalik Buterin and others have pointed out Tether, and now it‚Äôs becoming painfully obvious that something is going to happen on that front.  (Just google ‚Äútether leverage crypto‚Äù or something like that) My worry is that it‚Äôs really bad timing.  To reaffirm, I‚Äôm in it for the long term, but this is going to be annoying for a very long time.

1. This is going to make adoption in the short term a very hard sell for financial institutions and governments.  For every critic who said it was all a Ponzi Scheme, in a way when the truth about Tether fully comes out, it may be fairly true.  However tether was the Ponzi scheme that used the crypto environment to its advantage.  This will be impossible to explain to anyone who hates crypto.

2. Hopefully, very new adopters (el Salvadorans) hadn‚Äôt put in a bunch money to lose 60%+ in their first month.  The real human impact for people is often forgotten here.

3. I think every crypto investor needs to take a step back and ask, ‚Äúhow did this happen, how can we keep it from happening again?‚Äù

Overall, cryptocurrency and blockchain perform a basic function using less people, energy, time and complexity than every other rival system.  It will win out.  Finance wants it, governments want it, people want it.

o5nho5,jayfrostman,Hardware Wallets vs. Cold Storage Wallet | Which one is better and safe?,"The cryptocurrency boom has been going on for years and with it, there has also been a rise in the types of cryptocurrency wallets.

Being able to discern the differences between various types of wallets can be quite difficult.

Most users often opt for software, cloud, cold storage, or hardware wallets. While software and cloud storage wallets are self-explanatory,

it is normal to be confused between hardware and cold storage wallets.

**COLD STORAGE WALLET**

A cold storage wallet is used to keep all of your Bitcoins encrypted in a piece of hardware that resembles a wallet.

The data can only be accessed with explicit authorization from the end of the cryptocurrency holder.

**HARDWARE WALLET**

A hardware wallet, on the other hand, lets you store your encryption keys to access your Bitcoin.

A crypto hardware wallet makes use of hardware only to let users access their data. On the other hand,

cold storage wallets require both software and hardware authorization making them far more secure than traditional storage options.

**Why Use Cold Storage Wallets?**

One of the biggest reasons why you should opt for hardware wallets is that you do not need to rely on third-party ownership of funds.

Most online services essentially make you store all of your cryptocurrency in the hands of third parties. But with hardware wallets,

you essentially create your own mini bank. With cryptocurrency being the hot topic in everyone‚Äôs mouths recently, you do not want to take any risks.

There are quite a few cold storage wallet providers but one of the brands that have managed to live up to expectations is [ELLIPAL](https://www.ellipal.com/?rfsn=5833167.54d011).

They have been offering cold storage wallets for quite some time and there are plenty of options to choose from to keep your cryptocurrency safe.

If you happen to be looking for a cold storage wallet that has best in class technology you should check out the [ELLIPAL Titan](https://www.ellipal.com/?rfsn=5833167.54d011) which protects you from both physical and online attacks.",1624369445,0,1

Is Bitcoin's price volatile? Yes.

Does Bitcoin's price volatility matter to long-term, buy-and-hold investors/owners? No.

Do many people know what Bitcoin actually is, and the basics of how it works? No.

Did criminal bankers go to jail for causing the 2008/9 crisis? No, they got paid huge bonuses from the bailout money.

Did anything significant get fixed as a result of 2008/9. No. In fact, today's situation is even worse than then.

Are banker bailouts still happening? Apparently: recent Fed repo activities... looks like some Too Big To Fail / Too Big To Jail entity is insolvent. Stay tuned.

Is the economy doing well? For the top one-tenth of one percent, yes. For the rest, the bottom 99.9% - with few exceptions, no.

There are many factors at play here including the federal reserve becoming more hawkish in their economic rhetoric, thus leading to contractions in the price of commodities and the tendency of investors to move away from risk-on assets. Also, the cryptocurrency space tends to follow the price action of Bitcoin and currently Bitcoin is receiving FUD surrounding China deciding to effectively ban Bitcoin mining and trading within the country. 

What many people don't realize is that China doing this reinforces why having a permissionless free monetary system like Bitcoin is important in the face of totalitarian governments. There's also a silver lining in that Bitcoin mining moving out of China alleviates some of the concerns people had about China's control over the Bitcoin network through its hashpower and its use of dirty energy to facilitate its production. With mining moving out of China, the network hash power should gravitate towards more democratic and clean energy providers thus strengthening the security and ethical consumption of the network. Regardless, having a monetary technology that frees us from the theft of our value through inflation by Central banks is a huge step forward in my opinion and is worth the energy needed to provide that in a secure and transparent fashion.

o5mwdd,_kr_saurabh,"Hedgeye: This Model Predicts Bitcoin at $1,000,000"," **Analysts at Hedgeye Risk Management, an investment research and financial media company based in Stamford, Connecticut, have analyzed the Bitcoin stock-to-flow argument. This framework suggests Bitcoin‚Äôs price potentially reaching $1 million by the latter half of the 2020s and as much as $10 million per BTC by the 2030s.** 

**At its recent peak, Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap hit $1.2 trillion. To give you some perspective, that‚Äôs bigger than the four largest banks in the United States** ***combined*** **(JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citi, Wells Fargo), as well as the four largest payments platforms combined (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square).**

**As most long-term holders understand, a confluence of critical factors will continue to aid in the proliferation of crypto adoption across the world.**

**Among them:**

* ***Corporations accepting payments via cryptocurrencies***
* ***Institutions holding crypto on their balance sheets***
* ***Asset managers creating new investment vehicles (at the time this was written, there are eight money managers with pending Bitcoin ETF applications)***
* ***The debasement of the U.S. Dollar***
* ***Increasing distrust in centralized political and monetary institutions***

**The list goes on and on.**  


**Analysts at Hedgeye Risk Management, an investment research and financial media company based in Stamford, Connecticut, have analyzed the Bitcoin stock-to-flow argument ‚Äì in line with their approach of observing financial markets through a** ***quantitative*** **lens (which is noticeably devoid of qualitative, narrative-based ‚Äúcalls‚Äù).**

**This framework suggests Bitcoin‚Äôs price potentially reaching** **$1 million by the latter half of the 2020s and as much as $10 million per BTC by the 2030s****.**

**Hedgeye was founded in 2008 by former buy-side analysts to democratize access to hedge-fund quality investment research for everyday investors. To expand the scope of its research process, Hedgeye‚Äôs Macro team created an exhaustive, daily quantitative dashboard on a range of cryptocurrencies and ETFs, aptly named the ‚Äú****Bitcoin Trend Tracker****‚Äù.**

**This ‚ÄúCrypto Quant‚Äù dashboard breaks down the 1) Price 2) Volume and 3) Volatility among several other metrics of each asset it tracks. (You can watch Hedgeye Macro analyst Christian Drake‚Äôs 30-minute explainer video on how to use the Tracker** **here****).**

**The goal is simple: Give investors the same high-quality quantitative data for cryptocurrencies available for other asset classes, reflective of the reality that crypto is** ***here to stay*****. The ‚ÄúBitcoin Trend Tracker‚Äù is no different from Hedgeye‚Äôs other proprietary tools which utilize market-based signalling to stay ahead of large movements in any asset.**

**In addition, one of Hedgeye‚Äôs analysts, Josh Steiner, has also performed a fundamental analysis by comparing the Stock-to-Flow model of Bitcoin to that of other hard assets and comparing the evolution of Bitcoin‚Äôs price to that Stock-to-Flow framework. Below is a summary of that analysis.**

**To be clear, it should go without saying that numerous, legitimate risks exist to being long Bitcoin. Smart investors need to be mindful of these risks. They run the gamut and include potential regulatory risk, as well as competitive and technological risk. Anyone who owns Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency for that matter) needs to be mindful of these potential land mines and risk manage them accordingly.**

**The idea here is a simple one,‚Äù Steiner explains.**

**‚ÄúIf you look at the ratio of outstanding supply relative to the flow rate of that supply, you can get the stock-to-flow ratio. Bitcoin‚Äôs** ***Stock-to-Flow*** **ratio is currently 54x; roughly 344,000 BTC are being mined annually on an outstanding base of about 18.6 million BTC.**

**But what‚Äôs remarkable about Bitcoin is that it possesses a pre-programmed creation-decline roughly every \~4 years; during each of these events, the reward for mining Bitcoin is cut in half.**

**That means the** ***Stock-to-Flow*** **ratio is poised to increase logarithmically, roughly 10-fold, every 12 years.**

**To put that in perspective, by 2036 we should be at a** ***Stock-to-Flow*** **ratio of approximately 1000x ‚Äì or more than 10x the stock-to-flow of Housing (93x) or Gold (72x). By 2048, there will be another 10-fold increase, which would take the** ***Stock-to-Flow*** **up to 10,000x.‚Äù**

 **In plain English, Bitcoin is mathematically designed to exponentially increase its** ***Stock-to-Flow*** **ratio until it ultimately mathematically converges toward infinity. This is both relative to its current state and relative to other hard-money assets like Housing and Gold. A higher Stock-to-Flow ratio indicates that less new supply is entering the market relative to an asset‚Äôs existing, outstanding supply.**

**In other words, an asset with a higher Stock to Flow ratio should, relative to other assets, retain its value better over the long term. In a world of easy money and U.S. Dollar debasement, it‚Äôs easy to understand Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal as not just a hard-money asset, but as an ultra-hard-money asset. Unlike real estate and gold, which have high, but relatively static, Stock-to-Flow multiples, Bitcoin‚Äôs Stock-to-Flow ratio will keep increasing exponentially for the next 100+ years.**

**Steiner circles back to the abiding issue mentioned earlier, the impact on price.**

**In the chart below, Steiner plots a time series of Bitcoin‚Äôs price (y-axis) versus the** ***Stock-to-Flow*** **ratio as it changes over time (x-axis) out through 2057. Perhaps most importantly, the black dots in the right-hand chart reflect Bitcoin‚Äôs historical price versus the theoretical progression implied by the Stock-to-Flow ratio‚Ä¶** ***and it has followed the model very closely thus far.***

 **With over two decades of investing analysis under his belt, Steiner used every regression analysis in the book to model Bitcoin‚Äôs future price. The best fit‚Äîby far‚Äîwas a power function. The graphs shown are logarithmic; Bitcoin‚Äôs price appreciation has been‚Äîand may continue to be‚Äîlogarithmic.**

**‚ÄúEvery 10-fold increase in Bitcoin‚Äôs** ***Stock-to-Flow*** **ratio, which will happen every \~12 years going forward, has produced a \~1,000-fold increase in Bitcoin‚Äôs price. And that hasn‚Äôt happened once, but twice.‚Äù**

**Steiner explains that he has yet to see another asset behave this way, even after a multi-decade career on both the buy-side and sell-side of Wall Street covering Financials, Housing, and Macro.**

**In the spirit of full transparency, Steiner isn‚Äôt keeping his model a secret. The equation for the theoretical progression of Bitcoin‚Äôs price (relative to its** ***Stock-to-Flow*****) is** ***y=1.3268x2.4769*****.**

***That equation forecasts Bitcoin to hit $1 million by the latter half of the 2020s, and $10 million per*** ***BTC*** ***by the late 2030s.***

 **Of course,** ***Stock-to-Flow*** **is not the** ***only*** **factor that will influence cryptocurrency prices going forward. The goal of the model is to prove how Bitcoin** ***intrinsically*** **could achieve these price levels.**

**Furthermore, not everyone plans to be a long-term holder of cryptocurrencies. Many people use crypto in various transactions, or to store value but later realize it again, among numerous other use-cases.**

Hedgeye aims **to add a quantitative framework for investing in cryptocurrencies, for both short-duration traders and long-duration investors alike.**

**Investors can now gain a better understanding of the short-term and long-term movements and correlations that alter the near-term trajectory for various cryptocurrencies and crypto-related ETFs. In other words, Hedgeye is injecting transparency into what will presumably be a massive asset class that one day could rival equities, fixed income and foreign exchange.**",1624367698,8,1

o48yhh,Ricknad0,Any Reason Other Than User Error Why Seed Phrase Won't Recover (Trezor T),"Not a big deal because this is a practice device, but I recently had a Trezor T have a critical error during a firmware update. The whole device erased during the process. I have two copies of my recovery phrase, and went through Trezor's seed verification process during the original setup. It's saying that it's an invalid seed phrase.

I tried it multiple times on the same device. I tried a new Trezor T as well. I also tried to recover in Electrum, though I'm not super familiar with using Electrum. I think I got the derivation path right, but here's another detail. I used this Trezor T to set up a wallet with Trezor's website, as well as setting up a single sig wallet with Specter via MyNode. Each had a different derivation path. 

There were no funds on this device, but some transaction history, and Electrum didn't show any transaction history on either derivation path (I'm not sure if Electrum would show this). I can send and receive funds on both wallets via Electrum, but I don't know if I've essentially created a new wallet with this phrase. I don't see any transactions appearing on my single-sig Specter wallet, which is now inaccessible because the Trezor device cannot sign (again, no funds, so no panic here).

So that's a long way around to say, is there any reason a seed phrase would show as ""invalid"" on the Trezor devices, or is this clearly an error on my part when I wrote down the see phrase?",1624205355,14,1

Bitcoin is not a currency, it is an asset. Holding to the moon only makes the issue worse. My fair price for Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt exist because it is a game and not a currency.

Bitfarms ($BITF), based out of Canada, is a Bitcoin mining company. They just IPO'd on the nasdaq Monday. Currently trading around $4.50 per share. They' mined 11,300 BTC since 2017. All mining operations use 100% renewable energy.

SOS Limited ($SOS), based out of China, just recently got involved in crypto. They have recently entered into a joint venture with Niagra development LLC, based out of New Jersey (US), to begin BTC mining operations in the U.S. They have ETH rigs still in China unaffected by the crackdown. More than 90% of their crypto mining rigs use renewable energy. They are also in the process of developing a digital currency exchange (like a Coinbase). And use Blockchain technology for their emergency services offered in China. Currently trading around $3.40 a share. They confirmed Q1 mining produced 42 BTC and 918 ETH.

o62vfl,Long_Chard9727,Bitcoin was snatched up after its plunge! The bulls stage a short-selling market?,"Yesterday, Bitcoin investors once again ushered in a bitter blow. The highest drop of Bitcoin yesterday reached more than 10%, which put the recently fragile investors into an endless plunge again, which is really tragic! Yesterday‚Äôs liquidation figures also reached a new high. The number of liquidation exceeded 200,000, which is a high record in the near future!

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday‚Äôs sudden drop was triggered by the news. Yesterday morning, Bitcoin maintained an upward trend. However, due to the impact of sudden bad news in the afternoon, Bitcoin began to plunge sharply, and investors did not respond at all. Coming over, all followed the dive of Bitcoin and there was a stampede sell-off, which led to the crazy dive of Bitcoin!

&amp;#x200B;

It was not until the close of the evening that Bitcoin began to rebound, from a drop of more than 10% to about 4%. However, the mysterious capital of Bitcoin entered the market last night, which led to a rapid increase of 6% in a short period of time! It is worth noting that the CEO of Grayscale posted yesterday that when investors were crying and selling, they were buying. Perhaps this was an important reason for Bitcoin's strong rebound last night!

&amp;#x200B;

The recent trend of Ethereum can be described as horrible. The big brother of Bitcoin has fallen, and Ethereum has fallen following the footsteps of Bitcoin! Yesterday, when Bitcoin fell by 10%, Ethereum had fallen by more than 11%. The recent weak performance of Ethereum has nothing to do with the market trend of the entire cryptocurrency. Therefore, the weak decline of Ethereum is still reasonable, because there is no snowflake in the blood crash. Innocent! However, the current investors in Ethereum may suffer painful lessons. At present, there is still no sign of stopping the decline in the medium and long term of Ethereum, so investors should pay attention to short-term risks in life!

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding the market outlook, ken believes that the current Bitcoin and Ethereum have reached the bottom from a technical analysis. Judging from today‚Äôs rebound, the bulls have a lot of ideas to create a short-selling market, but for the moment, the medium and long-term Bitcoin and Ethereum It is still in a downward trend, so the market like this kind of plunge will happen occasionally, coupled with the impact of recent negative news, so the sharp fluctuation of Bitcoin at the current point is also within a reasonable and reasonable explanation!

&amp;#x200B;

Ken believes that current investors should reasonably control their positions. Because the policy is not clear, it may lead to the risk of unrecoverable investment costs. This is a huge uncertainty, so the current Ken is still relatively cautious!",1624413052,1,1

The year is 2071. Earth's population is 20 billion. Bitcoin is the standard, topping out its price at 10 million USD apiece. Stargates were just invented to allow fast travel to other planets hundreds if not thousands of light-years away in just seconds.              

2072 rolls along. Half of Earth's population leaves so they can make a living on new planets. But they leave Bitcoin on earth because of the impossibilities of keeping the entire blockchain in sync over thousands if not millions of light-years and several planets is impossible.

Felt bad for the guy but essentially what he sold was the portion he went in heavy when it was right under $20k. So while BTC was down, his realized gains were over 50% profits. Not bad. Plus this was just a portion of his stack so he's still a HODLer as much as he can be.

I guess being into Crypto and all I'm more used to concepts like Austrian Economics but seriously I just can't wrap my head around how retarded that video is.

""Annual GDP growth is vital because companies are unable to increase stock value in a declining economy"" ?

""Too much GDP usually leads to inflation""

""Bigger GDP causes less unemployment resulting in more demand for goods resulting in increasing prices""

""Because prices increase, companies then need to raise wages and pass the increase to consumers through higher prices""

""Explosive GDP growth can cause hyperinflation which causes people to spend even more because they know their money will be worth less in the future""

**""This causes further GDP** and price increase**""** 

""Some people think that 0% inflation is good but a little inflation is better because workers want their wages to rise""

o6dngm,_kr_saurabh,While Bitcoin Hits New Lows Gold Bug Peter Schiff Blasts the Top Crypto and Supporters,"The American economist, financial commentator, and gold bug Peter Schiff had a lot to say about bitcoin‚Äôs price sliding on Tuesday. Schiff has always claimed bitcoin‚Äôs value will one day drop to nothing. This week he insists bitcoin‚Äôs chart shows a head and shoulders top pattern with a ‚Äúneckline around $30K the pattern measures a move to zero.‚Äù

## Schiff Believes Microstrategy Will Sell Every Last Satoshi

After bitcoin (BTC) dropped 10% Monday during the overnight and into the morning sessions on Tuesday, Peter Schiff took to his soapbox on Twitter and hammered the leading crypto asset. Schiff often has nothing good to say about bitcoin but on Tuesday, a great majority of his tweets (close to ten in total) were dedicated to bitcoin. The financial commentator talked about his favourite investment, gold, as well, and discussed how the precious metal dipped 6% last week.

‚ÄúOver the weekend bitcoin bugs made fun of gold‚Äôs 6% drop last week, which was about twice bitcoin‚Äôs 3% decline,‚Äù Schiff said. ‚ÄúBut while gold recovered some of those losses today, bitcoin crashed by another 9%. Also, while gold is down 9% from its 2021 high, bitcoin is down a whopping 50%,‚Äù he added.

Schiff‚Äôs tweets even targeted bitcoin bulls like Microstrategy‚Äôs Michael Saylor and Digital Currency Group‚Äôs Barry Silbert. Schiff tweeted:

 One individual defended Microstrategy‚Äôs CEO and told Schiff to debate Saylor or stop criticizing a ‚Äútechnology that you don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù Others stated in the Twitter thread that Schiff has already offered to debate Saylor, but the Microstrategy executive allegedly ‚Äúhas not taken him up on it.‚Äù 

Schiff Slams Silbert and Novogratz, Spencer Schiff Defends Bitcoin

In another tweet on Tuesday, Schiff went after Digital Currency Group‚Äôs CEO Barry Silbert. ‚ÄúIn Mar. \[Barry Silbert\] promised GBTC investors he‚Äôd close the 10% discount to NAV by buying back $250 million of shares,‚Äù Schiff wrote. ‚ÄúAnd then in early May, he promised to increase the buy to $750 million. So far he‚Äôs purchased less than a third of that amount. What are you waiting for Barry?‚Äù Schiff asked the Digital Currency Group executive.

Then the gold bug went after billionaire investor and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz.

‚ÄúAs bitcoin crashed below $30K, CNBC invited \[Mike Novogratz\] to try to pump it back up,‚Äù Schiff remarked after his many anti-bitcoin tweet bombs on Tuesday. ‚ÄúNovogratz claims Bitcoin can‚Äôt keep falling as there is all this new institutional demand. Assuming some institutions were getting interested above $60K, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve lost interest below $30K.‚Äù

Of course, Schiff‚Äôs son Spencer Schiff got in on the action after his father tweeted about bitcoin doing a dead cat bounce.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get excited about bitcoin‚Äôs dead cat bounce from an intra-day low of around $28.6K to near $32K,‚Äù Schiff‚Äôs tweet scathed on Tuesday. ‚ÄúNothing drops in a straight line, \[especially\] a token as highly manipulated as bitcoin. As this bear market grinds on, about 55% so far, better to sell the rips than buy the dips,‚Äù the economist added. Spencer, however, snarkily snapped back at his father and said:

However, in terms of likes and retweet ratio, Spencer‚Äôs father had more likes and retweets. Others defended Spencer Schiff‚Äôs statement and said that Peter has been ‚Äúspectacularly wrong about Bitcoin multiple times over a decade. If he‚Äôs right this time it will be purely a broken clock situation.‚Äù

## Schiff‚Äôs Bitcoin TA and the Head and Shoulders Patterns That Lead to Zero

Besides the dead cat bounce commentary, Schiff also described an alleged head and shoulders pattern in the BTC/USD chart. As usual, Schiff declared that the leading crypto asset‚Äôs fiat value was on its way to zero.

‚ÄúThe most ominous thing about bitcoin‚Äôs head and shoulders top pattern is that with ahead near $65K and a neckline around $30K the pattern measures a move to zero,‚Äù Schiff wrote. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because the pattern projects a move below the next line that equals the move from the neckline to the head.‚Äù

‚ÄúFunny how you‚Äôll apply low probability TA (technical analysis) to BTC, but you won‚Äôt even consider the annualized returns of bitcoin over the last 10 years,‚Äù an individual responded to Schiff‚Äôs head and shoulders tweet.

&amp;#x200B;

It's great to see the sub reddit cheering while the price is going up and governments around the world are talking about it openly.

However, the biggest threat to Bitcoin dominance and, unfortunately, it's survival, is it's **fungibility**.

As much as we hate to admit it, current state of affairs points at the fact that **1 BTC != 1 BTC**.

As much as we want BTC to succeed as a currency, we also need to acknowledge that things are pretty sad at the moment. 

FBI tracking coins and marking them (therefore tainted coins), chain analysis companies tracking your previous and! future transactions making sure that none of the coins come from the mixers or go to the mixers (coinjoin is a red flag for the majority of the CEX), same with p2p platforms which are at times the only place where people  from the countries with authoritarian regimes can buy their coins!

Environmental debate sparked a speculation about marking BTC as clean or not clean. And as much as I don't want to admit it, the reality proves that BTC can and does get tracked and rejected.

Ask yourself: would you want to accept BTC as a payment knowing that at any given moment your account may get blocked by CEX? I know, we can use DEX, but for a lot of people ramping off is a necessity. 

We've all become blind to this MAJOR issue, blinded by the ever increasing denomination in fiat currency. It's no surprise governments love blockchain with the open ledger since it actually gives them a wonderful tool to track and intercept any sort of shady activity (which in some countries means being in the opposition to the ruling class).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, there are services like Wasabi and Samurai and Bisq that allow to obfuscate the transactions, but as you can see, coins become simultaneously anonymized and **surveyed** at the same time.

I think we should pin this matter as it is of the highest priority for the entire community. We haven't even noticed how what we fight for has been morphed into a major surveillance system.

&amp;#x200B;

Even tweets of Musk don't regularly change the price. Even some government news don't change the price substantially (e.g El Salvador accepting bitcoins or China bans of mining). 

So why there is a steady and fast growth of the price and then a fast decline? Many people and organizations that I know that bought crypto do not withdraw it to fiat money but rather hold it, so there should not be a huge supply of  Bitcoin.

This post is meant for the few of you out there that are open minded and find this unconventional analysis interesting. 

In 1980, Gold hit a peak of \~$700 before the crash and and long sideways movement. Then came another bull run up \~3x from the last peak to \~$2000 in 2011. Then Gold crashed almost 50%, moved sideways for a while, and suddenly spiked 1.5x from the previous peak.

Since 4 years ago, Bitcoin has been correlating extremely well with Gold's price movements but at a much faster rate. Bitcoin hit a peak of \~$20,000, crashed and moved sideways for a long time, went on another bull run up \~3x to \~$60,000, then crashed almost 50%. 

If we assume that Bitcoin will continue the historic Gold trend, that would mean Bitcoin will move sideways around the $30,000 - $35,000 range until the end of the year. Then a sudden spike close to the $100,000 range. Not financial advice.

I don't know what I'm going to eat next month. I don't know if I'll even have the energy to make the trip home to see my family. 

My plant has a few small tomatoes on it, barely edible. They would maybe get me through a couple weeks or a month, but I know I'd be better off waiting until they've reached maturity before eating them. If I can wait that long, their sustenance will keep me going for much longer. 

My plant has a few small leaves on it, should I eat them to tide me over? Skim a little off the top? No.  That would hinder my plant's ability to fully ripen, and the nourishment I'd get from its leaves isn't anywhere near that of a fully grown tomato plant. 

So I will be patient and wait until my plant has fat, red tomatoes before harvesting. And even then I'll save some of its seeds to plant each spring, giving me a bigger and bigger harvest each year. I might be late in making a trip back home to be with family, but at least I'll show up nourished from patient endurance and not emaciated from unripened opportunity.

When a customer withdraws more than 12,000 euros per year, the bank will charge 5 euros plus 0.5 percent per transaction on the amount withdrawn. Earlier it was announced that costs would be charged from 10,000 euros. According to Trouw, Rabobank will also introduce debit card costs for certain packages in September and ING is already doing so. For example, a student can withdraw money twelve times for free, after which it costs 0.80 euros per transaction.

This is great news. The relatively high stake that China has in Bitcoin has always made me nervous because any Chinese stake is a CCP stake, no no mistake about it, no pun intended. 

Dear CCP, thank you! Yes! Please! Ban Bitcoin and all Crypto! The sooner the better. Please ban all miners. Please encourage them to move to freer, cleaner locations.

o5knzr,flowbrother,This whole sub doesn't 'get' bitcoin in the same way the rest of the planet does.,"OK.  Fair enough, reddit is the last refuge where the dumbest of the dumbed down Umercan trailer trash congregate to repeat OLD media fed beliefs to each other and EVERYONE else is a cOnsPiraCy tHeoRist.

Which is why reddit is famous world wide as the place to go to show you that the Umercan idiot is a real thing.

I get that.

But......

While the entire planet views Bitcoin as the global silent revolution to unseat the banksters from their self proclaimed throne, Umerca is under this bizarre haze where BTC is some find of 'digital asset' that gets bought/sold/valued in terms of bankster fiat dollars.

In the rest of the planet, people stumble across BTC because they are looking for a solution to very real problems and BTC fills that need. 

In Umerca, it's all about lambo and the price in over printed fiat.

Weird.

People who live in places with currencies that are NOT the US dollar, understand that BTC is the currency of the people and the banksters have been locked out.

In Umerca, it's a digiTaL aSseT.

The corporate overlords are terrified you folks will 'get' it and realize it is a capped currency with which to make transactions.",1624360632,6,1
