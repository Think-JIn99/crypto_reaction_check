I know I should take strangers advice with a grain of salt but I feel like the average of most of the people I‚Äôve been following probably know what they‚Äôre doing. I plan to DCA, it won‚Äôt be much each time however it will be for the long haul, but I also want to start with a larger lump sum into Btc and mmmaybe some of that into Eth? The plan would be to leave it for many years. This seems to be the way? Would you all wait to do that lump sum until a big dip, which it sounds like could possibly happen early next year?

qmhkak,Newbiebewbie69420,Selective Deletion in Blockchain (Question),"Why is Selective Deletion of Blockchain not a thing in Bitcoin. Or crypto in general for that matter? To quote Peter Hillmann, Marcus Kn√ºpfer, Erik Heiland and Andreas Karcher:

""The constantly growing size of blockchains becomes a challenge with the increasing usage. Especially the storage of unwanted data in a blockchain is an issue, because it cannot be removed naturally. In order to counteract this problem, we present the first concept for the selective deletion of single entries in a blockchain. For this purpose, the general consensus algorithm is extended by the functionality of regularly creating summary blocks. Previous data of the chain are summarized and stored again in a new block, leaving out unwanted information. With a shifting marker of the Genesis Block, data can be deleted from the beginning of a blockchain. In this way, the technology of the blockchain becomes fully transactional. The concept is independent of a specific block structure, network structure, or consensus algorithm. Moreover, this functionality can be adapted to current blockchains to solve multiple problems related to scalability.""",1636021329,0,1

qmd2yu,Jout92,Using Satoshi in everyday life,"So many people seem to have trouble thinking in Satoshi, because people (in the west) are used to price things in USD.

If you've watched Squidgame on Netflix you will probably know about the Korean Won right now. Even if it was pretty confusing at first I bet you got a feel for how much 1000 Won is and how much (or how little) it can buy. Now here comes the interesting thing: 1 Won is very similar to 1 Satoshi in value right now (1 Won ~ 1.34 Satoshi)

I think it helps imagining how Satoshi can be used by average people because it seems so unimaginable to many right now, but we actually reached a point where Satoshi is very comparable to already existing currencies in countries and if we wanted we absolutely could already use Satoshi in everyday life and not wait for Bitcoin to hit 1 Million (this is when one SAT would be worth 1 ct)

I was thinking about getting a Nano Ledger but what happens if I lose the USB stick or a password? I was also reading that they had a leak last year and people's info got exposed? I honestly don't trust Ledger at all, and I was thinking (ideally) to have the coldest possible storage available, free from giving any information or working with any third parties.

I was also reading that paper wallets can achieve this - moving the risk to potentially losing the paper, but with the benefit that no other institution or hardware will need to interact with the BTC in order to achieve the storage. So, I created a paper wallet with bitaddress, and this is where my n00bness shows, but I don't really know how to withdraw once I deposit some BTC. The paper gave me a public key and a private key, the public is to do some deposits, I know, but how would I use my private key to withdraw and/or access the funds? I've only moved BTC through brokers, where they only ask me to input the public key as a deposit and click to send...

I consider myself a long-term investor for all the technical, idealistic &amp; financial reasons that many of you are probably sharing as well. But I worry about too much enthusiasm around the future potential price appreciation nowadays. I‚Äôd like to discuss one contextual, temporary but none the less historic and massive event that will happen soon and that could put some downward pressure on the spot price.  

For those of you who‚Äôve been in this long enough, [MtGox Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox) closed transactions 25th feb 2014 following a massive hack and hundreds of thousands of bitcoins lost and has since been followed by a 8 years legal development aiming at returning former customers what could be ¬´ saved ¬ª (apparently [200k BTC](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/defunct-bitcoin-exchange-mt-gox-usd-9-billion-2589828)). At the time of the hack, a BTC was around 550USD/coin. Those former customers are now looking at &lt;100x gains.

In October 2021 this rehabilitation plan was approved and the next steps in November will be the [restitution of those bitcoins](http://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20211020_announcement_en.pdf). 

Now, unlike what some may think, the spot price isn‚Äôt defined by the market capitalization, but by the depth of the order book and the number of available coins on exchanges. 
[We can see](https://cryptoquant.com/overview/btc-exchange-flows) that a relatively low difference in supply (200k BTC delta between July 20th and now on exchanges) can lead to a huge spot price difference whether appreciation or depreciation (30kUSD/BTC to 60kUSD/BTC).

Now, I feel like if even half (100k BTC) of those MtGox bitcoins are sold by the former customers to secure profits we could see a pretty heavy pressure on price at some point.

I wonder how you folks feel about that and if this makes any sense for you or if I missed something important that would invalidate my take on this situation.

In any case, that is no financial advice, and remember not to ever invest more than what you‚Äôll willing to lose.

Cheers &amp; HODL FTW.",1635938628,0,1

The following situation has developed on the market:

Funding is the most pressing issue for all young teams. It is simply difficult for them to find investors since many of them do not even know where to apply.

In a bank with a loan, they are very likely to be refused, possibly due to insufficient credit history, perhaps there is another reason, and it is not always possible to attract their own funds.

At the same time, there is a huge layer of investors who do not have the largest capital to become a ‚Äúwhale‚Äù, however, they are quite capable of financing a developing project if they see the benefit in it.

Coinstox as a Bridge Between Start-ups &amp; Investors

The Coinstox project comes to the aid of startups and investors, which is a link between them, which the blockchain has long lacked. Investors can easily search for startups they like, and startups can grow with their help.

What do startups get?

Investments

Tokenization of their assets and their subsequent sale using the blockchain

Growth through capital raising

Decentralized governance

What do investors get?

Tokenized assets of young companies that buy with cryptocurrency. This makes it easier to acquire them since banks can be bypassed and transactions are instant.

Convenient management of your investment portfolio

P2P token exchange

Smart contracts protect all transactions, which means you can be sure of their reliability and transparency

Thus, Coinstox creates its own ecosystem in which investors can safely invest in companies, receiving start-up tokens in return, which can be sold in the future due to an increase in their price. Moreover, in addition to tokens, each investor receives a special service from companies.

Use your seed phrase to generate 8 addresses or locations on the map. Now sign in to your favourite map service and save these 8 locations.

Tell your family how to reverse it - go to the location -&gt; put in on What3Words -&gt; Check the 3 words. Then the next 3 etc.

In this way your seed is hidden on the globe at 8 different locations.

BNB trend is strong, but on the whole, it can only be said that it has just broken through. Compared with ETH, the space is larger and the trend is stronger, so large funds can be considered. Small funds or mainstream concept is given priority to.

**Topic**

 EFI, as the upgrade of ENJ, has just broken through the current trend, with small market value and extremely low valuation. Once the currency falls below 1 due to a dive, it can be considered in batches. The long-term target is 3U, and the short-term target is 1.5, and stop-profit can be considered

BTT, TRX ecological concept, currently TRX horse racing game is coming to land, TRX concept may appear after dot changes, mainly ambush, at present, there are constantly funds slowly enter, you can wait for the callback after the gradual low suction. Short-term target 0.005 supports 0.0038

Is this a common scam? What are your concerns with this sort of thing?

What I am most worried about it is sustainable in the long term run (for example, in next 30 years) for fee fees to replace rewards without decreasing the difficulty and becoming a 51% attack. A lot of people have told me that ""it will change over time and the fee will replace the rewards"", but that's not enough for me. Will people want to pay at all if  is here a Lighting network?  


**I programmed for this problem a calculator** [**https://bitcoin-sustainability-calculator.netlify.app/**](https://bitcoin-sustainability-calculator.netlify.app/) that can simulate various variants in future: from the value of BTC and the amount of the fee, it calculates the fee in USD per transaction and what reward the miner will receive from it in what year and you can compare with the current situation.  


I give to the community who is also interested in this problem. Fortunately, the numbers don't turn out as badly for me as I originally feared :-).

qm45fh,el_timinou,Why the US dollar and other Fiat currencies are scams! Explained,"That‚Äôs my own understanding of why fiat currencies are the most accepted scam in the world.

I‚Äôm not an economist and I would really like to read any comments or counter arguments.


Ending the Gold Standard

After the 1929 Great Depression, the US Federal government could not print enough money to pay for his spending program. All paper money had to be backed by 40 percent gold owned by the Federal to prevent bank runs. From 1933 to 1974, Executive order 6102 made it criminal in the US to own or trade gold coins or gold bullions. Every citizen had a month to turn in their gold to any member bank of the Federal Reserve or get penalties of 10 years imprisonment. During those times, people had to stop using gold and get used to paper money only.

Then in 1971, Nixon completely ended the gold standard due to large deficits by selling every oz of gold from the Federal reserve. The main expenses during those years was to finance wars and the US used their military supremacy to impose the dollar. Thus creating the biggest illusion of money yet created, the fiat standard, backed by nothing but authorities.

Gold ownership was legalized again a few years later.


Fiat is a scam

A scam is a deceptive scheme or trick used to cheat someone out of something.

In a fiat standard, governments have the power of devaluing their currency through money printing or quantitative easing. Basically, instead of directly taxing citizens, governments now have unlimited access to any saving accounts to pay for their deficits. Considering that wealthy people don‚Äôt have any fiat currency, this hidden tax primarily targets the working class, people trying to save money and those living on fixed incomes such as Social Security. Less educated/fortunate people that don‚Äôt have any assets might never realize the decline of their purchasing power.

Currently the smartest move to fight unpredictable inflation seems to get rid quickly of your fiat holdings and buy assets instead (and yet everything is nominated in fiat!).The biggest winners are the wealthy that can borrow large amounts of money to buy more assets or influence politics, for example petroleum industries which also protect the US dollar. This concentration of power in the hands of a few leads to abuse and printed fiat is constantly used for socializing losses on privatized gain investments of the wealthiest, like bank bailouts or subsidies to large corporations. Policies that individually we will never vote for them!
 

Conclusion

In 2009, Bitcoin concretized money again and broke the fiat illusion. Yet, history can repeat itself if we are not cautious. Don‚Äôt leave your holdings in exchanges/banks, avoid KYC, and do not buy derivatives like Bitcoin ETF. It‚Äôs important that people hold the real thing or else authorities might be able to make their own rules and print any amount of derivatives.¬†

qm31wl,Belatedlove520,Why is the use of cryptocurrency mining in a coinbase account different from simply relying on rising to make profits?," Change often pushes people to abandon stereotypes and inspire new thinking, and the rise of blockchain will upend the way people think about things in many industries.

However, when it comes to exponential growth, we tend to overestimate the short-term impact and underestimate the long-term impact. Just as the dotcom bubble collapsed in 2000, the Internet went from being a game changer to being a hotbed of capital. It turns out that the Internet is not so magical, and most companies have not succeeded in building a worthwhile business model on the Internet. However, how many people can imagine that only a dozen years later, the Internet has profoundly changed the pattern of today's business society, but also changed our lives.

Like the development of the Internet, the rise of blockchain, a protocol-based, disruptive technology that requires large-scale collaboration and participation, will take longer than most people expect, and the ultimate scope and depth of impact will be far greater than most people imagine. The future development of blockchain will not be plain sailing. It may experience overheating or even bubble stage, and may also experience trough. However, I believe that blockchain, as the core technology of the next stage of the digital wave, will eventually build a diversified ecological value Internet, which will profoundly change the structure of the future business society and our lives

First, let's talk about currency speculation. Frankly speaking, it is a way to buy from the secondary market at a low price and then sell the currency to make profits when the price rises. Coin speculation is a high-risk, high-return investment. Because the current currency price is high, investment speculation requires a lot of capital investment, the threshold is too high. Ordinary investors do not have the financial capacity to play the risk - averse game. And must always pay attention to policy guidance, pay close attention to market trends, afraid of missing a sickle and afraid of cutting leeks. The market is not very stable now, the pricing power is always in the hands of the dealer. You do not know when to go up, when to fall, accidentally cut leek. No one can buy at the lowest point and sell at the highest point. What we can do is gradually improve our level and outperform most people.

Coinbase account defi liquidity mining is equivalent to quantitative investment, an investment, long-term returns, and produce a certain amount of money every day, and revenue stream, because the mining and energy storage investment characteristics, not every day to sell the COINS, but mainly the chariot COINS, so don't stare, every day on real-time currency, the normal life and work, Make money easy and fun. What's more, when the price of coins goes up and you have another batch of coins, you have enough chips to trade. Mining is a continuous discounted investment behavior, can obtain lower cost chips. When the currency rises to a certain price, there is no need to worry about short selling. Basically, by participating in mining, you can eat a big chunk of the entire market. It is a relatively stable investment way

1, low cost of mining VS high cost of speculation

2, mining risk is small VS speculation risk is large

3, mining sustainable income VS speculation is not sustainable

4, mining profits VS speculation every day to earn and lose

5. Mining has strong risk resistance VS speculation has no risk resistance",1635970215,0,1

so, we just launched on the 21st of October, it was just 3 weeks ago, but we completed 3 of our projects. ( KALA WALLET, KALA SWAP, KALA STACKING).

5. All developers are Doxxed, you can find our developer social media link in our website ( kala.finance ) . And almost every night we are on telegram voice and video calls.

**2nd Segment: Questions from Twitter Announcement.**

**6: do you have any plan for burning tokens in the future to reduce the supply of the token and increase its investment attractiveness?**

**Question by g76974594**

**Aman Matasulu:** Yes, we already burn 39%, and we will burn another 5% ( 5M token ) when we reach 5.000 Holder‚Ä¶

Another 5% in phase III

Another 5% in phase IV.

**7: In my opinion, a project needs to deal with solving a real-world issue or problem What is the problem that your project primarily focuses on?**

**Question by Ibrahem24254134**

**Aman Matasulu:** Yes‚Ä¶ Agree! The Emotional selling point from KALA is ‚ÄúThis is Indonesia Token. from Indonesia-for Indonesia‚Ä¶ we want to start with our baby step first! Focus on Indonesia market, give big impact to the community especially in culture, education, and finance.

We want everything step by step and based on the timeline, also focus on it.We give real facts, not just the dream, we want to different from our competitors‚Ä¶

**8: Staking is very important for every project to attract users. So does Kala Coin project have a staking program? If yes, how can we stake your token? Are there any requirement for users?**

**Question by tuan\_iker**

**Aman Matasulu:** No, you can‚Äôt stake KALA. You will rewarded KALA, only in on KALA FARMING. Don't worry, we will launch in the next 3 Days‚Ä¶

**3rd Segment: Community Round.**

**Is your project only for English speaking countries or do you have any community for nonenglish speaking users too?**

**Aman Matasulu:** As I said before, the goal is for the community but we start in Indonesia first, after 3 weeks in Indonesian market, we are ready to expand globally. Now the team is preparing all global groups, based on the region.. So yes, we will prepare content, group, in a few languages‚Ä¶but English and Indonesia as a primary language.

.

For more questions, you can join the global group..and the admin will help you..

**Marketing is very important for any project because good marketing makes the company look smart and powerful, so what is Kala marketing strategy?**

**Aman Matasulu:** Yes. Agree!! But besides marketing to promote, I still think the brand itself is one of the important things. The unique selling is the token features itself, but the emotional selling is THIS IS INDONESIAN TOKEN.

We blend all that into one marketing strategy and deliver to the world! and community as our basic media to speak to the world! KALA will never grow without the community. Now, for us, just need to find the perfect digital media to gain the exposure of KALA token based on community regions.

The marketing plan is ready until June 2022, but, we still do the research to find out more about the audience. So all the marketing strategy speaks to the right audience.

**.Most of the new investors, only focus on the price of the token and the short term benefits of the project rather than understanding the true value of the project. Can you tell us about the motivations and benefits for investors to hold your tokens long-term?**

**Aman Matasulu:** hi..I like this question.

for KALA, we are focus on Community! That's become the strongest point for us, and that's why we can kill zero in 7 days, we can deliver all projects on time‚Ä¶the support, the input of the community is the important one‚Ä¶and the price will follow, equal with the marketing strategy.

.

And Kala is a long terms project. Why? because represent our Motherland ‚Äî Indonesia. From Indonesia for the world‚Ä¶

**Aman Matasulu:** The answer is the Community TRUST.

After we gain the community's trust, the community is self will become KALA's strongest media to spread all the good news about KALA.

AND the effect will be the price token and new partners in every aspect.

**Can Kala share with us some of the future plans, such as the marketing development plan and recent activity plan for Kala?**

**Aman Matasulu:** For now, the plan is just 5000 Holder, we already apply to CG and CMC‚Ä¶meanwhile we approach all the listing and exchanger‚Ä¶.

Host: Thank you so much u/amanmatasulu for the very detailed answers!

**I would recommend to our community please join KALA social media channels for more updates**

Hi all,

I've written my first article on Lightning and I must say it's not really for this group... :)

I break all the rules in terms of ""not your keys, not your coins"", I don't cover any of the fundamental principles/philosophy of bitcoin, or security or even provide a variety of options of ""better platforms"" to on-board with.

It's really not anything new in the grand scheme of things, but what I've done is try to create a single resource that offers a complete and straightforward way for someone you may know who needs that little push to take the next step to get some practical experience with Bitcoin and Lightning.

So if you read it and think it‚Äôs any good, please consider sharing.

Anyway, here it is - [Bitcoin Shopping Discounts with Lightning Payment](https://hasoforsoundmoney.com/lightningpayments/) \- as well as some further context below. Happy to receive feedback and would be great to know if it is actually helpful..

Thanks, Haso.

**Who is this article for?**

The ‚ÄúBitcoin-as-a-means-for-payment‚Äù sceptic - For potential new users who are cautious, curious but want to learn by doing. They may be looking for a single resource or guide they can follow for a hands-on experience with Bitcoin and making a Lightning payment.

Shoppers ‚Äì Who may be looking for different avenues for discounts/bargains and don‚Äôt mind doing something new and following a few steps to get them.

**What is it?**

Its effectively a short course ‚Äì (about 30mins on average), taking the reader (who may have little to no knowledge of Bitcoin) through the process of converting dollars to Bitcoin and then make a Lightning payment. No additional resources needed.

**Why?**

The incentive is by learning this method of payment, new markets and opportunities become available for discounts and/or better value-for-money purchases.

**Longer Term Effects**

The reader, in becoming familiar with the utility of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network may, over time, transition to also viewing Bitcoin as a store of value and therefore hodl some allocation.",1635807280,4,3

qkm66w,Initial_Captain_9819,A thought experiment: spend all existing bitcoins to purchase all US real estate.,"Today there are 18.78 million bitcoins in existence. At today‚Äôs exchange rate of 1 BTC = $60,812 that means those 18.78M BTC are worth $1.142 trillion. Wow! That‚Äôs a lot!

The current US real estate market is worth an estimated $33.6 trillion. That means all the real estate owners together would sell all their real estate for $33.6 trillion, but no less. That‚Äôs their rock-bottom price, otherwise they would rather just keep it.

Some people who own bitcoin also already own some of the $33.6 trillion real estate market, so let‚Äôs be generous and assume they already own $3.6 trillion of it free and clear, no mortgage, no debt, they own it. So there‚Äôs still $30 trillion in real estate out there, and together all the bitcoiners decide that they would rather own real estate instead of bitcoin. They all collectively decide to reap the rewards of their bitcoin investment and try to buy ALL the real estate in the US in exchange for ALL the bitcoin in existence.

So together all the bitcoin owners communicate to all the real estate owners that they want to buy real estate. 

The real estate owners tell the bitcoin owners that they will not sell their real estate for anything less than $33.6 trillion dollars, which at today‚Äôs exchange rate is equivalent to 552.5 million BTC. 

The bitcoin owners plead with the real estate owners: ‚ÄúBut we only have 18.78 million BTC, which is equivalent to $1.142 trillion. Why won‚Äôt you lower your price? Why won‚Äôt you sell us $30 trillion worth of real estate for the $1.142 trillion we are offering? We are offering you a whopping 3.8% of your asking price, why won‚Äôt you take it?! You have got to believe us, these bitcoins are going to be worth a lot more in the future! They are going to increase in value so much that someday you will be able to buy the equivalent of $30 trillion dollars in real estate, maybe more, for only $1 trillion! It‚Äôs true!‚Äù 

So all the real estate owners said ‚Äúwow, that sounds like a great investment! I‚Äôm in!‚Äù And they agreed to sell their $30 trillion worth of real estate to the bitcoiners for $1.142 trillion. They signed all the papers, packed up their belongings, evicted all their tenants, and went out to the street. The bitcoin owners changed all the locks, moved in to their new digs, and everyone lived happily ever after.",1635796313,24,0

qlosvl,olivietti,Bitcoin ‚Äì needle in the haystack technology,"&gt;‚ÄúEntropy is what makes a bitcoin your bitcoin‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img ha0j1vudubx71...*

Your private key is a needle in the haystack.  
Well actually that‚Äôs not true, your private key is a really big and random number.

So 1st of all why is it a number? Well because everything that‚Äôs on a computer is a number.

Ok, but why does it have to be big?

Well, let‚Äôs say my private key is a number between 1 and 10. If you want to guess it, you have a 1 in 10 chance of guessing it. Which is pretty bad for me.  
And if you‚Äôre a bit zealous it would only take you 10 tries to go through all the possibilities to guess my private key.

Now let‚Äôs say my private key is a number between 1 and 115 **quattuorvigintillion**, things are a bit different.  
What is 115 **quattuorvigintillion**?  
That is 2256, and this is the upper limit of the number I was talking about and to put it more into perspective this is how many atoms there are in the visible universe.

So if you would want to go through all the possibilities of all the private keys to guess my private key that would take you about 500 years.  
And that is great because this process is very time-consuming, like finding a needle in the haystack.

So your **private key** is like the needle in the haystack, more precisely the **position of the needle in the haystack**.

If you put your needle at the top of the haystack, anyone can find it.  
If you put it in the corner of the haystack, someone might look there and also find it.  
So if you put in a position that is pretty obvious, someone will guess it with ease.¬†

But if you would put it in a **random** position, the only way someone could guess the position of your needle(aka your private key) is by going through all the hey in the haystack, which could take a long time.

Luckily you don‚Äôt have to worry about this and your wallet takes care of all these things.

# RNGs ‚Äì Random Number Generators

Your **Bitcoin wallet** is the **instrument** you use **to interact with the Bitcoin network**.  
It has 3 main functions:

1. It generates the private keys
2. It stores the private keys
3. It signs transactions

And depending on what specific wallet you may be using it may include other functionalities.

I‚Äôm sure you learned by now from your past relationships that it does not matter how hard you try in the present or even if she‚Äôll do anal once a week if the whole thing had a bad beginning.

The same holds true for cryptography, and more precisely for the security of your Bitcoin keys.  
If your private key was not generated **randomly**\[1\] and **privately**, there is a decent chance you may lose all your coins, and even more, it can nullify future efforts you put into securing your Bitcoin.

The private part is up to you, but the random depends on the software and hardware you trust.  
So what‚Äôs so hard?

Well, **computers** are **deterministic machines**, meaning they will do the same thing if you give them the same input.  
Example.  
When I type in xhamster.com in my browser, it takes me to xhamster.com every time\[2\].  
This is great because this is why we use computers in the first place because they are reliable, but this means they are NOT capable of producing random outputs.

Yeah, but cryptography is not only used to secure Bitcoin, in fact, its used all over the place, so clearly we must have solutions that provide use random numbers.

Indeed.  
We have, and they are called Random Number Generators.

Of which there are of 2 types:

1. Pseudo RNGs
2. True RNGs

**PRNGs ‚Äì Pseudo-Random Number Generators**

https://preview.redd.it/pstv36fnubx71.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ad02da0cbc40a3b1a373b4040f600dfaa20c8de

The Pseudo ones are like fake boobs.  
They may look real for a distance, but on close inspection, it‚Äôs obvious they are fake.

These are pretty much an algorithm, a piece of software that spits out multiple numbers.  
These numbers are uniformly distributed, and if you have a few of them you can NOT guess future ones.  
Uniformly distributed means that if you chart them they are all over the place, and dont concentrate in one area.

Remember the needle in the haystack.  
We dont want possible private keys to show any specific patterns or predictability.

&amp;#x200B;

[Numbers from a Pseudo-Random Number Generator plotted.](https://preview.redd.it/tct0ukrsubx71.png?width=372&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94924bd7ad9328387b5eb265e98016cfe48fc9be)

They are useful as they are fast and reliable, and they are used all over the place.  
The operating system on your phone and computer uses them all the time.

So the way these pseudo RNGs work is that they are a function(recursive most of the time) that needs an initial term T0.  
The same way the Fibonacci sequence needs the 1st term.  
Depending on this term you will get different sets of uniformly distributed numbers.

But remember this is a **deterministic process** that runs on a **deterministic machine**, so if someone gets this initial term, they will all be able to generate the same numbers as you, and possibly guess your current and any future private keys you may generate.

Ok, so where do we get this very important 1st term from?

**TRNGs True Random Number Generators**

The answer is True RNGs.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ehljcxb0vbx71.png?width=522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26af5bf0549c51dcadbcb3eae00556575a1cc20a

What makes these ones ""true"" as opposed to ""pseudo"", is the same thing that makes boobs real as opposed to fake.  
The fact that they are natural.

Tru-RNGs are hardware-based and digitize chaotic events from nature in order to produce random numbers.  
They often focus on physical phenomena like atmospheric noise, magnetic noise, or electromagnetic or quantum phenomena like thermal noise or avalanche noise.

The numbers outputted by a TRNG will **also** be uniformly distributed, lack patterns, and are totally unpredictable, but there are 2 differences.  
There is no T0 and there is no algorithm behind them.

If we take 2 data sets one from a PseudoRNG and one from a TrueRNG you can‚Äôt distinguish between the two.  
**The only difference is that one is random and one is not.**  


As John von Neumann famously put it.

https://preview.redd.it/6ottvag3vbx71.png?width=501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e68a966a2d38d2528065f98a1c878e23d9188434

As with anything in life, there are tradeoffs, and even though the true ones are truly random, they are usually slower, and if not slower very expensive.  
And as with any physical device living in the physical world, it can break down and/or become unreliable.

So are the true random number generators better than the pseudo-random number generators?

Well is a wife better than a table?  
Even though one is more useful than the other, the question does not make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0ecrsk36vbx71.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09bcb6b1d4bc1ebb852c19d68e9e7b0426cd05d6

# Entropy

You **can‚Äôt** measure randomness.  
You can observe a process and understand how it works and draw the conclusion that it is random or not.

But considering we are talking about numbers, after all, can‚Äôt we measure the numbers?  
Of course, we can say 8008 &gt; 1234 but saying that 8008 is more random than 1234, would not make any sense.

Whenever the topic of randomness is mentioned, entropy comes up very often, and depending on the context it can mean different things.

### The physics context

The term comes from Thermodynamics and it has to do with measuring molecular randomness, or in how many ways you can arrange the tiny things that make up something.  
And is used to express the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. 

‚ÄúThe entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest.‚Äù

### The information theory context.

In 1948 Claude Shanon((Who was a crazy motherfucker! )) wanted to measure information and published a paper called  ‚ÄúA Mathematical Theory of Communication‚Äù, which pretty much give birth to this field.  
He popularised((But not come up with as he ""stole"" it from John Tukey)) the bit as the most minimal unit of information.

A bit can either be a 0 or a 1, something or nothing.

He started thinking about how many questions does he need to ask in order to guess all the digits of a string.  
Let‚Äôs say we have an 8 digit long binary number. Binary means that each digit can either be a 0 or a 1.

So how many questions do you need to ask me in order to guess my number?  
Well for the 1st character one question.  
You ask me is it a 0, and if I say no, you know it‚Äôs a 1.  
What about the 2nd character, the same.  
So in order to guess all the 8 characters, you need to ask me 8 questions.  
So the entropy of the string is 1 bit per character times 8 characters = 8 bits.

This is true only if you dont have any information about my string, let‚Äôs say you somehow found out that 4 of the digits are 1s, then you would require fewer questions.  
And of course, this gets more interesting and complicated when we have more options for each character, but for Bitcoin private keys, we keep everything in binary form.

Also in the paper, he estimated that the entropy of written English is between 0.6 and 1.3 bits per character, which is very low, and this is why it compresses so well((The higher the entropy is in a bitstring the less it can compress. Kinda makes sense as there are no patterns.)).  


So higher entropy would mean more secure, no?   
Well, not necessary.  
This does bring us closer to what we are interested in but not quite there.

### The cryptographic context.

You see Cryptography is just adversarial math.  
Meaning that we always frame stuff by how hard it‚Äôs for an adversary to guess the secret or alter data.

The way modern((Modern meaning after 1883 after Kerckhoffs formulated his 6 principles)) cryptography works is that everyone knows the algorithms we use, but none one knows the entropy.  
Like in Bitcoin everything is open-source, we know how every little thing works, and that‚Äôs great because that‚Äôs why we also trust the code because is auditable, but everyone‚Äôs, private keys are private and entropic(hopefully).

So good entropy would mean it‚Äôs hard(it will cost a LOT of resources) for an adversary to guess your secret, or in our case the Bitcoin private keys.

Good entropy has 3 characteristics: 

1. Unpredictability, which is a measure of how strong the non-computability of the bits in the sequence is; 
2. Uniform distribution of the bits in the sequence; 
3. Lack of patterns in the sequence. 

It is worth pointing out that 3 implies both 1 and 2.   
However, 1 does not imply 2.  
And similarly, 2 does not guarantee 1.

But not all entropy is equally important.

Some people use entropy to make simulations of the universe(or for video games) and they don‚Äôt need cryptographically secure entropy, because they dont have any adversaries to worry about.

So what is the actual difference between Shanon‚Äôs entropy and cryptographic entropy, seem to be the same?

Well, it is not.

For example, we can take the very well-known constant Pi.

Pi is a number that goes on forever, and to date, we calculated about 62.8 trillion((To put it into perspective this is 3 times more than there are blood cells in the human body*.*)) digits of it.   
The sequence of digits of Pi has all the proprieties listed above, but if we use that as entropy for our private keys, it‚Äôs trivial for anyone to guess.

The key difference is that generating the digits of Pi is **not a random process**, and it can be replicated by anyone with a computer, so from the adversarial POV, even though the entropy checks all the boxes, it would **not** serve as cryptographically secure entropy.

Ok, ok, but we are talking about Bitcoin here.  
This can((will\*)) be worth millions in the future, and I might even want to pass it on to other generations, so as entropy is so important what is the best entropy for my Bitcoin private keys?  


Well, that sounds like a great subject for a future post.",1635922329,0,1

Hello. I am trying to learn about consensus mechanisms and how they work, starting with PoW in the bitcoin blockchain. Can someone please help explain this to me with layman's terms, and with non tech analogies if possible? What I am getting confused about with PoW is that I am reading that in a blockchain there are thousands of nodes competing to solve a mathematical problem, and the winner is the one who gets to verify the most recent block of the blockchain.

Firstly, I thought the one of the big ideas behind blockchain is that it's not just one computer or one organization verifying the accuracy of a ledger, and that it is instead thousands or millions of nodes all of which need to be an agreement as to the accuracy of the latest block in the ledger before verifying it. This is inconsistent with a single ""winner"" being the one to verify a ledger.

Also, what is this ""mathematical"" problem that all the nodes are trying to solve? Is it in anyway related to the transactions on the blockchain themselves? I heard once that the nodes are trying to find a new prime number, and, because prime numbers get rarer and rarer as you go higher up, the harder it becomes for computers to find them. The individual who told me this also told me that each bitcoin represents a prime number, and that's why bitcoins are scarce- because prime numbers, while infinite, become exponentially harder to find as you go higher up.

The project aims at replicating most aspects of the current political system while shifting the source of power. 

We are also going to address common pitfalls of both the current system and direct democracy.

- Majoritarianism (mob rule)

The majority is not required to participate in the political process. There are also instruments that allow the minority to shield itself such as credit default swaps on sovereign debt.

- Itemization of legislation 

Voting doesn't happen on the law by law basis rather on bundles of laws that are created by competing taxpayer funded entities.

- Voters may lack information 

Liquid democracy: voters can have an unlimited number of representatives that compete for taxpayer funding.

- Constitutional Catallaxy as a form of government

Peter Schiff likes to bring up this talking point every time he is given a stage, and he loves to point out that gold can be made into jewelry and semiconducters and that is what gives it its ""intrinsic value"".  He then points out that bitcoin has no intrinsic value because it cannot be made into things like gold can.

Gold is TANGIBLE.  Thus, it makes sense that it's value-adding attribles are also tangible.  

Bitcoin is INTANGIBLE.  Obviously, if you try to find TANGIBLE goods to manufacture with it, you won't find any.

Just as bitcoin is intangible, it makes sense that it's unique value-adding attributes are also intangible.  No money before bitcoin could claim these intangible and useful attributes:
- Security ensured by mathematics (instead of guns).
- Borderless
- Final settlement in the same short time ANYWHERE
- permissionless
- non-reversable (good or bad depending on the context)
- Fully transparent ledger
- Censorship resistant

With each of these attributes arises unique use-cases that cannot be achieved with any conventional money/value store.

First is, Im coming from an ideological perspective, not so much of a I have fomo and want to maximize profit perspective I like crypto because It gives power to the people and can be used to create a freer society via dual power, however is crypto currency actually being used in real life with day to day stuff? That's what I want it to be used for not people who have fomo and cash out all the time, I want real world applications.

2nd is environmental impacts, from what I've seen the power of crypto can power a small country, how do we mitigate environmental damage? Is there more environmentally friendly coins?

3rd is market value and infation, is crypto really that much better of the value per coin is constantly fluctuationing? Can crypto combat inflation or slow the process?

4th, I know you can invest via the stock market and that's legal but what about actually using it? Will I be put on a list? 

5th I've seen ads specifically the lion icon metal cards that have crypto storage, isn't that tied to a bank and they can see and by extension the government can see what you spend it on?

6th how do I actually get crypto currency, like actually have it and actually use it?

qkuvvr,MrJacuna,Bitcoin Economics in the Future,"Hi All,

I have been aiming to better understand Bitcoin and crypto currencies in general over the last couple of weeks. I recently invested in some crypto however I actively chose not to buy any BTC because there are a number of concerns I have regarding the platform. Specifically in the longevity of the network. I'm hoping to have some new perspectives on these thoughts from the community here so I can get in on this as a well informed investor.

1. Block Subsidies - At time of writing the BTC block reward sits at 6.25 BTC/block. As the BTC reward continues to approach 0 miners will have to rely on transaction fees in order to keep their machines running. My assumption is that miners are 100% economically motivated which leads to my concern of the network being abandoned to mine more profitable coins. If in general a miner will always follow the money will the network fail. I understand that as less computing power becomes available fees increase and therefore it becomes more economical to stay on the network but at some point won't the network become unsustainable or too volatile to be worthwhile.
2. Introduction of Quantum - This applies to all crypto currencies but if quantum computers are realised not only will it be possible to hash at rates beyond any GPUs but it also opens up the blockchain to quantum malicious attacks. Is there something I'm missing on the technical implementation that protects from this or are quantum computers able to undermine the network as described.
3. Platform is Only Self Sustaining - Bitcoin exists only to sustain itself. Other currencies are a consequence of a decentralized network as a service platform and therefore they not only are self sustaining but relied on by other platforms. This indicates to me that there are more incentives to use these networks and transaction/gas fees seem much more economical because they encompass any number of decentralized functions. From my perspective BTC seems outdated but I do understand the value in just simply doing one thing well
4. Environmental Concerns - This goes for most crypto currencies as well but the mining and network management has requires mass amounts of electricity. With most of the world still burning fossil fuels this doesn't sit great for me. I don't really have a solution for this other than the fact that I choose not to purchase a mining rig myself.

Would really appreciate some perspectives on these points so I can make an informed decision.

qk5f3r,jcoll627,Here Are Some Bullish Thoughts On Crypto As They Relate To The Upcoming November 3rd US Fed Meeting... Based On Re-listening To The September Fed Meeting On Economy and Interest Rates,"I was worried about the market reaction to the Fed tapering schedule which will be announced on November 3rd at 2pm, so I decided to re-listen to Powell's September speech. The tapering is estimated to start in mid-November or December which is largely expected by the market; however, Fed commentary around interest rate and inflation will be critical to determining if the bull market persists.

In regards to the September US non-farm payroll released after the last Fed meeting, ""Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, compared with the Dow Jones estimate for 500,000"", so this will make the Fed more dovish (i.e. more inflation, low interest, more accommodative) for this up-coming November meeting. Likewise, US GDP was lower than the Fed would like to see, further contributing to their likely dovishness.

The Fed is also getting pressure from politicians such as Warren who called Powell a ""dangerous man"" inferring that if he becomes Hawkish too soon, it will result negatively for a fragile recovering COVID economy. I don't think he cares what Warren thinks very much \[like most people\], but I do think it inadvertently pressures him to be more dovish.

For these reasons, in regards to interest rate increases at this up-coming Nov 3 meeting, Powell will AVOID providing any commentary relating to timing of rate increases occurring in 2022. Some Wall St banks are expecting 2 interest rate increases in 2022 due to inflation. However, I heard nothing from Powell's September speech to suggest he will raise once or twice in 2022. He said the hurdle for raising interest rates is significantly higher than the hurdle to start tapering. He did mention that all but one of the Fed officials expects interest rate increases starting in 2023; however, for 2022 Powell said interest rates can increase only after tapering completes (mid-2022) because it's senseless to raise interest rates while bond purchases are occurring. And he said the Fed is going to continue to monitor the economy before providing guidance on such rate increases.

In regards to actual inflation, the fed is unlikely to acknowledge its true extent in the midst of a COVID economy. Powell is being very careful with how he discusses inflation and interest rate increases. His commentary will focus on how inflation is manageable, related to supply chain shortages, and how it will be lower in the out years like 2023 once the economy is on firmer ground.

In regards to crypto, I think there is potential for a bumpy Monday / Tuesday (I'm scared every time the Fed speaks) but I see Bitcoin staying above $59K. Institutions understand the bull market too much to allow Bitcoin to fall any further than $59K, and if it falls to this level it will quickly be purchased. After this meeting on Wednesday, I believe Crypto is free to increase until November 22nd forming new ATHs, after which volatility from November 29 options expiry will start to set in and potentially cause a minor pull back from these new ATHs.",1635737298,7,1

qk41gk,brianddk,How to hack an exchange account,"Since I see the question of ""are exchanges unsafe"", here's  guide to how to hack an exchange account for you to decide for yourself.  This assumes the user has Google Authenticator 2FA.

TLDR; Exploiting ""lost 2FA"" workflows are easier than ""hacking 2FA""

***

1. ***Get Email and Phone number*** - These can be found on the leaked BitcoinTalk database, the Ledger database, YahooMail database, and the coinmarketcap database
2. ***Determine the phone carrier*** - In many cases, tools can be used to determine what carrier is associated with which phone number.
3. ***SIM Swap the phone*** - This is hit or miss.  It usually entails either getting a part-time job at a mobile carrier, or bribing a friend that works there.  There are reports of SIM swaps selling for as little as $20
4. ***Claim ""lost password"" on Email account*** - In most cases, this will trigger the email carrier to send a one-time password to the phone on file.  With this, the sim swapper has now elevated their attack to taking over the users email.
5. ***Assume userid is same on email and exchange*** - Most users like `JYellen@cmail.com` will also have an exchange account userid of `JYellen`
6. ***Claim lost password on Exchange*** - With the guessed userid the attacker can file a lost password claim.  Crappy exchanges will then email a lost password link to your email.  Once they change the password, they still need the 2FA to gain full access.  Also, in some cases, the user database leak, like with YahooMail, will include the password.  If users recycle their password, then attackers can get userid/password for your email and your exchange. 
7. ***Claim lost phone (2FA) on Exchange*** - Some exchanges, incredibly, will let users simply strip the Authenticator 2FA off their account by claiming ""lost 2FA"".  This will trigger a validation email, but since the hacker already hacked the email, they can answer that challenge.

Few ways to prevent this:

* Don't use same user-id or same passwords on accounts.  If `JYellen` didn't reuse her username on cmail and the exchange, this linkage would have broken.
* Don't use the same email on your exchange as the forums.  If `JYellen` would not have used her cmail on both CoinMarketCap site and the exchange, this link would have been broken.
* Tighten security on your email - Some email providers allow users to disable the ""lost password"" and ""lost 2FA"" features on the email account.  This means if you lose your email password or email 2FA, you give them permission to delete your account.  Many attacks don't guess your password, they just claim to be you and that the password is lost or forgotten.
* Use better 2FA - Ultimately crappy ""lost password / 2FA"" workflows are not your fault and can't be avoided, but sometimes better 2FA can help.  If you use hardware-2FA they often have different workflows than the ""lost phone"" workflow.  Basically, you want it to be as difficult as possible to navigate a lost password or lost 2FA situation.  So choose the one that is the hardest to reset.
* Don't keep funds on exchange - The problem with exchanges is that you put your trust in the exchange to maintain some semblance of good sense.  Unfortunately when exchanges get thousands of lost password tickets every day, they are often tempted to loosen the requirement for password resets.  Often at the behest of the very customers they are trying to secure.  If you simply stop trusting the exchanges to hold your balance week after week, then you can secure your accounts better (sometimes) outside of an exchange.  This way, you are the only one you have to trust, not a password-reset admin.

In a perfect world, exchanges would lock accounts down for weeks if someone claiming to be you said they lost their phone with all their 2FA on it.  But the world isn't perfect.  Coinbase recently admitted that their lost secret workflow was flawed.

Just be careful out there.",1635732296,67,1

qk1u98,jcoll627,Just Re-listened to the September Fed Meeting On Economy and Interest Rates... Here Are My Thoughts Ahead of The November 3rd Upcoming Meeting,"I was worried about the market reaction to fed tapering schedule which will be announced on November 3rd at 2pm. The tapering is estimated to start in mid-November or December, I think it will be the latter, and the ballpark amount is \~$15B less a month \[from existing $120B a month levels\]; although this could change depending on future economic indicators. 

The September non-farm payroll was released after the last Fed meeting. ""Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, compared with the Dow Jones estimate for 500,000"", so this will make the Fed more dovish for this up-coming meeting. Likewise, GDP was lower than the Fed would like to see. 

The Fed is also getting pressure from politicians such as Warren who called Powell a ""dangerous man"" inferring that if he becomes Hawkish too soon, it will result negatively for a fragile COVID economy. I don't think he cares what Warren thinks very much \[like mostly people\], but I do think it inadvertently pressures him to be more ""accommodative"" during this uncertain period in history \[especially so during the Fed ""insider trading"" controversy\]. 

In regards to interest rates, Powell reiterated many times that the Fed will be ""accommodative"" during the September Fed meeting. He's obviously nervous about changing too much too fast. I think he's only comfortable announcing the taper, and will likely wait until December or next year before commenting on interest rates. 

Some Wall St banks are expecting 2 interest rate increases in 2022 due to inflation. However, I heard nothing from Powell speak that suggest he will raise once or twice in 2022. He said the hurdle for raising interest rates is significantly higher than the hurdle for starting tapering. He did say say that all but one of the Fed officials sees interest rates starting in 2023; however, for 2022 he only said that interest rates can increase only after tapering completes because it's senseless to raise interest rates while bond purchases are occurring. 

In regards to actual inflation, I do believe it's higher than the Fed is citing; however based on the above commentary, it's unlikely the Fed will announce the timing of interest rates until 2022. 

In regards to crypto, I think there is potential for a bumpy Monday / Tuesday but I see Bitcoin staying above $59K. After this meeting on Wednesday, I believe Crypto increases.",1635724479,2,1

Today, thirteen years later, the first digital God has born. I present to you Bitgod, a philosophy, community, religion, and God. King of kings, and in the end, nothing more than a tool at the service of the mankind.

The aim of the foundation is to create a community of technocrats strong enough to solve the bigger problems of the world. Imagine if Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey, and Pavel D√∫rov worked together under one organization. We plan to act as a shield to help the next generations of innovators to change the world. Provide them support, resources and an ethical code.

Change the world through education and hope. Change the world supporting those who will change the world. 

In two months we'll have the structure of the foundation completely defined, alongside our two most valued assets: The manifesto, and the BGT. The first is our creed, the values ‚Äã‚Äãunder which the foundation is developed. The second is our token, working under the Ethereum Blockchain which allows us to manage the foundation through all its members anonymously. The manifesto is the heart of the Bitgod, and the BGTs its veins.  

For now, here you can find a website which works as an interactive whitepaper, consider it the introduction to the manifesto, because it explains in an assertive and reduced way our mission.

qjzgva,SatoshiNakamotoWife,BTC a good capitalism story,"
Bitcoin is born.
No matter in the end who invented and why, it‚Äôs like the discovery of fire in history.
Then capitalism, ‚Äúuncontrolled capitalism‚Äù make btc a slightly different from the founders‚Äô vision.
But it was inevitable, I agree with that in part, because I believe more in the power of companies like Tesla or others and companies in general rather to go on another path diverging with the government rather than fighting it.
True capitalism doesn‚Äôt care about governments, companies always find a way to dodge government restrictions.
And they will probably succeed in opposing to the imminent law by the government to being taxed more, I bet all my btc, bch and crypto on the fact that they will dodge this restrictions even if they need to do that in a justice court.
They are acting like vessels for btc, and even if there are a lot of that that‚Äôs rigged and conspire to seize btc like block stream we should all separate central government and central banks from companies in the end.
Technologies always makes things cheaper, even a lightning network and sort of others off-chain improvements could be made by everyone person‚Äôs company, even yourself.
BCH for me will be surely the best alternative for less developing countries, that will also grow as economic power (speaking about communities not governments).
I know that there will be many disappointed here as usual, I would only like to say that if my guesses are correct, this is a much brighter vision than excessively complottists visions about BTC and central banks going along as friends.
I like this Reddit but in the long run this sub will be a lesser anxious and complottist sub.
The fact that here is like a nest of contrarian thinking people is wonderful.
You are all doing a great job.

qkih93,JustAGuyInACar,"No, you don't buy bitcoin at the price you deserve.","The lot of you (ESPECIALLY ""whole-coiners/multi-coiners"") love to say ""you buy bitcoin at the price you deserve"". That is absolute garbage that makes you sound just as awful and greedy as the 1%. I was 9 years old when bitcoin was created. The price of a single coin rose to over $100 before I even got to middle school. On top of that I was born to a less-than-fortunate white trash family, who's never really had extra money just laying around to invest.

 I was 16 before I ever even heard the word ""bitcoin"" spoken by anybody and they weren't even speaking to me. By the time I had my own phone with full time internet access, bitcoin was already over $5k per coin, and I had just started pulling in $250 every 2 weeks working at a sandwich shop. Wasn't bitcoin created to help everybody? To help pull people out of poverty? People like Me?

 Then along comes a bunch of spoiled and entitled people like the ones on this sub. People that enjoy saying things like ""you buy bitcoin at the price you deserve"". Really? I deserve to not make insane gains like you because I was a child with no access to bitcoin at the times that all of you had access to it? How funny that a bunch of former poor people enjoy talking down to current poor people for not having access to or knowledge of the things that made you not poor. 

I currently have 0.00518 bitcoin. I get to own half of one ""bit-cent"". Even if it's value increases 20√ó (in USD) I'll only get enough of a return to make a down payment on a shitty used economy car. That's the amount of bitcoin I have access to. I have equity in other things and don't just piss away the little money I earn, so I'm not just riding on my half of a bitcent to make my fortune. 

I can't help but wonder how nice it must be sitting on that impossibly high throne that the lot of you were given a spot on merely by chance, looking down on the rest of us broke people with contempt. I hope your precious bitcoin hits 0 so you all can remember what it's like counting physical coins to buy necessities, instead of lecturing us on how we ""buy it at the price we deserve"". 

I'm of course not speaking to the other less than fortunate people on this sub, and no I don't feel like the world owes me something because I was born poor. I've accepted where I am. I just wish that people who owned whole coins or even lots of coins could hear themselves and what a little bit of money has done to them.",1635786221,101,0
qkieln,WonderBets,Payments on BTC / Crypto,"Good afternoon!

I am part of a web design company and we provide online services to clients.

Most of our clients usually pay by paypal.

We have seen a significant increase in customers asking the possibility of paying for services in cryptocurrencies.

We don't and we don't have a clue if it's logical or not..but considering recent trends, we understand at least the importance of starting to consider.

The question will be: would this type of implementation be logical for a service that generates a limited volume of business?

Would it be logical to sell a product for a cryptocurrency that is worth X today and Y tomorrow?

If yes, any suggestions for implementation? Would it have logic to receive the payments through BitPay, CoinBase or Kraken? Any easy way to start with? 

We don't know if this has already been the doubt of many others, but if so, we would like to know what they think and what they advise.

qkgskm,Amichateur,URGENT: bitcoin.de users with a BCH balance: Send your objection by Tuesday/Wednesday (better today)!!! Otherwise you may lose 20% of your money on bitcoin.de! Login now and check your emails!!!,"*Note: This is not an altcoin post as also Bitcoin users may be affected for historical reasons!*

--------

Bitcoin.de has sent their users an email on 20 Oct 2021 to confirm their balance. They grant a 14 day deadline for objections in case users disagree. This **14 day deadline** ends now on Wednesday (or on Tuesday if you received the E-Mail already on 19 Oct)!!!

At first glance all seemed ok to me. But then I realized that my BCH are sitting there for quite some time already. I have a balance of 10 BCH at bitcoin.de (my actual balance is different, but I write ""10 BCH"" here for the sake of example).

After checking the ""history books"" I realized that there was the BCH --&gt; BCHA (Bitcoin Cash ABC) hard fork on 15 Nov 2020 on block 661648. Today 1 BCH = 590 USD and 1 BCHA = 150 USD, so omitting your BCHA amounts to losing 20% of your money (or 1500 USD in the case of a 10 BCH balance on bitcoin.de).

So better send your formal objection to bitcoin.de NOW to maximize your chances for getting heard!

PS: For the historical records and to avoid confusion:
* BCH forked away from BTC on 1 Aug 2017
* BSV forked away from BCH on 15 Nov 2018
* BCHA forked away from BCH on 15 Nov 2020 (block 661648)
* BCHA ""Bitcoin Cash ABC"" was ""renamed"" XEC ""eCash"" on 1st or 2nd July 2021, with denominations being 1 BCHA = 1,000,000 XEC, but many exchanges or price tickers still use the legacy symbol ""BCHA"".",1635781537,6,1

two files:

\~20Gb and \~81Gb compressed (65Gb, 317Gb uncompressed) set of transactions from a fullnode ZMQ rawtx channel decoded to json for easier consumption, describing \~146M transactions.

The smaller file is a snapshot of random periods over a few weeks. The larger file is a single capture period from (I think) \~25 to the 30 October 2021 (those transactions have an \`extra\` field containing the node localtime, the small file does not have local timestamps).

Note: this is not the blockchain data, this is mempool data, i.e., unconfirmed transactions submitted to the network. So, an interesting project could be to compare these transactions to those in the blockchain and build a set of transactions which were not confirmed.

Details: The data from the report points to a potential supply shock where long-term holders are not taking profits. The number of bitcoins that haven‚Äôt moved in the past 6 months has already reached a 3-year low, according to the report.

Big Picture: Basically, the report finds a lot of strength among long-term holders and mining pools. This includes individual miners who have realized modest profits.

Numbers: The price of Bitcoin skyrocketed over 35% in October.

Final Thoughts: Despite these trends, the report concludes that there is a considerably healthy macro environment for Bitcoin.

Can someone convince me that this is not an absolutely bonkers system?","My understanding of the wallet system is that it is like a row of a bajillion safes. All the safes are open and you can look inside. The only thing preventing someone from not being able to look into your safe is that there are so many that it would be unprobable for him to find it. 


I think this is kind of silly. Firstly. You can't calculate the probability with a perfect case scenario where your RNG generating your wallet will be perfect. RNG will definitely be imperfect and some seeds will get re-generated, some will never get generated. 


A pretty low number of people use bitcoin so yea, getting someone's address is not probable in the grand scope. But it is not impossible. 

If wallets had passwords, then people would have actual ownership of them. Like this it is just a numbers game, and I don't like it. Imagine someone with a quantum computer bruteforcing all wallets and getting all the money. It is possible. 


If anyone can give me a response that will satisfy me, please do. Maybe I misunderstood something. But this kind of system feels pretty stupid, not gonna lie. Imagine if the banking system worked like that. Literally nobody would use it.

I know that no one can answer this question for me, and there are personal things to consider, but let‚Äôs say I don‚Äôt really care about owning the property that much.

You can't see it because you are not thinking in the right terms.

As an example, almost every politician in history looked at statistics. He is not looking at you, he looks at a statistic and if this statistic in your state or country tells about narrow minded Christian/Muslim w/e hard liners he will evaluate this, act and say things accordingly to the preposition. If the narrative shifts, he will shift his facts slowly, to not loose the hardliners, but surely.

If this is something new to you and you did not think about it hard and clear, this will frighten you or you will dismiss it.

The truth is, most people don't think about reality as it is, they think about their individual reality and this individual reality doesn't mirror the true reality. The true reality, a huge planet an ever-expanding universe were so many things go on that describe reality, is almost impossible to get the full picture of.

What political players take for their advantage is money and statistics. Statistics tell you everything about every state, every country, every city, every suburban small fracture and then these statistics put you as an individual in a broad place.

When you think as an individual, try to abandon the main principle of this narrow thought process.  You.

If you do not think broad space, you don't think at all.

And if the politician does not think about reality this way or takes these principles into consideration ‚Äì do you really want her or him to govern you?

ql26f9,Responsible_Rip_1793,"Bitcoin ETF continues to drive market enthusiasm: less than half a month after listing, market cap already exceeds $1 billionWhat do you think about that just for reference","[INVESTING.com](https://INVESTING.com) \- Since Bitcoin was first created in 2009, it has gained many admirers along the way, but there are still many sceptics. As a result, even though the cryptocurrency market, led by Bitcoin, has soared in market value, it has been slow to gain recognition from the traditional financial industry, and national financial market regulators have not issued a formal ETF product for over a decade.

&amp;#x200B;

This situation continued until February 18th of this year, when Canada fired the first shot - the Toronto Exchange, which launched the world's first ETF (TIP) in 1990, launched CAD ETF Non-Currency, the world's first Purpose Bitcoin ETF for investing in bitcoin Hedged Units (TSX:BTCCb), and in the month that followed, Bitcoin followed suit, soaring from just over $40,000 to over $60,000.

&amp;#x200B;

Subsequently, related cryptocurrency ETFs began to spring up on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada, including three ethereum ETFs - the Purpose Ether ETF (ETHH), the CI Galaxy Ethereum ETF (ETHX) and the Evolve Ether ETF (ETHR)', and another Bitcoin ETF - 3iQCoinShares Bitcoin ETF (BTCQ).

&amp;#x200B;

However, what is more exciting for the market is that on 19 October this year, Wall Street finally welcomed the first Bitcoin ETF - the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSE:BITO).

The ProShares Bitcoin Strategic Futures ETF (BITO) was extremely popular on its launch day, with first-day volume exceeding $32.52 million and the spot price of bitcoin soaring to a high of $66,017.7 at one point. Less than half a month after its listing, BITO has already grown to become the second largest bitcoin ETF in the world in terms of market capitalisation after the 3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin ETF (BTCQ).

&amp;#x200B;

The market's enthusiasm for investing in bitcoin and ethereum is high, and the listing of a series of cryptocurrency ETFs such as BITO on Wall Street has further boosted the market's sentiment.

&amp;#x200B;

Statistics show that the cryptocurrency market has seen inflows of around $8 billion so far this year, surpassing last year's $6.7 billion, and the entire cryptocurrency market now has a market cap of over $2 trillion. the week of BITO's IPO, the total assets managed and invested in crypto by various investment houses had reached $76.7 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, with the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, both open interest and trading volume in Chicagoland BTC futures reached record highs, according to the latest data from Glassnode, spurring an explosive rise in open interest in October, increasing by $3.95 billion (265%) as the BITO ETF utilised Chicagoland futures contracts as the underlying, setting a new record high for open interest in CME exchange futures closed positions at a new all-time high of US$5.44 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, trading volume also reached a new high of $7.66 billion on 20 October, the day Bitcoin reached an all-time high. Traders traded $490 million more on CME futures relative to the previous peak set in February 2021. However, the margin ratio for futures collateralised by volatile cryptocurrency assets continues to fall, with futures contracts collateralised by cryptocurrencies having fallen from 70.1% in April (at the time of Coinbase's listing) to 44.6% today.

&amp;#x200B;

As the market continues its frenzy, investors still need to be aware of the risk factors in the cryptocurrency market.

&amp;#x200B;

SEC Chairman Gary Gensler ""poured cold water"" on the launch of the first bitcoin ETF when he said that the cryptocurrency market was growing at a rapid pace, but that additional regulation was still needed to ensure that investors' rights were protected. He said outright that the current cryptocurrency market still has insufficient protection mechanisms for investors, suggesting that the SEC still has no plans to release a bitcoin spot ETF in the near future.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, investments in cryptocurrency ETFs have their own shortcomings, with some investors complaining that futures-based ETFs cannot track bitcoin perfectly due to the cost of buying and selling futures contracts and other issues. They believe that if the cryptocurrency continues to rise, investors in bitcoin futures ETFs may face the problem of the fund lagging behind in performance.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) closed 2.24% lower last week at $60,460 per coin so far, according to quotes from Invesco [Investing.com](https://Investing.com). In addition, the CME November contract for bitcoin futures at the ChiNext is currently trading at $60,815, having also lost 0.55% on a weekly basis last week.",1635852669,0,1

qjv6qc,thadiusb,Thinkin about starting a BTC business. How profitable do you think a Bitcoin Education Center would/could be?,"I was thinking about starting a Bitcoin Education Center in my town in BC, Canada. It would be in a decent size city. 

I would provide information on how to buy Bitcoin. Education on different exchanges, or cold wallets. How to transfer. The importance of HODLing. ETC.

I can also provide information for teaching businesses on how to accept Bitcoin. I can cram the place full of BTC ATMs. I can hang up a bunch of TVs and run Michael Saylor talks.  

I can sell crypto wallets. I can provide courses as it takes a minimum 10 hours to actually begin understanding BTC.

Could a business like this be profitable? 

Any other ideas would be helpful :)

For example most super luxury stays that cost $3000 last year cost well over $30000 this year. As someone that comes from luxury the effect is very noticeable. Only btc has managed to retain purchasing power, increasing 20x over the same period.

It will trickle down to food prices and cheap rents last, and when those go 10x, all hell will break lose.

qjtvst,NicolaLisoFabbri,What could happen to the BITCOIN in the next few days?,"**Bitcoin broke the $ 65,000 resistance and traded at a new all-time high against the US Dollar. BTC is correcting gains, but declines could still be attractive near $ 60,000.**

‚Ä¢ Bitcoin gained pace above the $ 65,000 and $ 65,500 resistance levels.

‚Ä¢ The price is now trading above $ 63,000 and the 20-wheel exponential moving average.

‚Ä¢ A crucial uptrend line is forming with support near $ 60,000 on the daily chart of the BTC / USD pair.

‚Ä¢ The pair is correcting gains, and declines could extend in the near term within a range of $ 60,000 to $ 55,000. Bitcoin price remains in an uptrend Bitcoin price extended its rise above the $ 63,500 resistance zone.

BTC broke the key $ 65,000 resistance zone and moved above the 100 hourly simple moving average.

It even spiked above the $ 65,500 resistance and traded to a new all-time high of $ 66,982. It is currently correcting lower and trading below the $ 66,000 level.

There was a break below the 23,6% Fibonacci retracement level of the ascending wave from the $ 61,320 low to $ 66,982 high.

Immediate support is near the $ 60,000 level, and breaking this support can accelerate the downside to the **first interesting buy zone where various factors converge between the range of $ 56,000 -52,500 roughly.**

**The second very interesting buying zone is the one that is unique in the range of approximately $ 52,000 to 47,000.**

 

[Daily BTC chart](https://preview.redd.it/g4mkvvs5itw71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ea52bee6bbf27698d518a9767e8755516dad9ef)

On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $ 65,200 level. The first key resistance is near the $ 65,500 level. A clear break above the $ 65,500 resistance could open the doors for more advantages.

The next major resistance is near the $ 66,800 level, above which the price could rally towards the $ 68,000 level. More profit could drive the price towards the $ 70,000 level.

**Technical indicators:**

**Daily MACD:** Now it is losing its rhythm in the bullish zone, about to give a sell signal.

**Daily RSI:** Now showing weakness exiting the oversold zone, looking for neutral 50 levels.

**Major Support Level**s : $ 60,000, followed by $ 56,000.

**Major Resistance Levels** : $ 65,500, $ 66,800, and $ 68,000.

qjto4s,Few-Writing-5355,FOCUS ON THE CURVE OF PLANB's MODEL,"Don't just focus on $63K Oct, $135K Dec.  Look at the underlying curve.  His model shows we are in a largely flat price for BTC for 3 full years - out to 2024.  Meaning, once the price of BTC recovers to the model target, it may wallow there for up to 3 years.  The historic data shows wild fluctuations from the model (note - this is log scale so one unit in the y axis is an order of magnitude change.  (look at Sep/Oct 2013 where the price was almost a full order of magnitude above the curve).  This points me to a swing trade strategy after $100K - pick a number below $100K to accumulate and pick a number above to sell.  Rinse and repeat **until the model proves wrong** `(and hope you don't get royally porked because the model was totally wrong!.`  Not saying hold isn't a good strategy in the long run, but it could leave a lot on the table.

Final thoughts - since the detailed S2F model was only predicted in April of this year, it's not like you can look at pre-April data and say it always calls things perfectly.

qjtmbk,ShockWave52,Thanksgiving is upon us. ‚ÄúSo hows that Bitcoin thing doing?‚Äù,"Every year I always get asked by some family member about Bitcoin/crypto. About 90% of the time, its negative. Always getting tossed around and made fun of about how I invested in an imaginary thing made of fairy tale dust. Im sure most of you can relate. My Uncle in particular always gave me flack every single year. It was hard at first as I always looked up to him for financial advice. He grew up from the dirt and made his living on Wall St. He is the reason Im in the markets in the first place. Ive told him many reasons why this is the most beautiful investment of our lifetimes, but it never does click for him. He has told me to sell multiple times. As time went on, I grew to be very independent in my financial choices so all of the family flack just goes in one ear and out the other. 

Anyways, this year as we all know, will be a different conversation. A one to show how you were right, and your risk paid off. A friendly reminder to never tell anyone how much you hold. 

Im curious to hear your thanksgiving conversations. Cheers.",1635699249,4,1

TL;DR: when an output is spent, does that data value get mutated (e.g. spent : false -&gt; spent: true)? Or only new UTXOs get created? 

One thing I can't seem to resolve is how, on one hand you hear of how Bitcoin and blockchains would keep track of all the history always, and blocks are only added. Yet, I'm also reading how the spent outputs are ""removed"".

Would someone be able to please add a bit more detail to this conflict of understanding please? If indeed all information in the Blockchain is immutable and only added to, what are the typical mechanisms in this model that when someone views a wallet would determine which outputs are spent and unspent?

I advise y'all to forget predictions and start making a good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses. The market is very unstable and you can't tell if it's going bearish or bullish. While myself and others are trading without fear of making a loss others are being patient for the price to skyrocket.

I personally think that by making this move we are sending a message to the people who are still misled by bitcoin's carbon footprint, which, I might add, is much smaller than the entire video-streaming industry's carbon footprint.              

I'm wondering if we can make this a community movement?             

If we take this article at face value, which I believe is somewhat disingenuous, then mining 1 bitcoin creates 191 tonnes of CO2:              
https://www.visualcapitalist.com/comparing-the-carbon-footprint-of-gold-and-bitcoin/              

And if we take this article at face value, then 6 trees offsets one tonne of CO2:               
https://co2living.com/reduce-your-carbon-footprint-by-planting-a-tree/                

I've seen some websites that state 1 tree can be planted for 2 dollars. If all of the above is true and you own 1 bitcoin, then you would be looking at spending $2 x 191 x 6, or $2,292 USD to offset the carbon footprint that it took to make that 1 bitcoin.                

I'm willing to do that and a little more. I do drive a car, and I do plenty of things that leave me carbon-positive.",1635755345,44,1

Talking about BTC, yesterday said that there may be a new low, but as long as the quality of the project can increase the position, yesterday afternoon basically picked up, now the adjustment is basically over, don‚Äôt be afraid, if the downward pin, you can put the value of the currency in advance to hang a single market pin transaction.

Many times we‚Äôve talked about ETH, even looking at the 60 average, yesterday also said that it fell below but there are to undertake, is still a low suction opportunity, low suction to now also earn a little, but also said that the mainstream ETH can only say stable, BNB is still stronger than ETH, some time ago SBF FTT financing a lot, is also very valuable in the long term.

Facebook‚Äôs name change has stimulated metaverse concepts, which have exploded in the short term, including Mana, TLM, AXS, and RACA. So this is a long term concept, there are adjustments and you can keep paying attention to that, but in the last wave the first one that pulled up was ALICE, and the AXS doubled and ALICE didn‚Äôt move and she‚Äôs been consolidation for a long time, so you can keep paying attention to that.

The issues I have with the FAQ arguments on this issue:

A) it doesn't address the possibility of a less energy-intensive cryptocurrency

B) much of it is highly speculative.  E.g. the suggestion that the environmental impacts will be offset by bitcoin driving more rapid green technological innovation.

C) it focuses on slightly side-issues, like the idea that bitcoin could in theory just be run off 'waste' electricity at site.

Fees are around 1% and they deduct whatever sum from your bank weekly and then automatically purchase BTC for you.
