First off, the wallet rather behaves like of a browser than wallet. Not too comfortable with that.

Bitcoin is not called Bitcoin Core anymore. Off the bat you are presented with BCH and BTC. Looking further below it becomes clear which is which.

Not buying Bitcoin can now only happen if someone doesn't know what BCH or BTC are. The chances of things going wrong have been reduced, but.....

You can now set a manual fee. The fee preset prices are a mystery beforehand. The conformation time estimate is a number someone typed in manually. Fee advice also has a deceptive flavor to it. You know, the ""unbiased kind"", it could blamed on external sources. *But,* you can blamed the wallet for using shit sources.

In 2008-2009, when all the banks received government bailouts, those at the top of the pyramid, like Jamie Dimon, argued that they *“really didn’t need the bailout but they had to take it because the Fed forced them and nobody else wanted to take it,”* says Stacy.

*“All of these projects will be eviscerated,”* Max says, adding *“Now, bitcoin is going to make its move.”* He explains that bitcoin has been playing cat and mouse with these other projects to see who’s right and who’s wrong.

*“It’s going to go up to $100,000 per coin but it’s going to destroy everyone who gets in its way. So, all these altcoin posers and government subsidy-welfare bums will be eviscerated by the one true bitcoin. It’s about time…”* says Max.",1594300471,20,1

ho0fno,Veryuniquenames,Is bitcoin just an investment tool?,"It seems like bitcoin is becoming less practical to spend each day. And no, it’s not about transaction fees which I believe are fair in securing the network. Not advocating for btrash. Anyway, bitcoin is becoming harder to spend for these reasons:
1. Kyc- Most exchanges enact KYC regulations for the government. There is no inherent problem in this, but there is small privacy issues with this. Exchanges are really the only way (except for mining) to get btc
2. Smearing- when sending bitcoin, you can be easily smeared for a crime. For example, if you send from a kyc exchange and the receiver performs illegal activities with your coins, you can have a knock at the door. Fact is, the money can be traced back
3. Receiving- same issue as above, but the other way. Nowadays, bitcoin has little fungibility (dollars or physical items have a lot more). For example, if I received 1 bitcoin for a payment from bitcoin from, let’s say for example, Ross Ulbricht from the Silk Road, I would obviously be in a lot of trouble when i receive in an exchange wallet or eventually sell onto an exchange. Of course this can be unknowingly on the receivers side

So now the question is: Has bitcoin just become a big investment tool or hedge against traditional markets? I love bitcoin, but it seems like practical use cases for payment for services is fading. Once these issues are solved, I think bitcoin’s true potential can come. Let me know your thoughts!",1594288695,2,1

When you try to spend utxo 26 times (one chain utxo's), an error appears - the long mempool chain. This is the protocol of bitcoin and we can not do anything with it.

Imagine a situation in which the sender wants to freeze the funds of the recipient for an indefinite time for some reason. In this case, he waits for a large load on the network (more than 30k transactions) and makes 24 transactions in the perimeter of his wallet with a commission of 1 / Satoshi bytes. Then he transfers the payment № 25 to the recipient with a commission of 1 / Satoshi bytes.

The recipient’s money will be frozen until the network is unloaded. During this time, the attacker can take some action. I don’t know which ones yet. Maybe someone comes up with ideas.

I understand that this attack is extremely unlikely for ordinary users. But still interestingly, is it possible to use it somehow?

For example, if an attacker knows the recipient and knows where his hardware wallet, PC, smartphone (compromised with passwords). And after sending the funds to the recipient, the attacker will steal them with confidence that the recipient will not be able to send them anywhere within a week or even more.

hmeoxf,badtimemachine,Does ICANN know Satoshi's identity through the bitcoin.org domain registration?,"I like to buy and sell domain names. This has been on my mind for a while and I can't think of a good reason why this trail of clues wouldn't lead to some info about Satoshi.

Until cryptocurrency came along it wouldn't have been terribly easy to register a domain completely anonymously. Am I wrong? Even a debit card gift card has to be purchased somewhere by someone. 

My understanding is that [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org) was present on the original whitepaper.(Creation Date - 8/18/2008). 

Assuming Satoshi went to great lengths to hide their identity, wouldn't some degree of a paper or internet trail have to exist?

Potential ways to ""anonymize"" a domain registration:

 \- Debit Card Gift Card

 \- Online Payment Service

 \- Innocent third party who is or was unaware of the significance

 \- Special Promotion or Coupon for free registration.

I'm very curious to hear the opinions of others and to learn if I am missing something because this seems a little too strait forward. Has anyone looked into this?",1594063869,3,1

* Blatant spoofing on nearly every coin, daily, which they happily allow
* Really bad UI/UX design, like a 10yr old designed it
* Crappy trading tools for retail traders
* Constant bugs they don't bother fixing such as the 'max fill zero' bug for limit buy and sell orders which can potentially cost traders money when market is hot
* Goes down every time bitcoin pumps
* Undoubtedly the most dog sh!t crypto app I've ever seen in all of crypto universe
* Undoubtedly the most sh!t support of any US exchange

Moved everything to Bittrex, Binance US and Kraken. Volume and liquidity doesn't match Coinbase, but I've adjusted my trading strategy to make it work. Bye bye Coinbase.

Also submitted a report to the SEC over the major spoofing problems. If you want change, you have to take action. :)

hmcjjj,mdntblu,Scammed out of 1 BTC on localbitcoins.,"I'm not looking for people to tell me I'm stupid or tell me I made a mistake. I already acknowledge that I didn't do it correctly.

Here's the deal. I wanted to pay down some debt and so I wanted to cash out 1 BTC to do so. I went on Localbitcoins (never used the site before but heard about it many times) to find someone to take my 1 BTC and deposit the equivalent into my bank account. I found a user jlvm2204 on there who was willing to send money to my bank. When I was on his account I noticed he had a text number. So instead of starting the ""sale"" I decided to hit him up via Text first to make sure he was available and could do the transaction before I went any further and wasted my time. He replied to the text and said he was available. (remember I don't really understand how LBC works at this point) So he asked me what bank I had (I have the full text conversation I can send to someone if interested) and I told him. He also asked me for my account number which I gave him as well. He then said I can send you my wallet via text and we can just do it here, I have high ratings on LBC and tons of feedback, etc. I did notice he had 100% feedback rating. Part of me was like doing it over text is risky but then he had good feedback. So I then decided after contemplating a while to just go for it. That was when I knew it was a bad thing to do when I hit that send button, I had a bad feeling but there was no backing out.

So of course as you already know the end of the story I never heard from him again and never got money deposited in my bank account.

However because I told a friend who's used LBC many times about it he texted the same person and pretended he wanted to send money as well. They had a similar text convo but he decided to ask him to do a video chat with the guy and he said he would over Whatsapp. My friend was able to snap some photos of him via the video chat. We also have not only the SMS number we were using but also whatsapp number on top of that he posted another whatsapp number on his LBC account since I complained to LBC and they temp suspended his account. I'm pretty sure he's in Columbia.

I have also filed a report with the FBI, but does anyone know if theres any way to find this guy and will the country of Columbia government work with me/FBI to get him? We have a total of 3 phone numbers for him, and his obvious logins on LBC, along with a picture of him, etc.

Just looking for some advice. And yes I know I made a mistake. I don't need to hear how dumb I am. I already realize that. Helpful advice is what I'm looking for.

Thanks",1594058152,60,6

hm2ovh,CryptoCurri,Possible explanation for sideways movement?,"Due to COVID-19 the awareness of BTC and general investing $ are of low volumes. However, the crypto community with so much support (due to foundational belief in crypto, early investors) and institutional investors (awareness &amp; $ amongst them is increasing, Iran) keeps the prices above where they should be during COVID 19. This results in the sideways markets.
However, once the effects of COVID lift from the market the volume will pick the price up from where it was maintained, giving great growth.

Of course we all knew that once COVID was over the markets would pick up again, so why say this? Well if you believe in this line of reasoning than a massive gain relative to the last year is no longer a maybe, but inevitable; making now and until then an good time to buy.

I'm having to amend tax returns for 2017 (about 100 trades total) and 12 trades in 2018, and 35 trades in 2019.

I was just on the phone with someone from TokenTax and they quoted me $1000 to have one of their in-house CPA's go through and file reconciliations for those years + 2019. My family members tell me it'd be stupid to pay me to file any of this because they don't understand it and I lost money.

It appears that my Trezor hardware wallet has bit the dust. It is no longer regognized by my home PC or my work PC, meaning there's probably an issue with the connector. I've tried multiple cables and USB ports to no avail. I have my recovery seed but wonder if there's any limit to using it? I tried importing it into Electrum temporarily but its not showing any balance which means I probably did it in a wrong fashion? I've gone ahead and just ordered another Trezor wallet to make things easier which will arrive tomorrow. This is probably a dumb question but I'm just wondering if I f'd up by even attempting to use the recovery seed or if it can be used as much as needed?

He talks much of the time of Gold, but in my view Bitcoin and Gold should be best friends, instead of hoping just one will survive.

**BUT in episode 8 he also talks about Bitcoin** (the first half).

Sadly he also talks about Hashgraph in episode 8 (*this part isn´t good ... i think he got incomplete informations, because he was thinking it is also decentralized*)

I'm researching solo mining, but I need help in finding information on how the Coinbase Transaction is Generated:

It should be explained within the 'getblocktemplate' page on the Bitcoin Wiki ([https://en.bitcoin.it](https://en.bitcoin.it)), but this only explains how to build a coinbase transaction with the help of ""coinbasetxn""; and it's my understanding that ""coinbasetxn"" is only supported within Mining Pools, not the Bitcoin Wallet - remember, I'm researching solo mining.

What's also making things complicated is ""Segregated Witness"" (Segwit): With Segwit, all transactions now have a 'txid' and a 'hash'; sometimes, the 'txid' and 'hash' will match, but most of the time (including in some Coinbase Transactions) they don't. And I can't find anything online on how to generate a Coinbase Transaction while accounting for Segwit.

**Can anyone find an example algorithm that can build a Coinbase Transaction in a solo mining environment while also accounting for Segwit?**

You can share it in any code you like, but I'd prefer Python.",1595073494,0,1

htcuvn,brando2131,Wallets should be called keystores instead,"There is too much confusing around bitcoin and the crypto community. Many beginners who come here still ask basic questions because of the confusion around the word 'wallet'.

I've been thinking about this for a while and think we should be calling a bitcoin wallet or crypto wallet, a ""bitcoin keystore"", or ""blockchain keystore"" (for multi cryptocurrency wallets).

It would brush up a lot of confusion/misconceptions:

- Bitcoins are stored in a wallet. Wrong, your keystore gives you access to spending the bitcoin via the blockchain.

- Couldn't duplicating your wallet, duplicate your bitcoins. Wrong, duplicating a keystore just gives you a copy of the current keys.

- Backing up a wallet file is for your current bitcoins only. Wrong, backing up your keystore (if its deterministic like 99% of keystores) allows you to backup future funds too.

- Someone stealing your wallet, only gives them access to your current wallet funds. Wrong, access to the keystore also gives them access to future funds too that you deposit to it.

It would greatly benefit newcomers who should start thinking of there wallet as a bunch of keys, rather than a ""mysterious"" wallet, and need to unlearn there misconceptions. 

For one, Samsung blockchain keystore is the only one at the moment that refers to it this way that I can think of. But at least bitcoin core should create keystore.dat rather than wallet.dat by default, and then read either of these files for backwards compatibility. 

We already refer to wallets sometimes as ""seeds or private keys"" but we could do better by all together dropping the word wallet for keystore. That do you guys think?",1595058365,24,1

hvm754,attolini,How many bitcoins you need today to be a fiat millionaire/billionaire club equivalent,"Did a few quick Google searches and came across the following assumptions:

There are 2,100 billionaires with a total net worth of USD9.1t, 46.8m millionaires with a total net worth of USD158.3t, total population of 7.8b and total global wealth of USD1.2q (I used this instead of currency supply as millionaires/billionaires’ wealth are not measured in currency). The current BTC supply is currently 18.5m.

Based on this, billionaires make up 0.000027% (2.1k/7.8b) of the total population, with an average net worth of USD4.333b (0.00000027\*9.1t). That means an average billionaire owns 0.000361% (4.3b/1.2q) of the total global wealth. The average billionaire will have to own 67BTC (0.00000361\*18.5m) to be a billionaire equivalent in the BTC world. In total, the billionaires hold 140,292BTCs.

Using the same calculations for millionaires, they will have to own 5,215,655sats (or 0.052BTC), totalling 2,440,458BTCs. Given the USD1,200 being handed out, entry into the millionaires equivalent club in the BTC world is still within reach (round up to 6.15m sats to be safe).

For perspective, Satoshi Nakamoto (\~1m), the Winklevoss twins (\~210k) and possibly Chamath (200k?) already individually own more BTC than what all fiat world billionaires would need to own in total (140kBTC from my calc) to maintain the same ratio in the BTC world. If my simple calculations any degree of accuracy, would that make the BTC world less evenly distributed than the fiat world? Would Satoshi Nakamoto’s BTC wealth alone make all the Rothschild and Rockefeller’s combined wealth look like a million dollar family office equivalent in the BTC world?

Do my calculations stack up, or have I missed something?",1595388183,9,3

I went through the AT&amp;T payment screen, selected BitPay, and then sent some coin to the address (BCH this time, but I also have some BTC I will use). The coins went out of my wallet, a few moments later I got a ""Success!"" message, and my balance dropped to $0.00.

Everything looked great ... for a little while. 

After a few minutes, the AT&amp;T balance jumped back up to the full amount due, as if it was *never* paid.

BitPay's site says ""Looks like you don't have any transactions. Check back here when you make a payment to see your history.""

But... My coins are of course still gone, I have my BitPay transaction ID, and I even got a screenshot of the AT&amp;T app showing the ""Success!"" message with $0.00 due after I paid.

How could all the payment status *revert to unpaid*?

I made an app to help us

* set savings goals
* track buys and the occasional sat spends
* *optimize tax burdens by drawing from the best tax lots*
* automatically budget for next year's taxes
* manage our bitcoin finances regardless of wallets

I take privacy seriously and do NOT want any of your personally identifiable information.

* When you sign up, I give you a random UUID and that's all I know about you.
* Support is handled in-app. **I don't want your email address.**
* This is more like a checkbook or spreadsheet than a wallet. **There is no link to your transaction ids, this is intended to be a separate log.**
* I don't use third party cookies for retargeting advertising.
* I don't track your IP address. **Use the onion address** &amp; don't trust/verify.

This app will help me prove to the IRS that *my Casa subscription only realized a $0.68 tax bill*. **Yes I will be flooding them with such minutia. Fuck that noise.**

Rules:

 * should be possible to do with basic wallet or bitcoin explorer
 * should not require you to send the bitcoin

Chose the utxo you want to flip check the transaction that created the utxo if the last digit is even then face if it's odd then tail.

hxcbfd,Pantamis,Bitcoin is (the best) money for reasons different of what you think,"Too much people have a bad understanding of money. We all know that here. But even in r/Bitcoin, we often read this :

""Bitcoin is money because it is store of value, medium of exchange and wil be unit of account thanks its fixed supply"".

This is misleading, those are the functions of money, if a money furfils them well it is a good money but stuff can have these functions without being money.

&amp;#x200B;

# So what money IS really ?

Simple: a money is a bank IOU. Money is created when a bank gives a loan. Against the IOU, the bank asks the borrower to give it an IOU for the same amount plus interest and Money is destroyed when the principal of the loan is redeem (the bank's IOU vanished, but borower's IOU interest are still there). When we talk about money, we are in fact talking about a banking system, nothing less, nothing more.

&amp;#x200B;

In the case of fiat money, the central bankers owns the banking systems. The ""regulation"" is the set of rules of issuance of fiat (the credit issuance work is made by the commercial banks). When the central bank says it wants X% of inflation it sets how well its money is unit of account. ""Stabilize the prices"", ""avoid hyperinflation"" truely means ""maintain credibility of the banking system"". That's why banks are always saved too, they are just the right arm of the central bank to issue credit, they are the money itself.

Precious metal like gold are popular as a good way to physically represent an IOU because scarcity and durability make them good collateral in case the bank who issues the IOU disappears but it is not money in itself (it also lacks the medium of exchange function because gold can be faked). Gold standard was just a way to issue IOU so that it furfills the store of value and unit of account function automatically and add medium of exchange function (it is easier to check a dollar is a a real one than gold) creating a very good money. This was the choice of the FED before 1971 (and the dollar becames the international money as it was the best money).

So a money is always issued by a banking system as it wish to issue it (meaning it determines who get the loans), a bank provides by its network (of ATMs, of payment processors, of credit agencies...) easy ways to exchange its IOU and backed the IOU to give them credibility. Before all banks were private but when the states started to have one, they centralized all the banking system around it and private banks were forced to issue IOU against state bank's IOU, giving birth to the central banking system and so fiat money (as money = banking system's IOU). State money don't need collateral because you need to pay taxes in state money: the collateral is that you can pay taxes and so not ending up in prison. State money is a violent but hidden freedom restriction.

&amp;#x200B;

# So now, why Bitcoin is money ?

The Bitcoin's tokens are the IOU of a bank. Who is the central bank ? The Bitcoin protocol. Each node is a bank who applies strict rules of IOU issurance: loans are for miners, preferably the first ones as the supply schedule says. ""Run a full node to be your own bank"" is litteral, by validating Bitcoin's rules you are like a bank in the current banking system, except the central bank doesn't exist, it is just a protocol you follow with others. The only difference between Bitcoin and classical banking system is that the protocol doesn't ask an IOU to the miners in exchange for the newly created money to destroy it later, it is as if the miners made in fact a deposit of their computational work and the returned IOU value depends of supply schedule and difficulty.

Now, is Bitcoin a good money ? The answer is a bit subjective but mainly yes, it is certainly the best money if we look at how it has the three functions of the money (store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account). The IOU are valuable by the same principle of fiat money is valuable: you can use the Bitcoin ledger only if you pay at least the minimum relay fees... in bitcoins ! You also have to pay additionnal transaction fees but you can also pay them to a miner directly in something else but chance are low he found a block himself. Notice however that nothing force you to use the ledger so Bitcoin is peacefull contrary to state money. Bitcoin's IOU are extremly easy to exchange since if you don't find full node for that, you can just build one as soon as you have internet access ! So bitcoins are the absolute best medium of exchange. And finally, unit of account is more subjective but in expectation the best choice is indeed choosing a capped supply to get a form of price stability.

&amp;#x200B;

So there you have it: Bitcoin is money because it is a (peer-to-peer) banking system. It has the three functions of money. Bitcoin is valuable because you need to pay in Bitcoin's IOU to use its ledger (which is valuable for many applications because it is backed by miners' work). Bitcoin is the best medium of exchange because it is permissionless and decentralized: if there is no bank to process your payment, you can build one for you. And finally, the capped supply is the best way to have a unit of account function when you can't adjust the money supply to the economical context automatically.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why Bitcoin is the best money for me, if it is not the best it is at least a very good one (many are worse) moreover it is peaceful.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

PS : what about shitcoins ? Well they have a value to use their ledger as Bitcoin, but that's all.

Bitcoin's rules take care of your ability to run a full node, not shitcoins, so they are not good medium of exchange (censorship possible).  Shitcoins ledger are not as valuable as Bitcoin's one since it has less work. And finally many of them didn't choose a capped supply and the ones who premined or issue a big part of tokens to funders effectively give them the control of the issuance schedule of IOU, so a node is not a true bank: nothing to insure unit of account.

&amp;#x200B;

PPS : transaction fees have nothing to do with medium of exchange function. Minimum relay fees is the real taxe imposed to use the ledger and gives value to the token by opening access to the work of miners (it is a commitment to avoid spam). Transaction fees is something else, it is a way for the network to pay miners for their computational work with or without issuing more IOU's depending of the schedule. As miners will mine only if they earn enough money, and as the value of the money first came from this work in the ledger, a valuable Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency can stay valuable only if it has high enough transaction fees (newly issued IOU's included, they are the hidden inflation taxe imposed to all money users if high !). Those transaction fees depends of the congestion which happens when users use the network more than what allows it to stay in consensus, they naturally increase with usage of the ledger and will incitivise miners to mine more in the short term (this will be observed when transaction fees will represent most of the block reward). So the value of the Bitcoin's IOU will also comes from the value of what people can achieve with this ledger when block's subsidy will be lower after some halvings. It is true that transaction fees paid by users (and not issued) restrict the case where the ledger can be used. But the fact that it is used by very few people doesn't make it bad ! (particulary if you can transact IOU's with other networks without the ledger)",1595633078,15,0

Myself:  ""I knew that, hence the reminder"". 

Boss (who has no idea about Bitcoin): ""I can pay your salary in that dream currency you have been ranting about to everyone"". 

Myself: ""Oh sure no worries. So hereafter, you can pay my entire salary in Bitcoin. It's a digital currency not a dream currency""

Boss: whatever dude! You and your false beliefs

Myself: ""okay, so from now instead of a dollar, you give 1 Bitcoin. I can even sign a contract if you want me to""

Boss: Are you serious?!!

Myself: I am absolutely sure. I can even sign a contract if you want if we agree to the deal.

Boss: Alright, come in to my office tomorrow morning when I am back at office. We can discuss.

Next day, at Boss's office

Myself: Hey Mark, so I guess you still agree with the deal we made?

Boss after a complete stare: ""Cheeky bugger! You're kidding right? I just went home and googled it and a Bitcoin is worth nearly $10,000. Why makes you think I will pay 1 Bitcoin for every dollar?!!

hz7bkr,paulcheung1990,The deepest report: Bitmain's self-help history,"The original intention of this article is to let readers understand the causes and consequences of Bitmain internal fighting, but after writing it, I found that it is not so much internal fighting as it is a long history of self-help.

The story is very long. Let's adjust the timeline to the eve of December 17, 2018. That was one of Bitmain's most critical moments and the beginning of a series of subsequent stories.

**1. Self-immolation**  
In September 2018, Bitmain's financial department warned management that the company's cash flow has become very tight and operating costs must be reduced to allow the company to continue. The blockchain unicorn, which is valued at more than 15 billion U.S. dollars, is crippled in the run and struggling to break the corner.

In 2017, Bitmain made a profit of 1 billion US dollars  
In the first half of 2018, Bitmain made a profit of 1 billion US dollars  
Three rounds of financing, a total of 800 million US dollars  
Net assets should exceed 3 billion U.S. dollars  
In September 2018, Bitmain had tight cash flow and was on the verge of bankruptcy

A simple comparison, it is not difficult to see that Bitmain's ability to make money is incredible, and its ability to burn money is even more extreme.  


How does Bitmain burn money? Do you pour cash into gasoline and burn it, or hire a lot of employees to stuff the banknotes one by one into the shredder? The actual situation is closer to the latter.  


The following data can help readers quickly learn Bitmain's money burning skills.  


At the beginning of 2018, the entire cryptocurrency market has entered a bear market, but Bitmain's monthly operating costs have been rising wildly. Operating costs have risen from 10 million US dollars at the beginning of the year to 50 million US dollars at the end of the year.

Large-scale expansion of the R&amp;D team is one of the main reasons. The HR who once worked at Bitmain revealed that the company once hired more than 50 employees a day and nearly 500 employees a month. Even so, it was criticized for its slow recruitment speed. The cash consumption in this area is approximately $250 million.

Operating costs are just the tip of the iceberg. Excessive chip trial production can become a classic case of project management courses. Readers who pay attention to Cryptocurrency mining can easily find that Bitmain is still working hard to clear the inventory of Antminer S9 in 2019. As the co-CEO, Ketuan Zhan did not listen to the advice or even warnings of the Finance Department, insisting on the implementation of Excessive chip trial production, resulting in a large accumulation of inventory and tight capital turnover. Another CEO, Jihan Wu, once revealed that the loss of Excessive chip trial production to the company was approximately US$1.5 billion.

Large-scale expansion of the R&amp;D team is one of the main reasons. The HR who once worked at Bitmain revealed that the company once hired more than 50 employees a day and nearly 500 employees a month. Even so, it was criticized for its slow recruitment speed. The cash consumption in this area is approximately $250 million.

The BM1393 chip incident is even more incredible. Chip expert Ketuan Zhan invested a lot of money on a failed chip, and finally failed again. From 2017 to 2018, Bitmain has failed Trial production of mining machine chips at least 4 times, including 16nm, 12nm and 10nm chips, of which 16nm Trial production failed twice, thus losing at least US$1.2 billion.

It is rumored that Bitmain still holds a billion U.S. dollars worth of cryptocurrency in a state of floating loss. In view of the rebound in the market in 2020, we will not comment temporarily, waiting for the correct answer from the cryptocurrency market. But the losses pointed out in the previous article are all irreversible.

**2. Sole power**

In September 2018, Bitmain's management realized the seriousness of the problem. It turned out that the company's money could be squandered. As a result, the management began to discuss self-help plans, and the most reasonable and effective way was obviously to lay off employees.

The probation period for newly hired employees at Bitmain is half a year, and the probationary salary is 100% of the official salary, there is no difference. Once layoffs are made, new employees who have not passed the probationary period will be the main layoff targets. The department managed by Ketuan Zhan will face large-scale layoffs. The layoff plan is strongly opposed by Ketuan Zhan. Bitmain can only temporarily abandon the layoffs and replace it with continuous reductions. For marketing and travel expenses, a budget committee was established to strictly approve every expenditure. At the same time, employee benefits, such as reimbursement of taxi expenses, breakfast supply, snacks and drinks, etc., have also been abolished, and even the tradition of giving employees 400 yuan worth of BTC/BCH every month has been stopped.

In the face of huge cash flow pressure, trivial savings is obviously of no avail. Soon, the management again discussed the layoff plan, and it has reached the point where it has to be laid off.

In December 2018, Jihan Wu began to organize all entrepreneurial veterans and business backbones to persuade Ketuan Zhan to agree to layoffs, but Ketuan Zhan still insisted not to layoffs. The persuasion process was very unsuccessful. After many meetings and intense debates, Bitmain executives were caught in a dilemma of wasting time with Ketuan Zhan.

In this process, the shortcomings of the dual CEO system began to appear, and the relationship between the two CEOs gradually deteriorated.

On the night of December 16th, Ketuan Zhan reconvened the management meeting, and more than 30 managements who were present were asked to hand over their mobile phones. At this time, Jihan Wu was on a business trip in Hong Kong and was busy with listing related work.

In the meeting, Ketuan Zhan's core content was three items:

(1) Bitmain cannot have two CEOs, only one CEO and must be Ketuan Zhan. Ketuan Zhan said that he met an old leader during a business trip. He hadn't seen each other for many years. The old leader suggested that the company can only have one CEO, and it must be him. Ketuan Zhan feels that this is a kind of fate, an opportunity given by God.

(2) Ketuan Zhan believes that the company's cash flow problems, the biggest responsibility is the inability of the financial department. To prove his point, Ketuan Zhan announced Bitmain's financial data at the meeting. In the evening, employees in Taiwan began to post messages on social media, saying that the company's capital chain was broken and the top management was split.

(3) If Ketuan Zhan is not supported, the option will be cancelled and the equity will be voided.

Hearing about this, Jihan Wu, who lives in Hong Kong, sent a WeChat message to the management who are attending the meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c5cxea2lqid51.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d6a0388408f6b8abe10648e5e4b7a3a5434c821

 

On the afternoon of December 17, 2018, Jihan Wu returned to Beijing to negotiate with Ketuan Zhan all night, and finally reached a consensus in the early morning. Bitmain co-founder Yuesheng Ge announced the results of the negotiations. Jihan Wu and Ketuan Zhan ceased to serve as CEOs, and Haichao Wang served as CEO. Jihan Wu voluntarily backed down and Ketuan Zhan served as chairman.

The ""12.17 Incident"" had a very bad impact on Bitmain, especially the disclosure of Bitmain's financial status, which caused vendors to start dunning. The loan that had just been negotiated with the Bank of Beijing was cancelled the next day. Jihan Wu's resignation as CEO caused an uproar in the industry, and it became a hot topic among Cryptocurrency mining, blockchain practitioners, and investor communities. The media focused their interpretation on Bitmain's series of incidents, and generally looked down upon its ongoing Hong Kong IPO, believing that the high-level changes had already signaled the failure of the IPO in advance.

On Christmas December 24, 2018, Bitmain finally began to implement the layoff plan. This long-delayed “correct decision” was achieved after a stalemate for nearly three months. The AI ​​teams in Beijing, Singapore, Taiwan, and Shanghai have laid off more than 50% of their employees. The Israeli R&amp;D center was closed and Shenzhen New Species Technology Co., Ltd., which had been acquired for only ten months, was dissolved, and all employees were laid off. Copernicus, Bitmain's top blockchain development team, was not spared and was wiped out in this layoff. Copernicus and some of the laid-off employees joined the new company Matrixport co-founded by Jihan Wu and Yuesheng Ge, headquartered in Singapore.

**3. Past events when starting a business**

After the ""12.17 Incident"", Jihan Wu gradually faded out of Bitmain's management affairs and turned his attention to the IPO and new company. And this is one of Jihan Wu's major mistakes, he began to let Ketuan Zhan manage Bitmain alone.

In fact, as early as 2013, Jihan Wu planted hidden dangers.

Jihan Wu, an investment banker, was the earliest translator of the Bitcoin white paper. He began to get involved in the cryptocurrency mining industry in 2012. The disappearance of Kaomao and Nangua Zhang's ticket skipping led Jihan Wu to decide to develop his own chip.

In 2013, Jihan Wu established his own mining machine company. Together with Yuesheng Ge, who was only 20 years old, he found Ketuan Zhan, an integrated circuit designer of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to create the protagonist of this article, and later the digital Cryptocurrency mining giant, Bitmain.

Jihan Wu promised Ketuan Zhan that every time a mining machine chip was successfully developed, he would give some shares to the Ketuan Zhan team. At that time, the company founded by Ketuan Zhan was on the eve of falling apart. In order to regroup the team, Ketuan Zhan promised to share half of his shares with the team members. Unfortunately, this is just a bad check. With the rapid development of Bitmain and higher and higher valuations, the expanding Ketuan Zhan almost monopolized all the shares.

Like many startups, Bitmain encountered many difficulties in its early days, and many jobs had to be done by the boss. For example, in the chip design and production process in the second half of 2013, Bitmain was caught in a dilemma of insufficient funds. Jihan Wu personally raised funds and met with TSMC’s sales to persuade TSMC to accept the production needs of a start-up company. Jihan Wu also participated in the selection of the thermodynamic parameters of the heat sink in the Antminer S1.

In 2014, Jihan Wu discovered that this company was independently operated by Ketuan Zhan, which had huge problems. Forcing Jihan Wu to continue to participate in company management.

At that time, Bitmain's mining machine chips had just achieved a certain lead in the standard design process. Jihan Wu believes that the next step must be to develop full customization technology, but Ketuan Zhan plans to invest resources in the research of mobile payment chips.

Ketuan Zhan met a mysterious person from the Party Central Security Bureau who claimed to be able to manipulate the Party Central Committee’s decision-making process for the next generation of mobile payment cryptography standards, but this direction is likely to lead to the fact that Bitmain has just gained the lead in the mining machine market. Regained.

Jihan Wu said that as a graduate of the School of Economics, with a little memory of his high school stage and the knowledge reserve of a computer technology amateur, he retrieves various materials and papers every day, learns theories related to full customization, and goes to Ketuan Zhan conducts persuasion work there.

Fortunately, in the direction of full customization technology, Ketuan Zhan finally listened to Jihan Wu's opinion. Bitmain quickly integrated the technical experts from the United States and Russia introduced by Jihan Wu, which greatly improved the design level of chips and complete machines.

In 2015, Jihan Wu suggested that Ketuan Zhan consider the direction of artificial intelligence. But Ketuan Zhan is not here, he prefers the CPU direction. After staying asleep at night, coupled with in-depth analysis by the Bitmain investment team, Ketuan Zhan finally agreed with this direction. It is a pity that after the Tianshi Chen brothers made major breakthroughs in theory and practice, Bitmain officially invested in the relevant direction, and it was still a step behind.

In the two years from 2016 to 2017, Bitmain's business performance has achieved rapid development, becoming a unique super unicorn in the blockchain industry. According to Froth &amp; Sullivan, in 2017, Bitmain Technology Holdings was the second largest fabless chip design company in China and the tenth largest fabless chip design company in the world, and the fourth largest fabless ASIC chip design company in the world, accounting for 74.5% of global cryptocurrency market share.

However, the huge crisis has long been buried in the early days of entrepreneurship.

Ketuan Zhan's decision on major directions revealed his weakness of extremely lack of business understanding. But every mistake he made was blocked by the company's core employees. His overconfidence in his management ability led to the gradual intensification of conflicts, and the management differences between the two founders became more serious.

**4.The giant gets lost**

The contradiction between the two broke out on December 17, 2018. Ketuan Zhan used extreme means to force the management to compromise with him by canceling the option, so as to achieve the goal of sole control of the company. Jihan Wu returned to Beijing from Hong Kong overnight and negotiated with Ketuan Zhan all night. In the end, the two resigned as CEO. Jihan Wu retired. Ketuan Zhan has the exclusive rights of chairman in exchange for the implementation of the layoff plan.

Jihan Wu's voluntary retreat has intensified Ketuan Zhan's management to do whatever he wants.

A Bitmain employee commented on Ketuan Zhan's management skills, summed up in two letters-SM.

After becoming the sole helm of the company, Ketuan Zhan quickly ""rectified"" the department in charge of Jihan Wu as the chairman of the board. He guided the sales of mining machines at the dinner, and pointed out that the sales performance is not due to the sales staff. Ability is strong, but the company provides opportunities. Take two sales leaders as examples, saying that if the company hadn't given the opportunity, they would still be losers. In addition, Ketuan Zhan also instructed the sales staff on how to toast and imparted the wine table culture and experience.

After the meal, Ketuan Zhan came to the conclusion that the quality of Bitmain sales staff was too poor, and Huawei’s blood needs to be injected to drive the company’s progress. Soon, the marketing and sales director from Huawei officially took over Bitmain, opening the era of brand premium for Antminer.

In order to further understand and guide the sales work, Ketuan Zhan asked to meet the customers with the sales staff. During the negotiation process, Ketuan Zhan had a heated discussion with customers on the issue of Chinese and Western medicine, and had also forced the sales staff to be able to ship 10,000 machines due to insufficient production capacity.

Although the requirements for sales personnel are strict, Ketuan Zhan has provided a lot of convenience for ""Mainland Ark"". In addition to selling mining machines at a more favorable price, Bitmain's mining machines are also hosted in Ming Wang at a higher price than the market price. Mine. It is reported that both Ketuan Zhan and Ming Wang are shareholders of Ark.

The new sales strategy of Huawei's executives has also brought very obvious changes to Bitmain. The self-righteous brand premium reduces the price-performance ratio of Antminer, causing competing products to eat away at Bitmain's market share. Later, Bitmain found that the strategy was wrong and started to cut prices, and found that the mining machine market was saturated and the purchase demand of miners had decreased.

More dangerous than the sales strategy is that the technical advantages of Antminer are being chased by competing products, and even overtaken. At the same time, the two mining pools under Bitmain also lost their first and second positions. The AI ​​business, which Jihan Wu placed high hopes and Ketuan Zhan personally supervised, became a laughing stock in the industry. Not only did it fail to make a profit, it almost brought down Bitmain.

Blindly introducing senior executives from Huawei to occupy important positions completely destroys the company's internal cultural foundation. The bureaucracy within Bitmain began to corrode from high-level employees to ordinary employees. Ketuan Zhan is not aware of this. He is still keen on recruiting Huawei employees, imitating Huawei's organizational structure and strategy, letting HR do sales and R&amp;D personnel to do HR.

The organizational structure adjustment in October 2019 was the fuse for Ketuan Zhan to completely anger Bitmain management. This time, Ketuan Zhan completely marginalized Bitmain’s veteran employees, and suddenly promoted some of the “airborne soldiers” who had just joined the company to the position of person in charge, which caused the former person in charge to report to the new employees. The two managers who were originally equal The hierarchy becomes the subordinate relationship, the operation and development of different business lines are merged into a large department, the upward reporting process becomes more cumbersome, and the relationship between employees becomes delicate.

**5. Headwind**

On October 29, 2019, Jihan Wu urgently held a staff meeting. Prior to this, the legal representative of Beijing Bitmain has been changed to Jihan Wu, including the parent companies Hong Kong Bitmain and Cayman Bitmain. Jihan Wu stood in the lobby of Building 25, B1, announcing that Ketuan Zhan has been relieved of all duties. Any employee in the Bitmain Group shall no longer execute Ketuan Zhan’s instructions and participate in any meetings convened by Ketuan Zhan. If there is any violation, the company will demotion and expel the company based on the severity of the circumstances. If losses are caused to the company, the company will be held accountable.

Jihan Wu's speech is very long, which can be summarized as follows:

(1) Ketuan Zhan has been relieved of all duties. Also expelled from the original Huawei company HR Zhi Wang introduced by Ketuan Zhan at the end of 2018. Zhi Wang’s reputation on Bitmain was extremely poor and was ridiculed by employees as ""nine thousand years"" (In ancient China, the emperor was called ""ten thousand years old"", and the prince was ""eight thousand years old."" However, in the Ming Dynasty, there was an eunuch who caused harm to the country and the people. He called himself ""nine thousand years old"", meaning that he was only A little lower than the emperor's level).

(2) Ketuan Zhan's ability to control the company's option incentive plan has disappeared, and it is no longer possible to cancel employees' options at will.

(3) The organizational structure adjustment plan led by Ketuan Zhan was suspended.

(4) We are optimistic about the future of AI business, but the premise is that the main business can continue to make profits in order to support the company's continued investment in AI business.

In the speech, Jihan Wu also told employees the whole story of the ""12.17 Incident"" and bluntly said that the company is not in good condition. If no measures are taken, Bitmain is likely to go bankrupt in three quarters and he must come back to save the company.

At this time, Ketuan Zhan, who was on a business trip in Shenzhen, finally experienced the situation of Jihan Wu in the ""12.17 Incident"".

After the official return, Jihan Wu began to clearly point out the company's various problems in operation and management, and went deep into each business line to understand the situation. In the mining machine sales department meeting, employees spoke enthusiastically, reflecting on the difficulties and opinions encountered in the work, the marketing and sales director from Huawei asked with a surprised look, ""Why didn't these issues be reported to me before?"", and soon , The director was interviewed and ""voluntarily resigned.""

On November 2, 2019, Jihan Wu announced a salary increase for all employees. Bitmain’s last salary increase dates back to 2018. In principle, Bitmain has two salary increases every year.

On November 7, 2019, Ketuan Zhan spoke on social media for the first time, describing his hardship in starting a business, and condemning Jihan Wu for “stabbing a knife in the back”. At the end of the article, he also set himself a KPI for 2020, that is, the mining machine market share will reach 90%, and the AI ​​business will earn 1 billion.

But Ketuan Zhan's majestic plan did not make Bitmain employees feel emotional, but ridiculed him instead. Employees exposed that he insulted employees, advocated Chinese medicine, believed in Buddhism, drank in meetings, practiced Qigong...

However, there is less than half a year before the halving of Bitcoin production, and the cryptocurrency market shows no signs of recovery, which makes Bitmain management very anxious.

On January 6, 2020, Bitmain ushered in another round of layoffs, with a layoff ratio of about 1/3. This time the layoffs have caused many employees who have just increased their salaries to feel very grieved. On the one hand, they were looking forward to Jihan Wu's return. On the other hand, the compensation for this layoff was less than 18 years.

Ketuan Zhan, who has been unable to enter the Bitmain office area, once again spoke on social media and firmly opposed to layoffs. We do not need to lay off staff and we cannot commit suicide.

During the Spring Festival, Covid-19 broke out. Mainland China has begun to extend the Spring Festival holiday and advocate working from home. Under the chain reaction caused by Covid-19, most companies have chosen to cut salaries or even lay off employees. In the first two months of 2020, China's exports fell by 17%, U.S. stocks were broken four times in a row, Bitcoin plunged 40% in 24 hours on March 12, 2020, and crude oil futures fell by 300% on April 20, 2020...

Obviously, Jihan Wu can't predict, but this layoff seems to be the right decision again. In addition, from January to April 2020, Bitmain's revenue exceeded US$400 million amid the spread of Covid-19 and the collapse of the financial market.

**6. Fight to the death**

When Jihan Wu tried to get the company back on track, Ketuan Zhan was not helpless. On April 28, 2020, Ketuan Zhan finally rolled back the legal representative of Beijing Bitmain to before October 28, 2019 by repeatedly submitting administrative reconsiderations, and restored his status as a legal representative.

On the morning of May 8, 2020, a piece of news about Bitmain quickly appeared on the real-time hot search rankings, and even dominated the headlines of the day. At window 52 on the second floor of the Haidian District Government Affairs Center, when Ketuan Zhan, the legal person of Beijing Bitmain Company, was receiving the business license, a group of unidentified people snatched the business license from the industrial and commercial administrative staff. A source at the scene said that the number of unidentified people in the group was about 60 people, of which Luyao Liu was directing at the scene.

This is a skillful piece of news. It first leads readers to think that Ketuan Zhan is a victim, using 60 people to grab business licenses as the focus. The masses accused Jihan Wu of lawlessness, but ignored whether the government affairs center could have 60 personnel. As for Hong Kong Bitmain to have the right to appoint a representative to obtain a business license, this is a deeper level of thinking.

The follow-up report restored the real situation at the scene. Only more than ten people were present, and both sides were equipped with security personnel. Bitmain employees also broke the news in the circle of friends, claiming that Ketuan Zhan's bodyguard had injured Bitmain's authorized person, and said in a threatening tone, ""Be careful!""

However, the subsequent plot reversal did not have much effect. Jihan Wu's reputation has been greatly affected. From a bloody soldier who rescued the company in trouble to a lawless criminal, it can be said to be a world of war. do not.

Ketuan Zhan, who succeeded in the first battle, began to counterattack Bitmain continuously. On the afternoon of June 3, 2020, Ketuan Zhan led a team to pry open the back door of the Beijing Bitmain office and formally occupied the deserted Beijing headquarters.

On June 4, 2020, Ketuan Zhan called on Bitmain employees to resume work and promised to expand the company's market value to more than US$50 billion within three to five years. After that, Ketuan Zhan began to contact employees by phone, trying to acquire the options in the hands of employees at a valuation of 4 billion US dollars.

Subsequently, Ketuan Zhan recalled Huawei's executives and issued a series of personnel appointments and removals. As of June 9, 2020, Ketuan Zhan has successively eliminated CFO Luyao Liu, and Wenguang Wang, the head of the mining center. Luyao Liu is responsible for controlling Bitmain's IPO plan. He also appointed Yanwu Ma as the HR director, Gang Ren as the head of the mining center, Yonggang Sun as the head of the supply chain, Ling Gu as the financial director, and Bin Zhu as the head of the mining machine business department. Bin Zhu is the senior executive of Huawei who was interviewed and left as mentioned in the previous article. During his tenure, he reduced Antminer’s 90% market share to 50%, and received a large number of complaints from miners. Internal employees once speculated that he might be Compete against the spies sent by the company.

In addition to recalling senior executives of Huawei, Ketuan Zhan also urged employees to return to work. They can receive a bonus of 10,000 yuan when they return to work on the same day, which is only half the next day. Ketuan Zhan showed a very kind side. Every time the elevator door is opened, Ketuan Zhan's hot gaze can be met, shaking hands, taking photos, and receiving money. As there is no personnel information, Ketuan Zhan does not know whether the person receiving the money is a Bitmain employee, and these people did not resume work the next day.

The effect of gentleness was not good, Ketuan Zhan began to force employees to return to work. Seeing that there are still very few respondents, Ketuan Zhan threatened employees through SMS, phone calls, EMS, emails and other harassment, issued multiple threats such as termination of contract, suspension of payment of social insurance, suspension of wages, and even used personal information saved by employees to form a group of employees. Domicile threats, requiring employees to perform ""work handover"", trying to force employees to return work computers, etc.

On June 10, 2020, the media revealed that Ketuan Zhan had controlled Bitmain's Shenzhen factory and prohibited employees from delivering normal shipments to paid customers, which caused difficulties in the operation of the Bitmain mining machine department.

On June 13, 2020, Hong Kong Bitmain, the parent company of Beijing Bitmain, issued a statement accusing Ketuan Zhan of signing a ""Sales Agency Agreement"" with the Ark Data Technology Co., Ltd. in which it holds shares, in an attempt to embezzle Beijing Bit's assets.

On June 17, 2020, the media revealed that Ketuan Zhan started selling 14,000 T17+ series mining machines at low prices.

On June 20, 2020, Hong Kong Bitmain officially suspended the supply of chips to the Shenzhen factory.

On July 13, 2020, in the ""A Letter to All My colleagues in the Shenzhen Factory"" released by Bitmain in Hong Kong, more details were added on the series of Ketuan Zhan's actions in June.

The legal person Feng Zhou of the Shenzhen plant is related to Ketuan Zhan. After being relieved of Ketuan Zhan's post, Jihan Wu flew to Shenzhen to have a long talk with Feng Zhou. Jihan Wu believes that Feng Zhou is the right person to manage the factory and help the company overcome difficulties, and decides to leave Feng Zhou to continue to manage the factory.

This wrong decision staged a story of a farmer and a snake. When Ketuan Zhan began to counterattack Bitmain, Feng Zhou was also quickly instigated and began to assist Ketuan Zhan in seizing customer machines and transferring 17,000 T17 mining machines in the warehouse. Hainan Continental Ark Data Technology Co., Ltd., which is held by Ketuan Zhan, sold them at a low price.

In order to protect the interests of customers, Jihan Wu had to make a compromise and paid the payment for some goods to a bank account controlled by Ketuan Zhan in exchange for delivery. However, after the other party received a payment of 109 million, the delivery stopped. On July 8, 2020, 5600 mining machines have been overdue.

At the same time, the factory defaulted on suppliers’ accounts payable as much as 200 million yuan. Bank acceptance bills issued by the factory, exceeding 36 million yuan, will expire on July 17, and more than 34 million yuan will expire on July 23. It is understood that Ketuan Zhan, after receiving the bank's dunning call, made it clear that he would not repay the loan, which would destroy the company and the entire group's credit in financial institutions.

**7、 This is not the end**

So far, the power struggle between the founders of Bitmain has been more than half a year. The office building already occupied by Ketuan Zhan is still empty, and most employees choose to work from home. Some chip developers returned to the office with the acquiescence of Jihan Wu and continued to maintain research and development to reduce the impact of infighting on technological iteration and competitiveness.

This giant ship that once stood on top of the supercomputer chip is crashing into the iceberg due to the madness of the former helm. Ketuan Zhan's madness and Jihan Wu's compromise made mistakes again and again. Bitmain tried to save himself many times, but was unable to get out of the black hole.

If the time goes back to that day in 2013, would Jihan Wu and Yuesheng Ge still choose to dial Ketuan Zhan?",1595907441,4,1

I would appreciate any recommendations. I am happy to pay the right person for their time, ideally someone has some credibility online. 

Alternatively, if you are an experienced trader and just happy to help, please reach out to me as well.

i122e1,Satoshilol,DEMOS: Staking Always Continue to Move Forward,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jcayvfuvq4e51.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70b1195daecc3a9cb6737bf7b22c758c5f30d52e

 

Staking  (Staking Mining) has been very popular recently. It seems that you  can’t say hello to others in the currency circle without knowing that  Staking.

**Staking is essentially a product that is similar to the fixed income of the currency circle.** The  bear market environment has given it the soil for its development. It  provides scenarios that users can accept in the short term, such as node  services, especially the special time when the exchange joins. The  public knows better that 2019 is the first year of Staking.

Staking  is a verification process under the POS consensus mechanism. In the POS  mechanism, all nodes need to pledge tokens to participate in the  consensus. At the same time, the public chain network verifier is also  the holder of the token, and the pledger needs to lock their tokens as  collateral , In exchange for the right to verify blocks and mining  rewards. In the POS consensus mechanism project, all miners must hold  coins, and anyone can participate in staking to “earn coins” through  encrypted asset mortgage lock-up. If POW tokens used to provide rewards  through calculations, then POS participates in staking through encrypted  asset mortgage lock-up.

Although  there are still people who are skeptical about whether staking can make  money, it has to be said that instead of letting “digital assets” lie  quietly in their wallets, most people choose to do staking to increase  the share of Token in the entire network. Share. In order to make this  income truly reach a positive value, DEMOS, which has the advantage of a  public chain, adopts a democratic voting method to provide high income  from staking. The process is as follows:

Users  who want to participate in staking first need to open a democratic  certificate, bind the corresponding mining pool, and then use DOS to buy  votes (refer to the figure below for the detailed process). DEMOS  adopts a POW+POS dual consensus mechanism, and it is set that when POW  miners generate each block, at least 5 votes are required for  confirmation, and there can be up to 20 votes. 30% of the DOS rewards  for block generation will be shared equally by the selected voters, 60%  of the rewards will be obtained by POW miners, and the remaining 10%  will be entered into the community account as a community fund. **The process from voting to the selection of a vote is called a smashed vote.**  If the smashed vote is successful, the principal and rewards will be  credited to the account at once. As of the time of publication, the  ticket price is about 321.86DOS, the unit’s blast ticket reward is about  37.32DOS, and the rate of return is as high as 11.6%.

**Since  voting is randomly selected, the vote-popping cycle is also random.  Participants can purchase multiple tickets to increase their  vote-popping rate.**

DEMOS’s  mature ticket mechanism (that is, the ticket pool can only hold up to  40960 tickets at the same time) guarantees that the cycle of votes will  not exceed 142 days. Tickets that have not been selected after this time  will be returned. The selection rate is only 0.5%. According to the  feedback from the DEMOS community, the average cycle of the current vote  burst is about 28 days, and the vote burst in the fastest day.

**The DEMOS autonomous community has a mining pool freely formed by participants.**  The role of the mining pool is to vote on behalf of miners when they  need to vote, and vote online 24 hours a day. As of the publication time  of this article, DEMOS has 13 mining pools with a total pledge amount:  848,048. The largest mining pool pledge amount is 374,069, which shows  the popularity of DEMOS Staking.

For  the cryptocurrency industry, staking in the POS mechanism has two main  functions, namely, maintaining security and incentivizing user  participation. Just like the founder of Babbitt said: “The biggest  significance of staking is to increase community participation, because  when participating in staking, the vast majority of token holders and  project parties are communities of interest.” DEMOS Staking On the one  hand, the marketization of revenue encourages users to participate in  DOS voting (staking) to increase revenue, and on the other hand, it also  provides effective guarantees for the decentralization and security of  DEMOS.

Staking  economy has become an emerging model for blockchain participants to  obtain stable income. As more and more investors pour into this track,  it is foreseeable that Staking proceeds will eventually sink into the  community economy, and the hidden value will inevitably be unlimited.

**DEMOS, as the global basic public chain, is here the track is bound to go straight ahead.**

The main point he brought up is how he believes if governments decide to adopt cryptocurrency at some point, they will create regulations that make it difficult and more expensive to use bitcoin as opposed to the federally controlled cryptos, creating incentive for people to opt for the fed regulated options. I stated that I believe the people who use bitcoin will likely stand by it because of the fact that it is NOT controlled by any single entity. His response was that the controlling elite will always overpower the desires of the majority and either way people who invest in BTC to hold for the long run will end up suffering.

I don't understand how only giving your debit card into allows you to withdrawal from your banks ATM with the low fees like $2.

I am aware of btc atm's that ""sell"" and charge 7-10%, not interested in those.

I am aware of gift cards; amazon lowes, not interested. But is there such an option as buying a reloadable VISA with cash from the grocery/market or Walmart and sending that VISA number to BitPay? I think you have to give a name and address to the reloadable VISA people in order to constantly use it or go over a certain limit.

Well we started talking bets and my drunk self came up with insane bet which he jokingly gave me the most insane odds! My friend gave me 100 to 1 odds I couldn’t get 1 Bitcoin for free sent to me by a stranger in the next month. The max I could I put down is 100 bucks. I gave him hundred bucks today and the bet began. I literally expect to lose the 100 bucks honestly don’t give a shit but I figured what the hell its interesting story at least! I’m going to link my bitcoin address at the bottom of the post he helped me set it up today! Please troll and have fun with this post! I’m honestly just doing this cause you hear of crazy stories like Mr.Beast giving 100k to some random person! That’s where I got the idea for the bet haha!

I'm Venezuelan living here and have taken the time to track and share this weekly numbers.

This is the first time all the numbers went down. Don't know what happened. Nothing special to be honest.

Since last week the goverment is officially taking BTC to pay for passports, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/her9xg/venezuela\_government\_is\_officially\_taking\_bitcoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/her9xg/venezuela_government_is_officially_taking_bitcoin/) (only for Venezuelan living abroad)

I  think a part of that weekly Localbitcoin volumen comes directly for the  goverment. It has been around 2,000 BTC monthly for months!  (only  measured using  LocalBitcoin, there are other exchanges like AIRTM,  Uphold, Binance and  so on, but no open data). Most of the Localbitcoin  trades are in Bolivares.

I  recommend reading this website, it is one of the best english websites  for Venezuela news (they sometimes touch the crypto and economic  situation).

[https://www.caracaschronicles.com/](https://www.caracaschronicles.com/)

People   always ask what the the  average salary, not the minimum. Well I would   say around 20-50 USD  monthly. One doctor is around 30 USD. Teacher   around 20 USD.  Junior  engineer maybe 50 USD (The  engineers collegue   ""suggests"" around 200  USD monthly, but it is hard to find a place with   these wages)

Any question let me know, AMA. But check my links and sources first.

hjzc3s,200201552,How will Bitcoin have a future?,"*Keep in mind that you guys are in an echo chamber as you read what my thoughts are on bitcoin.*  


I honestly dont see the currency being accepted as a global currency in the near or distant future. if theres only 21 million bitcoin that can possibly exist and that amount is reached in 2140, the amount of bitcoin that  will be bricked due to lost passcodes and people dying whilst in  ownership of such currency in the next 10 generations will cause circulative supply  to drop to such a low that the majority of bitcoin in circulation will  be owned by less and less people and thus create a stagnant ecosystem.  Its price will be determined by fewer and fewer individuals that have the majority of bitcoin. This goes against the spirit of community and human values  that value a certain level of governing control through a majority consensus.  


 If it is  to be accepted by the billions of people on earth then it has to have a  stable price and value that can be controlled by the communities that  use it or it will warp a large % of peoples minds into valuing it as an **appreciating commodity and not a currency**.  


 The effort to get people to learn fractions and technology that  involve phones and usb-like devices is also a major hurdle to accessibility for most people. Our current global infrastructure does  not support widespread use of crypto. But when does, which wont be in  the near future, Fiat currency will remain the leader in value because  through law it can be bound to a physical asset such as gold.   


So to me, if I bought bitcoin, I personally see that as a move only motivated by distrust in government. People dont realise that they are their government and they have a say in it by either becoming a representative of the people or electing someone as such.   


When Andrew Yang (the only technologically literate candidate to ever run for office) eventually becomes president and America is systematically reformatted to a modern up to date country, Intelligent use of fiat currency will bounce back and will be a very strong norm. Governing bodies can fund programs that value community and human centered values. Universal basic income and a booming population will require fiat currency as its stable medium of trade. Bitcoin cannot offer a properly run governing body any benefits because it literally represents the human ego in a trade able commodity that is only ever viable in a land of fear and uncertainty with donald trump. (i dont see him being reelected but he did his job throwing a monkey wrench into the gears of a broken system).  


Lets talk about what the future will look like if crypto currency is actually used as a currency instead of a commodity that is only purchased for the sole reason that it will be sold for more than it was purchased for:

Think about hundreds of millions of people using the cryptocurrency  trading the 10,000 bitcoins between one another in fractions in the  distant future(not literally the exact amount but as an example). Then imagine a legacy owner of the currency dumping  their 100,000 bitcoins into the market on a whim because they want to  crash its value. Theres no governance that can step in to stop this from  happening. Bitcoin isnt backed by any physical asset such as gold and its value cannot be inforced by a governing body. The one action of one individual can negatively affect the  majority of other people with no safeguards. That should be more  terrifying to people than a fiat currency being printed by a central  banking system and then distributing funds in a less disruptive manner  that allows for programs such as universal basic income to be viable  that will be an inevitability in the future or community run organisations that benefit the spirit of community. Sure, Bitcoin is stable on paper, but its value is all speculation and subject to mass psychology.   


This bitcoin narrative all over twitter and youtube actually require you to believe them to keep bitcoin viable. without  your belief in it, its worthless. of course you can say the same thing  about fiat currency, but there are benefits fiat provide that bitcoin  cannot. With Bitcoin you have tax avoidance? reduced funding for community run organisations? failure of funding for public services that many use? Bitcoin does nothing for community as a whole. It really is the ego of the human race represented as a trade-able commodity.    


The fact that the way bitcoin was designed doesnt factor in the fact that the population of the human race will only keep growing; makes it an inferior means of trade on a large scale and merely a commodity to add to the list next to gold. By inferior i mean it isnt widely accepted. most stores wont accept gold nor will they accept bitcoin.  


If there is any takeaway from this it is or added notes:  
\-Bitcoin represents the ego of the human race as a trade able currency

\-Bitcoin does nothing to propagate community values by its very nature which is why it will not succeed in the future.

\-As difficult as it is to mine bitcoin, most people that use money in general dont really care what you did to earn it. People value stability in a currency. not rampant volatility.

\-Youtube videos on bitcoin value is all speculation no matter how much you want to justify its value. People dismissing the billionaires that publicly state their gut beliefs against crypto by creating conspiracy theories are actually the real insecure people of the crypto community. 

\-Bitcoin is a COMMODITY dont be fooled into thinking that is a currency. It will never be a fully accepted global currency unless it can be controlled by a(competent) centralised governing body. And because it does not possess that capacity, it will never succeed in the distant long term.",1593704550,21,1

They could in theory add a bitcoin wallet within their wallet, and when paying with your phones NFC at a card reader they instantly turn your bitcoin into the local currency and put it onto a single use disposable virtual card that is used to pay in-store. Pretty simple considering they already work closely with Visa and integrate with point of sale terminal standards around the world.

They would need their own exchange or need to run on top of an exchange, but with the number of crypto debit card companies around now they may want to compete.

The problem is that i am 16 and i am therefore confined to trading on small exchanges, like localcryptos, localcoinswap and hodlhodl. I cannot trade on sites like paxful or localbitcoins because of KYC. 

When i visit these sites there are hundreds of sellers with 0 successful trades. And those who have trades usually only have a few 10 or 100 compared to the 1000 or 10000 that vendors on localbitcoins and paxful have. It feels like theres barely any customers to be found there.

So, any sellers here who have experience with smaller sites? Could i make atleast a few hundred bucks a month there? I dont need to sustain my life on it. I just want to save up like 10.000 dollars untill i am 18 so my adult life will start off a bit smoother.

I wrote this up and to the best of my knowledge covers everything a NOOB should know about bitcoin.  That being said I probably made some mistakes and welcome any feedback from the community I could get on cleaning up the verbiage.  Thanks in advance!

Bitcoin For NOOBS
Peer to peer digital currency that is scares.  It is digitally secure through cryptography and decentralized through open protocol mining principals.

Peer to peer:
USD:  paper dollars can be exchanged peer to peer but any other form of USD exchange requires your banks permission to use your own money.  In fact if you try to pull out too much paper USD your bank may question you.

BTC:  Can be exchanged with no middle man.  No bank or government permissions needed for any amount and can be exchanged across the global at any time.

Scarsity
USD:  Print more money just write an IOU to the banks no big deal.  Inflationary.

BTC:  The number of BTCs that will ever exists is a fixed number it will never change.  Deflationary.

Cryptography:
USD:  With USD the “keys” to your wallet lie with your identity.  If I can gain access to your identity I can gain access to your funds.
BTC:  Your identity does not travel with the coin ledger.  Stealing your identity does not mean your funds can be accessed.

Decentralization
USD: The federal reserve banks are owned by unknown individuals.  Make no mistake the illuminate exists.  When the fed prints money the write those unknown individuals and IOU.  Out of thin air wealth is created to individuals not the government.  You don’t know who they are and never will.
BTC:  Anyone can mine bitcoin.  You dedicate your hardware to mining aka processing transactions.  It costs you money to run that hardware.  Your reward for your hardware costs is bitcoin.  The mathematical principals behind bitcoin do a check for how many mining machines decided if a transaction is real or not.  51% wins.  The more bitcoin is used and the more people that dedicate hardware to mining the more digitally secure it becomes.

Bitcoins case for calling it gold 2.0:
Currently bitcoin is not acting like the USD but instead acting more like gold a store of value.  Long ago before the dollar gold was the standard.  The government attempted to issue greenbacks however no one wanted them since gold was the tradition and was scares in supply.  The government decided to back the dollar with federal gold reserves.  Federal reserves no longer exist as they once have in fact if you invest in gold via the stock market there is a slim chance it is backed by any type of gold reserve it’s really just all digital money for the most part now a days.  While bitcoin is truly limited in supply and scares not only is it a great store of value but it has even more use than gold.  It can be exchanged electronically peer to peer across the globe and used via smart contracts etc.  A quick google search say that the total value of gold in the world is at roughly 7.5trillon dollars.  Gold does has more use than just a store of value via jewlery electronics etc but let’s compare the numbers side by side.

Gold 7.5 trillion
BTC market cap 170.5 billion

If you agree BTC is a better store of value or at least a decent store of value since it’s truly limited in supply with more usability then it’s easy to see how much upside potential is left on the table.  As the fed continues to put out more money during these economic hard times they are causing inflation while BTC has just undergone a halving aka it’s harder for miners to produce a bitcoin reward meaning deflation.  Bitcoin is the perfect place for you to store that big fat government stimulus check if you don’t need the money for awhile.",1594159020,1,1

hmwdxk,CoinjoyAssistant,Mass adoption: blockchain as a norm of modern life,"*It took a whole decade for the economy and business to understand blockchain technology, its strengths, and weaknesses. Several years ago, the first mature options for its practical application began to appear on the market.*

[According to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jj9biX1uwg) Joseph Lubin, the founder and CEO of the blockchain company ConsenSys, the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus infection pandemic could be a watershed for blockchain technology.

Joseph Lubin and Mike Novogratz, the CEO of Galaxy Digital cryptocurrency bank, discussed the development prospects of the industry and the impact of the pandemic on the cryptocurrency business. Both entrepreneurs believe that the socio-economic crisis is driving industry growth.

## Blockchain for Voting

Participation in online voting makes it possible not to visit polling stations, thereby not only to save time but also to minimize contacts during the pandemic. 

Blockchain e-voting system undoubtedly fights against intruders and excludes the possibility of voting several times, since it stores unchangeable records of all votes and all identification data.

The blockchain e-voting results [are transparent](https://digitalchamber.org/the-future-of-voting-is-blockchain/), cannot be changed, and can be accessed instantly. Blockchain for voting is not only more reliable, but also faster, eliminates the human factor, and allows you to instantly receive election results.

## Blockchain in Logistics

Blockchain technology in logistics will greatly simplify business. Now, to send one typical sea cargo, it is required to have 240 copies of 36 original documents. [Komgo](https://komgo.io/), the consortium of traders, banks, and inspection firms, uses the DLT platform in order to get rid of this paper swamp, optimizing the process of cargo registration on the principle of “Know Your Customer”.

Parties can immediately receive confirmation that they have exact copies of the same data at their disposal, which speeds up the process and avoids legal disputes and conflicts. 

## Tuna Blockchain

The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in Australia, Fiji and New Zealand has [launched](https://www.wwf.org.nz/what_we_do/marine/blockchain_tuna_project/) a pilot project in the Pacific Islands that will use blockchain technology to track tuna paths from “bait to plate”.

The project aims to stop illegal and unregulated fishing, as well as to stop human rights violations in the industry, including corruption schemes, illegal trade, and the use of slave labor in the fishery.

## Blockchain Stamps

Lamborghini decided to digitize its collection postage stamps and [issued](https://www.lamborghini.com/ru-en/%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/lamborghini-huracan-evo-rwd-spyder-stamp-size) the first blockchain-based stamp. This technology should guarantee the uniqueness and authenticity of each stamp.

In 2019 Austrian Post Office [launched](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2019/06/12/austrian-post-launches-stamps-on-the-blockchain/) a line of [blockchain](https://cryptonomist.ch/en/categoria/blockchain-en/) authenticated stamps with 5 images of a unicorn. On those stamps, one could find credentials for the authentication on the Ethereum blockchain. In 2020, they kept on with last-year success and [announced](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2020/06/25/crypto-stamps-in-austria/) a new line with animal designs. As every crypto stamp has a private key, being also an Ethereum wallet, one can use them both a real stamp or as an alternative paper wallet with a nice visual style.

## Blockchain Telemedicine

Recently, many medical blockchain projects have been created. One of them is [My Clinic](https://myclinic.com/).

It’s a platform for instant communication with a personal doctor. It is based on a blockchain for exchanging client data, which allows patients to contact a new doctor without the need for a personal visit for an initial examination and transfer of medical documents. Consulting a doctor becomes easier when traveling, taking tests, and undergoing large-scale diagnostics.

## The Future of Technology

Blockchain is likely to transform entire industries and, possibly, the entire economy through integration with other technologies.

The distributed nature of blockchain provides a valuable opportunity to conduct transactions cheaper and faster. Instead of “transferring” copies of documents between lawyers and banks and waiting for each stage of registration to be processed, blockchain gives all parties a complete overview of the procedure for the simultaneous implementation of several stages of the process.

For example, a consortium of law firms has teamed up with blockchain service providers [Proxeus](https://www.proxeus.com/) and [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/ch-de) to reduce the time for setting up a commercial company from a few weeks to a few days. The first company to have made it [Drakkensberg](https://www.drakkensberg.ch/), was generally founded within two hours.

## Resume

Thus, we see that blockchain technology has a wide range of implementations in the near future. And, perhaps, the one who starts it first will be ahead of competitors.",1594134865,1,1

Can anyone please tell me if my procedure is correct and enough.  
I've always heard and read that I must disconnect from the internet when creating **Electrum** Wallets, to keep away from hacks, viruses, malware or having my bitcoins stolen.  


I have created **electrum** wallets and bitaddress paper wallets yesterday. Though I dont know much about its technicalities, I just followed simple procedures I've read online.  


1. downloaded **electrum** exe installer and bitaddress (from github)  
2. save them in my usb  
3. disconnected my laptop from the internet  
4. uninstall and reinstall Windows 10 (I have windows installation files too, in my usb)  
5. created **Electrum** wallet, write the seed in a paper. save the wallet file in my usb.  
6. created bitaddress paper wallet, write the Public Key and Private Key in a paper (not print). have checked the spellings, capitalizations multiple times.  
7. uninstall and reinstall windows 10 again, scanned my usb, then connect again to the internet.  


Thanks for any advice / clarifications,

By that time I need bitcoin to be at least over 9000$ (my migration to Germany depends on it!)

I'm not selling my bitcoin right now because I think it will go  higher, like 10000$

The full story: I'm Iranian. I want to study in Germany. They ask for 10236 Euros in cash. I have about 0.6 BTC and I count on it as 5000 Euros. The rest is in Euros and gold because my currency, Rial, is 💩",1593881456,18,3

when : i do not know  ! if i know i would rich as hell .

Why : Bitcoin is the only real digital asset  , the only new asset for last 12000 years , the other true assets are 1-land &amp; water 2-food 3-gold (metals)  , it is not own by anyone  . it was the first digital asset to come to us, it has 100 million satoshi so it  can divided easily  , all of this is already known to everyone  but what is unique is that bitcoin is the only currency that can be  a globe  world currency that people believe in  from  and it can safe you from crazy bankers who destroy the economy .

Doesn't need banks to transfer it use it or pay to anyone  . 

Rich people see that  but they are worry that people own bitcoin cannot lose their money value in it as it grow so how can bankers take you down , as many notice every 10 years we have collapse  , that is not a cycle it  deliberate made either by idiots who are too rich to worry and gain from it  or they are doing that to get your asset as much as cheap as they  can .  

How : rich and medium and poor  all are worry about the world , the bankers are so bad and they are so strong in governments that scow up the economy just to get more assets from you so the only way protect your asset is bitcoin , as global economy become more connected now the only asset that can be globally is BTC .     

PS: if you don't believe in BTC , i hope you like the paper money who can loss it value by 10 to 40% in a year from now .",1593879378,17,1

hl3ddd,Blockchainauditor,HODLing from 2017? Why talk smack about BCH and BSV?,"There are many good philosophical and practical reasons to support Bitcoin as a superior idea, “investment” or movement to Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. But if you are a HODLer “since 2017”, for every BTC for which you hold the keys, those same keys mean you may also control an equivalent amount of BCH and BSV (and a number of lesser cryptoassets).

August 1, 2017 was the Bitcoin Cash fork. While your wallet may not know it, the keys it manages unlock the amounts in the addresses in both chains. 

November 15, 2018: Any addresses under your control of legacy Bitcoin Cash controlled addresses in both resulting chains, BCH and BSV.

Yes, $220 and $150 are mere fractions of $9,100, but it’s YOUR $220 and $150. It’s 4% of what you own. Why spite your own holdings?

Takeaway: Depending on what you think an hour of your time is worth and how much 4% of your Bitcoin hodlings are, if you want to talk smack about BCH and BSV, take the time to get out of the amounts you control from pre-August 2017 holdings and only then have at it.",1593869553,2,1

1. Added Metamask wallet to chrome, remitted an amount of ETH to its address, but the balance is still zero.

2. After careful inquiry, there are two transactions at this address, one is the received ETH, and the other is an automatically generated transaction.

3. Later, multiple ETH tests were sent to the wallet address, all of which are  the same, and a transaction is automatically generated.

Is there anyone who encounter this phenomenon, what is the reason?

Now here's where I can no longer follow: If I sign a transaction with my private key, then why can someone verify it with my public key? And how does that work?

Do I throw the input in a hash function, just replacing the private key with the public key, and see if the signature is the same? If yes: why can that even be?

DCA seems to be the best bet long term and timing dips is near impossible. However do you think we’re set up for another bull run?

While I believe in Bitcoin as the future of currency, I’m mainly interested in it for short term gains between 5-10 years, the strong potential for a $9-10k investment to grow to $250k or beyond is a good risk in my opinion, however I’m unsure what the best path to get there is.",1593979996,16,9

hlmrf6,hectorhan,How Bitcoin futures exchange works?,"To start trading Bitcoin futures, one must sign up with a Bitcoin futures exchange. The exchange provides a marketplace where you can buy and sell the Bitcoin futures. These exchanges are required to be registered with the relevant regulatory authority.

Some years ago, the futures exchanges utilized physical trading floors like the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). However, with the evolution of technology, such locations are not as important as they used to be in those days. Today, Bitcoin futures trading takes place over the computer 24 hours throughout the week.

Traders including individuals only have to own a personal computer, look for a reliable derivatives exchange offering Bitcoin futures and open a trading account with them.

Function of a futures exchange

A futures exchange standardizes and makes it possible for as many traders as possible to access futures trading. Mostly, the managers of the exchange are after increasing the volume of the traded asset (Bitcoin).  Therefore, the more the participants the better.

Some exchanges also offer margin trading. Therefore they have liquidity providers who lend money to traders who use them to trade and in return the money with some interest.

The exchanges are also responsible for the clearing services. Therefore, parties in the contract do not have to worry about the other party failing to deliver on their part of the contract. Though there are a number of other firms involved in the clearing process, the exchange is the overseer and it also standardizes the charges.

Bitcoin futures contracts

In a nutshell, Bitcoin futures contracts allow traders to trade on the value of Bitcoin without owning the Bitcoin. Most Bitcoin futures contracts are cash-settled, meaning that the trader receives returns in terms of fiat currencies. However, there are some Bitcoin futures exchanges that have introduced physical settlements, where the traders receive real Bitcoins once their contracts close.

Contrary to the spot market where buyers and sellers dictate the market prices of cryptocurrencies through over-the-counter (OTC) contracts, in Bitcoin futures trading, the exchanges standardizes the contracts. The Bitcoin futures contracts have standardized sizes depending on the exchange. In some exchanges, a single Bitcoin futures contract could be worth $1 while in another exchange the contract could be worth $10.

There are also other things like the expiration dates and strike prices that are also standardized in futures trading.

Exchanges also ensure that the pricing information is clearly provided to ensure fairness and transparency to all participants.",1593956188,1,1
hlmqut,hectorhan,3 Interesting things you can buy with Bitcoin!,"Bitcoin has exploded in popularity as a digital currency. Though many Bitcoin traders see the asset as an investment to hold, it can also be used to purchase many things around the world. Here are three surprising products that can be purchased with Bitcoin.

## Gold

Although Bitcoin itself is often considered a form of digital gold, you can also use it to purchase actual gold. There are many websites and companies such as JM Bullion that will allow you to purchase a variety of precious metals. If you ever feel like Bitcoin’s value may drop, transferring some of your holdings into gold may be a sound hedging strategy.

## Food

Bitcoin isn’t only accepted for finance-related products and assets. Even simple everyday necessities can be purchased with the cryptocurrency. The fast-food giant Burger King started encouraging its Dutch customers to pay with Bitcoin by offering a buy one get one free deal for its whoppers.  Of course, there many other restaurants and businesses around the world that also accept Bitcoin.

## Cars

Tesla is perhaps the best example of an automobile that can be purchased entirely with Bitcoin. However, this is far from the only brand of car that is available in exchange for cryptocurrency. In fact, there are many services online that specialize in selling a large variety of cars exclusively for Bitcoin. These services offer everything from luxury cars, to RVs, to bikes.

Even if you began your crypto journey as a Bitcoin trader, it’s worth taking a look at the incredible amount of things that you can purchase with the cryptocurrency. Of course, using Bitcoin instead of traditional fiat options will give you a higher level of control, anonymity, and will support or promote the industry as a whole.

hoxhkr,1anon2ABji2ciXyeyVsj,"Why Bitcoin Doesn't Have To Go ""Mainstream"" To Reach The Moon (Warning: Long-ass article)","A lot of people talk about how Bitcoin will possibly reach mainstream adoption. While this is ideal, it likely won't happen in the way we visualize it.

Bitcoin's greatest strengths and key selling point is not very popular - that is, the idea of financial self-sovereignty, protection against inflation, security without third parties, and so on. Gold has had many of these properties for years, but gold bugs are somewhat rare in economic circles and certainly rare among mainstream.

It is too idealistic to believe that the mainstream will become ""educated"" and ""financially literate"" and therefore, adopt Bitcoin. That's not how the mainstream operates. They operate more like a fickle customer, following trends and only being concerned with short-term hits of dopamine that comes from things like a fast shopping experience, or a fast rise in an investment.

If Bitcoin remains how it has been for the last 10 years, it simply doesn't have enough flash to attract the mainstream. But perhaps, that is perfectly fine. Because Bitcoin can become ubiquitous without anyone in mainstream knowing what it is or how it works, much like TCP/IP or the Internet itself is simply ""there"" while the mainstream enjoys the results of the framework.

The way the Internet developed, was that a very, very, very small number of highly enthusiastic geeks decided to build something useful and interesting. They didn't spend a lot of time questioning, ""how will we make the Internet accessible to the mainstream?"" Rather, they knew that if the system was built on a solid foundation, good engineering principles, with scalability, security, and efficiency in mind, that it would naturally attract success if they did things right. Usability was not a concern, at least in the early phases.

It didn't matter that it required a ton of commands, scripts, complicated tools to make this ""Internet"" contraption work from their garage. Nobody knew what the hell it was, or how it worked, or why they would someday need it. They just knew the geeks were working on something.

Usability really came in once the businesses got involved, and started to streamline the ""Internet"". In fact, they adopted it so fast that the standards groups and geeks were not able to keep up with their desire to grow on top of the Internet. This created problems, where the technology wasn't ready for scale. For example, JavaScript was never meant to be a full-fledged application language for the client-side in browsers, but websites simply kept getting more and more complex. JavaScript standards have caught up to some degree, and browsers are more powerful, but it's still fundamentally something that could be far more efficient if it was designed from the ground up. Some concepts exist that could replace JavaScript such as Web Assembler but so far I haven't seen any really catch on or ready to overtake JavaScript.

The point is, Bitcoin will likely never be ""mainstream"" in the sense that everyone knows what it is or how it works. But, it will simply be the framework for financial transactions over the internet. The average user may never need to know that a system is using TCP/IP, or HTTPS, or BTC. It's simply a technology that makes good things happen for them, and that's enough.

The most mature, and secure Layer 1 is BTC. The most mature, and secure Layer 2 is BTC with Lightning Network. As we continue to build the standard, competing standards such as alt-coins, will continue to stick around. But eventually, it won't make sense for higher level platforms to adopt so many different root systems. In the beginning perhaps, it does make sense to support multiple platforms, but ultimately, communication standards should converge to make it easier for everyone. Otherwise, what is the point of a ""standard"" if there are so many of them? We only need one, and it makes things effective without any downside.

Is it possible for a sudden shift in underlying technology as the basis becomes something other than BTC? Yes, it is, but highly unlikely. At this point, it's not even worth considering because the distance between #1 and #2 is widening every day.

And it's important to understand, what ""distance"" are we talking about? Is it the ""market cap""? 

No.

Definitely NOT market cap.

What makes a technology like the internet the standard, is the adoption of platforms building on top of it. The fact that Lightning Network is primarily growing the fastest on Bitcoin is extremely significant. And, many platforms are building on Lightning Network itself, as a 3rd layer. Market cap, total value, is actually quite meaningless in this aspect. You could say ""PayPal"" and ""Venmo"" and ""Apple Pay"" all have far more value behind it because these businesses are huge. But these are not really comparable because they are not designed to be open platforms. Just like, ""AOL"" was huge back in the 90s, it was not the open Internet that we see today. 

Java was once an extremely proprietary language, but they soon realized that by keeping it closed, nobody would build on it. Ultimately, now people can write Java programs without an official license, which blossomed into a ton of Java applications and kept Java alive. If it remained closed, it would likely be a forgotten relic of the past. Many people would have kept building on Java if they had no other choice, but slowly, there were more better and more open choices available. 

Today, PayPal and the fiat currency are platforms that have a monopoly on transactions, but slowly, it's becoming clear to 2nd and 3rd layer applications that there is an advantage to using Bitcoin. And a new, open platform is better than the closed platforms.

It's important to separate the adoption of technology from the adoption of Bitcoin as use as ""direct cash replacement"" and as use as ""store-of-value"". Both are great, but what is really going to change the world, is the way Bitcoin is currently building a new type of financial ""Internet"".  An actual, usable, stable communication protocol for how to transmit value without closed platforms. 

In the beginning, we had many internet systems such as Gopher and Usenet and FTP and others, but for certain, it was HTTP and the World-Wide-Web that really became the ""must-have"" protocol for everyone. And HTTP is now probably used more for Email (Web-based), Group Chat (Discord/Slack), and File Transfers (cloud storage) than any of the individual protocols that existed. There is a convenience in dealing with one protocol. Bitcoin is likely to be that one protocol, because it's the easiest and more secure. Altcoins are interesting, but they are wild experiments at best. They may have some obscure use here or there, but we know that all else being equal, mass adoption will prefer to simplify. And simplifying all applications to be built on Bitcoin, rather than against Bitcoin, will likely be preferred by most serious platforms.

So don't worry if your friends arn't using Bitcoin to go shopping or that the mainstream just doesn't seem educated enough to understand it. They don't need to. Bitcoin will win because people will adopt the most efficient, reliable technology. People didn't understand how cars worked, but they were way faster than dealing with a horse pulling a buggy. People adopted it because the technology was good. Until people just use cars now as ""common sense"" transportation.

Closed systems like PayPal and Apple Pay will eventually die. Like AOL and Compuserve and all the thousands of other closed, proprietary, commercial systems that required permission or license or registration. At one point, AOL looked unstoppable. Everyone was on it. You would never have thought they would die. But they were unstoppable, until they wern't. And nobody blinked an eye. Someday, PayPal will be a relic of the past, as will Visa, MasterCard, and fiat currency. And it will feel so obvious that everyone switched to money that was technologically superior and open to everybody, that nobody will blink an eye.",1594416127,7,1

Pros of GBTC:

* Taxes are 100 times easier since the investment firm deals with that
* Lower buying fees. Yes, there is a premium, but that premium for all we know will remain there when its time to sell
* Purchase in Roth IRA. Between my wife and I, that is $12,000 in buying power per year. My risk tolerance doesn't support any more investment than that anyway
* All gains are tax free if in Roth IRA
* Probably secure

Pros of Physical bitcoin

* No premium, but you pay exchange fees/transaction fees
* Can put security into your own hands
* Can't be taken away, unless you do something dumb or get hacked
* No financial shenanigans possible. You know you don't just have ""paper"" bitcoin",1594399625,6,1

I'd kind of like to ask multiple questions

1.	How do people who own millions of bitcoin keep it safe? Their own hardware wallet or ledger or trezor whatever
2.	Concerning this post I linked to. I'm not sure if what they're saying is that if someone opened my ledger, did something with the hardware and closed it again, if they would be able to get the funds FROM my ledger. Would that be possible in any way? Or are they more talking about hem adding malware to the ledger which would get on my computer but couldn't actually reach my private key?
3.	Generally, if someone got their hands on ledger before I got it. I open it, everything looks normal on setup, no words already written down on my recovery sheet. Basically I, as the user, know what I'm doing and to me everything looks normal. Is there any way at all for someone to have done something to my ledger that would allow them to get my private keys? Even though everything looks perfectly fine.

I hope I can get some answers to those quesions that I will be able to verify on my new ledger nano x.

Get ready because unprecedented wealth destruction is coming.

July 9 (King World News) – Alasdair Macleod:  So far, the current economic situation, together with the response by major governments, compares with the run-in to the depression of the 1930s. Yet to come in the repetitious credit cycle is the collapse in financial asset values and a banking crisis.
When the scale of the banking crisis is known the scale of monetary inflation involved will become more obvious. But in the politics of it, Trump is being set up as the equivalent of Herbert Hoover, and presumably Joe Biden, if he is well advised, will soon campaign as a latter-day Roosevelt. In Britain, Boris Johnson has already called for a modern “new deal”, and in his “Hundred Days” his Chancellor is delivering it.
In the thirties, prices fell, only offset by the dollar’s devaluation in January 1934. This time, monetary inflation knows no limit. The wealth destruction through monetary inflation will be an added burden to contend with compared with the situation ninety years ago.
Introduction
Boris Johnson recently compared his reconstruction plan with Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal. Such is the myth of FDR and his new deal that even libertarian Boris now invokes them. Unless he is just being political, he shows he knows little about the economic situation that led to the depression.
It would not be unusual, even for a libertarian politician. FDR is immensely popular with the inflationists who overwhelmingly wrote the economic history of the depression era. In fact, FDR was not the first “something must be done” American president, a policy which started with his predecessor, Herbert Hoover. But the story told is that FDR took over from heartless Hoover who had failed to step in and rescue the economy from a free-market catastrophe, by standing back and letting events take their course instead. Nothing is further from the truth: Hoover was an interventionist to his fingertips. The last of the laissez-faire presidents was Calvin Coolidge, Hoover’s predecessor. 
A few years ago, the BBC broadcast a programme extolling the virtues of FDR and his new deal. Stephanie Flanders, at that time the BBC’s economics correspondent, reiterated the myth about Hoover being a non-interventionist and FDR having all the correct reflationary policies. In a piece to camera at the Hoover Dam, no less, she recounted how it was an example of FDR’s new deal stimulus. While it wasn’t completed until 1936, building started in 1931 as a project by the eponymous Hoover, pursuing the same interventionist policies as FDR before FDR’s landslide election. It was never FDR’s project, the clue being in the dam’s name. Research by Flanders and the BBC was either biased, deficient, blind or all three.
The myth that has even drawn in Boris is so powerful it has intelligent people swearing the earth is flat. The FDR fairy-story is fundamental to the modern state’s interventionist stance; the very reason for its existence and its welfare commitments to the electorate. Wishful thinking about FDR’s pioneering role is now the pervasive theology. But the way the world is viewed cannot change the facts, and to quote FDR and his new deal as the template for economic policy is to repeat the errors that led to the longest and deepest depression in American history.
If in a few words one was to sum up why the state fails in its interventionist quest, it would be its inability to understand change. Free markets change all the time. Businesses and whole industries evolve and disappear in a natural process of selection driven by the consumer. The state’s response to a crisis is always aimed at a return to normality; normality being an unchanged state from before the crisis. The state protects yesterday’s jobs and yesterday’s businesses. Worse, by preventing evolutionary change at the heart of a dynamic economy it deprives it of the resources required to evolve. And that’s why the depression lasted into the Second World War.
The back-story to the depression
Before Hoover, US presidents understood a hands-off policy would let the economy rapidly fix itself. The post-war 1920—1921 depression in America was allowed to run its course. It lasted just eighteen months and was the prelude to a period of technological revolution that gave enormous benefits in the quality of life for all Americans. Following President Harding’s death in 1923, Coolidge was elected the new president. While Coolidge enforced a strict laissez-faire policy, he was either unaware of or ignored the monetary policies of Benjamin Strong at the Fed, which, to be fair to Coolidge, was only a decade old. The Fed’s monetary policy was the cause of an inflationary boom which ended in a stockmarket bubble in 1929.
In 1927, Coolidge announced he would not be standing for a second term, and Herbert Hoover was elected President in 1928 nearly a year before the  stock market crisis occurred.
Fuelled by a free market approach and the stimulus of unbacked credit, when Hoover took office in March 1929 the economy was, in the epithet of historians, roaring. We can now begin our comparison with the present day. Boris Johnson became Prime Minister after a similar inflation-fuelled period; but the more important correlation is with Republican Donald Trump, whose interventionist policies imitate Hoover’s from his time as Secretary of Commerce in Harding’s administration onwards. Hoover deported immigrants and Trump builds a wall, both reasoning they take American jobs. And like Hoover, Trump uses tariffs to protect farmers and businesses from foreign competition deemed unfair.
The combination of a massive credit expansion in the 1920s and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act passed by congress in October 1929 — the month of the Wall Street Crash — serves as a template for the condition of America’s economy today. Apart from some differences in timing, the most significant difference is in the money. Before April 1933 the dollar was freely exchangeable by the public for gold at $20.67 to the ounce; today the dollar is unbacked. Prices were stable, today they rise.
By passing the Smoot-Hawley Act at the top of the credit cycle, Congress ensured a sharp downturn in the economic outlook, persuading bankers to call in their loans. The economy began to contract, and interventionist Hoover went to work. To quote from his memoires;
“…the primary question at once arose as to whether the President and the Federal government should undertake to investigate and remedy the evils… No President before had ever believed that there was a governmental responsibility in such cases. No matter what the urging on previous occasions, Presidents steadfastly had maintained that the Federal government was apart from such eruptions . . . therefore, we had to pioneer a new field.”
Hoover called a series of White House conferences with industry leaders and bankers to persuade them to invest and maintain wages in order to keep consumer spending going. Like the neo-Keynesians of today, Hoover believed consumer spending was vital for the economy, but failed to make the connection with production, which is always first in temporal order, and provides the product for consumption without which it cannot happen. Hoover’s view on maintaining wages is reflected today in minimum wage rates, which innocuous though they may seem render certain activities uneconomic.
As is the case today, the Fed was ready to inflate. According to Murray Rothbard, the Fed
“…was just as ready to try to cure the depression by inflating further. It stepped in immediately to expand credit and bolster shaky financial positions. In an act unprecedented in its history, the Federal Reserve moved in during the week of the crash—the final week of October—and in that brief period added almost $300 million to the reserves of the nation’s banks. During that week, the Federal Reserve doubled its holdings of government securities, adding over $150 million to reserves, and it discounted about $200 million more for member banks.”
Monetary policy was a doppelganger for the Fed’s policies today. In today’s money, $300 million is about $26bn, using gold as the conversion factor. Today’s stimulus is a thousand times greater in real terms — so far.
In 1932 Roosevelt won a landslide against Hoover, and as was the custom at the time he took office the following March. Only a week before, an assassination attempt on Roosevelt struck the wrong man who died shortly afterwards. Banks were failing. Farmers were in revolt. The numbers of unemployed were increasing alarmingly. Hoover’s reflationary policies had failed, and he was said to be the least popular man in America on inauguration day. Fast-forward eighty-eight years and we see President Trump following in Hoover’s footsteps in this election year; and we can be pretty sure Joe Biden — if he is not asleep at the wheel — will cast himself as the new FDR with his version of the new deal.
Roosevelt then delivered his inaugural address, which included the famous line, “So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” His speech was followed by the Hundred Days, the first time a president had set such a schedule.
In Britain, Rishi Sunak, the new Chancellor, is now pursuing his version of a Hundred Days announcing subsidies and new support as the occasion demands, financed by monetary inflation. Admittedly Sunak remains a free marketeer but has yet to prove his measures are temporary. Meanwhile, President Trump is destroying his administration’s finances in an attempt to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus in his election year.
They say that repeating a failed action in search of a different outcome is a sign of madness. Hoover and Roosevelt were pioneers of today’s failed economic policies and it is their post-war successors who are arguably certifiable. But the problem is deeper than that, with the public voting for the same failed policies, so even an economically literate politician has to deliver solutions in that context. It is what makes history repetitious. Instead of economics, psychological factors drive politics, including the public desire for the state to provide easy solutions to economic and personal difficulties. But the lesson from the Hoover era is that we stand on the precipice of an economic collapse as a result of a combination of excessive credit creation in the years before and the introduction of trade tariffs. And that was before the coronavirus was added to this lethal mix.
The psychology suggests that this time the politicians and the monetary authorities will pursue much the same course as before, even more aggressively. So far, the evidence supports this thesis, and it allows us to anticipate mistakes yet to be made.
The credit cycle and the banks
A notable feature of the Wall Street crash and the onset of the depression were bank failures. Not only had the 24,000 American commercial banks extended unbacked credit throughout the 1920s, but their reserves were to an extent, fictitious. This arose from double counting cheques in the process of clearing, remaining in the cash reserves of the bank upon which it was drawn while being immediately credited to the receiving bank’s cash reserves.
But when the public began to withdraw cash in increasing amounts this false liquidity was exposed. The initial banking panic began in November 1930 in Tennessee when a correspondent network in Nashville collapsed after the Bank of Tennessee closed its doors, forcing over 100 institutions to suspend operations. And as the contraction in bank credit continued, additional correspondent systems imploded. That was only the start of it. The Bank of the United States in New York in December was followed by a new banking crisis in Chicago the following June, this time involving real estate. In 1932 over 2,000 banks closed, and in 1933 a further 4,000.[iii]
The banking scene is very different today. Instead of many thousands of small one and two-branch banks the system is dominated by large international behemoths, global systemically important banks — the G-SIBs. They operate under the rules and regulations of the Basel Committee, currently Basel III, administered by national regulators.
Aping the crookery of double-counting floating cheques, today’s banks game the system, this time aided and abetted by the regulators, who, so long as the forms are correctly filed, are happy to look the other way. Indeed, as their stress tests have shown they would rather gloss over the issue of inadequate capitalisation.
The full weakness of the global banking system is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the leverage between total assets on the G-SIB balance sheets and their market capitalisation. The regulators persist in using the relationship between total assets and balance sheet equity instead, despite the market valuing a typical bank’s equity at considerably less than book value.
￼
Bank equity valuations on 8 July have benefited from the liquidity-driven rally in global stock markets, with Deutsche Bank’s shares, for example, almost doubling from a low of €4.50 in mid-March. The recovery is not a sign of new-found strength but merely reflects the severe disconnection between rising financial asset values and a collapsing economy, which will almost certainly lead to a substantial adjustment to the detriment of financial asset values.
The full weaknesses of the current system are described in a paper on the big UK banks, jointly authored by Dean Buckner and Kevin Dowd. Figure 1 was constructed using the methodology in that paper. It is a strongly recommended read for anyone seeking to understand the severe risks associated with not just the UK banking system, but the G-SIBs in all jurisdictions plus other significant banks not on the G-SIB list.
With a fundamentally weak global banking system, over-leveraged and virtually guaranteed to collapse as current financial and economic conditions deteriorate, a new banking failure could make the first wave of bank failures in 1930 Nashville look like a vicar’s tea-party. The failure of just one major bank anywhere in the world is likely to degenerate into a widespread panic, because global regulation has ensured they all game the system similarly and they all share the same weaknesses to greater or lesser degree.
In another potentially fatal error, following the Lehman crisis the G-20 agreed new rules designed to ensure that the costs of future bank failures are to be carried by bond holders and large depositors as well as shareholders, and not governments. Fortunately, this bail-in route is intended to be optional, but there is a risk that in a widespread banking crisis one or more of the G-20 members will go down the bail-in route, probably for banks not on the G-SIB list but smaller and no less significant banks. With some bailing-out and some bailing-in, simple nationalisation and preservation of all customer deposits becomes less likely, prompting a collapse not just in the banks bailed in, but a panic in all bank bonds and major deposits which would otherwise be protected in a clean bail-out.
Putting the bail-in uncertainty to one side, instead of a series of bank failures between 1930-33 today’s global banking interdependence suggests one major crisis is more likely, which arguably has already started given the liquidity injections that have taken place since last September, commencing in the repo market.
A difference from the thirties is that cash money today is a lower proportion of overall money supply, payments being overwhelmingly electronic. Depositors queueing up to withdraw their funds in old fashioned bank runs cannot be ruled out, but today failing banks find funds transferred from them far more swiftly by electronic means, particularly from larger account balances lacking depositor protection.
One reason that central banks have encouraged the abandonment of cash is to lessen banks’ vulnerability to old fashioned bank runs. Instead, by acting as back-stop liquidity provider, even when other banks reduce credit lines to a stricken bank, the intention is that no bank need fail. By the creation of bank reserves through QE and using the repo facility to provide overnight liquidity, commercial banks are already drawing on this support, without which there would almost certainly have been a banking crisis already.
On this basis, bank failures are already here, only they are hidden from public view. All that’s needed is for bank bond holders and large depositors to wake up fully to the risks to their capital for the banking crisis to become public. And that’s why the values of financial assets cannot be permitted to slide, because if they were to do so the whole financial system would rapidly collapse.
Money differences
In the 1930s the dollar was exchangeable for gold until one month after Roosevelt’s inauguration, when he signed an executive order banning the ownership of gold and gold certificates. It was a prelude to the devaluation of the dollar to $35 to the ounce the following January, the rate at which US citizens were forbidden to own gold. Apart from that devaluation, and despite its demonetarisation from gold the dollar retained its objective exchange value, while the depression led to falling prices for traded goods and commodities.
Falling prices were the natural consequence of the contraction of bank credit, the imposition of trade tariffs and failing price support operations. Instead of inflationary unbacked bank credit contracting, it was sound money in the form of a gold-backed dollar that took the blame. The inflationists were in control in both fact and of the narrative, but they couldn’t quite discard gold altogether — that didn’t happen until 1971.
Today there is no backing for government currencies, being entirely fiat. There is therefore no restriction in the deployment of an inflationary tax to balance the government’s books. Measured in gold, the dollar has already lost 98% of its purchasing power since the late sixties, and now its supply is being increased at an unprecedented rate.
The mistake being made by central banks is to not understand that money is merely the mechanism for converting an individual’s labour into consumption. It is the means by which we compare one good against another. It is not, as modern economists seem to think, a means for individuals to evaluate the cheapness or dearness of a good in isolation. If that was the case, then current and prospective prices would broadly have the effect they expect.
The failure of monetary policy, therefore, is in large measure due to the error of not understanding the true role of money in the economy. It wasn’t the increased purchasing power of the dollar in the 1930s which contracted the economy, but the withdrawal of bank credit combined with trade tariffs. Similarly, the falling purchasing power of the dollar today will not, on its own, stimulate consumption. This is not to merely dismiss the distortions in the market from changes in the quantity of money, which are damaging in many other respects. But above all, the debasement of the currency impoverishes the creative economy, the exact opposite of the effect intended.
It remains to be seen how far the destruction of fiat money will go, but as Figure 2 shows, M1 money has already jumped sharply — by 104% annualised between 24 February to 22 June.
￼
Conclusion
Unfortunately, governments in the developed nations are making the same mistakes dealing with the current economic crisis as they made ninety years ago. As was the case between 1930—1933 we can be almost certain of a banking crisis. This time it will be global and almost certainly will require banks to be taken into public ownership. The cost will be immense, and it will be paid for by inflationary means.
The scale of it will mean an unprecedented destruction of wealth — hardly the basis for economic recovery. At the same time statist preservation of existing production for fear of unemployment will hamper, not help economic recovery; and, so long as fiat currencies retain any exchange value, there can be no economic revival.
Indeed, the most important difference from the 1930s is the money, which could well collapse entirely. Guided by the pre-Keynesian economic theory of the Austrian school, of the economic consequences we can be certain. The political consequences in the long run can only be guessed",1594374173,11,1

hojmsx,undadatunda,with the recent rgb smart contracts news above lightning is there a 'possibility' to smart contract with yourself to cold storage in lightning form?,"i mean with the 'possibility' to cold storage for like 20 yrs or something 'safely'

https://rgb-org.github.io/

its says:

RGB uses blockchain as a state commitment layer and Bitcoin script as an ownership control system; while smart contract evolution is defined by off-chain schema and Turing-complete scripting system using Simplicity language

and

As a security mechanism RGB uses single-use seals defined over bitcoin transaction outputs, which provides ability for any party having smart contract state history to verify it’s uniquiness. In other words, RGB leverages Bitcoin script for its security model and definition of the ownership and access rights.

and

Each RGB smart contract is represented by some genesis state, created by smart contract issuer (or, put simply, issuer) and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of state transitions kept in form of client-validated data (i.e. this data is not stored on blockchain or within LN transactions/channel state). The state is assigned to unspent bitcoin transaction outputs, which defines them as single-use seals. The party that is able to spend corresponding transaction output is named a party owning state: it is a party that has the right to change the corresponding part of the smart contract state by creating a new state transition and committing to it in a transaction spending the output containing previous state. This procedure represents closing of a seal over state transition, and a pair of spending transaction and corresponding extra-transaction data on the state transition are named witness.",1594360865,9,1

I’d like to upgrade but from reading CC’s documents the light should be green, stay green, and ONLY turn red for several seconds during the actual upgrade process?

The question is how to do this. What if two users try to spend the same output at the same time with different destinations?? Will both transactions get into the mempool? What are the rules for entering a transaction into the mempool and where is the rule that rejects the second transaction?

And the second question - how do attackers do this? Do they use some kind of custom wallet?",1594713158,10,1

hqvx6j,Leech-64,Bitcoin compared the Gold market cap thoughts,"So bitcoin can pretty much do what gold does, except it uses energy to transport or keep track of it. Let’s assume we replaced Gold with bitcoin, since its ability to be used as a currency is pretty much as useful as Gold, if not more. Let’s also assume that the market cap of Gold is $10.5 trillion. If bitcoin replaced Gold and took its market cap, then bitcoin could be priced at $500,000 per Bitcoin in which there are 21,000,000 bitcoins mined. Even higher if there are less.
Now of course market cap is calculated usually in reverse where you take the unit price and multiply it by the amount of unit. 
But this is just a thought experiment for what the bitcoin price would be at a reasonable market cap in the future. In my eyes, i can see this being as valuable as the Gold market.",1594705677,8,1

hqr3no,InternationalDeer9,Thanking Bitcoin the best way I can,"So, this idea has been bouncing around in my head for a while.. Bitcoin has had a big impact on my life. So I’ve been thinking, how can I show my appreciation and share my love for Bitcoin.

I’ve driven over 80,000 miles across the UK and across multiple countries within Europe over the last 3 years. Why not add a sticker on my car?

I wanted to do something a little more though. Maybe some other people would like to add a sticker onto their car too. Wouldn’t it be cool to drive around and see other random people with a Bitcoin sticker on their car?

So some of the ideas that came into my mind:

1. Start a ‘sticker printing’ business. As a launch campaign, give the first xxx people the sticker for free. And then sell the rest at a reasonable price. 
Problem - I wouldn’t have the time, knowledge or the required dedication to get it off the ground. I also think some people would have privacy concerns with me collection their shipping info. So this would certainly not be an option for me.


2. Set up some kind of fund (I’d be happy to give a few hundred dollars to allow people around the world to do the same)
Problem - How would I ensure that users data is kept private while also ensuring that they are genuine users and actually ordering a sticker?

3. Contact a company that already sells stickers and offer them some kind of deal. Tell them that I’m willing to fund the first xxx orders for any stickers related to Bitcoin.
Problem - I would have to trust the company to honour the agreement and there would be a risk that some people would just order them all to random addresses since they’d essentially be free?

I guess some may think it’s stupid to ‘publicly advertise’ that you may hold Bitcoins. But you don’t need to have any BTC to put a sticker on your car.. I have a very small amount of BTC left and it’s in cold storage

Any thoughts?

hrtlof,slvbtc,How do you explain the fact bitcoin is different?,"The number one reason (from what I can gather) that older generations and gold bugs state is the main reason they don't believe in bitcoin is this:

If anyone can launch a crypto then why would bitcoin be any different from the others. If they all have value then really none of them have value because new coins can be infinitely created.

To them they see no difference between bitcoin and doge coin and titcoin, which is fair enough.

My question to you all is can you explain in one paragraph why bitcoin has value even though cryptocurrencies can and have been created ad infinitum. Why is bitcoin different from the rest?",1594839425,21,2

This will dry up liquidity as no new fiat will enter the space. Congress could also tax crypto long term capital gains at 90% and also implement a “holding tax” per year. This would kill Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies. 

No liquidity- no market. Once bank services are eliminated Bitcoin price collapses 90%. This causes miners to become unprofitable and shutdown which creates a death spiral. 

The government will seize any hard sound money and drive it out of the market because it does not serve their agenda. The government must control where capital flows or it has no power. 

I fully 100% believe the US government will successfully kill crypto.

Oh and I don’t think it’ll come to this but if need be the US government can just make it a crime to hold BTC and because it isn’t private at all and most exchanges are KYC your identity is already tied to your associated wallets. 1-2 year jail time should do the trick.",1594832195,10,0

hrnzng,banksychris,Instant payments? Help please,"So I’ve been reading online about possible ways to make instant transactions without double spending. Can someone explain any flaws/problems with this suggestion below:

Essentially, an “insurance transaction” is a transaction set up by a third party service to be sent to the network on behalf of the payee should the payer attempt to double-spend, and thereby removing the payer’s incentive to double-spend. 

Should double-spend attempts be prevented, the trust problem is eliminated because the payee (merchants, seller) is guaranteed by a preventative mechanism that their incoming unconfirmed transactions will not be vulnerable to a double-spend attack. You could structure a “double-spend prevent” mechanism by letting buyers generate an “insurance transaction” when they want to make instant cryptocurrency payments on the main blockchain. 

Theoretically, attackers are still able to release a double-spend transaction to the network, but as disincentive to do so because of the insurance transaction generated during the payment process. In the case of an attacker attempting to redeem back their funds, the payee will receive their payment from the payer regardless. Hence the name “insurance transaction”. 

Generating an insurance transaction can include the minimum amount of transaction fee. Once an insurance transaction can include the minimum amount of fee, it is assumed to be a low-priority transaction so it would be mined over hours, even days, depending on the network traffic at the time. 

This is done so it does not matter when a transaction will be mined (i.e. get its first confirmation) because the payee will receive their payment regardless but at a later uncertain time after the payment. 

The key point here is payment transactions are accepted instantly (unconfirmed) but can be spent a later time (when confirmed) from the perspective of the payee. 

Can someone point out the technical problems and issues with this above statement please?",1594821341,2,0

I'm aware of all that so don't give me too much shit or call me a shill for coinbase, I'm not, I just found a bit of an exploit that I figured I'd share until they fix it.

You know how when you transfer fiat from your bank account to gdax you have to wait about three days before you can trade? And your alternative is to transfer it to coinbase instead for ""instant trading"" but you pay some laughably high fee? But if you try transferring to coinbase first and then to gdax it says that money is on hold? Well, I discovered that the coinbase pro app for android doesn't restrict your ability to deposit money from your coinbase account. In other words you can instantly trade on gdax without having to wait three days. All you have to do is deposit into coinbase, then open your coinbase pro app and shift it over.

Replace bitcoin with gold.

If one or two governments banned gold nothing happens. 

If all governments banned gold simultaneously gold wouldn't go away, it would still exist just like bitcoin. If this happened all gold exchanges would close, gold would move to a black market, and because of the legality element it would demand a premium and end up with a higher market value than it had before it was banned. The exact same thing happens when you ban drugs, a black market evolves and the price goes up.

So banning bitcoin would not do anything but put coinbase out of business, create a massive black market for its exchange and give it a higher price than it has today.

If gold was illegal I would want to use it even more. The same is true with bitcoin, banning bitcoin enhances its desirability..",1594948031,73,1

hsjqqg,NateNate60,"Random idea: USL, but for Bitcoin addresses","This is my rough idea for a Bitcoin change that would allow for a bit more fraud protection. I might write up a BIP later if I get around to actually nailing it down.

For those unaware, the [Universal Scammer List](https://universalscammerlist.com) (USL) is a page dedicated to keeping track of the usernames of scammers on Reddit. Basically, if you want to conduct a transaction with someone on Reddit, you should first check if they're listed as a known scammer.

My idea is to do the same with Bitcoin addresses. A decentralised database of blacklisted addresses would be kept by anyone running a full node. Any funds in the blacklisted addresses are deemed worthless.

For example, address A gets listed for hacking into an exchange and stealing coins. **Any funds held by address A would be deemed worthless**. If they send 10 BTC to address B, then the network would remember that address B has 10 BTC that is worthless. If address B originally had 5 BTC and was sent 10 BTC by address A, they would have 15 BTC, but the bottom 10 BTC would be deemed worthless. If address B sends 2 BTC to address C, then C receives 2 good BTC and B is left with 3 good BTC and 10 blacklisted BTC, but if B sends another 4 BTC to address D, then D would receive 3 good BTC and 1 worthless BTC, and the network would now remember that D has 1 worthless Bitcoin. Therefore, before accepting the transaction as payment for something, they would have to check to make sure that they are not receiving worthless blacklisted coins.

Miners could also choose to selectively refuse to mine transactions involving blacklisted BTC because any miners' fees collected from such a transaction would be blacklisted as well. This could mean someone trying to send blacklisted BTC is essentially broadcasting a transaction with a 0 sat/byte fee rate, meaning their transaction would probably be stuck in the Mempool for quite a long time, if not forever if miners refuse to mine it.

Whenever someone wants an address blacklisted, they would announce it to the public via any mechanism, and anyone keeping a full node can decide whether or not to blacklist the address. Therefore, anyone who disagrees with the blacklisting is free to accept the coins at face value or mine them into a block. If you don't agree with the evidence presented, then you are free to not blacklist them. Therefore, contested coins would only be accepted as valid payment by those who think the coins should have never been blacklisted in the first place.

This system would not be meant to help every single person who gets scammed with Bitcoin, but it would discourage large scale wholesale Bitcoin fraud. It would be ridiculous to expect all full-node maintainers to become arbitrators of all disputes, and consensus would never be reached on half of the transactions being processed. Node operators would also ideally not have to remember as many transactions involving blacklisted coins because miners would refuse to mine them (transaction fees collected would be in blacklisted coins), meaning they'd be stuck in the Mempool for long periods of time, reducing the speed at which they can be moved around, if at all. So the ledger of blacklisted coins would not have to be updated extremely often. Blacklisting would only happen for really big scams involving tens or hundreds of Bitcoin, like if an exchange got hacked or something.

Scams have effectively less than an hour to be discovered. 10 minutes for the deposit into the address in question, and more, depending on how many block confirmations something must have before others will accept it for transactions sell goods for it. Therefore, if a merchant requires 3 block confirmations, then they would give 40 minutes for the address to be blacklisted. If the buyer's address is blacklisted before the transaction to the merchant gets 3 block confirmations, the merchant would realise they've been sent blacklisted coins and not ship the goods. 40 minutes isn't a lot of time, but it's better than nothing.

This has the additional effect of encouraging people to wait for more confirmations. For low-value transactions, the risk is nominal because even if you were sent worthless coins, you're probably only out the price of a coffee. But if you're selling a house, you might want to wait for even more block confirmations.

Money sent around too much could be deemed ""too late to blacklist"" if there is a risk that it would result in too many innocent people's Bitcoin getting blacklisted.

This system doesn't refund the Bitcoin of victims, so poor security practices would still be punished by a loss of coins, but criminals would not be rewarded for their efforts either. The lack of reward (or the risk of a lack of reward) would hopefully make people less inclined to try and pull off the type of big scams that are giving Bitcoin a bad reputation!",1594938091,22,1

hsc800,tycooperaow,"Bitcoin challenged my comprehension of money. and from that, governance too","Social Media hacking jokes aside for today, I thought to share a thought experiment I had on how bitcoin fundamentally challenged the way I view money forever. 

 I was always told throughout life and even in school that money distributed by the government, managed by the government, but used amount the populus. It wasn't until I was 17 in my senior year where I learned about the in-depth concepts of money with topics such as Federal Reserve Banking (How banks make money), taxes, debt,  and fiscal and monetary economy. What's funnier is that when I was 14 I heard about bitcoin, but I thought it was just an idea for some far off technology like Nuclear Fusion or Astro mining. So I'm happy to state I learned more about bitcoin before I learned about my own government monetary system. Unfortunately, It would not be for another 2 years before I learn about cryptocurrency and blockchain entirely and another few months before I can actually buy some. 

It was at the moment when I fully understood the concepts of bitcoin where I fell in love with it, the idea that NO government, company, or bank could just step in and take your money. No overdrafts, chargebacks, or no 3-5 days deposits. It is great. I get excited to the point I share all I can to people around me about the concept and yet they are confused like a child learning a new language because the concept of true financial responsibility and digital sovereignty can be complex to comprehend. Many of them refer to the same statements: ""Money should be protected and held by the bank so I trust that it will forever be there"". As I think of it more I start to think of ways how blockchain technology as a whole can be implemented into fintech (or even become the new fintech). Henry Ford once said that 

&gt;"" It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning."" 

It is merely with the introduction of bitcoin and decentralized finance tools when this quote incubates into fruition. Cryptocurrency as a whole puts the individual in power with the same banking tools as the whole banking collective operates on. I agree that there are many people who are fed up with the banks, and their practices but at the same time those people are even more scared to assume their own financial control due to immense responsibilities the bitcoin introduces (private key, cognitive understanding of the industry and tech). Yes, banks are here to provide a service to the public ease and use, but therein lies the question of how much freedom do people really want when they realize that they are also baring even more responsibilities than they are used to. Great power comes with great responsibility. The more financial freedom (I'm not talking about in dollar amounts, but security and accessibility ) you have over your wealth the more responsibility is needed to maintain it. So then more so this brings furthermore changed my perception that I don't have to be so reliant on centralized parties with my money, but I can own my money on the blockchain and send it anywhere where in the world as I deem fit. 

So this brings to my thoughts of how would blockchain systems work in government and laws. The laws are barely adapted to handle the internet as is; now they are further behind to handle blockchain. With coronavirus going around this is a testament to show how we are becoming stronger digital society. I have not been out of my home in the past few days, and most of the older ways of doing things are becoming challenged with the introduction of new technologies. The only thing that defines our governments are the lands in which was founded, discovered, or concurred by winning factions and ideals that ultimately curated most of the cultures we see today. We can speak to anyone we can on the internet in a matter of seconds, make a full-time living, we can buy nearly anything and get it delivered on the same day or week, and be associated with communities that align with our interest all online. So when these apps have more data and international relations than the governments we reside, can governments be more than just ""land""?

Finally, this brings into question Facebook and Libra. Facebook is one of the largest public multi-national countries on this planet, and libra in eyes of many just a software update. However, Libra shined a light on so many things I've always wondered. With as powerful as Facebook is that probably knows more about you than your government, and has more international relationships with more countries than your government, if/whenever libra is released, this now puts a corporate entity in charge of your money. And As they say, libra existing on blockchains, really can't be stopped if ever it's released. Sure governments can be banned and sue Facebook all they want, but if there are people using it, the damage is done, they can't shut down Facebook without causing an economic collapse probably one worse than the great depression. Facebook is just too big to fail. Google, Amazon are other companies seeking to challenge governance by cities for their corporate entities and employees. They most likely won't be here in the USA too much regulation, but someone where like Africa or even [cities on water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EotHcLHsAXs) . 

All in all, as I leave, Everything I knew about finances such as mortgages, paychecks, loans, mediums of exchange, trade, and banking tools are all fundamentally challenged by the introduction of bitcoin. The power lies in those who own the system, and when no one owns the system, but everyone manages it, the real power becomes invested back into the people. With this knowledge, I know that I am truly more powerful than I thought I was, and you should feel empowered as well. Sure the infrastructure may take time before things become convenient enough for wide-scale adoption, but we are the founding fathers and mothers of the first generation in the true power of decentralized tech. We are the ones that decide on how the first implementation of this tech should be used, and that's all by experimentation. I agree that it will be a daunting task and scary for those who are not familiar with this. Like all things that exist it starts with experimentation.",1594915300,11,1

Bitcoin was just a entity used in (16-7-20) twitter breach. It's impossible to attack the bitcoin network, so the hackers decided to storm a more feasible one.

It merely proves the fact that security and privacy can always be compromised under goliaths. More prominent names like Gates, Musk, Cook and Bezos couldn't survive, do we even stand a chance?

The hack could've been of a more significant impact if it wasn't for the Cypherpunks who were trying to make a statement or prove a point that ""centralization is s\*\*t"".

If twitter were decentralized, those tweets would have been digitally signed by the user which we could have then verified anytime using blockchain. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

hud7ew,slvbtc,The decoupling is coming,"The reason shitcoins have been rallying while bitcoin trends sideways is because right now it is a risk-on environment, as evidenced by stocks hitting all time highs.

If bitcoin was a risk asset it would also be rallying.

This might mean bitcoin is showing its first signs of shifting into the risk-off asset segment.

This is what bitcoin should be doing. In preparation for further economic turmoil through the rest of 2020 and into 2021 bitcoin is morphing into a safe haven risk-off asset.

As stock markets roll over later this year expect altcoins to fall alongside them while bitcoin rallies.

The decoupling is at hand.

Edit: some people see volatility and disregard the idea bitcoin could be a safe haven. Look at the charts, gold is rising in preparation for a huge bull market, silver is volatile but following gold, bitcoin is even more volatile but following silver. Just because silver tanked in march does not mean it won't follow gold to new all time highs, and similarly just because bitcoin tanked in march does not mean it won't follow silver to new all time highs.

Gold will lead, silver will follow gold with more volatility, and bitcoin will follow silver with even more volatility.

Gold will 5x, silver will 10x and bitcoin will 50x over the next 3 years.",1595211992,81,60

hucjdy,slvbtc,"Maybe bitcoin isnt just digital gold, maybe its an entire digital gold vault.","Think of a massive brinks vault, full of gold, all in segregated piles. In fact every ounce of gold ever mined is in this one vault.

Tens of millions of people have an account at this vault and by using an app they can transfer their gold from their pile to someone elses pile. Inside the vault there is a robot arm constantly moving the gold to the correct pile each time a transaction is requested.

The vault runs itself autonomously, there are no humans, the robot just actions our transactions when we request it to. Its trustless, no humans are involved, no one can break in (not even politicians), and no one can stop the robot from actioning our transactions, it is uncensorable.

This is not possible in the real world. In the real world theft is possible, insurance is fallable, trust is required from the vault operators, 3rd parties acting as custodian can censor you, politicians want to control it, governments can seize it, there is no politically neutral place on earth to store the gold.

So what do we do? We digitise the vault and all the gold inside it, and move it to the one politically neutral jurisdiction on earth, the internet.

Bitcoin is a big theft proof segregated gold vault inside the internet, and every single person on earth has the ability to open an account without anyone elses permission.",1595209236,91,19

After reading on here, I decided to buy from the exchange and then transfer onto my Ledgers, all working very well on the app and desktop.

You can cancel the transaction anytime within the 2 days. This gives you time to react in case of unauthorized access and it also makes $5-wrench attacks more difficult.

The Coinbase Vault is great. But unfortunately Coinbase the company is untrustworthy.

I currently have some funds in a Coinbase Vault that I would like to move some where else. But I can’t find an alternative. (I don’t want a self-custody solution. Let’s argue about why another time.)

I've just finished a new installation of raspiblitz and I'm looking for recommendations on next steps. My vision for this was to have BTCPayServer on digital ocean, connected to my existing BTC and LND node on my pi. After some reading I'm not sure thats possible. 

I was looking into LNbits so that I can have multiple ""wallets"" on one LND node for different merchants, and I really like the look of Thunderhub as well, so I'd like to include those.

So...

1. Is it possible to have BTCPayServer connected to a node on a different host? 
2. If not, should I just install BTCPayServer directly on my pi?
3. Is it possible to use a trezor with raspiblitz?

Very discouraging and tiring to find no website that works since now every website needs kyc this year :(

Some Info:
I used to use paxful but now they require KYC just to use their damn wallet. Which means I have $30 worth of bitcoin lost there. 

I live with my parents so I can’t prove I live at any address with documents nor do I want to. 

I have a debit card and could buy with that or buy a gift card online and buy bitcoin using that. But I cannot get a Visa or mastercard gift card online. So a legit website using amazon or best buy gift cards or something would work. No kyc obviously.

I live in the US so sites that work here 

I’m trying to buy around $100 USD of bitcoin

I don’t want to have to wait a day just get the bitcoin so a quick website would be great

I use blockchain as a wallet but they kyc if I wanted to buy

I don’t want to meet in person to do anything or can’t do the Bank transfer to cash deposit to someone 

I have tried this websites and they don’t work for me:
Coinmama
Changelly (lies about kyc)
Bitsell X (Tried using but redirected me to changelly) Also No reviews

Ipayyou (looks suspicious; don’t want to get scammed)
Paxful 
Bitrefill (sold out of crypto vouchers; could figure it out)
Cryptovouchers (they kyc don’t want to lose money)
Fold app (don’t think you can buy bitcoin using a giftcard only the other way around)
Cash App (kyc)
BaseFex (couldn’t figure out the derivative markets; don’t think I can just buy using a debit card either)
Agora Desk; I might use but it looks suspicious still and would have to use cashapp to buy someone
Wall of coins (Have to go in person somewhere)
Switchere (Scared of kyc)
HodlHodl (Not avaible in us)
Bisq (Hard to use; Couldn’t figure out plus high fees don’t want to get scammed)
Local cryptos (Dont support payment methods i want)
Bitvalve (Inactive sellers wouldn’t respond)
TotalCoin app (Barely any seller probably inactive)
Coin corner (Not in Us plus lies about no kyc)
Kyc not me (none that fit my requirements)
Kucoin (only one seller that is selling $1000 or more)
Bitquick (Have to go to bank to deposit cash)
Buy crypto today (Low amount of sellers)


This is very depressing because it once was very easy and enjoyable to buy bitcoin now their is all this kyc and have to wonder if i’m getting scammed.

Might have to use bitsell x or Agora desk but would rather not.

If you can help or give a good website I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks",1595340749,25,0

Which central bank, financial institution (pension funds, etc) would trust Bitcoin when the founder (Satoshi) holds more 5% of the coins ever created. The control he/she (Satoshi) would have over the price of Bitcoin would be a great concern.

The implications of someone like Satoshi being a bad actor (not saying he/she is) could be devastating to global economies which would be at Satoshi's mercy.

If BTC were to go up in value to let's say 100k USD as some are predicting, it would mean that 1 person is holding upwards of 110 BILLION USD!

I bought in some years ago (Nov '17 - December '17), but have always been a very casual (but steady hodler)  
I have not used my bitcoin since I bought them (I lost quite a bit, mostly on believing IOTA), however they are just sitting on Coinbase.  
After all this time, the 'Not your keys = Not your Bitcoins' sentiment is finally getting to me, so I decided to move them in case it's not very difficult for me.

So my question: How will I move it to a digital wallet the easiest, cheapest and most painfree way? (I don't want to buy a hardware wallet, as I am clumsy and lose things easily with my current nomadic lifestyle)  


Or is it worth just keeping it on Coinbase if you are worth less than 1 BTC?

Thanks a lot in advance - any help will be incredibly appreciated,

[Hacker Group Robbed Crypto Exchanges by $200 Million](https://preview.redd.it/1ys8hpjc46c51.png?width=525&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0d84070ba8e5f15045167f43cfdf646eeccc287)

According to a report published by top cyber security firm ClearSky, a hacking group known as CryptoCore has stolen more than 200 million from several crypto exchanges since 2018.

The hacking group is reportedly operating somewhere out of Eastern Europe, Romania, Russia, or Ukraine. The notorious group is also known as “Dangerous password” or “Leery Turtle”.

It has used Spear- phishing emails and Social engineering techniques to gain access to the accounts and email-ids of employees and executives of the crypto exchanges of China, the US, and Japan.

As per the report, though the group has managed to steal more than $200 million so far, technically they are not so advanced on a massive scale. Their noticeable strategies are ‘swift’, ‘persistent’, and ‘efficient’.

**Modus Operand of the CryptoCore**

The group uses a spear-phishing technique to access cryptocurrency wallets belonging to the exchanges. They send emails to the employees of the company posing as the top executive or close associates of the firms.

Once the mail is opened, that id of the employee gets hacked, the group installs malware and access the password of the account, the group then steals all the private keys of the crypto wallets. They wait till the removal of the multi-factor authenticator. Once it is removed, the hackers act swiftly to steal the money from the wallets.

3. Why exactly 10 mins between blocks? Not 5, not 2?

Android has had, for a number of years, the ability to add additional users.

Settings --&gt; Users &amp; accounts --&gt; Users --&gt; Add user or profile

Does having another user expose any wallet data (e.g., seed phrase) that would lessen the security of the wallet app (for the primary user)?  And, can the second (or any subsequent) user use a wallet app without exposing wallet data to the primary user (which has ""admin"")?

The question came up in a discussion about smartphone adoption among the poor (e.g., developing world).  In these areas, each family member might have their own feature phone, but for smartphone apps, the family might share a single smartphone.   So the question that came up in that discussion is if Android multiple user configuration would be a safe way to enable multiple people to each have a wallet on a mobile device and their wallet be secure from the other user(s).

Of course, this wouldn't be for the life's savings / cold storage, but for a spending wallet.",1595490771,15,6

hwbi82,attolini,Alternative perspective to Mike Maloney’s Currency vs Money…vs Cryptomoney,"Mike Maloney’s Hidden Secrets of Money Episode 1 outlined that money had all the characteristics of currency plus “store of value”. Because gold today is considered money despite only being used for physical applications or exchanging between financial instruments, maybe “medium of exchange” does not need to be a necessary characteristic of money to be considered money. This assumption would then give currency a unique property with medium of exchange while money’s unique property would be store of value.

When using this assumption to compare currencies and money, fiat would then be exclusively currency and gold would be exclusively money (but not currency). 

The world could go back on the gold standard and make gold a medium of exchange again; however, as Mike said it himself, the gold standard sucks. 

Bitcoin on the other hand, is currently an emerging medium of exchange and emerging store of value (ref Travis Kling). Once the fees and scaling issues have been resolved (plus user friendly UX), bitcoin can then be considered a currency. Once bitcoin reaches the end of hyperbitcoinization (e.g. price of the same quantity and quality of coffee stabilizes at 6.15sats for a decent amount of time), bitcoin can then be considered money. 

When bitcoin reaches the stage of being both currency and money, maybe it might need its own category… cryptomoney?",1595489818,1,0

So lets say i order a trezor wallet and put coin on there to spend, I create my wallet and load some bitcoin on there, then walk into a store that takes bitcoin and want to use it or someone has something they wanted to give me bitcoin for. How would I be able to use that particular wallet without having it be exposed? In the past i would just restore a wallet seed phrase on blockchain for simple transactions. (I know i know never leave anything on blockchain, security risk, not your keys, blah blah blah, this is why im getting a hardwallet) Now i know this, im just trying to figure out how to use the wallet in real life once i get it. 

Am i suppose to bring my wallet with me and connect my wallet to their computer or terminal? Is there an app that connects to that wallet that i can have on my phone without my coins being at risk? 

Basically im trying to figure out what would be the easiest way to have access to my wallet to easily do transactions when im out and about without exposing my keys to being compromised?

I came to the realization that de-fi firms probably work with miners to issue said ""interest"" by mining more crypto hence putting more crypto into circulation (More supply smells like inflation if the amount of coins aren't fixed or haven't been issued yet). Also, by storing your crypto in an interest bearing account they're using your crypto to lend hence increasing it's liquidity. If investors are just hodling their coins, there probably is a low trading volume which is bad for any commodity or asset. I believe de-fi lending is a great use case but smoke and mirrors aside what is this really? If banks are switching to ""0"" to ""negative"" interest rates how can these de-fi firms afford to give 4-8% interest?

When clicking on the ""Validate/Decrypt"" button, it generates a ""Pblic undefined address"" of: 1Nnt1dJFifPUmfSKKWQXFM46trHfrsUUrC, which is different than what was generated by [bitaddress.org](https://bitaddress.org).
3. When I click the ""Validate/Decrypt"" button again, it generates a different public address. In fact, if I keep pressing the button, it keeps generating new different address for the same private key.
4. Sometimes clicking on the ""display compressed format"" will generate a public address that matches [bitaddress.org](https://bitaddress.org). but mostly, it does not, and continued pressing of the ""Decrypt/Validate"" button continues to generate different results.

Does anyone have any idea of what is going on? I thought i understood this stuff, and this troubles me.

That said, my approach to BTC is different now.  Selling BTC now, just to get my investment out, would be foolish.  There are too many factors contributing to the probability that BTC will increase further in price - although it is very possible that I am totally wrong about that, as I have been before.

hy4x5y,Yoo_Tu,Is bitcoin real bitcoin today?,"What you call bitcoin is not bitcoin. It is a managed surrogate that Freemasons have replaced real Bitcoin. The substitution took place in December 2017. Immediately after the lower projections of the energy standard of the Higher Planes Erzanil were withdrawn. It was these projections that were the real bitcoins.

&amp;#x200B;

**Can Bitcoin be managed?**

The collage below shows the principle of managing absolutely all processes at the social level, i.e. third dimension or manifest physical world.

https://preview.redd.it/81iwyptgk6d51.jpg?width=1041&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30fe6f1324daa703375a6a67ffb7bebd76d7a2d4

1 — the first level, the level of control or the real world, where all the processes take place. On the example of a container ship it is shown how they manage various stock quotes. For example, bitcoin. At this level, you can move and rearrange containers, as well as change their number. This is the level of “gods”, i.e. those who manage all processes.

2 — The second level is our level with you, i.e. level of “shadows” or projections of level one. Here we can only buy and sell.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why 21 million bitcoins?**

The total number of Erzanils existing at the higher levels corresponds to the total number of their lower projections, i.e. 21,000,000. If we arrange the number 21,000,000 vertically and in descending order, then we will receive the archetype of the new energy structure of a person.

The six lower chakras are absent, the sahastrara remain working and two new chakras appear, because after a person sheds six lower bodies and the subsequent ascension, two additional subtle bodies are needed in order to remain at new levels of being.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is Satoshi the smallest piece of Bitcoin?**

The smallest bitcoin particle is double anu or argo! Remember the catch phrase that personifies a synonym for all great Beginnings - ""like the Argonauts in the old days"" !? You will try to guess from the first time about its origins located at the subconscious level.

At low-frequency levels, the argo projection represents two different-spin anu combined into a single whole. It is this explosive-implosive particle that combines two opposites in itself, and not some mythical atoms, quanta, neutrinos and similar nonsense, that is the basis of everything! 

1 argo is one part of bitcoin to the minus twenty-first degree, from its maximum energy content.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, neither Satoshi nor anyone else has anything to do with bitcoin.",1595760322,12,1

hy2qii,Leader92,Need financial advice.,"Hello,

When I first learned about crypto, I spent a good couple of months doing research and came to the realization the blockchain will eventually take over. My back-then-now-stupid investment strategy was as follows:

Invest in Bitcoin and XRP. The first being truly decentralized and the second leverages blockchain but in harmony with banks. The idea being if Bitcoin took off and people won, I'm in that boat. but if somehow governments and banks used a blockchain-product and took over, XRP is their bitch and will likely rise as well. \[I know how stupid it sounds now.\]

I got into XRP at 0.7, so you can imagine the loss I got hit with, but my entry with bitcoin was so great that it almost covered all losses. in fiat terms, I'm in my original fiat amount.  What do you guys believe the best thing to do now? I no longer want any bit of XRP and would like to pour what I have left into BTC, but I lost too much, should I just convert all XRP back to fiat and wait for a bitcoin entry point? Or buy BTC with it now? or should I just leave XRP and hope for a quick pump to get rid of it?",1595748390,3,1

Hey r/Bitcoin, I'm really excited to share what we've been working on. Our goal at [Foundation Devices](https://foundationdevices.com) is to build the open hardware layer for Bitcoin and the sovereign Internet – we believe open source software like Bitcoin must run on open source hardware. 

Our first product, Passport, is an attempt to make open source beautiful and intuitive. It's a Bitcoin hardware wallet that makes it easy to store your coins yourself, rather than relying on exchanges like Coinbase. Passport allows you to experience true sovereignty and ownership. 

Passport is designed to be elegant; something every Bitcoiner would be proud to carry. We use high quality materials like soft-touch plastic and copper-plated zinc alloy. At 4 inches long x 1.5 inches wide x 0.8 inches thin, Passport is comfortable to hold and use. 

Passport’s interface is intuitive and familiar, with a simple navigation pad and physical alphanumeric keypad. There’s no need to learn how to navigate the menus and enter PIN numbers and passphrases – you already know how to use Passport. 

To sign Bitcoin transactions, simply insert a microSD card or scan a QR code. Passport is already compatible with most popular Bitcoin wallets, including BlueWallet on iOS. 

Passport is open source; the circuit board designs and firmware will be published on Github, with hardware licensed under CERN’s Open Hardware License and firmware under GPL3. No unknown code will run on the device. 

Completely airgapped, Passport is powered by two AAA batteries and includes no USB port, Bluetooth, or wireless communications of any kind. Passport has numerous security features, such as security lights and an avalanche noise source for entropy. And Passport uses more trustable components, like a screen with circuitry etched directly into glass, which allows for easy inspection at production. 

Foundation Devices is headquartered in Boston, and we will proudly assemble Passport and our future products in the USA!

Passport will launch for preorders in August and will ship by late December. We have already received over 800 email reservations for our first edition batch of 1000 units! Reserve yours today at [https://foundationdevices.com](https://foundationdevices.com).

Internal Error"". I then noticed the transaction wasn't even on the blockchain. It can't find the transaction when I try to search the transaction ID. And the bitcoin is deducted from my balance since then. Where is my bitcoin? I checked the destination address and there is no incoming bitcoin from that transaction there either.

i00dmk,clararockmore,From exchange to Trezor - best practices?,"I am fairly new to bitcoin and have not yet bought any, but every day I get itchier about it as I watch the price creep up. A few weeks ago, I started learning heavily about BTC, Austrian economics, money theory, and crypto--and I'm super fascinated by it all. I'm totally sold on investing a portion of my savings into BTC.

I don't plan to invest any large sums right now (hahaha I don't have large sums TO invest) and I've never invested in ANYTHING before, but I've been slowly working on my financial health and I am at the place where I'd like to start investing a few hundred dollars here and there to get familiar with the practice.

I don't see BTC as a ""get rich quick"" opportunity, but rather an extremely fascinating alternative option to fiat currency that I really want to play with. However, I may invest larger sums down the road, depending on BTC's performance + my future financial abilities, so I would really, really like to start off with the best security practices to get into the habit. To this end, I plan to purchase a Trezor hardware wallet. I don't want to leave my BTC sitting on exchanges for very long AT ALL.

My question is, how difficult/expensive is it to withdraw funds from an exchange to a wallet? Is it worth it for lower sums? Which exchanges are the soundest to use for this method of storage?

I am also fairly sure I understand public/private keys in THEORY, but since I do not yet have experience with them in practice, I have a couple other questions...

When I get my hardware wallet, do I immediately use a seed phrase to encrypt my private key and ""set up"" my wallet? I understand I can independently generate a private key from a seed phrase without a wallet, but I'm trying to find a balance for myself somewhere between maximum security and my understanding of the technology (which is limited but growing each day).

BIP 0032 is an encryption METHOD, correct? Sort of like an enigma machine that runs my seed phrase through and generates an encrypted key, which can then be used for recovery on anything that uses BIP 0032? Please correct me if I'm wrong--I am just trying to grasp it.

Do I have ONE private key associated with my wallet, or multiple private keys that correspond to different transactions?

I just saw that Ledger was hacked and email addresses were compromised. I had been wondering if I should use an email specifically for BTC transactions separate from my personal email, and this makes me think ""YEAH PROBABLY."" How much of a security issue is having an email account associated with my BTC wallet?

I probably have a million other questions, but this is enough for now. I want to look before I leap, but don't want to spend so much time looking that I never leap. Let me know if I'm terribly off-base about something important. Thanks.",1596028002,3,1

It takes a few days for the transaction to fully process and for withdrawal to be allowed, but the price is locked in. Unfortunately the fees are high.

Is there any way to do this on Coinbase Pro? I would rather not leave large amounts of USD in my Coinbase Pro account simply in case I went to buy Bitcoin and avoid the fees of regular Coinbase.

If not, I would argue the Coinbase fees are more so for the benefit of locking in the purchase price and not waiting for ACH transfer to complete rather than for the simplicity of Coinbase vs Coinbase Pro. Just a thought.",1596020837,3,1

How exactly would that get reported to the IRS as income?,"Kind of new to cryptocurrency. I only made a wallet because I was doing some contract work for a digital service company that just pays out in bitcoin. So I made a wallet and received $3,780. In creating the wallet I didn't enter a single amount of personal information. Was going to cash it out, but realized I planned upgrading my PC (I do animation, not Pixar level, but similar) and found a site (Overstock) that has the the super computer of my dreams and coincidentally they take bitcoin as payment. Well I know I have to send my personal shipping address etc. in order to buy the laptop and have it sent to my house. But as far me reporting that as taxable income there really isnt any paper trail. No personal info in creating the wallet, no personal info in paying the payment from the wallet. Just personal info via the site for shipping reasons. Like who would the crypto company even send the 1099 to? There is no personal information for them to have it. The site can't legally give over my personal information (I googled it) unless obviously illegal stuff on a large scales was going on like scams/fraud....  so I mean I know I should report it as income as its law, but do throw out moral ethics do you think its necessary? Should I worry or just buy the damn laptop and treat the wallet kind of like a big gift card.... as I won't be using it again after I use it for the PC....

**The German Hyperinflation, 1923**

Excerpt from *Paper Money* by ""Adam Smith,"" (George J.W. Goodman), pp. 57-62.

*In the mid-1960s, money manager George J.W. Goodman began to write a series of irreverent and witty columns for* *New York* *magazine under the borrowed name of capitalism's founding theorist, Adam Smith. As ""Adam Smith,"" Goodman went on to write several bestsellers about economics, the stock market, and global capitalism, among them* *The Money Game, Supermoney,* *and* *Paper Money,* *from which this account of the Weimar Republic's disastrous hyperinflation is excerpted.*

**Essay**

Before World War I Germany was a prosperous country, with a gold-backed currency, expanding industry, and world leadership in optics, chemicals, and machinery. The German Mark, the British shilling, the French franc, and the Italian lira all had about equal value, and all were exchanged four or five to the dollar. That was in 1914. In 1923, at the most fevered moment of the German hyperinflation, the exchange rate between the dollar and the Mark was one trillion Marks to one dollar, and a wheelbarrow full of money would not even buy a newspaper. Most Germans were taken by surprise by the financial tornado.  


""My father was a lawyer,"" says Walter Levy, an internationally known German-born oil consultant in New York, ""and he had taken out an insurance policy in 1903, and every month he had made the payments faithfully. It was a 20-year policy, and when it came due, he cashed it in and bought a single loaf of bread."" The Berlin publisher Leopold Ullstein wrote that an American visitor tipped their cook one dollar. The family convened, and it was decided that a trust fund should be set up in a Berlin bank with the cook as beneficiary, the bank to administer and invest the dollar.  


In retrospect, you can trace the steps to hyperinflation, but some of the reasons remain cloudy. Germany abandoned the gold backing of its currency in 1914. The war was expected to be short, so it was financed by government borrowing, not by savings and taxation. In Germany prices doubled between 1914 and 1919.  


After four disastrous years Germany had lost the war. Under the Treaty of Versailles it was forced to make a reparations payment in gold-backed Marks, and it was due to lose part of the production of the Ruhr and of the province of Upper Silesia. The Weimar Republic was politically fragile.  


But the bourgeois habits were very strong. Ordinary citizens worked at their jobs, sent their children to school and worried about their grades, maneuvered for promotions and rejoiced when they got them, and generally expected things to get better. But the prices that had doubled from 1914 to 1919 doubled again during just five months in 1922. Milk went from 7 Marks per liter to 16; beer from 5.6 to 18. There were complaints about the high cost of living. Professors and civil servants complained of getting squeezed. Factory workers pressed for wage increases. An underground economy developed, aided by a desire to beat the tax collector.  


On June 24, 1922, right-wing fanatics assassinated Walter Rathenau, the moderate, able foreign minister. Rathenau was a charismatic figure, and the idea that a popular, wealthy, and glamorous government minister could be shot in a law-abiding society shattered the faith of the Germans, who wanted to believe that things were going to be all right. Rathenau's state funeral was a national trauma. The nervous citizens of the Ruhr were already getting their money out of the currency and into real goods -- diamonds, works of art, safe real estate. Now ordinary Germans began to get out of Marks and into real goods.  


Pianos, wrote the British historian Adam Fergusson, were bought even by unmusical families. Sellers held back because the Mark was worth less every day. As prices went up, the amounts of currency demanded were greater, and the German Central Bank responded to the demands. Yet the ruling authorities did not see anything wrong. A leading financial newspaper said that the amounts of money in circulation were not excessively high. Dr. Rudolf Havenstein, the president of the Reichsbank (equivalent to the Federal Reserve) told an economics professor that he needed a new suit but wasn't going to buy one until prices came down.  


Why did the German government not act to halt the inflation? It was a shaky, fragile government, especially after the assassination. The vengeful French sent their army into the Ruhr to enforce their demands for reparations, and the Germans were powerless to resist. More than inflation, the Germans feared unemployment. In 1919 Communists had tried to take over, and severe unemployment might give the Communists another chance. The great German industrial combines -- Krupp, Thyssen, Farben, Stinnes -- condoned the inflation and survived it well. A cheaper Mark, they reasoned, would make German goods cheap and easy to export, and they needed the export earnings to buy raw materials abroad. Inflation kept everyone working.  


So the printing presses ran, and once they began to run, they were hard to stop. The price increases began to be dizzying. Menus in cafes could not be revised quickly enough. A student at Freiburg University ordered a cup of coffee at a cafe. The price on the menu was 5,000 Marks. He had two cups. When the bill came, it was for 14,000 Marks. ""If you want to save money,"" he was told, ""and you want two cups of coffee, you should order them both at the same time.""  


The presses of the Reichsbank could not keep up though they ran through the night. Individual cities and states began to issue their own money. Dr. Havenstein, the president of the Reichsbank, did not get his new suit. A factory worker described payday, which was every day at 11:00 a.m.: ""At 11:00 in the morning a siren sounded, and everybody gathered in the factory forecourt, where a five-ton lorry was drawn up loaded brimful with paper money. The chief cashier and his assistants climbed up on top. They read out names and just threw out bundles of notes. As soon as you had caught one you made a dash for the nearest shop and bought just anything that was going."" Teachers, paid at 10:00 a.m., brought their money to the playground, where relatives took the bundles and hurried off with them. Banks closed at 11:00 a.m.; the harried clerks went on strike.  


The flight from currency that had begun with the buying of diamonds, gold, country houses, and antiques now extended to minor and almost useless items -- bric-a-brac, soap, hairpins. The law-abiding country crumbled into petty thievery. Copper pipes and brass armatures weren't safe. Gasoline was siphoned from cars. People bought things they didn't need and used them to barter -- a pair of shoes for a shirt, some crockery for coffee. Berlin had a ""witches' Sabbath"" atmosphere. Prostitutes of both sexes roamed the streets. Cocaine was the fashionable drug. In the cabarets the newly rich and their foreign friends could dance and spend money. Other reports noted that not all the young people had a bad time. Their parents had taught them to work and save, and that was clearly wrong, so they could spend money, enjoy themselves, and flout the old.  


The publisher Leopold Ullstein wrote: ""People just didn't understand what was happening. All the economic theory they had been taught didn't provide for the phenomenon. There was a feeling of utter dependence on anonymous powers -- almost as a primitive people believed in magic -- that somebody must be in the know, and that this small group of 'somebodies' must be a conspiracy.""  


When the 1,000-billion Mark note came out, few bothered to collect the change when they spent it. By November 1923, with one dollar equal to one trillion Marks, the breakdown was complete. The currency had lost meaning.  


What happened immediately afterward is as fascinating as the Great Inflation itself. The tornado of the Mark inflation was succeeded by the ""miracle of the Rentenmark."" A new president took over the Reichsbank, Horace Greeley Hjalmar Schacht, who came by his first two names because of his father's admiration for an editor of the *New York Tribune.* The Rentenmark was not Schacht's idea, but he executed it, and as the Reichsbank president, he got the credit for it. For decades afterward he was able to maintain a reputation for financial wizardry. He became the architect of the financial prosperity brought by the Nazi party.  


Obviously, though the currency was worthless, Germany was still a rich country -- with mines, farms, factories, forests. The backing for the Rentenmark was mortgages on the land and bonds on the factories, but that backing was a fiction; the factories and land couldn't be turned into cash or used abroad. Nine zeros were struck from the currency; that is, one Rentenmark was equal to one billion old Marks. The Germans wanted desperately to believe in the Rentenmark, and so they did. ""I remember,"" said one Frau Barten of East Prussia, ""the feeling of having just one Rentenmark to spend. I bought a small tin bread bin. Just to buy something that had a price tag for one Mark was so exciting.""  


All money is a matter of belief. Credit derives from Latin, *credere,* ""to believe."" Belief was there, the factories functioned, the farmers delivered their produce. The Central Bank kept the belief alive when it would not let even the government borrow further.  


But although the country functioned again, the savings were never restored, nor were the values of hard work and decency that had accompanied the savings. There was a different temper in the country, a temper that Hitler would later exploit with diabolical talent. Thomas Mann wrote: ""The market woman who without batting an eyelash demanded 100 million for an egg lost the capacity for surprise. And nothing that has happened since has been insane or cruel enough to surprise her.""  


With the currency went many of the lifetime plans of average citizens. It was the custom for the bride to bring some money to a marriage; many marriages were called off. Widows dependent on insurance found themselves destitute. People who had worked a lifetime found that their pensions would not buy one cup of coffee.  


Pearl Buck, the American writer who became famous for her novels of China, was in Germany in 1923. She wrote later: ""The cities were still there, the houses not yet bombed and in ruins, but the victims were millions of people. They had lost their fortunes, their savings; they were dazed and inflation-shocked and did not understand how it had happened to them and who the foe was who had defeated them. Yet they had lost their self-assurance, their feeling that they themselves could be the masters of their own lives if only they worked hard enough; and lost, too, were the old values of morals, of ethics, of decency.""  


The fledgling Nazi party, whose attempted coup had failed in 1923, won 32 seats legally in the next election. The right-wing Nationalist party won 106 seats, having promised 100 percent compensation to the victims of inflation and vengeance on the conspirators who had brought it.

5. In a year, sell enough of the 0.45 btc you bought to pay off the loan

Borrowing for bitcoin is nothing new, but the stimulus check presents a great opportunity to leverage government money for a year for free.  Unless you desperately need the $1,200, the opportunity cost of using the money for something else should be huge.  This could easily pay off your crippling debt or get you a down payment on a house.

Also, I'm thinking it could be possible to refinance the loan with a crypto lender like blockfi, so I can pay off the loan in bitcoin and avoid triggering a capital gain tax from converting it back to dollars.  Is that legal?  Or would I still have to pay capital gains even though I didn't convert it back to USD and never technically sold it?",1596114105,26,1

Hardware wallets at the same time are not open source. If you can't verify, you can't trust. Why do people buy these devices when they are not open?  What guarantees the fact that, the seed won't be somehow sent to their servers.

hn9yjf,dnlees,"Crazy con, maybe more way than one... Can I get the money back.","So my bf who is normally very intelligent asked me one night if I had any Bitcoin left and when I said yes he got excited n thought omg how'd i not know I would've said something sooner. Hopefully we can still get it- ok quick quick, send it to (........). I ask why, he just says hurry before we miss it, Elon musk is giving away bitcoin hurry hurry there's only a little left, I asked if he had determined if this was real, he pushed on to hurry or wed please miss out. So... I scanned and sent off the last of my bitcoin. I started off with about .$8000 worth, its value plunged to about $3000-4000 from the 16k I bought it at, went to send about $500 worth, went through three times. NBD we will buy more of whatever. But then that money got lost somehow. Transferring accts for no good reason. ""He'll pay me back though"". And then this .. Elon musk... Giving away bitcoin if you send him some. He even read me names of people, how much they sent, how much was rcvd.  I felt rushed. I was dumb. I sent it. I doubted it was real. I asked him. Multiple times. He seemed so sure. Rushed me to do it quick. 

After sending my money to ""Elon Musk"" I look up Elon musk giving away btc to see what it said about it. Trying to find where my bf found his info. This is a super common scam apparently..... I'm 29 (f) he's 24 (m) and we just got scammed out of the remaining half of the quarter of the btc that I bought. Two seconds it took me to find article after article. It was kind of common sense to me it was fake but I am known for my lack of common sense so I kinda just brushed it off n did what he said bc he's smart right? He says he knows things. But 2 seconds and I knew it was a scam. He said he'd watched a vid for like 45 mins about it but couldn't tell me where to go to go d it once I'd done the transfer and asked him. 

Is my boyfriend REALLY that dumb? Bc like.... He's not, right, but if he's not does that mean he's fucking me over somehow?

Also main thing- any way to get money back after sent?

He has offered to give me my money back that he lost for me but it feels.... Weird. I'm angry he lost it. But it's kinda my fault for not realizing from the start. Should I make him pay for what could have been an innocent mistake? And he doesn't give me money for bills 90% of the time so I'm not sure how I'm supposed to get this btc back even if I did decide to have him replace it. 

He owes me a large s of money, says he can pay me, but never actually does. I'm non confrontational..but I'm at my wit's end. Help me ppl. 

I'll be cross posting this bc this obv is not just bc related lol

hn8s7h,Cramson_Sconefield,Why Our Money Is Broken," I’m writing this because I wish to explain in layman terms why the global economy is broken. Most people intuitively feel that the economy is a mess and bad things are happening. Words like corruption, crony capitalism, money printing and bailouts are being tossed about as explanations why the economy is in trouble. While all these things are problems our economy is facing and deserve attention, they are all consequences of a fundamental problem that needs to be understood first and foremost. That is, money itself is broken.  

To understand how fiat money we use is broken, one should view money as a commodity just as you would any other good. Any economist would agree that setting a price for a good or service is a bad idea, but for whatever reason, mainstream economists (Keynesians) believe that money is exempt from the disastrous effects of price fixing. As a quick refresher why price fixing is never a desirable policy let’s take a look at the classic example of rent control. Let’s say the average cost of an apartment in your city/town is $1000. Your politicians say that this is outrageous and make a sweeping policy saying that no apartment can be priced above $100. Suddenly the supply for housing cannot come close to matching the demand at this price. Landlords no longer care about the upkeep of the apartment because even if the apartment turns into a shithole, someone will still take it for $100. People no longer have incentives to build new housing or renovate existing housing because they can no longer charge a market rate. The end result is a city in ruins. Try your logic at why price fixing doesn’t work with any good. The market is distorted. Supply and demand are unable to reach equilibrium and everybody loses. 

The price of money is the interest rate. When the Federal Reserve engages in interest rate targeting, this is price setting. The Fed will say that the cost of money is too high! We need to get more money into the hands of more people to stimulate the economy, so let’s set the price of money to zero. Take a minute to think about what this means. In a free market the interest rate is established by the supply of money (savings) and the demand for money (borrowing). The interest rate can never be zero. It can only approach zero if the supply (savings) is reaching infinity and/or the demand (borrowers) for money is reaching zero. When the Fed fixes the price of money, it is sending a false market signal across the whole economy about how much money is saved to properly be used for investment. This is where irrational economic behavior occurs on a macroeconomic scale. Strictly speaking, individuals are operating rationally. If the price of money is zero, it is only rational to borrow money and not save your money. The problem is not the individual but rather the Central Bank has distorted the reality of the most important commodity of them all, money itself. 

What are the consequences of setting the price of money so low? Think about how this affects borrowers. The economy is operating under the assumption that there are more savings available for investment then there actually are. This leads to malinvestments. Imagine your buddy says he has a million dollars saved and would be happy to lend you this money free of interest. Maybe you’d build a fancy new house or put down a lot of capital to start a business. Then halfway through building your house, your buddy says, sorry, I only had $100,000, not a million. You began building something you should never have started building had you previously known how much money was actually available. You have to scrap your project and you end up with a worthless half built project.  

How does this affect savers? Imagine if I had a million dollars in my savings account. With the interest rate so low, I’m being given very strong signals to not keep that money in the bank to be loaned out. If the price of money is zero, why in the world would I want to sell (loan) my money for no profit? You wouldn’t. Your money is losing value everyday it sits in the bank account because the Fed is pumping out more money and giving it to banks to keep the interest rate at zero. You need to buy something with that money. You end up buying a house, stocks or whatever commodity you think will increase in price because you don’t want to see the value of your cash inflated away. 

As investments are undertaken that should never have been started and commodities are purchased that should never have been purchased, asset prices rise and we see bubbles forming all over the economic landscape. By messing with price of money the whole economy has become infected. And unfortunately at this stage, there is no cure. We are in too deep. The financial system will implode and the dollar will collapse. Please protect yourself and buy bitcoin.",1594175796,11,1

Here's an example: When building web applications, BIG companies prefer to use programming languages like .NET or Java because they are owned by other BIG companies (.NET Microsoft, Java Oracle).  They do this because for them they have a level of accountability.  They have confidence in the company to maintain the programming language and if something goes wrong they can also point the blame to someone. 

So shouldn't the same be said for crypto?   There's no level of accountability for Bitcoin, no one knows where Satoshi is, its fork able (which banks probably won't like), people used btc for drug transactions which kind of make it impossible for banks to own.  Banks are the only ones that have the power to take bitcoin to higher levels, but I don't see them going near it.  Why am I wrong?",1593577133,13,1

hj21sk,Guilty_Pea,Ergo-Emurgo partnership yields new model for oracles,"*The joint research on oracle pools will be implemented in the Ergo stablecoin project.*

Oracles are one of the critical elements of DeFi, providing a link between the siloed and self-contained world of the blockchain, and real-world data. It is imperative that dApps have access to reliable price data, among other information, in order to execute effectively and securely.

New research from the Ergo-Emurgo partnership offers a new way to approach the problem of achieving consensus and posting data to the blockchain: Oracle Pools.

Despite the importance of oracles in providing data feeds to dApps, the research notes that ‘oracles schemes today lack transparency, accountability, and operational robustness’. This makes them a potential single point of failure, threatening the security of any software that relies on them. In the case of a stablecoin, it can mean the risk of losing its peg, and opening it to attack and exploits.

Oracle pools

The concept of oracles pools was designed for Ergo’s extended UTXO smart contract model, though the high-level overview can be adapted for use in Account-based systems (like Ethereum).

&gt;Oracle pools are a new model which attempt to address said issues, while also providing further new capabilities. From guaranteeing the data posting schedule, incorporating game theoretic incentives + disincentives, built-in governance, potential dynamic entry, and building oracle datapoint hierarchies of confidence, there are many possibilities unlocked with this model.

Oracle pools involve several oracles operating together, with different shares in the pool, and receiving payouts based on the reliability of the data they provide. (To determine the ‘true’ value of the data, outliers are removed and the data points averaged.) To participate, an oracle needs to post collateral, and can be ‘fined’ for failure to provide high-quality data on time.

Thus – as in the PoW consensus approach itself – honest oracles are rewarded, while fraudulent or unreliable ones waste their resources.

Stablecoin When the new model is implemented, it will become a key part of the technology that will underpin the Ergo stablecoin. (This will take an algorithmic or collateralised approach, rather than being a fiat-backed coin like USDT or USDC.)

Further details about the new stablecoin will be published in due course, with the new project expected to launch later in 2020",1593572248,2,1

However due to my interest in finance and economics I didn’t just give up, I decided to start a demo account, read some books, watch a lot of YouTube and practice! However what I began to realise was that I was making the same mistakes over and over. I felt like I new what to do but the discipline began to slide. I read a couple of blogs and lots of them really advised to record your activity and review them!
This is how I became consistently profitable. I came across a good trading journal.
It’s a very comprehensive trading journal that I have found very beneficial to my trading. It pulls together your data and gives you monthly and overall summaries, graphics and allows you to forecast your profits.

So advice to those who want to become consistently profitable... Record and review your trades!",1593552514,11,1

hiu0ap,OneMoreJuan,Decentralized Minecraft With Bitcoin,"I have posted something like this before but I think that I could've used better sentences to express this idea. 

I think that it would be amazing if we can run a Minecraft server in several servers at the same time, in a decentralized way (so that there isn't an admin controlling everything).

This Minecraft world would be created in survival mode and anyone could join it for free as long as they provide their own computer to run the server, or pay a small fee in Bitcoin to those who run the server.

In this Minecraft world we could just play, mine and build like we all do in a normal server, but the difference is that we would have a Bitcoin wallet holding some BTC in the Lighting Network. The private keys would be in our personal computer therefore it would be safe.

We can pay in Bitcoin for several things, for example labor: you could hire a player to go mine for you while you're building.

We could run an entire economy that's realistic using Bitcoin in Minecraft, it would be fun and it would actually be useful.

If this is well executed I know it would work because people already spend hundreds of dollars on virtual items in videogames just to be more ""cool"" or have a ""better"" gaming experience. 

The Bitcoin used in the game is in our computers, it's safe and it cannot get stolen. 

How can this become real?",1593544366,5,1

In that period only 28 trades ended in arbitration. Less than 1%. That is absolutely amazing. Bisq will succeed as the first successful Bitcoin DEX.

There is always room for improvement, but that should not diminish this incredible achievement. The future is very bright! I still remember the days when this was thought to be impossible.

Soon the world will catch on. Sure 500 BTC might seem small compared to the volume of centralized exchanges, but every single one of these trades was real, paid fees and had a security deposit. No spoofing or faking this volume.

No KYC, no account needed. Full user control of funds. Full user privacy. No data collection. Uncensorable.

hipeba,shadow12348,"After a year of jumping through hoops, MasterCard approved our Lightning based solution. Here's part 2 of our story in the journey from India to Silicon Valley to push for adoption","We'd ranted about our dream to create a solution that would enable people to actually use and do things with Bitcoin as evident in my post history. As a bunch of young founders, we realized quickly after developing our first hardware prototypes how hard that was actually going to be and how ridiculously capital intensive that process was, for a market that was waning away during the ""crypto-winter"". We ended up open-sourcing a portion of our developed hardware and had to absolutely put it on ice until we have more funds to build it out.

Almost every investor in the Baltics told us to go away when we mentioned the word Bitcoin and today we're proud to say that we didn't pivot into launching a random token, IEO, or whatever to raise funds to make our dream come true. We realized Silicon Valley was where we needed to be and we managed to get UC Berkeley's SkyDeck VC interested in the problem we wanted to solve. Our first in person interaction was - ""We don't usually invest in hardware, crypto companies and B2C companies, but you guys are all three!"" Long story short, as a bunch of young adults, we got UC Berkeley and Charlie Lee to invest in us among others! Admittedly, it's been uncertainty layered upon uncertainty but we didn't want to solve any problem other than the one pushing for the mass adoption of Bitcoin.

As beautiful as it would be if the entire world cared about privacy and security, and used hardware wallets to secure their crypto, the first steps are to push adoption, bring new users onto Bitcoin and provide new and better ways for existing Bitcoiners to do things with their Bitcoin. With that in mind, being a tiny company, after hundreds of conversations with financial institutions, banks and electronic money institutions in Europe and the USA, it's clear these big organizations still do not want to be associated with Bitcoin unless you're coming to them with atleast $2-10M in the bank. Despite this, after a long winded uphill battle, we've finally built out our Lightning Network based card product whose absolutely most primitive form was approved by MasterCard today. This is a tiny ftraction of all the stuff we've shelved away until we can grow to be a larger company with more resources. In any case, if you would like to join our private beta and test it out firsthand, it's on [lastbit.io](https://lastbit.io). This is a fully functional testnet application that gives you a feel for what this is all about and mirrors the main app as well.

The article says at one part, ""One of the world’s top cryptographers believes that Satoshi Nakamoto chose Bitcoin’s (BTC) elliptic curve either for its efficiency or because it may offer a secret backdoor."" Yet further on, the article quotes the same top cryptographer to say, ""In contrast, the Koblitz curve parameters are mathematically determined, and there is little possibility for setting such a backdoor.”""

Finally, Cointelegraph quotes Wladimir van der Laan to say, ""Even if Secp256r1 has a vulnerability, no one has stepped forward yet to announce their discovery. On the other hand, keeping this discovery to themselves could yield a multi-billion dollar reward.""  secp256r1 vulnerability leads to a multi-billion dollar reward?  Where is secp256r1 in bitcoin?

Let's say you generated an HD wallet to get money from your 3 friends. You give a different bitcoin address to each one of them and they give you 1 BTC each. And now that you got the funds you want to send the 3 BTC to the lambo dealership, to one single address.

Now, each address has its own private key that can be used to claim the funds. So how do you go about ""adding"" the 3 BTC together and spending it at the same time in a single transaction? Do you have multiple inputs? Or is there something I'm missing?

As per our conversation with the person who speaks and understands Malayalam (മലയാളം), language spoken in the Indian state of Kerala, it has been revealed that a young man, named “Mohammed Nawaz (aged 38)” convinced people of the state for crypto scam investment.

However, it appeared as the bitcoin-related fraud and victims have lost their money, Rs. 1.5 crore (approximately - USD 200320.50). They then instructed goons to kidnap Nawaz. As per the [report](https://www.mathrubhumi.com/crime-beat/crime-news/bitcoin-deal-youth-kidnapped-in-thrissur-1.4884709), police arrested 11 kidnappers and Nawaz agreed to sell his assets and return funds to victims who invested in the crypto scam scheme. The report specifically states that fraud is related to “Bitcoin Network investment”.

Kerala is a state of India which has the highest proportion of literate persons in the population has recently. Infant, as per early Jan this year, Kerala has [reportedly ](https://news.bitcoin.com/kerala-outlines-plans-to-become-indias-blockchain-hub/)revealed its plan to train 20, 000 blockchain professionals.

Given the popularity of cryptocurrency and rising interest, crypto scams are happening across the world. Very recently, Nigerian duo who appeared to be Instagram influencers with thousands of followers got arrested following the cybercrime. They stole funds and converted in Bitcoin which according to the FBI cannot be recovered as the Bitcoin Blockchain Network is too sophisticated. ",1594111800,0,1

Not sure if this makes sense but I’m thinking of something that’d be the next step up to projects like Cure coin which rewards for protein folding, except in this case, a reward from using the Bitcoin network specially with the incentive of causing data to be generated across all Omics categories instead of just the proteome. 

In essence, what I’m pondering is a way to intertwine the Omics era with Bitcoin/distributed ledgers such that a dataset compiles in a more passive, fast and most importantly, accessible way. Cure/Fold/Banano coin all seem like great starts towards addressing this but they seem to have multi-fronted limitations towards mainstream traction. At the very least, maybe there’s a way to follow a similar dynamic that’s more cumulative and streamlined? 

Just seems like it’d be fitting that Bitcoin, a global currency, aids in the solving of arguably the most important global problem, aging, by catalyzing data generation and the automation/accuracy of its analysis.",1594100487,3,1

Hello, investors

I introduce the useful app to show real time crypto price on the desktop of your windows PC. This shows the real time prices of main cryptocurrencies like sticky note.

As you know the crypto market fluctuates very unexpectedly, so you need to respond rapidly along the change in price of the assets you are investing on. This app will help you get profit from your business. Very useful, helpful and convenient.

Thanks.

hml7uj,killamch89,DO NOT USE PAYCENT!,"Here is my story. On Saturday, After many years signing up and verifying myself for their platform, I decided to give it a chance and buy the Paycent card. I sent some Ether to the wallet address they provided me. I remembered that they had a Telegram that I had been apart of since the beginning although I hardly ever paid it much mind. After 4 hours of not seeing any signs of my Ether, I went to the telegram group to inquire about this and only found out then that they were experiencing a bit of a technical issue because they were upgrading their systems for the next 10 days so my Ether couldn't be converted to SIP to purchase the card. 

Some other people were having some issues receiving their Ether as well but they said they eventually got through after 4-5 hours so I said alright and decided to go run some other errands. 5 and a half hours later, I still see no sign of Ether so I started asking around and some other people had received theirs. So I decided that I didn't have all day to monitor this so I decided to leave it until Sunday morning because I assumed by then the issue would have been sorted. 

Sunday morning rolled around and I still see no sign of my Ether and I checked my Ether wallet to ensure the Ether was there - still no Ether so I got in contact with customer support who told me they had technical issues because of upgrading their systems and they took my hash ID. I had some errands to run and also a couple of meetings so I left it. When I got home Sunday night - still nothing.

However, I was so tired that I fell asleep and woke up this morning. Now that I'm awake, I go check the wallet still nothing. I started panicking a bit because I still don't see anything so I reach out to customer support and they said they'd address it (from my experience with them, their way of addressing things seems to take an eternity). I go on the telegram channel to try and get some answers because I'm very disgruntled by the lack of communication. I ask about the Ether issue because everyone else who had the same issue as me around the same time had their issues resolved long ago.

This administrator called ""Alex"" comes in asking me why I'm still sending Ether when they had announced that they were upgrading their systems. Keep in mind that they don't have any news about this on their official site. I called him a twat because that is such a stupid question to ask someone. 

All of a sudden he starts calling me all kinds of names, (now keep in mind, I've been in many types of telegram chats before for many other companies and I've never seen the level of unprofessionalism as I've seen from these Paycent admins on telegram. Me being disgruntled already started cursing because it's my money and I don't see it anywhere. A gut feeling said to make sure to capture at least a screenshot as evidence in my story.

Long story short they kicked me out ( I did expect that) but the rudeness of these admins compelled me to write this post. By the way, do you want to guess when I finally got my Ether? this AFTERNOON. After two days. I'm going to close my account and transfer my Ether back out of my account because it's pretty obvious that this company lacks a basic understanding of customer service and communication. I encourage you to wait for Advcash to start offering their cards again worldwide or Crypterium. 

I'm trying to prevent what happened to me from happening to anyone else, put your money somewhere else where it will be valued. I'm in the process of transferring my Ether back out of my account and closing it because I refuse to give this company any of my money.

For anyone thinking of getting a cryptocurrency debit card (especially for Bitcoin), there are far better options.

Any info with pros &amp; cons is appreciated.

Current quote is for 6.3c electric costs that are locked into a 2 year contract.  Includes the shelf space, maintenance, cooling, etc.  The S17+ per unit are $2400. 

Based on my research this would profit a mere $60 per month or put another way, an ROI of 6.5 years at current market rate!  I know the price is set to fly over the next couple years but still...

hmgy4v,oniondrip,"Real Estate, Ownership, Contracts = Blockchain?","I just had a thought regarding the ownership to a plot of land.

Through history, land has been reclaimed and/or stolen, deeds, contracts has been burned, lost or otherwise destroyed.  
Hence, I was wondering, is there any current work. So as to say, An technology, legal and approved by a worldly (global) ""court"" or ""law, to save or store a deed, contract on the current Bitcoin Blockchain.  
If so, who offers this service, is it considered valid in the worldly court? Who upholds and keeps its validity? Can it be made self governed?  
I am fully aware that this might be a complicated issue, since it also depends on where the plot of land is bought/sold as well as regulations around said activity. However I would try to stress the ""global"" legality/validity, since Bitcoin is in fact such.  
Generally I though this to be part of the age old class fight, capitalism and the abuse of labour. Since capitalists does not seem to lose their properties/deeds in times of strife (General assumption - sorry). Regardless the proletariat are the ones that historically are driven off their own land, the ones that usually suffers and lose.  
What about global corporations compared to private interests?   


So the hypothetical, thought is in fact. How can I (and I believe also You) protect our property and let our descendants remain as owners on the land we acquired?\*

The writing is on the wall.","[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-06/square-rally-sends-valuation-into-ranks-of-biggest-u-s-banks?srnd=premium](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-06/square-rally-sends-valuation-into-ranks-of-biggest-u-s-banks?srnd=premium)

&gt;A rally in the shares of Square Inc. over the past few months has pushed the market valuation of the digital-payment company into the ranks of some of the biggest U.S. banks.  
&gt;  
&gt;Square has a market capitalization of about $55 billion after doubling since May, making it worth more than Truist Financial Corp. and all but four banks in the KBW Bank Index. While it’s still dwarfed by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp., Square is less than $20 billion shy of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s market valuation, which stands at $74 billion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Square is now worth more than Truist Financial after doubling since May  
&gt;  
&gt;Square shares have continued to set records in recent weeks as optimism swells over the growth of digital payments, and as the coronavirus pandemic changes consumer and corporate spending behavior.The San Francisco-based company has benefited in particular from positive sentiment about its popular cash app, its handling of pandemic-related government stimulus payments and its ability to garner deposits from traditional banks with fewer digital offerings.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Technology stocks have soared this year, while banks have sunk.** The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index has gained 21% and the KBW Bank Index has fallen 35%.  
&gt;  
&gt;Square rallied as much as 13% on Monday after an analyst suggested it could eventually win as much as 20% of U.S. direct deposit accounts.

They can buy bitcoin tho. Same impulse that makes reach Europeans put their capital in USDs will make the average Johann put his money in the magic internet money or maybe I don’t know what I’m talking about and sorry.",1594335806,3,1

1) Do you pay any taxes immediately when buying a bitcoin? When I buy a [Billy Strings](https://youtu.be/VFEZOjtrwls) CD at the store I pay taxes right there at the store, is buying bitcoin similar?
What if it is a gift or acquired from taking a survey online or something similar?

2) Are taxes always required when selling bitcoin for a profit/gain? What if you sell it for a loss bought 1 whole coin (or the equivalent),  at $10,000 and sold it for $9,000, resulting in a loss of $1,000?

3) How is bitcoin taxed for short term holdings? I mean can I buy a bunch of bitcoin today and sell it next day/week/month (less than 1 year), for a gain or loss? 

4) How is bitcoin taxed if I buy it and hold it for longer than 1 year...5 years...10+ years?


5) How are bitcoins taxed if sold for a loss, both less than 1 year and longer than 1 year?

6) What kind of tax write offs are available for bitcoin owners?

That pops up a modal and shows the private key (after making you click a warning box EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.)

However this method is painfully tedious with wallets that have 100's or thousands of legacy keys in them.

Skrill uses BitPay so I can't directly send it from my Paxful wallet. I end up sending it to my Bitpay wallet then to Skrill. The fees are killing me though so I decided to use DeBitpay from  u/alexk111  to send it directly from Paxful wallet &gt; Skrill.  


I did the transaction on Saturday and it is still pending on Skrill now Monday morning. If it fails then Skrill usually kills off your 'pending' order in about 30min or so but this is still pending so I have hope.

hrlpnc,almkglor,Technical: Taproot: Why Activate?,"This is a follow-up on https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/hqzp14/technical_the_path_to_taproot_activation/

Taproot! Everybody wants it!!  But... you might ask yourself: sure, everybody **else** wants it, but why would ***I***, sovereign Bitcoin HODLer, want it?  Surely I can be better than everybody **else** because I swapped XXX fiat for Bitcoin unlike all those nocoiners?

And it is important for you to know the reasons why you, o sovereign Bitcoiner, would want Taproot activated.  After all, your nodes (or the nodes your wallets use, which if you are SPV, you hopefully can pester to your wallet vendor/implementor about) need to be upgraded in order for Taproot activation to actually succeed instead of becoming a hot sticky mess.

First, let's consider some principles of Bitcoin.

* You the HODLer should be the one who controls where your money goes.  Your keys, your coins.
* You the HODLer should be able to coordinate and make contracts with other people regarding your funds.
* You the HODLer should be able to do the above without anyone watching over your shoulder and judging you.

I'm sure most of us here would agree that the above are very important principles of Bitcoin and that these are principles we would not be willing to remove.  If anything, we would want those principles strengthened (especially the last one, financial privacy, which current Bitcoin is only sporadically strong with: you *can* get privacy, it just requires effort to do so).

So, how does Taproot affect those principles?

## Taproot and Your /Coins

Most HODLers probably HODL their coins in singlesig addresses.  Sadly, switching to Taproot would do very little for you (it gives a mild discount at spend time, at the cost of a mild increase in fee at receive time (paid by whoever sends to you, so if it's a self-send from a P2PKH or bech32 address, you pay for this); mostly a wash).

(technical details: a Taproot output is 1 version byte + 32 byte public key, while a P2WPKH (bech32 singlesig) output is 1 version byte + 20 byte public key hash, so the Taproot output spends 12 bytes more; spending from a P2WPKH requires revealing a 32-byte public key later, which is not needed with Taproot, and Taproot signatures are about 9 bytes smaller than P2WPKH signatures, but the 32 bytes plus 9 bytes is divided by 4 because of the witness discount, so it saves about 11 bytes; mostly a wash, it increases blockweight by about 1 virtual byte, 4 weight for each Taproot-output-input, compared to P2WPKH-output-input).

However, as your HODLings grow in value, you might start wondering if multisignature k-of-n setups might be better for the security of your savings.  And it is in multisignature that Taproot starts to give benefits!

Taproot switches to using Schnorr signing scheme. Schnorr makes key aggregation -- constructing a *single* public key from multiple public keys -- almost as trivial as adding numbers together. ""Almost"" because it involves some fairly advanced math instead of simple boring number adding, but hey when was the last time you added up your grocery list prices by hand huh?

With current P2SH and P2WSH multisignature schemes, if you have a 2-of-3 setup, then to spend, you need to provide two different signatures from two different public keys.  With Taproot, you can create, using special moon math, a single public key that represents your 2-of-3 setup.  Then you just put two of your devices together, have them communicate to each other (this can be done airgapped, in theory, by sending QR codes: the software to do this is not even being built yet, but that's because Taproot hasn't activated yet!), and they will make a *single* signature to authorize any spend from your 2-of-3  address.  That's 73 witness bytes -- 18.25 virtual bytes -- of signatures you save!

And if you decide that your current  setup with 1-of-1 P2PKH / P2WPKH addresses is just fine as-is: well, that's the whole point of a ***soft***fork: backwards-compatibility; you can receive from Taproot users just fine, and once your wallet is updated for Taproot-sending support, you can send to Taproot users just fine as well!

(P2WPKH and P2WSH -- SegWit v0 -- addresses start with `bc1q`; Taproot -- SegWit v1 --- addresses start with `bc1p`, in case you wanted to know the difference; in bech32 `q` is 0, `p` is 1)

Now how about HODLers who keep all, or some, of their coins on custodial services?  Well, any custodial service worth its salt would be doing *at least* 2-of-3, or probably something even bigger, like 11-of-15.  So your custodial service, if it switched to  using Taproot internally, could save a lot more (imagine an 11-of-15 getting reduced from 11 signatures to just 1!), which --- we can only hope! --- should translate to lower fees and better customer service from your custodial service!

So I think we can say, very accurately, that the Bitcoin principle --- that YOU are in control of your money --- can only be helped by Taproot (if you are doing multisignature), and, because P2PKH and P2WPKH remain validly-usable addresses in a Taproot future, will not be harmed by Taproot.  Its benefit to this principle might be small (it mostly only benefits multisignature users) but since it has no drawbacks with this (i.e. singlesig users can continue to use P2WPKH and P2PKH still) this is still a nice, tidy win!

(even singlesig users get a minor benefit, in that multisig users will now reduce their blockchain space footprint, so that fees can be kept low for everybody; so for example even if you have your single set of private keys engraved on titanium plates sealed in an airtight box stored in a safe buried in a desert protected by angry nomads riding giant sandworms because you're the frickin' Kwisatz Haderach, you still gain some benefit from Taproot)

And here's the important part: ***if P2PKH/P2WPKH is working perfectly fine with you and you decide to never use Taproot yourself, Taproot will not affect you detrimentally***.  First do no harm!

## Taproot and Your Contracts

No one is an island, no one lives alone.  Give and you shall receive.  You know: by trading with other people, you can gain expertise in some obscure little necessity of the world (and greatly increase your productivity in that little field), and then trade the products of your expertise for necessities other people have created, all of you thereby gaining gains from trade.

So, contracts, which are basically enforceable agreements that facilitate trading with people who you do not personally know and therefore might not trust.

Let's start with a simple example.  You want to buy some gewgaws from somebody.  But you don't know them personally.  The seller wants the money, you want their gewgaws, but because of the lack of trust (you don't know them!! what if they're scammers??) neither of you can benefit from gains from trade.

However, suppose both of you know of some entity that both of you trust.  That entity can act as a trusted escrow.  The entity provides you security: this enables the trade, allowing both of you to get gains from trade.

In Bitcoin-land, this can be implemented as a 2-of-3 multisignature.  The three signatories in the multisgnature would be you, the gewgaw seller, and the escrow.  You put the payment for the gewgaws into this 2-of-3 multisignature address.

Now, suppose it turns out neither of you are scammers (whaaaat!).  You receive the gewgaws just fine and you're willing to pay up for them.  Then you and the gewgaw seller just sign a transaction --- you and the gewgaw seller are 2, sufficient to trigger the 2-of-3 --- that spends from the 2-of-3 address to a singlesig the gewgaw seller wants (or whatever address the gewgaw seller wants).

But suppose some problem arises.  The seller gave you gawgews instead of gewgaws.  Or you decided to keep the gewgaws but not sign the transaction to release the funds to the seller.  In either case, the escrow is notified, and if it can sign with you to refund the funds back to you (if the seller was a scammer) or it can sign with the seller to forward the funds to the seller (if you were a scammer).

Taproot helps with this: like mentioned above, it allows multisignature setups to produce only one signature, reducing blockchain space usage, and thus making contracts --- which require multiple people, by definition, you don't make contracts with yourself --- is made cheaper (which we hope *enables* more of these setups to happen for more gains from trade for everyone, also, moon and lambos).

(technology-wise, it's easier to make an n-of-n than a k-of-n, making a k-of-n would require a complex setup involving a long ritual with many communication rounds between the n participants, but an n-of-n can be done trivially with some moon math.  You can, however, make what is effectively a 2-of-3 by using a three-branch SCRIPT: either 2-of-2 of you and seller, OR 2-of-2 of you and escrow, OR 2-of-2 of escrow and seller.  Fortunately, Taproot adds a facility to embed a SCRIPT inside a public key, so you can have a 2-of-2 Taprooted address (between you and seller) with a SCRIPT branch that can instead be spent with 2-of-2 (you + escrow) OR 2-of-2 (seller + escrow), which implements the three-branched SCRIPT above.  If neither of you are scammers (hopefully the common case) then you both sign using your keys and ***never have to contact the escrow***, since you are just using the escrow public key without coordinating with them (because n-of-n is trivial but k-of-n requires setup with communication rounds), so in the ""best case"" where both of you are honest traders, you *also* get a privacy boost, in that the escrow never learns you have been trading on gewgaws, I mean ewww, gawgews are much better than gewgaws and therefore I now judge you for being a gewgaw enthusiast, you filthy gewgawer).

## Taproot and Your Contracts, Part 2: Cryptographic Boogaloo

Now suppose you want to buy some data instead of things.  For example, maybe you have some closed-source software in trial mode installed, and want to pay the developer for the full version.  You want to pay for an activation code.

This can be done, today, by using an HTLC.  The developer tells you the hash of the activation code.  You pay to  an HTLC, paying out to the developer if it reveals the preimage (the activation code), or refunding the money back to you after a pre-agreed timeout.   If the developer claims the funds, it has to reveal the preimage, which is the activation code, and you can now activate your software.  If the developer does not claim the funds by the timeout, you get refunded.

And you can do that, with HTLCs, today.

Of course, HTLCs do have problems:

* Privacy.  Everyone scraping the Bitcoin blockchain can see any HTLCs, and preimages used to claim them.
  * This can be mitigated by using offchain techniques so HTLCs are never published onchain in the happy case.  Lightning would probably in practice be the easiest way to do this offchain.  Of course, there are practical limits to what you can pay on Lightning.  If you are buying something expensive, then Lightning might not be practical.  For example, the ""software"" you are activating is really the firmware of a car, and what you are buying is not the software really but the car itself (with the activation of the car firmware being equivalent to getting the car keys).
  * Even offchain techniques need an onchain escape hatch in case of unresponsiveness!  This means that, if something bad happens during payment, the HTLC might end up being published onchain anyway, revealing the fact that some special contract occurred.
  * And an HTLC that is claimed with a preimage onchain will also publicly reveal the preimage onchain.  If that preimage is really the activation key of a software than it can now be pirated.  If that preimage is really the activation key  for your newly-bought cryptographic car --- well, not your keys, not your car!
* Trust requirement.  You are trusting the developer that it gives you the hash of an actual valid activation key, without any way to validate that the activation key hidden by the hash is actually valid.

Fortunately, with Schnorr (which is enabled by Taproot), we can now use the Scriptless Script constuction by [Andrew Poelstra](/u/andytoshi).  This Scriptless Script allows a new construction, the PTLC or Pointlocked Timelocked Contract.  Instead of hashes and preimages, just replace ""hash"" with ""point"" and ""preimage"" with ""scalar"".

Or as you might know them: ""point"" is really ""public key"" and ""scalar"" is really a ""private key"".  What a PTLC does is that, given a particular public key, the pointlocked branch can be spent only if the spender reveals the private key of the given private key to you.

Another nice thing with PTLCs is that they are *deniable*.  What appears onchain is just a single 2-of-2 signature between you and the developer/manufacturer.  It's like a magic trick.  This signature has no special watermarks, it's a perfectly normal signature (the pledge).  However, from this signature, plus some datta given to you by the developer/manufacturer (known as the *adaptor signature*) you can derive the private key of a particular public key you both agree on (the turn).  Anyone scraping the blockchain will just see signatures that look just like every other signature, and as long as nobody manages to hack you and get a copy of the adaptor signature or the private key, they cannot get the private key behind the public key (point) that the pointlocked branch needs (the prestige).

(Just to be clear, the public key you are getting the private key from, is distinct from the public key that the developer/manufacturer will use for its funds.  The activation key is different from the developer's onchain Bitcoin key, and it is the activation key whose private key you will be learning, not the developer's/manufacturer's onchain Bitcoin key).

So:

* Privacy: PTLCs are private even if done onchain.  Nobody else can learn what the private key behind the public key is, except you who knows the adaptor signature that when combined with the complete onchain signature lets you know what the private key of the activation key is.  Somebody scraping the blockchain will not learn the same information even if all PTLCs are done onchain!
  * Lightning is still useful for reducing onchain use, and will also get PTLCs soon after Taproot is activated, but even if something bad happens and a PTLC has to go onchain, it doesn't reveal anything!
* Trust issues can be proven more easily with a public-private keypair than with a hash-preimage pair.
  * For example, the developer of the software you are buying could provide a signature signing a message saying ""unlock access to the full version for 1 day"".  You can check if feeding this message and signature to the program will indeed unlock full-version access for 1 day.  Then you can check if the signature is valid for the purported pubkey whose private key you will pay for.  If so, you can now believe that getting the private key (by paying for it in a PTLC) would let you generate any number of ""unlock access to the full version for 1 day"" message+signatures, which is equivalent to getting full access to the software indefinitely.
  * For the car, the manufacturer can show that signing a message ""start the engine""  and feeding the signature to the car's fimrware will indeed start the engine, and maybe even let you have a small test drive.  You can then check if the signature is valid for the purported pubkey whose privkey you will pay for.  If so, you can now believe that gaining knowledge of the privkey will let you start the car engine at any time you want.
  * (pedantry: the signatures need to be unique else they could be replayed, this can be done with a challenge-response sequence for the car, where the car gathers entropy somehow (it's a car, it probably has a bunch of sensors nowadays so it can get entropy for free) and uses the gathered entropy to challenge you to sign a random number and only start if you are able to sign the random number; for the software, it could record previous signatures somewhere in the developer's cloud server and refuse to run if you try to replay a previously-seen signature.)

Taproot lets PTLCs exist onchain because they enable Schnorr, which is a requirement of PTLCs / Scriptless Script.

(technology-wise, take note that Scriptless Script works only for the ""pointlocked"" branch of the contract; you need normal Script, or a pre-signed `nLockTime`d transaction, for the ""timelocked"" branch.  Since Taproot can embed a script, you can have the Taproot pubkey be a 2-of-2 to implement the Scriptless Script ""pointlocked"" branch, then have a hidden script that lets you recover the funds with an `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` after the timeout if the seller does not claim the funds.)

## Quantum Quibbles!

Now if you were ***really*** paying attention, you might have noticed this parenthetical:

&gt; (technical details: a Taproot output is 1 version byte + 32 byte public key, while a P2WPKH (bech32 singlesig) output is 1 version byte + 20 byte public key hash...)

So wait, Taproot uses raw 32-byte public keys, and not public key hashes?  Isn't that more quantum-vulnerable??

Well, in theory yes.  In practice, they probably are not.

It's not that hashes can be broken by quantum computes --- they're still not.  Instead, you have to look at how you *spend from* a P2WPKH/P2PKH pay-to-public-key-hash.

When you  *spend from* a P2PKH / P2WPKH, you have to reveal the public key.  Then Bitcoin hashes it and checks if this matches with the public-key-hash, and only then actually validates the signature for that public key.

So an unconfirmed transaction, floating in the mempools of nodes globally, will show, in plain sight for everyone to see, your public key.

(public keys should be public, that's why they're called public keys, LOL)

And if quantum computers are fast enough to be of concern, then they are probably fast enough that, in the several minutes to several hours from broadcast to confirmation, they have already cracked the public key that is openly broadcast with your transaction.  The owner of the quantum computer can now replace your unconfirmed transaction with one that pays the funds to itself.  Even if you did not opt-in RBF, miners are still incentivized to support RBF on RBF-disabled transactions.

So the extra hash is not as significant a protection against quantum computers as you might think.  Instead, the extra hash-and-compare needed is just extra validation effort.

Further, if you have ever, in the past, *spent from* the address, then there exists already a transaction indelibly stored on the blockchain, openly displaying the public key from which quantum computers can derive the private key.  So those are still vulnerable to quantum computers.

For the most part, the cryptographers behind Taproot (and Bitcoin Core) are of the opinion that quantum computers capable of cracking Bitcoin pubkeys are unlikely to appear within a decade or two.

* Current quantum computers can barely crack prime factorization problem for primes of 5 bits.
* The 256-bit elliptic curve use by Bitcoin is, by my (possibly wrong) understanding, equivalent to 4096-bit primes, so you can see a pretty big gap between now (5 bit primes) and what is needed (4096 bit primes).
* A lot of financial non-Bitcoin systems use the equivalent of 3072-bit primes or less, and are probably easier targets to crack than the equivalent-to-4096-bit-primes Bitcoin.

So:

* Quantum computers capable of cracking Bitcoin are still far off.
* Pay-to-public-key-hash is not as protective as you might think.
* We will probably see banks get cracked before Bitcoin, so the banking system is a useful canary-in-a-coal-mine to see whether we should panic about being quantum vulnerable.

For now, the homomorphic and linear properties of elliptic curve cryptography provide a lot of benefits --- particularly the linearity property is what enables Scriptless Script and simple multisignature (i.e. multisignatures that are just 1 signature onchain).  So it might be a good idea to take advantage of them now while we are still fairly safe against quantum computers.  It seems likely that quantum-safe signature schemes are nonlinear (thus losing these advantages).

## Summary

* If you are a singlesig HODL-only Bitcoin user, Taproot will not affect you positively or negatively.  Importantly: Taproot does no harm!
* If you use or intend to use multisig, Taproot will be a positive for you.
* If you transact onchain regularly using typical P2PKH/P2WPKH addresses, you get a minor reduction in feerates since multisig users will  likely switch to Taproot to get smaller tx sizes, freeing up blockspace for yours.
* If you are using multiparticipant setups for special systems of trade, Taproot will be a positive for you.
  * Remember: Lightning channels are multipartiicpiant setups for special systems of lightning-fast offchain trades!

## I Wanna Be The Taprooter!

So, do you want to help activate Taproot?  Here's what ***you***, mister sovereign Bitcoin HODLer, can do!

* ***If you have developer experience especially in C, C++, or related languages***
  * Review the Taproot code!  There is one pull request  in Bitcoin Core, and one in libsecp256k1.  I deliberately am not putting links here, to avoid brigades of nontechnical but enthusiastic people leaving pointless reviews, but if you are qualified you know how to find them!
  * ***But I am not a cryptographer/Bitcoin Core contributor/mathematician/someone as awesome as Pieter Wuille***
    * That's perfectly fine!  The cryptographers have been over the code already and agree the math is right and the implementation is right.  What is wanted is the dreary dreary dreary software engineering: are the comments comprehensive and understandable? no misspellings in the comments? variable names understandable? reasonable function naming convention? misleading coding style? off-by-one errors in loops? conditions not covered by tests? accidental mixups of variables with the same types? missing frees? read-before-init? better test coverage of suspicious-looking code? missing  or mismatching header guards? portability issues? consistent coding style?  you know, stuff any coder with a few years of experience in coding ***anything*** might be able to catch.  With enough eyes all bugs are shallow!
* ***If you are running a mining pool/mining operation/exchange/custodial service/SPV server***
  * Be prepared to upgrade!
  * One of the typical issues with upgrading software is that subtle incompatibilities with your current custom programs tend to arise, disrupting operations and potentially losing income due to downtime.  If so, consider moving to the two-node setup suggested by gmax, which is in the last section of [my previous post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/hqzp14/technical_the_path_to_taproot_activation/).  With this, you have an up-to-date ""public"" node and a fixed-version ""private"" node, with the public node protecting the private node from any invalid chainsplits or invalid transactions.  Moving to this setup from a typical one-node setup should be smooth and should not disrupt operations (too much).
* ***If you are running your own fullnode for fun or for your own wallet***
  * Be prepared to upgrade!  The more nodes validating the new rules (even if you are a non-mining node!), the safer every softfork will be!
* ***If you are using an SPV wallet or custodial wallet/service (including hardware wallets using the software of the wallet provider)***
  * Contact your wallet provider / SPV server and ask for a statement on whether they support Taproot, and whether they are prepared to upgrade for Taproot!  Make it known to them that Taproot is something you want!

## But I Hate Taproot!!

That's fine!

* Raise your objections to Taproot now, or forever hold your peace!  Maybe you can raise them here and some of the devs (probably /u/nullc, he goes everywhere, even in rbtc!) might be able to see your objections!  Or if your objections are very technical, head over to the appropriate pull request and object away!
* Maybe you simply misunderstand something, and we can clarify it here!
* Or maybe you do have a good objection, and we can make Taproot better by finding a solution for it!

Hi,

1 of the 3 boards is not working anymore on my s9 antminer.

What can i do to troubleshoot? How can i find out if the board is broken or maybe there are some other problems?

hrg2zc,bigsquigglywiggly,Colleagues vs BTC,"I have colleagues at work who have very conservative views when it comes to cryptocurrency, specifically BTC (because it’s what I express interest in as I own a small amount). 

Their rebuttal is that, ‘every transaction is 100% traceable’, and essentially that fiat currency is king. I have made the distinction that BTCs value  comes in part from its market cap and that BTC printer don’t go BRRRRR - but was met with, “Yes - well that’s like saying, look at this dirt. It will always hold its value because there cannot be more created, only this finite amount will ever exist”. 

Meanwhile these same colleagues think of peaks and plummets in the stock market and major crashes as simply commonplace and of no concern. I feel legitimately out of place and as though they take me for some sort of evangelist whenever I express my interest in crypto. 

Not really looking for advice, just needed to vent. As I said, I have a small amount invested in BTC so I wouldn’t lose sleep if I lost it all tomorrow. I’m of the belief that innovation drives today’s economy and that fiat will be worth much less in the years to come.

1.) Let's say I purchase 500$ worth of bitcoin (about 0.054 btc with the current btc price), and I wish to conduct a trade over the popular P2P marketplace Paxful. If my trade partner is offering 45% of that in return (around 717$ in the end after fees) to be sent to a money app such as cashapp/movo, then reinvest that full amount into more bitcoin, then would that be considered illegal? I haven't really done any bitcoin trading like this before, so I'm just curious.

2.) I'm aware that there are possibilities of received money being dirty/stolen, but is there really anything I could do about that?

3.) Lastly, I'm concerned about taxes if I were to begin trading. Can anyone go into detail about this?

This may be a handful of questions, but I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could answer to clear up some confusion. Thanks!",1594780881,6,7

&gt;Dark money  
 In the politics of the United States, dark money refers to political  spending by nonprofit organizations — for example, 501(c)(4) (social  welfare) 501(c)(5) (unions) and 501(c)(6) (trade association) groups —  that are not required to disclose their donors.\[3\]\[4\] Such organizations  can receive unlimited donations from corporations, individuals and  unions. **In this way, their donors can spend funds to influence elections, without voters knowing where the money came from.**  
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark\_money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_money)  
 

Seems like a rigged game, especially when individuals can be attacked or fired for their political beliefs.

hr7t3x,gonzales82,[Discussion] Bitcoin and deflation: dangers of apolitical money,"Yannis Varoufakis has a number of objections against Bitcoin, most of which I can address, except of the issue of deflation which is way above my pay grade. Somebody help me out here. The argument is that the inability to manipulate the Bitcoin supply in a response to a crisis makes the crisis worse, giving the example of the 1929 crash. 

I don't know the history of the 1930 crisis enough (can somebody recommend a good book on this topic from an economist perspective?), but as Varoufakis explains in this deflationary (gold-standard) scenario ""[you have a] huge problem if wages fall faster than prices, meaning workers can only afford to buy fewer of the products."" This is another destabilizing factor which makes the crash worse. Here my question is - wouldn't this be only temporary, and would the prices necessarily adjust and eventually stabilize in proportion to the decrease of wages? Unless you find customers for your products, you're screwed anyway, so you need to make them cheaper, don't you?

In the context of the post-COVID crisis, I recognize the argument for the role of the state, and it's ability to print money and restart the economy, by making infrastructure investments, and direct payments to the people, i.e. Universal Basic Income.

he proceeds to lists several accounts claimed so far, 2 of these are 1 char accts which are not shown

1 account is [https://twitter.com/drug](https://twitter.com/drug) aka dr\*g in the screenshot which is currently now suspended.

[https://twitter.com/dong](https://twitter.com/dong) was taken and is currently suspended

[https://twitter.com/6](https://twitter.com/6) was taken but recovered by the owner @lucky225 which can be seen here [https://twitter.com/lucky225/status/1283514329187250177](https://twitter.com/lucky225/status/1283514329187250177)

[https://twitter.com/b](https://twitter.com/b) was taken and remains suspended.

[https://twitter.com/shinji](https://twitter.com/shinji) was the first user to tweet images of the admin panel, showing that @6 was targeted.

hstrdr,StayAwayFromCloudbet,Muchbetter Scam Issue,"Hello,

I have been a customer with Muchbetter for a couple years now. I did have issues in the past, however, recently I have not had any issues until 3 days ago.

I’ve done over 200,000 USD in transaction and crypto purchase in the last 6 weeks. I recently did a top up for $4000.00 CAD, sent $2000.00 via their P2P option to a friend of mine, they withdrew the funds 3 days ago and still have not received it.

Yesterday, I have topped up 2000$ CAD with my debit card, funds still have not reflected. I have been in direct contact with the CEO his name is ISREAL ROSENTHAL! Originally, he was very helpful, however, now they are saying that friends I referred have reported their transactions. This has nothing to do with me.

Anyways, long story short, they have scammed me for a lousy $4000.00 CAD and I will be taking immediate legal action. If there’s anyone else that has experienced issues with MUCHBETTER, please contact me directly and I can involve you in my lawsuit

I’ve tried for hours and days to get my money back and the CEO refuses to assist me. I also have his direct email and mobile number for anyone that has had issues I can give you this information.

Final message is this: Do NOT trust Muchbetter. They are 100% a SCAM.
Support sucks and doesn’t even speak English.
Take them 5 days to respond at a time.",1594983956,5,1
hstpyq,CryptoLant,Question: Actual vs (inflated) virtual bitcoin supply - backed vs unbacked exchanges,"Before I ask my question, I would like to set the stage in the **intro** below. If you are already a finance guru please skip right through to my actual question:  
We know that the origins of paper money comes from depositing gold and getting paper certificates for them in return. We also know that these institutions, that accepted the deposits, later started to issue out more paper certificates than they actually had gold, with the aim of lending it to people and getting a return on it in interests (these certificates were therefore issued ""unbacked"" by actual gold).

  
If the economy was working fine than this practice (when done responsibly) was not a big issue and could even help an economy grow, but if there were troublesome times ahead people started to withdraw their gold in an alarming rate. If enough people wanted to exchange their paper certificates back in gold, then the institution (that has given out the unbacked paper gold certificates) will not be able to give the gold to all customers, as there are more paper certificates issued then there is actual gold in their vaults. This is the medieval equivalent of a modern bank run.   


In summary: the **actual** gold supply was lower than the (""**virtual**"") supply of gold certificates.  


**Now my question:**  
Is every bitcoin you buy on an exchange backed by **actual** crypto that the crypto exchange has in inventory and/or has bought from other users and then sold to you (earning the spread as a reward for this service).   


**OR**  


Do crypto exchanges do the same thing as in my little intro above?  Do they sell you a promise of a bitcoin ? I have heard of some exchanges that don't let you withraw your crypto... They just promise you to give you back the market value of bitcoin if you decide to sell... Doesn't this mean there is a similar difference in **actual** vs **virtual** supply as in my introduction above? And if so, what are the implications of this dynamic? Can it cause issues if left unregulated or will market dynamics/""crypto bank runs"" just make sure that these unbacked practices can't be a viable business model in the long run?",1594983755,16,1

Because YT, Google, and FB are taking money to advertise all sorts of scams. Rental scams, gold scams, crypto scams, counterfit merchandise scams, you name it. I've seen them all. So they're obviously not vetting the people they take money from to advertise at all, and so people are seeing it as an ad, and assuming it's vetted. Therefore, giving the scam more credibility in the process to those that are unaware. The only way I see them vetting this stuff efficiently enough to not advertise scammers, and not help scammers make their scams look more legit by giving them the benefit of their advertising association, is if we make them liable for accepting money from scammer's to advertise them to their users.

 If a celebrity or large page irresponsibility advertised a scam, wouldn't you hold them accountable? Is Kylie Jenner not accountable for advertising the scam fire festival? Or the other celebrities who advertised that scam? There are literal court cases for that rn. 

Just think, if the billboard down the street was advertising the local crackhead buisness, do you think the billboard owner would not be liable for advertising something illegal? I don't get why digital platforms get a pass here",1594982623,21,1

hum4k3,frosty3907,Will send 0.004 btc to anyone who can answer a simple question without being a condescending jerk,"I've asked this before but the answer (as is so often the case with Reddit) was to RTFM.
I don't have any interest in becoming a Bitcoin expert, I just have a specific question for my simple use case of Bitcoin:

How can I set up multiple receiving addresses that can't be tied to each other and get cash money out the other end?

I'm in .au so have coinspot and independent reserve accounts, I also have bitpay.
I'm unsure if I'm better off setting up single use (auditable) wallets in bitpay or if it's ok to use a multi wallet which has a new address each time but I think still has some overarching user ID that someone could tie them together.
Finally, it's all pointless if IR's wallet accounts can be tied together somehow.
I know this sub seems to dislike bitpay but it seems pretty convenient and needs suiting and every time you check a list of ""better"" apps they all have various issues I'm not interested in stuffing around with, but I'm not married to bitpay if there's honestly a better solution.
I don't need an iron clad system but rather something that isn't trivial to see that ""hey, all these payments are ending up at the same place"" - so I guess if the way IR creates new receiving addresses are all under some unified ID then that's an issue?

So I guess the short version of the question is how would someone not interested in running overly complex systems setup multiple receiving wallets and get them to cash in .au without the sender being able to tie them all together, at least not easily.

Thanks and I'll honestly send whoever can give a good answer some coin.

Ps. Crap I just realised it sounds like I'm trying to avoid taxes or something. That's not the case, I don't want the sender of the coins or some random person to be able to link the transactions. I know once it hits the bank accounts the government will know about it, I'm not concerned with that.


PPS. I'm going to bed now so don't think I've just bailed and am not going to pay anyone giving a good answer, I'll be up can pay someone within 10 hours",1595255032,22,1

I plan to have two machines. One that runs the offline node, and another that is online.

I want to sync the blockchain on the online node. And when I need to make a transaction on the offline node, then I would going to update it's blockchain by copying it from the online node using an external HDD.

And when I copied the blockchain to the offline node, I want to use the QT core to create and sign the transaction then get the raw transaction data from the console by TX ID and broadcast it with some online service.

I will scan the external HDD for viruses on both machines, plus I will verify the checksums to make sure the files I copy are valid.

In this scenario the offline node will be a bit outdated at the moment when I want to create the transaction, because of the delay that happens while I copy the files from the online node to the offline one.

Will it still allow me to create the transaction? Is there any other factor that could prevent this setup working?

I know I could import the addresses to the online node, create the transaction and sign it on the offline node, but I want to avoid that because I plan to have thousands of addresses.

¿Cómo gano dinero?

Aunque Bitcoin no se creo para este fin, hay personas que pueden ganar dinero haciendo trading (compran barato y luego venden más caro). Sin embargo, tienes que estudiar y dedicar tiempo para hacerlo bien, de lo contrario probablemente perderás dinero.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

¿Cómo invierto en criptomonedas?

Las criptomonedas no son instrumentos de inversión ni reparten ganancias. Lamentablemente existe mucha desinformación en este aspecto. Bitcoin es una forma de pago, por lo tanto sirve para ahorrar, enviar dinero y pagar por bienes y servicios. ¿invertirías en dólares? ¿en euros?

&amp;#x200B;

¿Cómo cambio después mis bitcoins por pesos chilenos?

Puedes venderlos realizando el proceso inverso de como los compraste. Es decir, si alguien te vendió esos bitcoins de forma directa, puedes pedirle a esa misma persona que te los compre a cambio de dinero tradicional, o bien usar alguna de las otras alternativas indicadas en el paso 2 de esta guía.

&amp;#x200B;

¿Esto es dinero real?

¡Los bitcoins también son dinero real! No por ser digital lo hace menos real. De hecho, utilizas dinero digital todos los días cuando pagas con tu tarjeta de débito/crédito o realizas una transferencia electrónica en el banco. La principal diferencia es que Bitcoin es una forma de dinero mucho más segura.

&amp;#x200B;

¿Es realmente seguro?

¡Sí! Siempre que tomes los resguardos necesarios y respaldes tu billetera de forma correcta, nadie puede robarte tus bitcoins ni impedirte que los uses. Sólo puedes perder tus bitcoins por errores humanos, como por ejemplo, si olvidas tu clave privada o si dejas tus bitcoins en una plataforma online en vez de transferirlos a tu billetera personal.

&amp;#x200B;

¿Por qué debería usar Bitcoin?

Bitcoin te permite administrar tu dinero sin tener que depender de bancos. Protege tu privacidad cada vez que realizas una transacción. Los bitcoins no pueden ser clonados y la forma en que funcionan es completamente transparente y neutral. No discrimina de ninguna forma, todos pueden participar y acceder a enviar dinero por internet sin límites.

&amp;#x200B;

¿Quién respalda Bitcoin?

¡Todos y nadie en específico! Bitcoin es dinero descentralizado, lo que quiere decir que no depende de la confianza en un banco central para funcionar. En cambio, la confianza se obtiene gracias a que sigue reglas claras y conocidas por todos, creando una economía colaborativa. Por lo tanto, Bitcoin se respalda en las matemáticas, en un código inalterable que, a diferencia de los gobiernos y bancos centrales, es incorruptible.

&amp;#x200B;

¿Existen otras criptomonedas?

Sí, actualmente se conocen alrededor de 6.000 criptomonedas, aunque muy pocas tienen una relevancia tan importante como Bitcoin. Cada criptomoneda se crea con un propósito distinto, no todas sirven para enviar y guardar dinero, algunas se crean simplemente para experimentar. ¡Cuidado! También existen criptomonedas que no aportan realmente valor o se crearon para estafar.

If you come to crypto with such an attitude, you should never ever invest.   


On the other hand, if you actually had to earn it while doing whatever you are usually doing anyway, that involves money?  


Examples:  
You get crypto as a token of gratitude in exchange of donation to your favorite artist. (like on Patreon)  
or  
You are paid crypto as a bonus to your salary.   
or  
... (any other examples come to your mind?)

hvu6hw,DangerousJefe,Is there really a limit to the amount of bitcoin that can exist?,"Genuine question here guys, I'm trying to understand.

I often hear about the concept of digital scarcity, and the 21 million bitcoin limit. But that limit is imposed by software, right? Suppose one day, a brave new dev or enigmatic entrepreneur comes along and proposes a soft fork to increase the limit. Would the network accept the change?

Now here's where I may be misunderstanding things. It is my understanding that new software changes will be accepted if the majority of miners accept the new software. We are in a situation where mining bitcoin requires a lot of extremely expensive, specialist equipment. Are all these miners with their massive CapEx really going to accept, some day in the future, that they are not allowed to keep on printing digital money? If someone proposes the change, why would the miners not agree to it?

Is it even desireable that the limit remains in place? Given how easy it is to lose bitcoin (e.g. you die and don't tell anyone your keys) would it not be prefereable to come up with a metric for how many coins are likely to be lost (long term inactive?) and allow that many coins to be mined again?

Thankyou to my son for introducing me to 2 great things this passed week - Bitcoin and Reddit!

This is my first post here after looking around for a few days.  I'm not so sure this is the correct thing to do but...Hello world.

Very depressing times we're living through. This is truly unprecedented for any of the generations and my heart goes out to every single one of you that is suffering.

Yet through all the destruction and madness, there is a glimmer of hope and unity.

*""From the ashes, a fire shall be woken, A light from the shadows shall spring""* 

I'm now 68 and it's been incredible to witness necessity usher in the birth of this digital age of currency. Something I could not have fathomed even 10 years ago. 

I thought Bitcoin was a scam when I first heard of it and saw resemblances to the 1630s Dutch Tulip craze and here we are, 10 years on.

After finally educating myself on how this works and what it means, i'm incredibly excited to see where this will take us and I hope to be alive long enough to enjoy the ride.

I'm by no means rich and chasing a quick buck but I am longing for a change, one that brings equality for all future generations. Here's to the future and to my support, all .01BTC of it.

Good luck to each one of you and love to all.

hxxhht,7_Maybe_7_and_a_bit,Bitbuy vs Kraken," 

I went through the process of researching Kraken and Bitbuy for a Canadian $ entry into crypto and thought I'd give a comparison of both for folks living in Canada.

I was already a long time member of Kraken but had to verify again as my account had been locked due to lack of use (stupid bear market lol). Anyway within a day of back and forth emails with support I was back in again.

For Bitbuy I needed to create an account which required 3 documents including a Driver's License and selfie holding it. Pretty sure Kraken would ask for similar docs if I had to create a new account with them. Anyway it took them 1 business day to verify my account and I was good to go. Overall both exchanges were quick to respond and helpful.

Onto depositing CAD fiat. Kraken only has 2 methods of depositing money which are:

* In-Person Payments (IPP) - The fee is $1.25 CAD + 0.25%
* Bank wire - Free (However my bank charges $20 flat fee for a wire)

There are a few stipulations for the wire transfer. ""The name on the bank account you are depositing from must match the name entered for verification on the Kraken account you are depositing into."" Also you must send Canadian Dollars (CAD) only. Min is $125 and max $300000

For Bitbuy the options to deposit were better as they have 4 options:

* Express e-Transer - Fee is 3.5% and takes 2 hours
* Interac e-Transfer - Fee is 1.75% and takes 24 hours
* Bank Wire - Fee is 0.5% and takes 1 to 2 days
* Flexipin - Fee is 2% and is instant

Since I want to make relatively small deposits on a regular basis I would rather pay a small percentage than the flat $20 bank fee for the wire transfer. Also with a free interac e-transfer I don't have to go into my branch which is super convenient. I opted to try Bitbuy over Kraken using an interac e-tranfer which went through within 12 hours. Deposited $200 and received $196.55 in my account.

I will say volume is lower than Kraken so the trade price is higher...usually around $30 per BTC more. However that fluctuates and the ease of fiat to crypto gateway was worth it IMO.

As for trading fees Bitbuy has a promotion for May where if you use their pro version instead of express trade (think coinbase vs GDAX) there are zero trading fees. After that it's 0.16% for maker and 0.26% for taker. Using express is 0.75% for buying and 0.5% for selling so might as well use pro. Kraken's fees range from 0% to 0.26% of the total cost (value) of your order. So comparable I guess.

I have not tried to withdraw any fiat from either account yet but when I do I will choose Kraken first. This is because their withdrawal fees for an EFT is 0.25% with a $50 minimum, whereas Bitbuy offers Interac e-transfer at 1.75% or a bank transfer at 2%.

So that's about it for my comparison. If you're living in Canada and found this useful feel free to use my Bitbuy referral code **G2ZTNR5DO** and help me out when you create a new account. You also get $20 for your first $100 deposit.

Hope you found this useful. Let me know how your experience went for fiat into crypto. :)

**TLDR**: Bitbuy wins for ease of CAD deposit and Kraken wins for cheapest withdrawals.",1595723762,7,1

We had this freedom for thousands of years when the world cumulatively settled on gold as its free market choice for storing wealth.

Somewhere along the lines we were decieved into accepting and storing wealth in un-backed fiat instead. The damage this has done is immeasurable, slow insidious inflation is a cancer that slowly kills its host leaving an entire society wondering why their salaries are only 10% that of neighbouring countries, hyperinflation is a bullet to the head.

Last year I got him a ledger hardware wallet and taught him how to send/receive transactions and consolidate keys after buying on cashapp. He doesn't feel confident holding his own keys yet, and as proof he leaves his private key card opened in his desk, definitely risking any coin getting swiped by accidentally holding it up in front of an insecure webcam (or a million other wrong moves).  


I'd like to get him setup with a third-party custodian with good security, but I don't have much experience there. I'm planning on suggesting that he buy and hold on Cash app, Kraken, Binance US, or GBTC for the added security.

hxtexb,dev_lurve,Future of cryptocurrencies? [all alts are staying low after the bubble; what will happen in the future?],"Hi guys,

1. I am a content marketer and writer, and I used to write about crypto around 2 years ago. Then I migrated into writing about SEO and digital marketing.
2. I currently have the customer who wants me to write extensively about cryptocurrencies. I love this niche a lot, and I am currently migrating back into writing about it.
3. However, I am seeing that all alts are staying at the same level - at pretty much very low levels, as compared to the peak level during the bubble stage - without any major changes after the bubble burst. At the same time, I am seeing that BTC is going through some kind of the bigger cycle of its own, i.e. it hasn't gone back to 1K or something like that, i.e. it moves its standard cycle and it hasn't gone as low as other alts have.
4. The customer wants me to write about all things about cryptocurrencies (exchanges, wallets, trading strategies, mining, mixers, etc.), and I am into this. But the point is that alts aren't showing the upward movements, and I am feeling that I am entering a pretty decaying niche here (but the customer pays good money as this is my day job here). At the same time, I am very interested in this niche, and I might want to start trading cryptocurrencies in a couple of months (like, daily trading, with the budget of 100$ and good money management (i.e. I will not invest more than 100$ and I will have good stop losses and take profits - if I fail, I fail)).

***it's just that I am feeling that I am missing a certain important piece of the picture here as to explaining to myself why the alts haven't come back. What is this stage that the alts are currently going through? Are people still buying physical wallets, going on exchanges and using crypto-related services? Or, is the niche not active at all?***",1595708138,8,1

hxqcd3,January3rd2009,Simple scaling solution,"I have heard for years the idea of decentralized aggrigation pools that wallets could utilize to help speed up transactions and cut the price of fees. 

The idea for those who do not know is similiar to the way mixing pools work. You join your transaction into a large pool with others and once the time is up everyones transactions get batched all at once and sent on chain with a sizable fee so it gets mined quicker. Of course the fees add up among everyone in the pool so your personal fee is pretty small. This could be accomplished through a decentralized protocol and be built into any wallet. This would make a great 2nd layer solution to scaling that seems rather simple. Remember how much batching helped the mempool when major exchanges began doing it?

Or satoshi was born outside Japan? if not and if he was in Japan when he created bitcoin then why didnt he registered bitcoin website as bitcoin.jp instead of bitcoin.org?

&amp;#x200B;

This is the basic idea of how bitcoin became an actual asset. The central banking system and the federal reserve is much too powerful to be reasoned with or taken by force. A new system had to be created. Enter bitcoin. Ironically, bitcoin shares the same strength as the federal reserve, its can not be taken by force. In order for bitcoin to be ""shutdown"", you would have to literally destroy millions of computers worldwide, which would never happen. This idea had me pondering, what will the federal reserve and banking system do to deal with bitcoin? First of, [China](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2020/05/25/china-will-use-its-digital-currency-to-compete-with-the-usd/#4c42859b31e8) has already released a digital format of their currency, the Yuan. The [United State](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianakoffman/2020/07/01/senate-moves-closer-to-digital-dollar/#2683b5f97279) will soon follow suit. I think it's pretty obvious at this point that the future is digital. This brings me to the threat to bitcoin. Bitcoin is still in its infancy stages and is still a hard sell to most people. The average person would much rather trust a USD Coin or a GPB Coin linked to a financial institution like VISA or MasterCard. How do we see Bitcoin and other cryptos competing with federally regulated digital currencies?",1595819085,20,1

hycsb9,_risho_,This subreddit should enable and require flairs to post on this subreddit.,"As subreddits grow larger, more and more you have to appeal to the lowest common denominator which means as time goes on there is more and more low quality posts and nonsense memes. This makes these subreddits completely unusable to anyone who isn't a normie. If you were to enable and require flairs from a select group of flairs then people could just use RES or RIF to block out and filter all of the nonsense. It will make it so that the subreddit is actually usable and at the same time it will probably increase the quality of posts and comments on the whole. 

You could consider flairs like ""Price, Meme, Meta, Technical Discussion, General Discussion, Question/Help , Talk/Lecture, Ecosystem Discussion, Video, Economics, Adoption"" and a few others. An example of a subreddit that has used that to huge success is the AMD subreddit. Flair filtering is the different between a ridiculous subreddit full of pictures of CPU boxes and computer cases to something that is full of interesting discussion and information.

The great thing about this solution is that you don't need to actually remove the normie content this way. People who enjoy rocket ship memes and the 37th picture of a stupid license plate can still continue on as they always have and people who don't want to deal with it don't have to.",1595790798,11,1

So anyways, I got fucked down to play dough money vs ball'er happiness I had before.

So I leveraged big when BTC was $8k. And I maxed out CC debt, like hugely. And took out personal loans from friends, etc.

100% what I would call 'irresponsible'. But if BTC hits $13,000 before it hits $7,000 I'm good. I'll be back to mini-ball'er status, and easily repay debt with like $30,000 interest.

I felt bad. Even if BTC 'zero'ed' I would be ok... (as in next 5 years spent earning solely to repay debts), but I'd be a much happier man driving a Tesla than shacking it up... so ya. Here's to hoping.",1595869748,13,1

https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-price-20k-2020-398k-2030/

According to their research it claims that BTC price is predicted to reach about $340,000 by 2025. I’m thinking of investing $11,000 (one BTC) exactly. Does it mean there’s potential of returning $329,000 in next 5 years? (Btw these are just estimate numbers). Would you invest $11,000 right now in hopes of high return in next 5 years?

So, is it a bad idea to write those words down in as many places as I can?

Isn't there a middle ground in the activation debate for a version where miners don't process the new transaction formats \*in any way\* so that there isn't this risk of them doing something funny with them.

As I understand it, the reason soft forks are basically hard forks to miners is this risk that non-upgraded miners could use the new transaction types to do something that is out of consensus with the upgraded nodes. For example new tx types look to non-upgraded nodes as ""anyone can spend"" so a miner could try to maliciously spend one of those and that would cause a chain split.

But why is it impossible to put out a version that restricts a miner from including the new tx types \*in anyway way\*? For example a version where miner's don't even try to include an ""anyone can spend"" tx in their block.  


I get that even if this were possible, then the miner would still have to upgrade to THAT version as it is still a different version. But I feel like this would give the miners the chance to not upgrade to the latest tx types while also not being a risk to chain forks.  


The miners could then do the flag signaling or whatever that they've upgraded to the version that definitely doesn't do anything with unfamiliar tx types.

You can print if for a very long time and all that currency will be picked up by all other countries since they need it.

It gives the country that owns that currency a very powerful mean to literally just print money and live like a king.

That continues untill all those other countries at some point see that happen and think to themselves ""why do we accept this shit?"".

At the moment the tide turns all that foreign held money starts flowing back and is nothing less than a tsunami of worthless paper.

At that moment the whole game is turned around and the advantages become burdens.

It's not strange to think about a situation where other countries say ""thank you"" for that role.

Especially if we are going to link that currency to any form of sound money like we have been for a long time and made it interchangeable to Gold.

Who would like his currency to be interchangeable to gold and be the reserve currency of the world?

It's verry likely that your gold reserves will get depleted fast, and other countries just have the risk the owner of the currency just declares the gold shop to be closed, as what the US has already done before.

So what could be an alternative?

Does anyone really believe we are going back to a gold standard?

Who can be trusted to have enough gold and to not close the gold shop when they decide it's time to do so?

Are we going to trust something like the IMF?

Or is the world ready for something that can't be cheated on, can't close the shop, and is not controlled by anyone, thus has no counter risk party?

We don't know if it was the US, a group of people,  an old Japanese guy, or if anyone has access to the wallets at all.

Let's say in the future bitcoin is going to be used as a form of currency that is comparable to the USD.

Satoshi has 1.1 million bitcoin in his wallet. The max supply of bitcoin is 21 million. Not taking into account the bitcoins lost.

Currently, bitcoin is 11k USD

1.1mil x 11k USD = Today, his wallet is worth 12 billion USD .

the richest man alive(on paper) is Jeff Bezos at 116 million USD.

If bitcoin is used as a form of currency on the scale of the USD. Satoshis' wallet will make him the richest man alive(on paper).

Wouldnt said ""satoshi"" having this much market share be a flaw in bitcoins creation? Wouldnt this ""power"" be comparable to the federal reserve. Wasnt bitcoin trying to solve the problems of having said federal reserve?

What I am trying to say is that even though the advancement of bitcoin as a technology is good.

i0e5k8,anonCapitalist,Bitcoin vs. Last Cycle,"Hi All,

I thought it would be interesting to plot bitcoin so far this year vs. this time four years ago (i.e. the previous cycle) over a period of 18 months.

The red curve is Bitcoin.

The blue curve is 16 \* Bitcoin four years ago shifted four years into the future.  The factor of 16 is based on the low of this past cycle (\~3200) vs the low of previous cycle (\~200).  By total coincidence they were almost perfectly matched at start of year.  Plots were performed using python pandas data frames.

As you extend the plot out to a full two years it looks very intimidating, but at 18 months seems hopeful but plausible.  Very exciting to see us keeping ahead of the red, and can only hope it lasts!

As someone who has of high sense of predictability I don't think Bitcoin will be the currency of the future. My main concern is that I learned in school that an asset is only worth as much as its value at the end of its life. My concern with Bitcoin is the loss of coins In the next thousand years. No more coins printed and no more in circulation will leave the coin worthless because although it may be valuable no one will have any. On the other hand Dogecoins are something to seriously consider as a currency.,1596072972,3,1

It allowed a functional and Operatable Decentralized finance system to become a reality. The importance of this cannot be understated. Things like AI, voting security ,etc. will be able to use blockchain in the future and it’s because of bitcoin. When you invest in bitcoin many people say what value does it have? This question stems from the concept of an asset needing to produce something to be reliable. The Truth is when you buy bitcoin you’re buying into the blockchain or the concept it self among other things. And for that bitcoin should be worth 100 times what it is now. If you believe in Internet 3.0  or the Idea that AI And IOT will shape our modern world  blockchain is a tool that will move it into reality.",1596064492,15,1

hyrw9e,StupidAuthentication,Hypothetical question: in the event of a large world disrupting event (war)...,"Hypothetically, in the event of a large war, the undersea cables that connect the world with internet could be severed. Satellite internet could be disabled through further wartime acts. We could end up with several discreet, independant internets that are not only separated by great firewalls, but also physically separated from each other.


It's my understanding that the block chain would essentially continue in each internet pocket unhindered, but not synchronized. 


So what happened if after a prolonged period of isolation, let's say 5 years, the networks become reconnected. 


Would the two block chains ""merge""

If they merge, how would potentially conflicting transactions be handled? Double spending? Would one block chain fully overwrite the other? Effectively nullifying 5 years worth of transactions? Or would the possible overwrite only affect specific conflicting transactions? 



Or would they stay as separate discreet chains at that point?

Would that mean someone who has keys today would then have keys for multiple sets of bitcoins on multiple block chains with the same keys? (so if I had 1btc today, after the ""war"" would I then have 1btc [Americas] 1btc [Asia] and 1btc [Europe])",1595855140,22,1

I embarked on this question when I saw someone's tweet that goes something like ""I am sorry if you think that bitcoin was created and not discovered"". This was not a literal tweet, but I believe that the author was definitely sure that bitcoin was discovered. Upon reading about the nature of the word discovery and its meaning, the most common explanation goes something like "" **A discovery...**  
concerns something that already exists at the time of discovery, but was previously unknown.  As a result of the discovery, nothing has changed apart from an associated increase in knowledge. "", and for the invention "" **An invention...**  
concerns something that was not previously there. However, a correlation exists with already known items, to which changes are made, meaning that the effect is improved in terms of quantity or quality.

hqzp14,almkglor,Technical: The Path to Taproot Activation,"Taproot!  Everybody wants to have it, somebody wants to make it, nobody knows how to get it!

(Pedants: I mostly elide over lockin times)

Briefly, Taproot is that neat new thing that gets us:

* Multisignatures (n-of-n, k-of-n) that are just 1 signature (1-of-1) in length!! (MuSig/Schnorr)
* Better privacy!! If all contract participants can agree, just use a multisignature.  If there is a dispute, show the contract publicly and have the Bitcoin network resolve it (Taproot/MAST).
* Activation lets devs work get back to work on the even newer stuff like!!!
  * Cross-input signature aggregation!! (transaction with multiple inputs can have a single signature for all inputs) --- needs Schnorr, but some more work needed to ensure that the interactions with SCRIPT are okay.
  * Block validation - Schnorr signatures for all taproot spends in a block can be validated in a single operation instead of for each transaction!! Speed up validation and maybe we can actually afford to increase block sizes (maybe)!!
  * `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` - you know, for Decker-Russell-Osuntokun (""eltoo"") magic!!!
  * `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY` - vaulty vaults without requiring storing signatures, just transaction details!!

So yes, let's activate taproot!

## The SegWit Wars

The biggest problem with activating Taproot is PTSD from the previous softfork, SegWit.  Pieter Wuille, one of the authors of the current Taproot proposal, has consistently held the position that he will not discuss activation, and will accept whatever activation process is imposed on Taproot.  Other developers have expressed similar opinions.

So what happened with SegWit activation that was so traumatic?  SegWit used the BIP9 activation method.  Let's dive into BIP9!

### [BIP9 Miner-Activated Soft Fork](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki)

Basically, BIP9 has a bunch of parameters:

* **bit** - A field in the block header, the `nVersion`, has a number of bits.  By setting a particular bit, the miner making the block indicates that it has upgraded its software to support a particular soft fork.  The **bit** parameter for a BIP9 activation is *which* bit in this `nVersion` is used to indicate that the miner has upgraded software for a particular soft fork.
* **timeout** - a time limit, expressed as an end date.  If this timeout is reached without sufficient number of miners signaling that they upgraded, then the activation fails and Bitcoin Core goes back to the drawing board.

Now there are other parameters (**name**, **starttime**) but they are not anywhere near as important as the above two.

A number that is ***not*** a parameter, is 95%.  Basically, activation of a BIP9 softfork is considered as actually succeeding if at least 95% of blocks in the last 2 weeks had the specified **bit** in the `nVersion` set.  If less than 95% had this bit set before the **timeout**, then the upgrade fails and never goes into the network.  This is not a parameter: it is a constant defined by BIP9, and developers using BIP9 activation cannot change this.

So, first some simple questions and their answers:

* Why not just set a day when everyone starts imposing the new rules of the softfork?
  * This was done classically (in the days when Satoshi was still among us).  But this might argued to put too much power to developers, since there would be no way to reject an upgrade without possible bad consequences.  For example, developers might package an upgrade that the users do not want, together with vital security bugfixes.  Either you live without vital security bugfixes and hire some other developers to fix it for you (which can be difficult, presumably the best developers are already the ones working on the codebase) or you get the vital security bugfixes and implicitly support the upgrade you might not want.
  * Sure, you could fork the code yourself (the ultimate threat in the FOSS world) and hire another set of developers who aren't assholes to do the dreary maintenance work of fixing security bugs, but Bitcoin needs strong bug-for-bug compatibility so everyone should really congregate around a single codebase.
  * Basically: even the devs do not want this power, because they fear being coerced into putting ""upgrades"" that are detrimental to users.  Satoshi got a pass because nobody knew who he was and how to coerce him.
* Why 95%?
  * Suppose the threshold were lower, like 51%.  If so, after activation, somebody can disrupt the Bitcoin network by creating a transaction that is valid under the pre-softfork rules, but are invalid under the post-softfork rules.  Upgraded nodes would reject it, but 49% of miners would accept it and include it in a block (which makes the block invalid)  And *then* the same 49% would accept the invalid block and build on top of *that*, possibly creating a short chain of doomed invalid blocks that confirm an invalid spend.  This can confuse SPV wallets, who might see multiple confirmations of a transaction and accept the funds, but later find that in fact it is invalid under the now-activated softfork rules.
  * Thus, a very high threshold was imposed.  95% is considered safe.  50% is definitely not safe.  Due to variance in the mining process, 80% could also be potentially unsafe (i.e. 80% of blocks signaling might have a good chance of coming from only 60% of miners), so a threshold of 95% was considered ""safe enough for Bitcoin work"".
* Why have a **timeout** that *disables* the upgrade?
  * Before BIP9, what was used was either flag day or [BIP34](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki).  BIP34 had no flag day of activation or a **bit**, instead, it was just a 95% threshold to signal an `nVersion` value greater than a specific value.  Actually, it was two thresholds: at 75%, blocks with the new `nVersion` would have the new softfork rules imposed, but at 95% blocks with the old `nVersion` would be rejected (and only the new blocks, with the new softfork rules, were accepted).  For one, between 75% and 95%, there was a situation where the softfork was only ""partially imposed"", only blocks signaling the new rules would actually have those rules, but blocks with the old rules were still valid.  This was fine for BIP34, which only added rules for miners with negligible use for non-miners.
  * The same activation process for BIP34 was used for [BIP66](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki).  After BIP66 reached 95%, [however, a single miner mined an invalid-for-BIP66 block that still signalled BIP66 support](https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2015-07-04-spv-mining).  It turned out that of the 95% signaling BIP66 support, only about 50% were actually imposing the BIP66 new rules.  The rest signalled support ***without upgrading their software to support new rules***.  This lead to many chainsplits and chaos with SPV nodes.
  * The reasons miners signalled support was because they felt they were being pressured to signal support.  So they signalled support, with plans to actually upgrade later, but because of the widespread signalling, the new BIP66 version locked in *before* upgrade plans were finished. Thus, the timeout that *disables* the upgrade was added in BIP9 to allow miners an escape hatch.

### The Great Battles of the SegWit Wars

SegWit not only fixed transaction malleability, it also created a practical softforkable blocksize increase that also rebalanced weights so that the cost of spending a UTXO is about the same as the cost of creating UTXOs (and spending UTXOs is ""better"" since it limits the size of the UTXO set that every fullnode has to maintain).

So SegWit was written, the activation was decided to be BIP9, and then.... miner signalling stalled at below 75%.

Thus were the Great SegWit Wars started.

#### BIP9 Feature Hostage

If you are a miner with at least 5% global hashpower, you can hold a BIP9-activated softfork hostage.

You might even secretly *want* the softfork to actually push through.  But you might want to extract concession from the users and the developers.  Like removing the halvening.  Or raising or even removing the block size caps (which helps larger miners more than smaller miners, making it easier to become a bigger fish that eats all the smaller fishes).  Or whatever.

With BIP9, you *can* hold the softfork hostage.  You just hold out and refuse to signal.  You tell everyone you will signal, if and only if certain concessions are given to you.

This ability by miners to hold a feature hostage was enabled because of the miner-exit allowed by the **timeout** on BIP9.  Prior to that, miners were considered little more than expendable security guards, paid for the risk they take, but not special in the grand scheme of Bitcoin.

#### Covert ASICBoost

ASICBoost was a novel way of optimizing SHA256 mining, by taking advantage of the structure of the 80-byte header that is hashed in order to perform proof-of-work.  The details of ASICBoost are out-of-scope here but you can [read about it elsewhere](https://www.mit.edu/~jlrubin/public/pdfs/Asicboost.pdf)

Here is a short summary of the **two** types of ASICBoost, relevant to the activation discussion.

* Overt ASICBoost - Manipulates the unused bits in `nVersion` to reduce power consumption in mining.
* Covert ASICBoost - Manipulates the order of transactions in the block to reduce power consumption in mining.

Now, ""overt"" means ""obvious"", while ""covert"" means hidden.  Overt ASICBoost is obvious because `nVersion` bits that are not currently in use for BIP9 activations are usually 0 by default, so setting those bits to 1 makes it obvious that you are doing something weird (namely, Overt ASICBoost).  Covert ASICBoost is non-obvious because the order of transactions in a block are up to the miner anyway, so the miner rearranging the transactions in order to get lower power consumption is not going to be detected.

Unfortunately, while Overt ASICBoost was compatible with SegWit, Covert ASICBoost **was not**.  This is because, pre-SegWit, only the block header Merkle tree committed to the transaction ordering.  However, with SegWit, another Merkle tree exists, which commits to transaction ordering as well.  Covert ASICBoost would require more computation to manipulate two Merkle trees, obviating the power benefits of Covert ASICBoost anyway.

Now, miners want to use ASICBoost (indeed, about 60-&gt;70% of current miners probably use the Overt ASICBoost nowadays; if you have a Bitcoin fullnode running you will see the logs with lots of ""60 of last 100 blocks had unexpected versions"" which is exactly what you would see with the `nVersion` manipulation that Overt ASICBoost does).  But remember: ASICBoost was, at around the time, a **novel** improvement.  Not all miners had ASICBoost hardware.  Those who did, did not want it known that they had ASICBoost hardware, and wanted to do Covert ASICBoost!

But Covert ASICBoost is incompatible with SegWit, because SegWit actually has two Merkle trees of transaction data, and Covert ASICBoost works by fudging around with transaction ordering in a block, and recomputing two Merkle Trees is more expensive than recomputing just one (and loses the ASICBoost advantage).

Of course, those miners that wanted Covert ASICBoost did not want to *openly admit* that they had ASICBoost hardware, they wanted to keep their advantage secret because miners are strongly competitive in a very tight market.  And doing ASICBoost Covertly was just the ticket, but they could not work post-SegWit.

Fortunately, due to the BIP9 activation process, they could hold SegWit hostage while covertly taking advantage of Covert ASICBoost!

#### UASF: BIP148 and BIP8

When the incompatibility between Covert ASICBoost and SegWit was realized, still, activation of SegWit stalled, and miners were still not openly claiming that ASICBoost was related to non-activation of SegWit.

Eventually, a new proposal was created: [BIP148](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0148.mediawiki).  With this rule, 3 months before the end of the SegWit **timeout**, nodes would reject blocks that did *not* signal SegWit.  Thus, 3 months before SegWit **timeout**, BIP148 would force activation of SegWit.

This proposal was not accepted by Bitcoin Core, due to the shortening of the timeout (it effectively times out 3 months before the initial SegWit timeout).  Instead, a fork of Bitcoin Core was created which added the patch to comply with BIP148.  This was claimed as a User Activated Soft Fork, UASF, since users could freely download the alternate fork rather than sticking with the developers of Bitcoin Core.

Now, BIP148 effectively is just a BIP9 activation, except at its (earlier) timeout, the new rules would be activated anyway (instead of the BIP9-mandated behavior that the upgrade is cancelled at the end of the **timeout**).

BIP148 was actually inspired by the [BIP8](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/fcd34618d7ce594db2a7e9badc4e70f1a2fab6db/bip-0008.mediawiki) proposal (the link here is a historical version; BIP8 has been updated recently, precisely in preparation for Taproot activation).  BIP8 is basically BIP9, but at the end of **timeout**, the softfork is activated anyway rather than cancelled.

This removed the ability of miners to hold the softfork hostage.  At best, they can delay the activation, but not stop it entirely by holding out as in BIP9.

Of course, this implies risk that not all miners have upgraded before activation, leading to possible losses for SPV users, as well as again re-pressuring miners to signal activation, possibly without the miners actually upgrading their software to properly impose the new softfork rules.

#### BIP91, SegWit2X, and The Aftermath

BIP148 inspired countermeasures, possibly from the Covert ASiCBoost miners, possibly from concerned users who wanted to offer concessions to miners.  To this day, the common name for BIP148 - UASF - remains an emotionally-charged rallying cry for parts of the Bitcoin community.

One of these was SegWit2X.  This was brokered in a deal between some Bitcoin personalities at a conference in New York, and thus part of the so-called ""New York Agreement"" or NYA, another emotionally-charged acronym.

The text of the NYA was basically:

1.  Set up a new activation threshold at 80% signalled at bit 4 (vs bit 1 for SegWit).
  * When this 80% signalling was reached, miners would require that bit 1 for SegWit be signalled to achive the 95% activation needed for SegWit.
2.  If the bit 4 signalling reached 80%, increase the block weight limit from the SegWit 4000000 to the SegWit2X 8000000, 6 months after bit 1 activation.

The first item above was coded in [BIP91](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/fcd34618d7ce594db2a7e9badc4e70f1a2fab6db/bip-0091.mediawiki).

Unfortunately, if you read the BIP91, *independently* of NYA, you might come to the conclusion that BIP91 was only about lowering the threshold to 80%.  In particular, BIP91 never mentions anything about the second point above, it never mentions that bit 4 80% threshold would *also* signal for a later hardfork increase in weight limit.

Because of this, even though there are claims that NYA (SegWit2X) reached 80% dominance, a close reading of BIP91 shows that the 80% dominance was only for SegWit activation, without necessarily a later 2x capacity hardfork (SegWit2X).

This ambiguity of bit 4 (NYA says it includes a 2x capacity hardfork, BIP91 says it does not) has continued to be a thorn in blocksize debates later.  Economically speaking, Bitcoin futures between SegWit and SegWit2X showed strong economic dominance in favor of SegWit (SegWit2X futures were traded at a fraction in value of SegWit futures: I personally made a tidy but small amount of money betting against SegWit2X in the futures market), so suggesting that NYA achieved 80% dominance even in mining is laughable, but the NYA text that ties bit 4 to SegWit2X still exists.

Historically, BIP91 triggered which caused SegWit to activate before the BIP148 shorter timeout. BIP148 proponents continue to hold this day that it was the BIP148 shorter timeout and no-compromises-activate-on-August-1 that made miners flock to BIP91 as a face-saving tactic that actually **removed** the second clause of NYA.  NYA supporters keep pointing to the bit 4 text in the NYA and the historical activation of BIP91 as a failed promise by Bitcoin developers.

## Taproot Activation Proposals

There are [two primary proposals I can see for Taproot activation](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-July/018043.html):

1.  BIP8.
2.  [Modern Softfork Activation](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-January/017547.html).

We have discussed BIP8: roughly, it has **bit** and **timeout**, if 95% of miners signal **bit** it activates, at the end of **timeout** it activates.

So let's take a look at Modern Softfork Activation!

### Modern Softfork Activation

This is a more complex activation method, composed of BIP9 and BIP8 as supcomponents.

1.  First have a 12-month BIP9.
2.  If the above fails to activate, have a 6-month discussion period during which users and developers and miners discuss whether to continue to step 3.
3.  Have a 24-month BIP8.

The total above is 42 months, if you are counting: 3.5 years worst-case activation.

The logic here is that if there are no problems, BIP9 will work just fine anyway.  And if there are problems, the 6-month period should weed it out.  Finally, miners cannot hold the feature hostage since the 24-month BIP8 period will exist anyway.

## PSA: Being Resilient to Upgrades

Software is very birttle.

Anyone who has been using software for a long time has experienced something like this:

1.  You hear a new version of your favorite software has a nice new feature.
2.  Excited, you install the new version.
3.  You find that the new version has subtle incompatibilities with your current workflow.
4.  You are sad and downgrade to the older version.
5.  You find out that the new version has changed your files in incompatible ways that the old version cannot work with anymore.
6.  You tearfully reinstall the newer version and figure out how to get your lost productivity now that you have to adapt to a new workflow

If you are a technically-competent user, you might codify your workflow into a bunch of programs.  And then you upgrade one of the external pieces of software you are using, and find that it has a subtle incompatibility with your current workflow which is based on a bunch of simple programs you wrote yourself.  And if those simple programs are used as the basis of some important production system, you hve just screwed up because you upgraded software on an important production system.

And well, one of the issues with new softfork activation is that if not enough people (users and miners) upgrade to the newest Bitcoin software, the security of the new softfork rules are at risk.

Upgrading software of any kind is always a risk, and the more software you build on top of the software-being-upgraded, the greater you risk your tower of software collapsing while you change its foundations.

So if you have some complex Bitcoin-manipulating system with Bitcoin somewhere at the foundations, consider running two Bitcoin nodes:

1.  One is a ""stable-version"" Bitcoin node.  Once it has synced, set it up to `connect=x.x.x.x` to the second node below (so that your ISP bandwidth is only spent on the second node).  Use this node to run all your software: it's a stable version that you don't change for long periods of time.  Enable txiindex, disable pruning, whatever your software needs.
2.  The other is an ""always-up-to-date"" Bitcoin Node.  Keep its stoarge down with pruning (initially sync it off the ""stable-version"" node).  You can't use `blocksonly` if your ""stable-version"" node needs to send transactions, but otherwise this ""always-up-to-date"" Bitcoin node can be kept as a low-resource node, so you can run both nodes in the same machine.

When a new Bitcoin version comes up, you just upgrade the ""always-up-to-date"" Bitcoin node.  This protects you if a future softfork activates, you will only receive valid Bitcoin blocks and transactions.  Since this node has nothing running on top of it, it is just a special peer of the ""stable-version"" node, any software incompatibilities with your system software do not exist.

Your ""stable-version"" Bitcoin node remains the same version until you are ready to actually upgrade this node and are prepared to rewrite most of the software you have running on top of it due to version compatibility problems.

When upgrading the ""always-up-to-date"", you can bring it down safely and then start it later.  Your ""stable-version"" wil keep running, disconnected from the network, but otherwise still available for whatever queries.  You do need some system to stop the ""always-up-to-date"" node if for any reason the ""stable-version"" goes down (otherwisee if the ""always-up-to-date"" advances its pruning window past what your ""stable-version"" has, the ""stable-version"" cannot sync afterwards), but if you are technically competent enough that you *need* to do this, you are technically competent enough to write such a trivial monitor program.

I have finally found a way to make a small contribution into crypto community.

For about a year I was questioning myself how much could I accumulate if would have been buying a fraction of Bitcoin regularly. I tried my best, but I couldn't find that kind of calculator online, so I decided to make that calculator myself. Free and available for everyone.

Moreover, this app can show approximate accumulation of BTC if you start today. I am self-motivated and created it for personal use, but it will make me proud if you find this app useful.

Cryptocurrency Calc shows results of regular micro-investing in Bitcoin. You can specify investing amount, regularity of purchase and starting date. This is a MVP version of a product.My roadmap contains more cryptocurrencies and more prediction calculators.
