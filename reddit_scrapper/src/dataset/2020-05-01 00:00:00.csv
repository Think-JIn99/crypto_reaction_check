gcu5wy,the420chronicler,The Halving and the Self-Fulfilling Prophesy of Bitcoin,"Every four years, the Halving reduces Miner Rewards by 50%, which effectively doubles the marginal cost to produce a Bitcoin overnight (give or take). 

This protocol feature puts upward pressure on the price of Bitcoin over time to fairly compensate the Miners for their work securing the network.

While the marginal cost to produce a Bitcoin is just a measure of Miner costs to process transactions and secure the Bitcoin protocol, it is also a reflection of how much global civilization values the most resilient accounting information system ever created by the human race.  

More value is assigned to Bitcoin's resiliency everyday, which puts upward pressure on the Price, which attracts more miners to compete for miner rewards, which get cut in half every four years, which puts more upward pressure on the price, and so on and so forth... 

I expect this process to continue until the supply and demand for the most resilient accounting information network reaches an equilibrium... which may still be many years into the future I suspect.  

And none of this even considers the value of decentralized applications built on top of Bitcoin's security layer, which will no doubt only add more value and utility to the Bitcoin protocol.  

Long story short, I highly recommend getting yourself some Bitcoin, so that we can get on with the real work of re-building human civilization under a new set of rules that promote Liberty and Justice for All.",1588525823,21,1

gcu0kz,genocidechimp,When to invest in Bitcoin Halving correctly?,"Hello all! So I am what you could consider a novice when it comes to bitcoin. I have invested in some in  the past, made some purchases, but never held onto any. I see this upcoming halving as a real opportunity to become a HODL'R and invest. I have read up on it and I have some questions, forgive me for sounding like a noob.   


1. The date of the halving event is said to be May 12th. So on that date, I should be monitoring the price,  and when it falls drastically to a low price (relative to what it is at now), I should buy and hold. is that correct?   

2. Is there some kind of real time chat on discord/reddit or other platforms I can join, that will discuss when is the best time to do so? (Buy the btc at all time low)   

3. I am looking into buying a hard wallet, because I hear thats the best place to keep my BTC once purchased. Any suggestions of what wallet would work best for holding long time?   

4. Is there any reason why I shouldn't buy the BTC at this time?

gct9qi,FixedFloat,How Blockchain.com harms the cryptocurrency community," 

&gt;This post has been written to draw Blockchain.com's attention to the issues of its product.

Blockchain.com (formerly Blockchain.info) was founded in 2011 and with no doubt has helped the Bitcoin community to create a block explorer and has proven itself as a valuable service. Millions of people from all over the world use their wallet. However, time goes on, Bitcoin develops, but one of the main cryptocurrency companies not only slows down the process of its development, but also discredits the usability of cryptocurrencies. Why is that? We have tried to explain that in this post.

https://preview.redd.it/i0yk7qraqkw41.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=963dc18551d2900bca456bfa3a6cfd3636c7c93c

### 1. Lack of Segwit Address Support

This is the most painful problem for our service. To receive cryptocurrency we use segwit addresses by default. If a customer contacts our support, we can of course change an address in an order to P2SH (the one that begins with number ""3""), but it reduces the usability of the service. Why don't we use P2SH by default? It is less beneficial both for us and for our client, as the cost of the consolidation of the transaction is taken into account when calculating the exchange rate. With a high network load and with orders for a small amount, the commission becomes significant. To compare — segwit addresses (or Bech32 that starts with ""bc1"") are **15%** more [advantageous](https://fixedfloat.com/blog/guides/bitcoin-address-formats) than P2SH.

Segwit (Segregated Witness) was activated in 2017. At the end of the same year the CEO of Blockchain.info [announced](https://twitter.com/OneMorePeter/status/930834407522488321) its support starting from (most likely) 2018. We can understand certain fears at the beginning of the way, as the company's security system is for sure not that bad. However more than 2 years have passed since then and that is a lot for the crypto world.

### 2. Using Legacy (P2PKH) Addresses Only

As of now only a P2PKH address (that starts with number ""1"") is used in the Blockchain.com wallet to receive cryptocurrency. Why is that bad? It is [unfavorable](https://fixedfloat.com/blog/guides/bitcoin-address-formats) for the users of this wallet. They spend **29%** more than those using P2SH addresses.

### 3. Confusion with PAX and USD Digital

Changing the names of the currencies from one to another only in a Blockchain.com wallet is a rather strange decision. The key problem is that nowhere in the wallet are there any clues that this is an ERC-20 PAX token on the Ethereum blockchain. New wallet users will most likely be confused by this.

We sometimes get questions: ""do we have USD Digital to buy or to sell?"" and our technical support is forced to explain that it is PAX.

### 4. Incompetence of mobile application developers

In fact, this post was inspired by this particular problem. We will not focus on performance or shortcomings, we will just tell you about the main issue.

It is worth starting with questions. What problem does a mobile application solve when a person needs to pay for something? What is the best way to fill in the recipient address and the payment amount on the smartphone? Answer: **QR code**.

Scanning the QR code in this application is done not just badly, but also in such a way that creates maximum number of problems for a user.

The fact is that in the Android application when scanning code with the `bitcoin:&lt;address&gt;?amount=&lt;amount&gt;`, the value of the amount to be inserted in the corresponding field may differ from the encoded value by 1-100 Satoshi! Our team simply does not understand how this was implemented.

Do not believe? Try it yourself. Amount to insert — **0.00143452 BTC**

[bitcoin:3LAxDr5CxwBJT4tCejV8rpAXETz7bUH3tG?amount=0.00143452](https://i.redd.it/emy5pl40qkw41.gif)

After receiving information on such a problem from our users, we began to monitor updates to this application. After 2 updates had come out, the problem was not fixed.

And what about iOS? When scanning a QR code with a sum in iOS , the sum value is simply not inserted into the field! No comments. Bravo!

Blockchain.com wallet has different currencies, not just **Bitcoin**. Let's try **Ethereum**. You want to scan QR codes for Ethereum payment with the relevant sum? There is no such possibility. The application will respond with an ""*Invalid address*"" to all such codes:

* `eth:&lt;address&gt;?amount=&lt;amount&gt;`
* `ether:&lt;address&gt;?amount=&lt;amount&gt;`
* `ethereum:&lt;address&gt;?amount=&lt;amount&gt;`

For **BitcoinCash**, the task of identifying the amount in the line is also an impossible task. Line with wallet `bitcoincash:qpk0689rt3xkzlw8ap4yy72amp2zpws6zujkcgavpt`  
 considered true, but with the amount `bitcoincash:qpk0689rt3xkzlw8ap4yy72amp2zpws6zujkcgavpt?amount=0.1` — ""*Invalid address*""

But there are applications that understand all such formats, or at least one of them. The string parsing function is pretty trivial and should not be a problem for the developer.

This article has been written based on the experience of using the application of the members of our team (who have used it for many years) and our users.

We encourage Blockchain.com to fix at least 3 of the 4 problems that we covered in this article. We still hope that the company will work on the bugs and will earn back trust of its users.

In the meantime — use [other applications](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption)! ;)

In a time where cryptocurrency will revolutionise the entire financial industry, Bitcoin being the very first of its kind, just like Action Comics #1 was a few cents when it was first introduced. No-one thought much of it, but then years later comic books started to be popularised with far more variety (like alt coins now). 

Nowadays you have comic books with better print, artwork and quality than the founding comics however what makes the first set of comics such as these so valuable is how it influenced culture as well as reflected it.

Bitcoin doesn't need to be the best at making lots of payments and on the cheap in a real world case to have value, even if we have alt coins that are better in every way compared to bitcoin, bitcoin will always have value because it is the first of it's kind, and there will only ever be 21 million of them, with 17 million already being HODLed from early adopters to current owners.",1588511794,7,1

What does this mean in combination with (emphasis mine)

 &gt;*  **Note that this constant is *not* the total money supply, which in Bitcoin currently happens to be less than 21,000,000 BTC for various reasons**, but  rather a sanity check. As this sanity check is used by consensus-critical validation code, the exact value of the MAX_MONEY constant is consensus critical; in unusual circumstances like a(nother) overflow bug that allowed for the creation of coins out of thin air modification could lead to a fork.

Firstly sell orders as I understand these are a future price that a trader can set automatically to sell at a certain price point, I also think that this is also called a long position as the trader is looking at future gain.

But I also understand that fake sell walls can be put and so I understand this is to stop the price rising so the traders can buy more Crypto at lower level prices, yet I’m confused why they want to subdue the price as in why not just let it go higher and higher as surely that is a self for filling prophecy?

Now as regards short selling is this pushing the price down by also placing orders in respect to lower prices.

gepu4c,babyass,A practical proposition to naturally make bitcoin better.,"So I thought of an idea, if bitcoin has introduced the key concept of mining and exchanging gold into the internet, how about making also the concept of minting into coin with weight and purity also to it too? Like gold or silver, when we mine them we weight mined raw metal in grams or ounce and each little rocks have different purity. Those raw metal do have value but still is hard to transact with them (I believe we are like in this situation for bitcoin; we mine satoshis and the fees and price are constantly fluctuating.). To make economic exchange of those raw metal easy, we mint the raw metals into coins in a standard size, weight and purity. 

Example the 1 oz 22 karats American Eagle gold coin. 22 Karat mean the coin has 91.67% pure gold and 8.33% is impurity. How about we present the equivalent concept for Bitcoin, we imagine a virtual coin with defined purity and weight? If we agree a virtual coin unit, let's call it vBTC, have always 0.2% average fee, and from that calculate the weight of 1 vBTC in satoshi?

The time writing this the price of bitcoin is 8,915.00 USD and the average fee is around 2.41 USD/TX or 27,500 satoshi/TX that 1 vBTC will have the weight of 27,500/0.002 = 13,750,000 satoshis value $1,223.09. And each day or bloc that weight go down or go up according to the network load. (here I chose the 0.2% fee because we can use sub unit, like 0.01 vBTC which have 20% fee if we desire it in the first bloc. or let it 0.2% if to be on any bloc) And when I send you a 1 vBTC, I don't worry about fees if is high or low, or if my coin will be in the block or not. 1 vBTC will always be in the next block. If a seller set a price in vBTC, like a software for 2.5 vBTC, if the network is loaded or not, if the price is up or down it doesn't matter. When I receive 2.5 vBTC, I know I own 99.8% of that and i will receive it at the next 10min.

We can do this without changing anything in the bitcoin protocol. It's just a virtual layer between us bitcoin users. This way we can separate the link between bitcoin and USD and all those prices speculators in those centralized exchange platforms. And use bitcoin as a way of exchange, not an asset that we just hold and wait the day it hit the moon.

Yet there is still another stunning thing we can do with that vBTC. It can solve the price fluctuation nightmare of bitcoin.

The time writing this 1 vBTC is 13,750,000 satoshis which is $1,223.09 and 1oz 22K American Eagle gold coin is around $1,766.50, which are approximately the similar level of value. How about if we say that 1 vBTC possess the same intrinsic value as a 1 oz of 22K gold coin? Like anywhere and anytime 1 vBTC can always be exchanged to 1oz of 22K gold coin? And we always transact 1 vBTC as was real 1oz 22K gold on internet?

It's a very hard to understand at first glance, but allow me to explain. Right now, the price of normal BTC is set by the law of supply and demand in those multiple centralized exchange platforms. If there is more buyers than sellers, the price go up, and if there is more sellers than buyers, the price go down. But that supply and demand system is already present on the vBTC. If there is more demand (load) on the network the average fees go up and the weight of 1 vBTC in satoshis go up too. If there is less, the fees go down and the weight of 1 vBTC go down too. So if we simply agree that 1 vBTC = 1 oz 22K Gold, the bitcoin network by itself will do all the work and converge to the perfect weight to accommodate that value equality at that exact time. And that without letting speculator decide the price of it in a fiat currency on those centralized exchange platforms.

This will be revolutionary. There will be no speculation what so ever, and no pricing in a Fiat currency and no anxious holding until hit the moon. We can see bitcoin as simple coins and we can price our goods and services as old time when gold minted coins was introduced. And this doesn't require any change in bitcoin protocol. All it needs is only we put the vBTC denomination into wallets and we all bitcoin users have the faith that 1 vBTC = 1 oz 22K Gold or arround that, and the bitcoin network will do the magic by itself.

Furthermore, this is a good way to make minting of real physical 1 vBTC in real 1oz 22K gold possible, and exchange as it was real bitcoins we touch with hands. 

I will seek first to perform some excel spreadsheet calculation of the above. As the weight variation of vBTC (0.2% fees) since 2011 and price of each 1 vBTC in 1 oz Gold since 2011 then share it here.",1588790609,9,1

geolfm,shiznt,"Art for Bitcoin, but is Bitcoin for Art?","Hello all in here. Forgive me if this post is a little off topic... I haven't looked in on the bitcoin subs for a while since moderating r/BitcoinMarkets back in 2014 (hi to anyone in here from back then). I exited BTC a day or two before Gox went down, and aside from looking in on the crypto space occasionally I've more or less been detached.

A little background... I originally entered BTC/LTC somewhere in 2012. In late 2013 I opened up an art studio/gallery in the PRC (where I'd already been living for 3 years), juggling my time between that and day-trading. When I eventually exited (crypto) in 2014 I decided to devote full focus to my studio practice, holding true to that decision again in 2017 when a group of 'investors' invited me back in prior to the run-up. That for me personally remains a good decision, though I have to say it's been great seeing everything unfold within crypto generally to present day.

The reason I'm posting is that I would really love to auction off a (very relevant) piece of artwork for BTC (only) ahead of the halving, but in spite of some fair research I've been unable to find any platforms or outlets that would allow me to do this with any sufficient exposure, and I'm purposefully looking to see if this is a viable prospect outside of traditional means. Any feedback and/or suggestion from this community would be greatly appreciated, particularly from anyone with a personal interest in (physical) art, who like me may be wondering why this arena hasn't been explored further than appears.  The only real momentum within this realm as far as I can tell has been the authentication of artworks and ownership via blockchain, and even this appears limited in its adoption.

Here's a look at the artwork in question: https://imgur.com/gallery/MlKUR5j The image itself was put together in 2011 when it seemed all anyone wanted to talk about was the Chinese economy. I'd designed the image on my then office desktop, the very same desktop I would be day-trading from a few months later. This canvas was one of the final pieces to come out of my China studio before exiting last year. FYI: starting price on this is ₿ 0.8

Again apologies if this appears a little off topic, but I did very much want to see if anyone here had any further insight into the crypto/art space, since as I say previously it has eluded me somewhat thus far, and maybe I'm missing something...

Another headline we are going to talk about is those who invested their stimulus checks into Bitcoin are currently up more than 35%. It sounds like they made a wise investment.

The plan didn't pan out, so 2000 years later God set plan B in motion through the prophet Satoshi, still anonymous to this day. God gave us Bitcoin to end the perpetual wars enabled by the ability to create infinite debt through the use of Fiat currency. Endless wars and suffering can be brought to a halt if through the gospel of Satoshi, we spread the good news about Bitcoin, the new covenant and the plan for peace and prosperity for people world wide.

gkjdil,Ghostcarapace3,DO NOT TRUST BROWSER BASED WALLETS.,"So, I saw a post by someone asking for feedback on a website with a name suspiciously familiar to bitstamp. Basically asking for feedback on a browser based wallet. 

A browser based website \*CANNOT\* be peer reviewed in a meaningful way. You have no way to check the hashes of the server side software that serves up the html and javascript. You \*could\* peer review the javascript, but it would entail an addon that recalculates the hash of the website everytime it is served. 

Why can't websites be peer reviewed meaningfully? Let's say I publish the source code of my website, but I have a function called loadscripts(). That loadscripts function is called all the time normally. All I have to do is pass in one little modification for it to load scripts only for certain users, but for other users with the right cookies to load malicious scripts. You see why it is so dangerous from a technical standpoint? No! 

Do not store your keys on a website. They are even less secure than exchanges like coinbase. At least coinbase has a financial incentive to stay honest and secure themselves as best they can. They will rob you and steal your lunch on transaction fees, but they will be up front about it. Whenever a website isn't nickel and diming you on every transaction... watch out. You are the product at that point, and they ARE operating with a financial end goal in mind.",1589583131,9,3

gkfsxh,tob23ler,Question about potential hyperinflation of USD in relation to BTC,"The idea of hyperinflation of the USD confuses me in terms of the use case for btc as a store of value.

Everyone knows that the usd has been the top global currency for quite sometime.  Because of this, when another currency hyperinflates in places like Venezuela, Greece, Lebanon, Iran, etc. it makes sense when people use btc as a store of wealth. A safe haven for their assets. Essentially it's a quick and easy digital conversion that doesn't need any shady govt or bankster middlemen.

Good. Great. Grand.

But what happens when/if the world's top currency hyperinflates? What use is there to swap your wealth into something like btc when the fiat currencies you would need to transact in for daily regular items (food, rent, bills, clothes) is skyrocketing out of control?

Unless a lot of crypto infrastructure develops that currently doesn't exist in the majority of places, a hyperinflated American Dollar seems like a problem even for those happily holding btc.

So if btc hits $1,000,000 but bread in Walmart costs $200 usd, what's the benefit?

If I'm in Venezuela in 2019 and see my currency go to shit, i see the benefit of btc because i can compare it to the world's top dollar. When the world's top dollar has the same issue, i can't see that same upwards conversion safety.

I locked my account on Thursday, and sent a msg to coinbase support.  Friday I got a reply saying they would look into it. Wednesday support got back to me telling me how to unlock my account.

I understand the centralization concerns but if you look at graphs you can see that storage costs have gone down exponentially. Bandwidth costs have also gone down.

I don't see any good reason that the block size must be kept as low as it is. A small increase of a few mb would do an incredible amount of good for the network, and wouldn't cause any concerning damage to decentralization. I'd like to hear your thoughts.

ggo9tp,ElephantGlue,Bitcoin’s values isn’t just about scarcity of the coins themselves,"First, let me just preface this by saying that I’m posting this as a jumping off point for a discussion on how you see bitcoin evolving in the future, and none of what I’m writing here I’m absolutely sure of happening.

That being said, I believe that an aspect of bitcoin that we’ll see become more of a talking point in the future is that base layer transactions are necessarily scarce themselves.

This means that (in my opinion), at a certain point, people will have to onboarded to bitcoin via a purely second layer transaction.

While that may sound bad to people who see other crypto as ‘superior’ to bitcoin, it’s actually a huge benefit to Bitcoin’s massive monetary policy and security advantage it has over everything else.

This is because it will force market makers to fund LN with more and more liquidity. This, in turn means that market makers will have to cooperate with each other in order to minimize on chain fees and maximize the efficiency of all transactions that occur on the blockchain.

Once this happens, ‘spikes’ in on chain fees will happen much more rarely, and will mostly be due to periods of time where lightning liquidity is increasing and the spread is very high which is good for the market maker. However, the true price of on chain transactions will start to emerge as a function of funding LN channels.

Thus, increases in the liquidity and use of the lightning network will actually be beneficial for market makers making the on chain transactions, in addition to the miners confirming those transactions.

The increase of transaction cost fees for makers will necessarily have to be less than the profit margin for the spread in order for them to want to add liquidity to LN, so this itself becomes a self reinforcing cycle;

More direct LN adoption by bitcoin users &gt;&gt; increased requirement for LN liquidity &gt;&gt; market makers ensuring profits &gt;&gt; higher on chain fees &gt;&gt; more miners securing the network to collect higher fees &gt;&gt; higher relative price of bitcoin due to increased security and more miners participating &gt;&gt; more direct LN adoption by users because of how expensive on chain transactions are",1589060271,2,1

20-year U.S. treasures rank as the second-best performing asset with a 21.1% year-to-date (YTD) gain, followed by gold with 12.5%, and U.S. treasuries with 8.9%.

gggucv,Ghostcarapace3,What prevents this theoretical time travel attack?,"So, let's say I start with ten state of the art mining rig. However, these mining rigs have something a bit special. They all have their time sped up by a factor of 1000.

Then, I replay the entire bitcoin transaction history from the main chain through these rigs, the only difference being that the proof of work is time dilated by a factor of 1000, and as a result, the difficulty never goes up and overwhelms my machines. 

The time dilation is not known by the blockchain, or by the machines verifying the blockchain. To the machines, every second, ten minutes has passed. I construct my fake blockchain up to the point I want to, and then I start introducing transactions I want, like making one of my machines a miner. Keep in mind that this fake blockchain has almost all of the same transactions as the real blockchain. It is a longer blockchain. Its internal timestamps are valid. The only difference is that this blockchain never had its difficulty adjustment go up in its entire life. 

Then... I release this blockchain to the world. It IS the longer chain. How do nodes know to reject this chain?",1589036374,19,1

giklcz,diostrio,Why I’m an idiot and hardware wallets are important,"So yesterday I was updating apps on my Ledger Nano X (which I very much enjoy) via Bluetooth and my phone when something went wrong. As it was updating the Ethereum app (I know this is a BTC sub but bear with me, the lesson is the same) along with some others, my phone went into sleep mode as I went to a different room. This stalled the update and thus removed the app from the ledger entirely. 

Thinking this was my main ETH wallet, I scrambled to re-access my funds with the recovery phrase. That process wasn’t too hard after looking into it, so I recovered with seed phrase and went to try and access my ETH account through the Ledger Nano X. I set up a small transaction to see if the recovery worked and my keys remained intact. My heart sank as the transaction failed due to an error message saying something to the effect of “wrong device...” 

Keep in mind this was not a wallet with a huge amount or anything, but for me it was quite a bit of money. Obviously I was risking what I can afford to lose.... but to lose it like that? On such an important day in crypto history? Fuck that was gonna hurt....

In my panic I started to think about the wallets I own... I tried another one, same error message. Then I remembered.... I have a Nano S elsewhere in the house.... I run to grab it.

I plug that shit in and try one more time. Success. Incredible relief. But still, years of my life for the incredible 15-20 minutes of stress I had to endure to realize what a stupid mistake I made. Thankfully it cost me nothing because hardware wallets are designed for these types of circumstances.

Lessons learned - always keep track of which accounts belong to what hardware wallet. I know this sounds obvious and makes me look totally stupid but it can save you a lot of anxiety if you’re like me and have 20+ accounts on 4-6 hardware wallets. 

Another lesson is don’t update Ledger apps from a phone over Bluetooth, as the phone going into sleep mode (or whatever you wanna call it) will disrupt the update and cost you some time recovering from seed.

The last lesson is very simple: don’t panic, if you are educated in how these wallets work, there’s really no need to worry that you can’t recover funds. Oh, and make sure you have the right fucking wallet associated with whatever funds you’re trying to access.

I have only needed to recover a device from seed 1 time, being last night. And now I feel amazingly confident that I will be able to access my funds no matter what happens to the device, as long as I safely store and hide the seed phrase from potential theft.

I hope my story of complete stupidity and jackassery will help save someone else from the dread experienced when you think you’ve lost some valuable BTC or ETH. 


PS: I love Ledgers. I also own and really enjoy the KeepKey (that I got for $5... that’s a steal, if anyone has anything negative to say about them I’d be interested in hearing it though) and Shapeshift platform. Don’t own a Trezor and probably won’t ever, but I’d be curious to know why you think I should try that if you think it’s better.",1589318128,11,1

Most people expected some sort of fall off so this is interesting. My thought is that along as the price remains high than lower grade miners will stay on the network because it is profitable. However, if the price fall we can expect the lower grade miners to shutdown because it is no longer profitable. 

So either the miners will help keep the price of Bitcoin high by not selling their coins. Or, the lower grade miners will need to sell, price falls, they go off line, ect.

Once the low grade miners fall off the hash rate will fall and difficulty will lower. This will lead to better miners making more money, and having to sell less Bitcoin to mine. This will lead to price rising and lower grade miners maybe getting back into the game.

gii5kx,Sele81,Trezor or Ledger? And how to get my forks Bitcoin Cash / Gold / SV??,"Hi,

my bitcoin is on a paper wallet for years now. Finally I want to get BCash, BGold and BSV and also want to move the Bitcoin (and the other forks) to a hardware wallet. I try to learn how to do it and want to minimize the risks. I have following questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Wich Hardware Wallet is more safe? I read that there COULD BE a risk that Ledger makers could have a backdoor in the device to access coins? Trezor is open source no? Is it more safe?
2. Did I understood correctly that if I want to get (claim?) my bitcoin cash from the BTC fork, before I do that, I should move my bitcoin from the paper wallet to a new wallet and claim my bcash after moving my bitcoin to the new wallet? So if the paper wallet is empty, I still can claim my bcash and bgold?
3. Is Exodus on Mac safe to do this? Or is there a risk of viruses etc.? I dont have installed any weird software on my mac. But for example I have stuff like better touch tool etc. I remember when I created my Paper Wallet, on bitcointalk they told me to use a PC that will never be connected to the internet again. I used a fresh windows install, created my paper wallet and partitionited and formatted the hard disk.
4. Is [exodus.io](https://exodus.io) the real website/source? On [this](https://medium.com/@nesterenkoi565/how-to-sweep-for-bitcoin-cash-and-bitcoin-sv-on-exodus-wallet-7021c68d66a) website they are linking to [exodusupdate.com](https://exodusupdate.com) what made me curious.
5. I just realized, question 3 is not important, if the method in question 2 is correct? So first I would send my Bitcoin from the paper wallet to the Ledger or Trezor. And then claim my Bcash/BGold in Exodus and sent Bcash/Bgold from Exodus to the Ledger or Trezor right?",1589310877,4,1

gihn4v,Stokvisss,Give your best argument on the question: Is the halving priced in?,"My argument (**don't read before drafting your own argument**, might or might not create a bias):

&gt;!I think the halving is not priced in because of a narrative on the selling pressure of miners set forth below.!&lt;

&gt;!Because of the cost of mining most miners are willing to sell their Bitcoin after mining, and those who keep their Bitcoin are therefore parting with the USD on the electricity costs et cetera. Most miners will probably sell everything because they are just in the business or sell just enough to break even and keep some Bitcoin as a reward. Thus; there will always be a given selling pressure which, after the halving does get impacted, since the block reward goes down and miners earn less, which forces them to sell a bigger share of the mined coins. The halving could also drive some miners out of business due to unprofitability, making other miners more profitable because they get a bigger piece of the pie. You could argue that these miners will now be able to sell more of their proceeds again, but that extra selling would probably not amount to the selling pressure pre-halving.!&lt;

&gt;!Because of this selling pressure not being the same as the pre-halving selling pressure, I think the halving systematically can't be priced in. This is liable to an important shortcoming however. If the BTC price were to be above the price equilibrium before the halving, price could still dump.!&lt;

&gt;!Please prove me wrong with argumentation if u differ from my thinking, and let me know what you think. :)!&lt;",1589309432,10,1

gigrtg,JakeTheCryptoKing,BTC Blast Off or Major Miner Capitulation?!?!,"Does BTC absolutely explode from here or are we about to see major miner capitulation?

We already know the new block reward being halved makes many older miners obsolete at current BTC pricing. Therefore, BTC needs to pump 30% to just under $12,000 or miners will end up turning off their equipment and selling their BTC.

What determines if miners capitulate forcing the price lower in the short term or if the price rises keeping their equipment relevant? Either way these lower tier miners will eventually capitulate as newer technology is released (which it already is). 

It is likely we see BTC mirror the stock market actions over the course of summer. I do expect to see a major pullback but predicting it to a specific day is near impossible. The prior 2 halvings saw chop and drops for the 2 months that followed the halving.

This 3rd halving should be no different. Our economy is in more turmoil than ever in BTC's history and currently the economy is pumping. When this 'collapse' occurs based on a 40% drop in GDP (Q2) or historic unemployment numbers it is likely the shockwaves can be felt through the blockchain and BTC landscape.

It is my opinion that miners of lower tech specs will eventually capitulate. I believe this being timed with an economic down turn could lead to a major drop in BTC price in the coming months. I am not saying SHORT today, but I am saying make sure to have cash (fiat) on the sidelines ready to deploy if we have the opportunity to buy cheap BTC.",1589307045,4,1

But why would you (people in general) believe bitcoin is the currency of the future. I can 100% see crypto being the currency of the future but that's it. Which one it would be is impossible to know. There are already many different cryptos out there, anyone of them could win out. Or there might be others in the future that come out on top. The main argument for bitcoin would be that everyone has at least heard of bitcoin (it's main stream) vs the others.

What if you take the fact that there are only 21 million coins of bitcoin but the world population is always growing, sure you can split whole bitcoins up but what if people don't like that. Why 21? why millions not billions?...you could easily set up a marketing campaign against bitcoin on that point.

Or the fact that the point of cryptocurrency is to decentralize money, make things more even, but let say bitcoin does become the currency of the future, everyone who invested in it early on would already have a head start and therefore be pretty powerful. So you could campaign/argue against bitcoin on that point also.

Right now in my small mining farm I have online 2 Innosilicon S11, one Antminer A3 (All 3 mining a Blake2b coin that I've invested in), 4 Innosilicon A10 and from late 2017 till mid 2019 I had 5 Antminer S9 (14Th/s batches) running.

In these days I was thinking if it is worth buying the upcoming Antminer S19 Pro from Bitmain, since as of today (19 May, 2020) with the current difficulty and price, the profit with that ASIC sits around 2,00USD/day (Assuming the power cost is 0,10USD per Kw). Also to keep in mind these new Antminers haven't been delivered yet, so the difficulty will rise even more.

In my opinion, unless the minimum BTC price rises to at least the 20.000-30.000USD range, getting the S19Pro is not a great investment. What do you guy think? I'd like to hear your opinions as well.",1589841611,5,1

gq8f1b,Suheilaaita,Mining Companies Seize Mining Bitcoin due to unprofitability? Your views.,"Hello People,

&amp;#x200B;

Was going over some Publicly listed companies that mine cryptocurrencies and came through this chart below:

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: Hive Blockchain Technologies LTD; Coinmarketcap.com; blockchain.com](https://preview.redd.it/2lf891vdvv051.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=400e6a940d2de5a1f407727b203bf02b54fa9699)

In their Corporate presentation, it was written that they have seized mining bitcoin, mainly due to mining costs that became higher than the reward (un-profitability). Is this something that raises concern over the price and value of a bitcoin? and is this a trend between large mining facilities? 

If this is is yet to a be trend at this moment, won't it become one in the next 4,8,12, etc years as more and more halvings are due?

Ignoring other factors, it seems imminent that either bitcoin price skyrockets to match the costs to buy bitcoin, or it flats out mainly due to miners moving towards altcoins because bitcoin just became too expensive to mine. If the latter happens, then, well, bitcoin transactions won't be processed and it becomes more or less useless.

I am just thinking out loud here, and not trying to be a pessimist or an optimist. What are your views on the matter?

TLDR: Large-scale mining companies seize mining BTC, is this a trend? If BTC doesn't price doesn't accommodate the cost to mine, then BTC price might go flat. Do you agree, or disagree? Why?

She basically shit on Bitcoin security and said exchanges can be hacked, but she didn't understand what a hard wallet was when I tried to explain. Then she said the government will step in and take it over. I explained how the decentralization aspect is essentially the core of Bitcoin and that the government can't just come in and change that and that that's why Bitcoin is so special. This seemed over her heard. Then she proceeded to tell me it was just a ponzi scheme held up by market manipulation and will eventually crash when the market manipulators want it to. Finally, she said she when she heard about it in 2017 she assumed a Bitcoin would be worth 400 dollars max right now. I calmly tried to explain these things to her and it was in one ear out the other.

To make a long story short, he was a gold and silver investor whose funds were managed by an advisor of his. At the time, the portfolio was diversified by adding Bitcoin to the portfolio as a hedge. 

This advisor claims these funds are no longer available and that they were used for medical bills for a relative of his. My relative may pursue damages but judging by the value of BTC today versus what he most likely obtained it for in 2014, I fear he will will lose a very, very SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I suggested that any legal recourse he takes includes specific verbiage requesting the blockchain address that holds/held the funds in order to potentially trace where the money was sent. Should this include financial documentation noting the date with which his funds were sold?

I’m seeking additional advice that would assist in collecting this money, or give the slightest indication as to how much BTC he was holding at the time.

goeuug,JunoReactorFan,Year 2019 is the ultimate proof Bitcoin price is almost 100% TA and almost 0% fundamental,"Hi,

This is an unpopular opinion, yet when I look at 2019, there was really not much happening that year maybe apart from some stuff related to the ETF? Forgive me if wrong but I can't remember any big news that year. And what did the price do? Well remember:

\- 3k

\-13.5k

\-6.5k

Absolutely no fundamental explains this. These are massive price moves caused by supply and demand and nothing else.

I mean, Bitcoin right now is a much better project that it was in 2017, transactions are faster and cheaper, yet Bitoin price was worth almost 20k at the end of 2017, now it is worth 9k while the product is objectively better.

Again, this is not driven by fundamentals. 

I started this thread because I read recently that the 50 BTC moved by an old miner caused the current dump. I really doubt it. But people who bought coins hoping the halvening would boost the price, try to find a logic behind this move.

Actually, the charts are quite clear, downtrend since Dec 2017 is still going with big resistance (10.5k) too tough to break. 

Bitcoin is a heaven for traders. The moves are so sharp and so quick, buying near a well known support, selling near a well known resistance generates profit. 

Last but not least, those (especially big Youtube channels) who recommended to invest in BTC because of the halvening, should refund the money of the naive investors who will probably sell soon because BTC is heading to 5.5k, possibily 3.5k this year. Of course they won't, it's just a matter of speech but I wonder if they have any remorse.",1590132971,11,1

goddiz,brianddk,Making the case for the Layer-2 Maximalists,"I was in a debate with the Pro/Con on layer-2 and I think I ended up making a better case for it then I intended.  Though you guys might like to read it

***

Although I don't really think the maximalist argument hold water, I can try to make the case.  I used to work with one of the major banks and clearing houses listed below, so that will be most of my lens of observation.

&gt; The lightning network, and scalability... I just cannot accept that 7 transactions per second [TPS] will be scalable in the future. 

A lot of the blockstream development may reference some of the unique environment of US banking.  In US Banking there is a similarly layered approach.  At the lowest layer you have the Federal Reserve.  This is literally a bank for banks.  Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, they all have accounts at the Fed.  When you (banking at Chase) write a check to a plumber (banking at Wells) that will eventually be converted to a Fed transfer from Chase to Wells.  Since nothing is free at the Fed, these banks batch these transfers through something called ""Clearing Houses"" where checks get bundled and (used to be) physically exchanged.

So to reproduce the antiquated US banking system, you would need the Fed Bank-to-Bank layer (Layer-1) and the Visa, ACH, Check, POS layer (Layer-2).  We all know that Visa / Mastercard handle 25,000 TPS and perhaps we can take it on faith that bitcoin-layer-2 (lightning / liquid) can handle this.  The question becomes, ""How many TPS does the federal reserve (us-banking-layer-1) support?"".  Although no one knows, the [last reported data](https://web.archive.org/web/20170727215242/https://www.frbservices.org/operations/fedwire/fedwire_funds_services_statistics.html) (2017) shows about 5.7 TPS ^(\(15,000,000_tran_per_month * 12_months / 365_days / 24_hours / 60_min / 60_sec\)).  Furthermore, this level has been pretty unchanging for the last 7 years that the statistics are gathered.

Therefore, from a maximalist point of view, if bitcoin-layer-1 can support 7.0 TPS, then it can easily meet parity with the us-banking-layer-1.  This assumes you believe that bitcoin-layer-2 can support 25 kTPS like Visa/Mastercard do

That's probably the strongest argument I could make if I wanted to support the maximalist point of view.  In that sense it seems feasible to argue that bitcoin can achieve parity with us-banking-layer-1 and us-banking-layer-2.

To take the minimalist view, I would argue that the 5.7 TPS for bank-layer-1 is over 4 years old and perhaps the new number is much much higher.  Also argue that US banking is the exact thing that cryptocurrency was supposed to be unlike.  US banking relies on centralization, so modeling bitcoin after it is unwise.",1590125427,3,1

gobj06,the420chronicler,For all the haters who don't think Bitcoin has intrinsic value,"An intrinsic theory of value (also called theory of objective value) is any theory of value in economics which holds that the value of an object, good or service, is intrinsic, meaning that it can be estimated using objective measures.

Most such theories look to the process of producing an item, and the costs involved in that process, as a measure of the item's intrinsic value.... Bitcoin is without a doubt a never-ending process that seeks to produce tokens that underpin a highly secure score-keeping system

One could argue that Bitcoin satisfies every major intrinsic theory of value that there is:

Labor Theory of Value - Proof of Work

Exchange theory of value - Bitcoin protocol facilitates trustless and censorship resistant exchange

Monetary theory of value - Bitcoin is a token/symbol of value

Power theory of value - Bitcoin is political money in the sense that it decentralizes politics, where politics involves making decisions that apply to groups aka organized control over a human community

The Subjective theory of value - Different people choose Bitcoin for different reasons, value is in the eye of the beholder

Bitcoin seems to fit into every theoretical framework...

Let's call Bullshit on Exchanges for not supporting SegWit in the only way that they will notice.

**Boycott Exchanges until SegWit.**

The anti-SegWit decision by the world’s biggest exchanges **contributes** unnecessarily to enormous mempool spikes and fees such as what is happening NOW.

Here are reasons that Exchanges are anti-SegWit:

* a preference for crypto to remain on exchange rather than be withdrawn. Small transaction adjustments have large effects on behaviour.
* more reasons to support the Token Launch Platform to solve problems by first generation currencies like Bitcoin.
* people much smarter than me will add to this list no doubt.

Let’s relentlessly start posting and liking and generally getting pissed at Exchanges about lack of SegWit support!

Blockstream Node Block Count Discrepancy - Again,"Hello all, I'm noticing that yet again my personal node (run on a Windows 10 machine) is substantially lagging what Blockstream dot info shows as the current block count.  The other day when I first posted about this I wrote this off as I had just rebooted my machine and thought that perhaps that this was simply something that was due to the last few blocks being verified or that perhaps my node wasn't connected to enough other nodes.  Neither of which is the case today as my node has been up and running now for well over 24 hours and as of last check it had &gt; 80 connected nodes yet I see that my personal node shows that it's currently stuck at block number 631247 vs. Blockstreams node at 631249.

I’m sorry if any of my questions doesn’t make sense but I’m trying to learn about this.

What would be the best choice for buying BTC, exchanging BTC for altcoins and storing the altcoins? I’m looking for the cheapest and simplest way to do things but I’d also like to know what would be the best way regardless.

A) Buy BTC on Coinbase/Gemini/Abra, exchanging for altcoins there and storing it there.

B) Buy BTC on Binance/KuCoin/BitTrex/Crypto.com, exchanging for altcoins and storing it there.

C) Buy BTC/ETH on a wallet like Trust/MEW/Blockchain/JAXX, exchange it for altcoins and store it there.

D) Buy BTC on Coinbase/Gemini/Abra, exchange it on Binance/KuCoin/Bittrex, store it a wallet like Trust/MEW/JAXX 

Finally, which are the better platforms for each step? Which ones would you recommend and which ones would you not recommend? Is there a better process than those that I’ve described? Which one?

go6ds6,Chytrik,There is new a HODLING world champ,"Yesterday there was a transaction that received a lot of attention, as it spent the coinbase reward from a *very* early block. Here is the txID for it: f38d6f043c070ce9805ee81f46db4d32d0c9f148d62bbfbc0378bc5847c7dc70  


Something interesting about this transaction that I haven't seen mentioned much online, is that whoever spent those coins is now officially the HODL world champion! What is meant by this, is that of all now-spent UTXOs, the coinbase reward they spent in that block now holds the record for being the longest-held.   


This is a pretty cool title to hold, the individual who owned that UTXO had been sitting on it since the absolute earliest days of the Bitcoin network. When that block was mined, BTC had no value, beyond fascinating a handful of crypto and computer nerds around the world. When spent, the output was worth almost $500,000 USD. Thats quite the HODL!  


In total, this UTXO was held for 627,404 blocks, which is about 11 years, 3 months, and 11 days.   


For more info, and a list of all the runner ups, see this post on stack exchange: [https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/88517/what-was-the-longest-held-utxo-ever-spent/96055#96055](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/88517/what-was-the-longest-held-utxo-ever-spent/96055#96055)",1590098738,20,7

I like to dip my toes in various sorts of trading investments and securities. With the latest halving, I see a great buying opportunity before it's next bull run leading into 2021. I am so confident in this taking off to another level, I am ready to make what some would call a speculative approach on buying bitcoin. So here I am, a relatively broke, college student, whose only source of income really has been trading stocks on exchanges. I plan on selling almost my entire portfolio by the end of the summer, along with my dirt bike that I never ride anymore, and even picking up a small 1-2 year loan. I know many say don't invest with money you do not have, but honestly I feel that investing a $2-3k loan in the next month or two into bitcoin, it is actually probably the SMARTEST thing I can do, if I had a small loan. Keep in mind, I already am debt-free coming out of college, thanks to my scholarships. I can also easily pay this off upon college graduation in 2021, so I am not worried about those financial pressures whatsoever. But I believe by the time I have a full time job, the a bitcoin will be at-least double or triple what it is now, making the small loan actually much much more valuable in terms of the times-value of money. Based off my analysis, these last few months are potentially the last buying opportunity in my lifetime, to reach an entire bitcoin before it really takes off. I strongly believe I may never have the opportunity of securing that kind of weight in bitcoin again in my life, and I am willing to do what it takes to be a member of the 21 million club (or even more than that). I am not suggesting anyone follow my approach, but for me, I think that it is the smartest thing I can invest in, the smartest thing to take a small, payable loan out for as a college student. I would lime to know other's opinions on this, as well.

gs3stx,tookthisusersoucant,What protections does Bitcoin have against a split in the network?,"disclaimer: This is not supposed to be FOMO, it is a thought exercise.

I had a bit of a shower thought, and I'd like to discuss a scenario and what might happen.

Imagine, the internet gets severed for a day. USA has its own internet, the rest of the world has its own internet. The whole tech industry is going mad (Actually, I think this might have actually happened in Australia).

I'm open to hearing reasons why my scenario is impossible btw, but I assume that people might have access to local services and Bitcoin will appear to work normally. So it's a big day for some people since this is the day they get paid, and they get paid in Bitcoin. They get their money, confirm for 3 blocks, and start spending!

Meanwhile, the rest of the world is using a fork of Bitcoin. The next day, the internet is finally restored. Someone actually managed to sync the Bitcoin network a few hours earlier actually using (I dunno) satellites or something. Since they only needed to sync their own node and the rest of the network ate it up immediately.

So the rest of the network synced. The shorter chain dropped and (I think) half of the day's transaction history is lost. What's the impact? Does Bitcoin recover?",1590661894,11,1

gs2f3s,SpiritedOwl3,Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash," 

Although most [cryptocurrency derivatives platforms](http://phemex.com/) deal with Bitcoins, there is another similar asset known as Bitcoin Cash that may confuse some traders. This article will explain some of the reasons for why Bitcoin Cash exists and how it is different from Bitcoin.

Despite all of its revolutionary advantages, Bitcoin still has certain issues and challenges. Perhaps the most glaring of these, is the speed of its transactions. Currently, it can handle about 7 transactions per second, much slower when compared to traditional credit card companies (about 24,000 transactions per second). In order for the system to continue to grow and scale up, many agreed that some changes had to be made.

## The Birth of Bitcoin Cash

As the transaction speed issue became more relevant, a second group within the [Bitcoin community](https://phemex.com/references/articles/bitcoin-vs-bitcoin-cash) grew. One group of course wanted a solution that would allow Bitcoin to scale, while the other group insisted that Bitcoin was never meant to be used for constant transactions. Eventually, through a process called a Hard Fork, the Bitcoin system was split and Bitcoin Cash was born.  This new asset has a block size limit of 8 Mb (while Bitcoin only has 2 Mb) but uses the same code base as its predecessor. Bitcoin Cash allows for around 2 million transactions a day.

## Differences

So now that we have these two options, what are the differences?

Once again because of the increase in block size, not only are more transactions processed per second when using Bitcoin Cash, but these are also cheaper. The new name also makes a difference. The addition of the word ‘cash’ denotes its capabilities as an actual form of currency that can be easily and universally used for common purchases as adoption increases in the future. However, one potential drawback is the risk associated with using Bitcoin Cash at this moment. Where Bitcoin has an incredibly large amount of mining pools (making it difficult to coordinate a 51% attack), Bitcoin Cash has 51% of its network controlled by three mining pools. Addressing the cryptocurrency’s reliance on these three major groups will be a significant challenge the Bitcoin Cash must overcome.

Stay tuned for more blog articles on different concepts and ideas that will improve your knowledge of [Bitcoin Trading](http://phemex.com/).",1590654917,4,1

How likely would it be to happen one day? What effect would it have on Bitcoin in the short and long run? Thanks! :)",1590621739,17,1

grtj0b,DmMeYourBitcoin,"I didn't realize what people meant when they said ""When the time comes, you won't have to sell your Bitcoin"", Until Now:","The one thing people don't realize Bitcoin is for. You can take out loans on it. So in 10 years when you want a house, or duplex, or triplex, or apartment, or business; you can take out low interest rate loans for them with your Bitcoin, and buy that house, or rental property, or business you want. Something you could never do before any other way. This is what Bitcoin does for you. It grants you the net-worth and financial access so you can have the ability to get loans you could never get approval for before. Something as small as 20$ a month for 1 year or more, 10 years from now, can get you a loan for that house, or business you want but could never afford, or get an approved loan for. 

This is also better than selling your bitcoin for a property too. Because chances are, the Bitcoin will be a better investment value wise in the long run, so collateralizing it let's you keep your coin, and get your property, or business. Preferably a rental property, or solid proven business so it pays itself off.",1590617413,100,1

gtvqn1,skz-,I've created a simple file sharing service where you can buy or sell files using lighting network - https://poof.run,"The service is quite simplistic, no registration, just keys that are associated with your funds. Withdraw whenever you want. Sell your files as low as 50 sats. 

There are also some keyboard shortcut keys for convenience (check info icons at the bottom)

It's possible to POST your upload through cli with eg:. curl (yet, as not abused. Or captchas are comming lol). Most of server responses are simple - one sentence - json format so it's easy to parse and do something with it. (except withdrawals)

Keys for funds are not stored on the server, just their hashes, so please don't ask for help if you lose it. It's not recoverable. 

I'm just a hobbyist after all, not the smartest guy in the crypto world (or in general) so please take your earnings as soon as possible to avoid loss in case of hacks or bugs I don't know yet.

At the moment max file size is 50mb but there is a possibility to increase it in the future (servers cost money after all)

Oh, and last but not least, the upload front page works without javascript, it fallbacks to a basic html page without any fanciness.

Any suggestions are welcomed. You can contact me via twitter or on reddit if you run into problems/bugs or just want to talk.

Mastering Bitcoin - Andreas Antonopoulos

The Bitcoin Standard -  Saifedean Ammous

all of which i loved and think should be the first three books anyone reads on bitcoin. They focus on how bitcoin operates, the history and people (2008-2014), and the economic theory, respectfully. I am eagerly awaiting the release of Mastering the Lightning Network which is supposed to release in Q4 2020. Until then, I am left with a desire to read more material about Bitcoin. If there are any books about bitcoins history after 2014 (mainly about hard forks and the development of lightning) i would love to know about them. 

Also, a book needs to be written about the hash wars, if there is not one already. I know it is not directly related to Bitcoin but i find it important and interesting, nonetheless. I feel like there is so much to say. I could read up on some of this stuff from blogs and articles but there is something to be said for the format and polish of books.

gbjioz,GlobalGaol,Era of the free human is almost over,"For nearly 5 billion years, evolution has permitted the competition of nature, where the will of one component of nature attempts to enact its will over another, be it matter natural or biological.

Today, as we spend a gigantic amount of our time attempting to remain free, outside the will of the forces enacted directly and indirectly through the internet and police state. We frequently make the case that we still have choice in the matter, not enabling this, not buying that, etc. Or spending a lot of time removing said technologies from other devices.

What is lost however is that although YOU feel better in the moment, YOU have not done anything to protect the future generations who may not have that choice. Your children, your relatives children, whomever. A freedom fighter of some kind of oppression of tomorrow.

People know today that you can go full Unabomber, but even then, satellites and planes can see what you're up to, whether its the new planes launched over Baltimore. Or its another ""secret"" satellite that we'll find out 10 or 15 years from now has had facial recognition or some ridiculous number of pixels capabilities, the reality is that we are almost no longer a ""free human"".

We now give kids iPads at one year old, we now chip employees today in Wisconsin, we now manufacturer only cars that have Bluetooth. We enact segments of highway only with readers and all kinds of telemetry.

Remember every day that although YOU feel as though YOU have escaped, the tech is creating even less opportunity for your offspring to ever be free. They will not ever be able to hike a mountain, go to their neighbors house, or do something that is not being watched.

The era of the free human is almost over.

In a mere 100 years, we have taken 5 billion years of evolution and put it under a planetary panopticon. And remember every day that although you can still barely slink out under your prison cell door, your kids will have the door shut and may never ever get to open it again.",1588344747,34,1

gbh7sd,Vallenntin,I found a Way to get more out of Bitcoin and get steady profits and wanted to ask about opinions and if someone already knows about Stellarfund:,"&amp;#x200B;

It’s already some months ago since I found **Stellarfund** and i wanted to share my thoughts about this. So It is an Investment fund for Bitcoin and other Altcoins. You basically deposit your money there and other people who’s Job it is to trade, trade for you. Not only this, but  they work with an AI. This is where I got interested in it. Stellarfund gives you a **Daily Profit of 0.6%** of what you invested. 

So as I said I found this in November and tried it out. Since then I got 0.6% daily. On some days only 0.58% but on other days 0.63%. And **even in the Corona Crisis I got my 0.6% daily**. So I gained trust in this and I think it’s a good thing that works out properly. Have you already heard of it and what do you think?

If you want to take a look at it here is the link:  [Stellarfund](https://stellarfund.io/ref/da)",1588336215,12,1

gcl5o7,heronharry1,I need help answering how I messed up here exactly..,"Hello everyone.. Long story short I got back into cryptos about 2 weeks ago..  I had done a bunch of reading on security for it. I invested over $1000 last week, everything was going great. So I had initially bought the BTC off a Canadian exchange Coinberry, that was going great. But I wanted to offload a majority of it into a cold storage paper wallet, and just leave a little play to do some swings on the exchange. So I had created a paper wallet, offline of course, with the site offline and downloaded on my PC. I even unplugged my ethernet cable from my PC.   


So I go ahead and transfer my funds to this wallet, and I realize that it was immediately taken out.. And not only that, but looking at the transaction history of the address, this person had been able to pull this off several times over a few years??? Where did I mess up? Did I download a modified version of the wallet generator website to give a fake wallet? I'm so pissed off right now...",1588483116,54,1

gcjscg,cheez2806,M21GlobalCenter - cryptocurrency website (It may be a SCAM),"I'm making this post as I'm receiving alot of DMs about my situation as people encountering the same thing. I'm very new to this - did alot of searches etc. so this is what I did that may help some people and I did get my money back. I also could be lucky in that they thought if they returned it I might invest more? It wasn't a large amount, I put in 250AUD and got it back. Lost $2 from like transaction fees etc. I'm thinking if I put in more than 250AUD like thousands - perhaps they would just take the money and not respond at all? I'm not sure but here's my two cents worth.

**The potential SCAM website is:** [https://www.m21globalcenter.com](https://www.m21globalcenter.com) 

1. If you have just made a deposit - **call your bank now and talk to them about this. Is there anything they can do to cancel the transfer or something.** 
2. Some people have file police reports too. 
3. Also report the profile on the social media website if you haven't so. I couldn't as I deleted my CMB account one day after I added them on Whatsapp. I got tired of it all so just decided to take a break from it.
4. Block them on Whatsapp or Instagram **after** you have attempted to get your money back. If they message you asking how you are going etc. I still replied so they aren't suspicious that I found out they are scammers.

**Background:** 

I liked a profile on Coffee meets bagel and they liked me back and then started chatting away. Long story short - he  introduced me to M21globalcenter and guided me how to deposit, buy and sell.  

The deposit required my passport or license to verify who I was - I did a quick google search and some avenues do required that. So I did that. Deposit was successful the next day. 

So the next day he guided me through the buy and sell - so he guided me to purchase USDT using the 250AUD I deposited  and then he taught me how to trade it to earn. I think that's what happened Lol. Anyway so I saw that I earned some small increment on my account. 

So obviously later his conversation always turned to persuading me to go to this website to do more investments etc. so I told him I will stop for a bit and check out other platforms. Then he said alright you can withdrawal anytime if you want to stop and talk to chat support for assistance. So that's where I didn't block him nor talked to him anymore. Its only then I did a reverse image on his photos (profile pic) his using some one else's photos from Instagram. So I didn't block him yet but didn't want to alarm him in case his scam team may decide to do something to my money or details etc. I contacted my bank and made an note with them. 

**Withdrawal**

I didn't go back to ask him how I can withdraw even though he said if I have trouble I can ask him. I went to the webpage to explore a bit and they had two ways on the webpage to withdrawal. One is the ""withdrawal funds"" page. This will ask for your bank details and its submitted as a request. I didn't know how to use the other withdrawal at that time so I resorted to this one first - however I got back a email saying that I had filled things out wrong. So I went on to ask chat support and they said to give them those details over chat support and that I filled the information wrong. Then I stopped because the info I gave was correct. I'm guessing they couldn't work out which was my bsb and account number so I guess the platform's withdrawal form is just poorly formatted to just entering your bank account number. Being skeptical I went to check out option number 2 in a bit more detail. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Withdrawal fund page](https://preview.redd.it/e75pspmzkgw41.png?width=1900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1e245d3da17d5e5ecadcdef357d10e37077ecbc)

Option 2 is ""withdraw"" link under ""asset management""

&amp;#x200B;

[Select your currency that you had purchased e.g. I purchased USDT - under this page for me, all other cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, ETH if I click into it, it all says withdrawal suspended. I don't know whether its related to time of the day? Some times the page is open to those withdrawals.](https://preview.redd.it/p29bdnd3mgw41.png?width=1837&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=795a9de4239815bad4a44213a8fec2523b5dbb1f)

So if I select USDT I should see this: 

&amp;#x200B;

[Withdrawal address is your digital wallet address](https://preview.redd.it/fneo5zflmgw41.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=286407f45b2f6d66d0a144c4286ad594a85c1c63)

So then I was like okay I have no idea what that is...lol then I went to chat support and ask about this withdrawal address and they were like oh, you better off to withdrawal through the withdrawal form because its much quicker and just insisted I use the withdrawal fund form instead of this. Anyhow I closed chat and went to do more googling. 

Then I figured out how to use this and enter the ""withdrawal address"". I must have a digital wallet so I went to download **EXODUS** according to reviews and also some redditors comments of it. This withdrawal address is the code or link or what ever you want to call it, its like your bank account number for your digital wallet. 

Once downloaded, just follow through the sign up process. Then you can proceed with the sending and receiving cryptocurrencies. **HOWEVER!** you need to also have some ETH currencies in exodus because they charge a small transaction fee for sending or receiving fees.

**How did I get ETH into Exodus?** 

I signed up to **coinspot - as I'm based in Australia and they take AUD so to avoid international transaction fees etc. I used their platform to purchase $10 of ETH. The purchased ETH is stored on the coinspot's digital wallet on the website.. So I sent the ETH from coinspot to my exodus wallet using the ""withdrawal address"" as requested when you are sending or receiving cryptocurrency.  Now just in hindsight - I could have just sent the USDT to coinspot wallet instead. Anyhow this is my first time so I'm kinda all over the place with this.**

So once that's all set up. I went back to M21globalcenter and copied my exodus ""withdrawal address"" into the relevant section and waited. So in the mean time as I didn't get the cryptocurrency in the next few days - I went to exodus support team and asked how long does it normally take and explained to them what I encountered. They mentioned that M21 is most likely a custodial platform where they operate through banks hence the transactions taking longer is a normal occurrence. They also encouraged me to go back to M21 support to ask them how long it would take for the money to go into the digital wallet. So I did - initially I was really reluctant to do so because I was sure I'm not gonna get the money back but worth the shot I guess. 

I went back to M21 chat support and ask them how long it would take for the withdrawal to a digital wallet should take and they kept going back to saying use the withdrawal fund request form like a broken record. But I insisted no, I wanted it digital so then they said they cannot give me a time frame because it depends on when they process it and whether they approve of it. Anyhow just like 5 minutes after this conversation - I got the USDT in my exodus wallet. 

Then I transferred the USDT to coinspot wallet and then withdrew funds on the coinspot and got it back $258AUD in the next few days in my bank account. ($250 +$10 ETH I put into Exodus minus $2 dollars transaction fees here and there) 

Hope this helps

I am relatively new to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, and when I first decided to buy small amount of Bitcoin I did it on a custodial exchange and even stored it there until I found out why it was a bad decision. But it did take me some time to find that sort of information. And those information are scattered in different videos, posts and articles, which makes it hard for a lot of beginners to find the concept of decentralization useful.

So I wonder if there is any comprehensive guide on how to buy/sell/store our crypto in a decentralized way, or in general, what we can/should do in order to avoid the problem of centralization.",1588456560,6,1

See:[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/coronavirus-cause-china-research-evidence-destroyed-a9495856.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/coronavirus-cause-china-research-evidence-destroyed-a9495856.html)

It would be very interesting if government documents explaining the reasoning behind certain actions were hashed, and the hashes were put on the blockchain.

This way, governments can prove that the documents they are presenting were crafted at the time of the government decision, and are not after the fact scraped together documents, and stories made up to justify a decision.

In the case of china, there are many different reasons a communist country that represses speech would not want their citizens to know that coronavirus can spread human to human. One of the most obvious is preventing a mass panic in their own country. Another is a government official in one of the provinces covering his ass.

This is a problem, because when the CIA comes along, they have their own stories. They want to find china guilty, and use that guilt as an excuse to launch war, or economic sanctions or \*something\*. They want to find facts that fit their own story that justifies their own existence, and maligns the other country. Its a game of tit for tat poo flinging, just enhanced with suits and technology.

By publishing hashes to the blockchain, governments can tell other governments of what their intentions were at the time. This allows governments to give other governments access to their own internal logic without at the same time opening up the entire government for inspectors of the other government.

She says I have 24 hours to pay in BTC or she will send the video to my contacts and if I want proof I need to reply to the email with the word ""proof"". She gave me an address to send the BTC to and it was just a jumble of letters and numbers.

this is obviously not real, right? I just wanted to say this may be going around and to be very careful of these emails. It wasn't riddled with spelling errors, it was very well worded for an email like this honestly. It did alarm me a little bit because weirdly enough last night I did visit a NSFW site but not for very long, and it was on my phone where my camera isn't covered.

It's somehow insane and it's getting really worse. It really hurts to read, that people believe in Bitcoin, but they don't even know some of the most important basics.

Please, whenever you invest into any asset, etc. start by investing into your knowledge and your personality first. This will pay you the biggest money one day.
Mark my words!

The internet is full of information, use it. Bitcoin is still young, but there are a lot of information out there and the transparency is one of the best. Trust yourself and only the Blockchain.

When you buy a hardware wallet from a company, they tell you not to tell or show anybody your seed. That's what the 24 words are called. Sometimes could be 25, but that's the same case.

With those words anybody and I mean really ANYBODY in the world, could get access to your BTC. No matter if he is called Donald Trump or he's the guy flipping burgers at McDonalds.

That's like giving someone your bank card with the code written on the front.

You might have worked really hard to save a few bucks to buy Bitcoin, but the scammers don't waste any second with that thought. Their target is to get ranked 1. on the shitty hall of bullshit. They have no conscience. Their soul is lost.

Once they got your BTC, it's gone. Even the police can't do anything about that. Only a mistake by the scammer could reveal his identity.

Please never download any extension or program which isn't verified by the original producer. You're one click away from getting ruined.

Bitcoin could be called freedom as well it's possible to call it the total ruin.
Do your homework before you touch Bitcoin.

When you purchase a hardware wallet make sure you buy it from the producer itself.
Don't trust, verify!

Creator of the ultra-light Qbita Bitcoin Wallet Mario Mazzola has launched the first P2P bitcoin exchanger Qbita Exchange in Cuba.

Cryptovalues are not banned in Cuba, but there is no legal framework for them.  If you add U.S. sanctions, expensive and unstable internet and other local restrictions, it becomes clear why most of the world's cryptographic services and platforms do not work with Cuba.

Thus, Mazzola took on the task of developing an all-in-one cryptographic system on his own: the Bitcoin wallet, the payment platform, and the P2P exchanger.

""I created the Qbita Exchange because I was always convinced that Bitcoin was really needed here in Cuba.  For Cuba to be able to reduce its lag, it needs tools to buy, sell, use and store bitcoins easily and safely.  Qbita solves all these problems,"" Mazzola says.

An Italian-Cuban cryptographic enthusiast launched Qbita's wallet in November last year.  It can work from anywhere in the world, but it was created primarily to meet the needs of Cubans.  To install the wallet requires only 1 Mb on a mobile device and relatively low Internet bandwidth.  It is also possible to use a web wallet.

The wallet now supports a built-in P2P exchanger that allows Cuban users to trade bitcoins from their wallets in a secure and decentralized way, with full control over their funds.

Mazzola noted that other P2P platforms, such as Paxful and LocalBitcoins, provide similar services, but none of them are suitable for Cubans.

""Of course, there are Paxful or Localbitcoins on the market, but they are not available to Cubans.  Paxful Cuba is on the 'black list' and LocalBitcoins needs to pass the user identification procedure (KYC), but because of sanctions, it is not possible for Cubans to meet this requirement,"" he said.

Mazzola mentioned the P2P platforms CubaCoin and Fusyona, but he said they have different technical limitations.

""Despite the initial scepticism, the recognition and popularity of the wallet has increased significantly since the addition of the P2P trading platform.  About a week ago we had about 850 registered downloads.  We launched the exchanger, and in a week the number of downloads reached 1100,"" he said.  However, Mazzola did not run any advertising campaigns.

Now the developer Qbita is creating a payment gateway for companies that would like to start accepting the crypt currency.  According to him, this initiative is still difficult to implement because e-commerce in Cuba is still in its infancy.

""I think we will see more and more people in the future who will use Bitcoin not to make money on its growth but for its true purpose: the freedom to move money and full control over it.",1588601682,9,1

gfjhdp,dont-listentome,[ELI18] How consensus emerges from Satoshi Nakamoto's Proof-of-Work protocol.,"I was going to comment this, but I'm posting this to hopefully get more visibility.

===============================================================

There's a lot of aspects to consider about bitcoin. What about it don't you understand? I'm asking this sincerely.

Essentially, you have a Proof-of-Work protocol which allows for consensus to *emerge* without a central authority. The lack of a central authority is the reason you can have a permissionless and censorship resistant network, because without a central authority, there are no gates and therefore there are no gatekeepers. So basically, decentralized networks allow for a frictionless flow of information.

That only takes care of one part of the problem though, because the lack of a central authority gives rise to another problem, which is the ""double spend problem"". Since you don't have a central authority, you don't have clear course of action when you encounter two conflicting transactions. You can't say ""whatever transaction the network sees first is the one we accept"" because there is no notion of time in a decentralized network. Just try to image how you could possibly keep track of time when different nodes are broadcasting different times.

The way Nakamoto's protocol solves the problem, is by simply introducing a probabilistic selection of conflicting transactions by, essentially, letting nodes bet on either one of the conflicting transactions. And just like with any other bet, there must be a stake that you can lose, or else it wouldn't be called a bet. The stake itself must obviously be something of value, something that is hard to acquire. You can't place a bet with dollars, because dollars don't exist in the network. You can't use bitcoin either, because you can't measure the size of a bet with a unit intrinsic to the system. If you do use a unit intrinsic to the system, then you're gonna have a hard time trying to value the bet it in the physical world in which we ultimately live, which means that if you lose the bet or try to cheat the system, you haven't really lost anything. And if you have nothing to lose, well then you have no reason to play fair either.

So ultimately, you're looking for a unit that is extrinsic to the system, something from the physical world we live in. Problem is, you can't tie gold to a digital network in any meaningful way. As a matter of fact, you can't tie *anything* from the physical world to digital system, *except* for one currency, a currency we use on daily basis, the mother of all currencies, the currency in which all other currencies are ultimately measured and the currency of the universe. It's the currency also known as **energy**.

Why do nodes accept blocks from competing nodes that find a Proof-of-Work for a block other than the one they've been working on and reluctantly attach it to the tip of their own chain? It's because they know that the likelihood of a competing node trying to game the system are close to zero. Why are they close to zero? It's because they know the other competing nodes have something to lose if they don't play according to the rules and because it's trivial for everyone to check that they indeed verified correctly. They know that the rest of network is likely to accept the block and attach it to their chain as well, why do they believe that? Because they know that the rest of network can easily check that the winning node won the round fair and square, with real stake, with something to lose from the physical world. So they extend their chain with block_n, perhaps reluctantly, and continue to work on block_n+1. That is how consensus emerges.",1588900360,1,1

From were I’m standing the community seems very bullish rn so it doesn’t seem logical to me that these unprofitable miners would sell out because they see these bullish signs as well which would cause them to hodl like everyone else. So what I’m getting at is I don’t believe there will be a price drop because these early adopters are just gearing up for the next ride.

The network probably can't handle buying coffee with Bitcoin-- yet.

Using Bitcoin purely as a speculative USD based financial instrument misses the whole point of Bitcoin.  

The only way we can increase commercial usage of Bitcoin (at least in the United States) is to get the IRS to change the tax treatment of Bitcoin (i.e. abolishing capital gains when Bitcoin is used in commercial activity).

ge5ro8,diadlep,Bitcoin is Golden.,"Blatant price guessing here, based on the golden ratio:

&amp;#x200B;

(log price)

Approximate previous highs: $32, $1000, $20K.

Approximate ratios (first derivative): 33 (1000/32) and 20 (20K/1000).

Approximate second derivative: 33/20 = 1/1.6 (or 1/phi for idiots like me).

If this holds, the next first derivative will be 20/1.6 = 12.5.

Then $20K x 12.5 = $250K.

&amp;#x200B;

(linear time)

Approximate dates of previous highs: May2011, Dec2013, Dec2017.

Approximate time spans between: 2.5yr, 4yr.

Approximate ratio: 1.6 (phi, or close enough lol).

If this holds, 4yr x 1.6 = 6.4yr

Dec2017 + 6.4yr = Apr2024, a few months before the next expected halving.

&amp;#x200B;

If this is true, the next top should be around $250K around Apr2024, violating expectations for that halving just like this one lol. (Personally, I think the top will likely be closer to the halving, but still before it. Possible reasons for this, beside the obvious, include the fact that the cryptomarket peak was a few weeks after the bitcoin peak - relative local market forces could cause the date to be other than the expected - and the fact that 1.6 is less than actual phi, lol.)

&amp;#x200B;

Just a guess: Smart money will ""sell the news"" at the time of the next halving, liquidating all the retail FOMO longs that anticipate the halving and the increase in the stock-to-flow ratio. Those liquidations will crash the market, eventually resulting in a relatively shallow bottoming in 2026 of around $20K, at which point the next halving will result in market action much like 2016-2017. The golden cycles of a natural market and the fixed 4 year cycles of bitcoin halvings are fundamentally at odds with each other, as are the dramatic changes in bitcoin due to the halvings. In nature, such disagreeing cycles find resonant behaviors that allow different parts to occasionally line up even while they are dissonant and chaotic at other times (think planetary orbits, lol). It is likely that, if bitcoin survives and remains dominant, such resonances will become common and studied, while it is similarly likely that if the cryptomarket in general survives and remains relevant, similar frequencies, along with a much great set of market golden cycles, will become fundamental to longterm market structure.

&amp;#x200B;

imho

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

PS, if the pattern above holds, which it is unlikely to do given so many competing currencies, bitcoin will next peak at $1.9M in Jul2034 (leaving it far below the expected stock-to-flow ""fair value"" at that point). But again, such massive golden cycles are much more likely to be much more relevant for the cryptocurrency market cap as whole than for bitcoin alone over such large and chaos-promoting time spans. And again, imho.

&amp;#x200B;

PPS, I think we will see a mini-peak sometime in 2022 between $40K and $90K, followed by the aforementioned top, somewhat like a spread out version of what happened in 2013. Alternatively, we may see two mini peaks, one in 2021 around $20-25K, with another bouncing off both $100K and the ""fair value"" line in Dec2022-Mar2023.

&amp;#x200B;

PPPS, this all assumes we don't see some crazy supercycle low sub-$1K (maybe $500-700 or $2100-2700 Oct2020-Apr2021), which while not necessarily invalidating the predictive utility of natural cycles and resonances like phi, may invalidate all specified date and price targets. lol

&amp;#x200B;

PPPPS, there are two major conflicting factors moderating these predictions (guesses, lol):

&amp;#x200B;

The first is relatively positive - that the 2014 bear market was exaggerated and lengthened due to the severity of Mt. Gox fiasco's effects on the market, thus potentially also taking the wind out of the 2017 bull market (hard to believe, I know, but the top probably should have been a bit over $30K (assumign the $+1K top in 2013 was correct)). And thus, this bull market may be relatively more powerful and faster than otherwise expected, evidenced in part by the (so far) relatively short duration of the bear market.

&amp;#x200B;

The second factor is negative and significant, which is that the growth of bitcoin and the crypto market will lie on a curve resembling in some sense a logistic, namely that there's a limit to the number of people on earth, and the more people that adopt the fewer there will be that haven't, and the harder and more reticent the remaining group will be relative to previous converts (even as that reticence is of course competed with by seeing wider adoption occurring, lol). This and related factors will cause bitcoin's growth curve to decrease it's slope and growth derivatives in all frames. imho. If that growth deviates enough, it will eventually pierce every projected support among moving averages and those big log/quadratic curves everyone uses to project major tops and bottoms.

&amp;#x200B;

PPPPPS, yah, this is partially here because I despise tradingview lmao

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: $250K in Apr2024

Investing $1,000 at $10k will net you approx $28,800 max.

I did some calculations based on the two previous halving events and came up with a range of $80k to $288k, couple days later the investor PlanB came out with a prediction of $288k so I’m feeling pretty confident with mine as well.

Around $650 was the “normal” back in 2016 around when the second halving happened. No one would have thought the new “normal” range for 2020 would be around $7k to $9k as the previous ATH was around $1,200. 

I seriously believe the next “normal” range before the 2024 halving happens in 4 years will be around $27,000, it could honestly be here faster than 12-18 months post halving.

ggeccy,chiewbakca,Price/Reward vs. Cost per Bitcoin Transaction,"I am able to roughly calculate the total income per year for miners (mostly paid in new minted BTC or in the future mostly paid in transaction fees) per transaction - which is volatile and dependent on the price of BTC, and also the total cost of operations to be a miner (electricity bills, network costs, hardware costs)... but I am only able to do this with hindsight, meaning if I looked at total miner rewards over the past 12 months and divided that with total cost of operations over the past 12 months I'd see that there are times when it's not profitable to mine because the miner's fixed costs would exceed any reward, especially when Bitcoin prices are low. 

But let's put aside profits for now and look at fixed costs. Bitcoin has an upper limit to the number of transactions it can process per second, so if we understand that cost (not price or fee) per transaction is XX dollars being spent on computing and networking power per year divided by YY transactions per year, we'll see that it lands at about $40-50 per transaction. Then considering there is an upper limit to the transaction speeds achievable by Bitcoin, and the fixed nature of operating costs, this cost per transaction seems to remain rather constant at this range even when Bitcoin is at its theoretical maximum transaction speed. 

But here is where I faced difficulty, when coming back to the price side of the equation. In scenarios where the price of Bitcoin is low and mining becomes unprofitable, does the reduction in total number of miners who drop out reduce the remaining miner's operating cost? Or does it just mean that the spoils of war is now divided amongst less miners, hence they become profitable again? In this case wouldn't the miners with lowest operating cost always be the one who is the last to drop out, ie.  large low-cost mining farms in China? 

Also, when transaction fees become the primary source of income for miners, and we know the cost per transaction is about $40-50 based on past year data, then how do we reduce transaction costs so that it's appealing and competitive in the market? Miners incurring operating costs of $50 per transaction would still be profitable if they charged a $51 transaction fee, but they would be bleeding losses if they only collected $10 per transaction. How would that work? What are the levers that can be pulled in Bitcoin that can help ensure it'll always remain a viable enterprise for a distributed group of people to continue processing transactions? If the lever is predominantly number of miners hoping to earn transaction fees, then what number is the breakeven point for all miners? 

I'm sure there are plenty of experts who have pondered and probably published PhD papers on this topic, so I'd be forever indebted if you could help me clear this up, and I do apologize in advance for not being able to crack this one on my own. 

Thanks a million!

I would love someone to explain it the following to me.

If big miners dump their BTCs on halving, they would be taking smaller miners out of the operation (since they would not be profitable at a lower BTC price) and they would get a bigger % chunk of the network.

Wouldn't it make sense for them to dump their BTC and get them back at a lower rate after people panic sell them as well and simultaneously having more control over the network?

As I was browsing through reddit last night I came across a few people stating Bitcoin's halving would be a good opportunity to make short-term profit.

My thesis is simple, if no one actually sold BTC the value would skyrocket in the years to come, as any other asset, purchase orders would outnumber selling orders and price would naturally increase.

How hard would it be to convince the majority BTC holders not to sell their Bitcoins when price is increasing?

I know most people trade it for a living so that will still happen, others also have a huge chunk of BTCs and they will dump them and cause sudden price drops.. all I'm wandering is if it would be possible to create this hold movement even when BTC reaches astronomical prices

And how would be possible to convince the majority of holders on that scenario.",1589022626,10,1

ggdkhj,Melodic-Watercress,Beginner question re bot trading and equity value,"Hi all, 

 A basic question but I'm new to crypto trading so please bear with me. 

I am running a scalper bot on the band/btc pair which is reporting around 1%  profit per day and my overall investment change is listed as +2.19% on the bot provider site. However on my exchange site the total equity Value of my assets has dropped by around 3%. So although the bot is increasing the number of btc I have and bot site shows +2.9% total investment change, in reality I have lost money. 

Is this a glich or is there a reason for the difference in what the bot provider and exchange are showing? Is it just due to market change in value of assets? and if so shouldn't the % change correspond on bot site and exchange as they are linked via API? Also is it worth running a bot rather than just holding as even if you make ""profit"" on bot you are as likely to loose equity value due to natural market changes

gg58cu,melissaBrian0,HOW THE HALVING WILL AFFECT MINERS?,"With Bitcoin (BTC) block rewards expected to halve during the early hours of May 12, many analysts are starting to weigh in on what the event will mean for the crypto markets and mining community.

Three major bitcoin analyst gave their take on whether the halving is likely to comprise a “healthy rebalance”, or a catalyst for migrating hash power and rising fees. 

Analysts discuss impacts of halving on miners

Johnson Xu, the chief analyst at TokenInsight, predicts the halving will have a significant impact on miners.

“A large percentage of older generation miners such as S9s will be shut down in the short term, and phase-out from the network permanently in a few months post-halving,” Ji stated. 

“The bitcoin halving will result in the network in short term chaos, however, once the difficulty adjustment kicks in and self-adjust to an equilibrium state, we will see the bitcoin network back to a stable position quickly. The halving is positive to the industry in the long run.”
“Bitcoin halving is a healthy rebalance to force the network to re-adjust itself into an efficient network where miners can make sufficient margin,” Ji concluded.

Halving to impact miners

While Zach Resnick, managing partner at Bitcoin SV (BSV)-focussed investment firm, Unbounded Capital, agrees that the halving will disrupt mining operation, he predicts the event will comprise anything but a healthy rebalance.

Resnick argues that the halving will wreak havoc on BTC miners and drive a migration of hash power to rival chains such as BSV or Bitcoin Cash (BCH) alongside heavy price losses.

“At the moment of the halving, many miners will become unprofitable, and some will likely move to mining BCH and BSV,” said Resnick. “As miners fall off the BTC network, block times will lengthen. If price falls, then more miners will fall off the network.” 

“If transaction volume increases, fees could quickly spike to unusually high levels since block space will be more scarce due to the longer block times. High fees can make headlines that see prices continue to fall, block times continue to lengthen, and fees continue to rise.” 
“Because we don't believe there is a fundamental reason for prices to increase, we think it is somewhat likely that speculators waiting for a price surge will cut bait if price is stagnant, and very likely speculators will sell if prices are dropping quickly.” 

“Many miners are also highly leveraged and may seek to front-run an exit if they no longer believe that a price surge is imminent,” he added.”

Will prices rise after the halving?

By contrast, NEM Ventures’ head of trading, Nicholas Pelecanos, stated that the halving “has historically signaled the start of Bitcoin's most tremendous bull runs.” 

However, Pelecanos notes that the reduction in block rewards usually triggers “a brief sell-off” alongside an immediate decline in hashing power.

“The 2012 halving was followed by an immediate 10% sell-off and the 2016 sell-off witnessed an extended 38% decline. Both halvings were followed by an approximate 50-day decline in the hashrate.”
Pelecanos predicts that the disruptions to miners may be temporary, stating: “If history were to repeat itself and bitcoin entered into a decline post halving, high operating cost miners may have to shut down their rigs until bitcoin reaches a sustainable price",1588984217,2,1

But i've been in need for a good VPN, im not a criminal but i need the anonimity. So there goes the option of paying with credit card. Also look at the reviews of some VPNs, they will keep charging your credit card even if you cancel their services, Bitcoin solves this.

My message is, if you are hodling, thats your savings account, but remember, that hodling is just our trading strategy. For bitcoin to actually get mass adoption, and therefore climb in price, we need to get out and use it too. Its not that hard.

Of course one of the complications is that on Paxful and Bisq you need to posses the quantity you’re selling, making so that obviously if the price when you are selling drops in comparison of when you bought you’re losing money. 

So, another question: is there a way to just advertise you’re selling BTC without actual having to posses them? This would give the ability to just make an offer and instantly send the funds from a centralized exchange (where you pay +2%) to your customer, @ +8%.

Also, I’d probably need a SEPA Instant exchange to do this trick. Do you know any?",1589415874,18,1

How could it be that a measure of completed blocks (210k) can consistently come to ~4 years when the total amount of people involved in the ecosystem drastically changes over time.

Surely there are (literally) millions more people involved and transacting in btc today than there were in the first few weeks/months/years. So how can it be that the amount of computation from miners to get through 210,000 blocks takes about 4 years each time?

I read that some Amsterdam-based Bitcoin entrepreneur [installed a Bitcoin wallet](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/man-becomes-human-bitcoin-wallet-with-chip-implanted/) in his palm. Long story short, his life did not improve much. Perhaps on the contrary, his life got a bit harder now since people knew he was storing a private key inside his hands. 

However, this got me thinking, although he did install [the device in his palm](https://imgur.com/esuZxIW), are there companies working on this technology and maybe applying it with current payment solutions like VISA or alike? 

Seems that one company out from UK (BioTeq) is building such devices but it only works with opening car, a door, but not with payments yet. The company is trying to integrate it with VISA, but seems to encounter a bureaucratic problem[1]. Bitcoin fixes this. No need to ask permission; just do it! Contactless payments for everyone!

Imagine:

1. An little sensor that needs no battery is inserted inside human hand 
2. Wave your hand on the POS machine
3. Put authentication code
4. Put only cash amount of money on the device; the amount you are able to risk
5. Refilling is possible from btcATMs or from home

Or something alone those lines.

EDIT1. The whole idea reminds me of the movie _In Time_ (2011).

I understand (correct me if I am wrong ) that legacy is what most people still use.

If you send btc from coinbase for example to a ledger or trezor, so you choose legacy or segwit?. I understand the fees are lower with segwit but i am unsure about the above.

What happens if you give a segwit address to receive funds and this is not supported",1589547985,3,1

So I see online all the time people’s comments saying that paper wallets are not safe and should not be used, but I have not found any solid arguments against them . Could you please argue what vulnerabilities they could have? 

When I say paper wallet I mean downloading software to an offline computer to generate the keys. Example: bitaddress.org .Never connecting that computer to the internet after downloading the software to avoid leakages. Also not using the “move mouse” to generate the keys. 

Thank you ,

100 million satoshi (1 BTC) currently costs \~$9,500 USD.

1 billion satoshi (10 BTC) currently costs \~$95,000 USD.

Better not wait until EOY 2021 when 1 million satoshi will probably cost $1000 USD, or you'll complain that it's ""too expensive"" to become a millionaire...

It will be pretty mind-bending when--in a decade or so--we look back on this time and remember ""how easy"" it was way back in the day to stack a few million sats... And, we'll probably all wish we'd stacked a few more millions.

To all the trolls: YES. I believe it is more likely than not that we will see a 10x gain (\~1.3 trillion market cap) by the end of 2021. And then I think another 10x (\~10 trillion market cap) gain within the next 10 years after that is more likely than not to occur. This is a LONG way from Bitcoin becoming a new reserve currency.

ghb8f6,ThatWazMe,I'm spending my bitcoin. I just want to get rid of it.,"So i don't have much bitcoin, and I don't really care about investing, or speculating, I accepted bitcoin when someone couldn't pay me for something I designed for them, and I've had it ever since.

I donated some to a charity that my girlfriend likes. 

I bought some gifts on [overstock.com](https://overstock.com)

And I've been generally been looking to just spend the rest to finally close my wallets out. In truth I find it more of a burden rather than that of an asset.  I live in the SF Bay Area and it seems that I'd be in a great place to spend it, but it seems years after the hype has died so has the interest in accepting it in place of real goods. 

I understand the economics of it all, but I've come to realize, I don't value it anymore. 

Is anyone else out there lost interest? Does my apathy mark the end of crypto? TBH I don't see anyone like my mother or a small business accepting it. Especially since now it has the stink of drugs and illegality.",1589150309,35,0

But I'm in two minds here. Ledger are having a halving sale on the ledger nano S (€40) using the code **WEARETHEBULLRUN** and if you purchase two or more you'll get free shipping (€60). 

Anybody else considering buying the ledger nano s rather than upgrading to the x model (which is €123)? For the price of the X you would be able to get two ledger nano S plus a little bitcoin topup. Is it worth waiting for the X to come down in price? I'm sure ledger will release a new model soon enough.",1589297960,1,1

And it has something for everyone in the bag
 
Well as far as the traders and investors are concerned, I would like to go by the belief that history repeats itself, but to what extent will it turn out the same way this time around will be something to watch out for.
 
The bitcoin value grew from approximately 600 USD to 3000 USD in 11 months post the previous halving in 2016, and growth continued until bitcoin reached its highest ever market price at 19,783.06 USD in December 2017.
 
With respect to the last two halvings, the volume of BTC is much higher with it rising from nearly 1 billion dollars in 2016 to 21.6 billion dollars (as of 13th March,2020). 
 
Miners have become a lesser factor but still, old generation miners might have to close their activities which in turn will decrease the difficulty level and be profitable for new generation miners with newer equipment, but predicting whether the decrease in miners will affect the value of BTC is like taking a blindfold shot.
 
The halving has coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic and with global recession inevitable the future for bitcoin traders is a mystery which only time can unfold.

I’ve been in the so called ‘Crypto Space’ (yes I hate that term too) since the 2017 bull run. Back then I was clueless and spent far too much money on things that, let’s say…weren’t Bitcoin! In the almost 3 years that have passed, I think it’s fair to say that I’ve become well and truly coin monogamous! Bitcoin has me well and truly hooked. Every single day is a quest to stay up to date, learn about the latest developments, listen to the latest podcast or read the latest article.

Lately I’ve been wanting to give back somehow, problem is, I’ve never written line of code in my life and my professional career couldn’t be further from nodes, wallets and programming! Whilst it may be true that I’m not your typical ‘techie’ I do feel as though I’ve learned just enough to be able to help make a new entrants journey into Bitcoin a little easier. Bitcoin is a technical beast with a lot of nuance and jargon so I’ve wanted to try and make that first step a little easier in as simple a format as possible.

Enter [BitcoinQnA.com](http://bitcoinqna.com/)…..

My first attempt at properly contributing to the community and also my first attempt at building a website. [BitcoinQnA.com](http://bitcoinqna.com/) is my stab at answering the common questions and thoughts I had back in 2017. Questions I’m certain people are still having when entering today. 

[BitcoinQnA.com](http://bitcoinqna.com/) isn’t designed to be a resource for people to become overnight experts. The aim is for it to be somewhere you can you can send your ‘precoiner’ friends and family to get them off zero. I’ve also included some more tailored questions on the two main things that end users touch when they interact with the protocol, nodes and wallets. There is also a page of recommended projects that I’ve interacted with and think add a lot of value. The education page is to signpost those that want to dig a little deeper, to some of the world class resources available.

The site is very much at beta stage and I’m confident that it’s going to change and evolve as my own knowledge and experience continues to develop. I’m very keen to know what you all think about it and would love your suggestions for improvements of anything you think I’ve missed.

If you like the site please share, I want it to help as many people as possible.

Finally, I’d like to say a massive thank you to those who kindly cast their eyes over the site before today and offered their advice and support.

Thank you for visiting and please let me know what you think!",1589711527,0,1

glbc8n,slevemcdiachel,Game Theory of fees may cause artificial manipulation by miners?,"Given the recent spike in fees, I've been thinking about it and now I believe that the incentives with mining allow for cheap or even profitable attacks on the BTC user base (this is not an attack on BTC itself, but manipulation of fees, therefore on BTC users).  
In general, if someone wants to spam high fee transactions, the cost is well, the fees. That's the protection. But if the spammer is also a miner, he can reduce his cost by winning his own fee back when mining a block.  
So an imaginary miner with a large amount of hash rate could reduce his cost by the amount percentage of hash rate he owns (if he owns one third of the hash rate this attack costs him only two thirds of what it nominally costs). It's important to note that unlike other miners actions, this one can be done in a completely anonymous and undetectable way, since his transactions can be indistinguishable from legitimate ones.  


This is an issue on itself, since we know that lots of the BTC hash rate is owned by people who actively supports Bcash, who (theoretically) benefit from BTC having high fees.  


But even without that, I think that miners can use the lingering effect of a spike in fees to actually make a profit with this strategy, hear me out.  
Lingering high fees is a tough subject since it obviously depends on the fee chosen by the legitimate users. So better fee choosing algorithm means less lingering time.  
But we know that once a transaction is sent to the mempool it cannot be removed and it's fee cannot be reduced. So there will always be SOME lingering effect, no matter how smart the protocol for choosing a fee.

So the cost for a miner to do this attack on the BTC user base (cause fees to spike) is gonna be:  


(Nominal cost  x (1 - %hash rate) - Extra revenue from lingering fees.  


From experience watching the mempool behavior I believe that that once fees spike, it takes on average a few hours, so for the sake of example, I'll say the lingering effect causes fees to an average stay at one half of the high for 4 hours. That means only average, of course the actual behavior will be different. But let's do the calculation just get an idea of what happens:  


So miner hash rate: 33.33...%  
Fee he will provoke: 5 USD (to use recent values)  


So cost of maintaining fees at $5 for 6 blocks is ($66,000 x 0.6666...) = $44,000.  


Now, the lingering effect will cause fees to stay high for a while, causing an extra revenue after the attack is over of:  
($5,500 x 24) x 0.333333... = $44,000 also, causing the net cost for the bump in fees to be 0.  


Of course this is all very sensitive on hash rate and size of the lingering effect. Higher hash rate and/or longer lingering effect cause the miner to make a profit, while lower values cause the ""attack"" cost to increase.  


Now, this is all a simplification and the reality is tougher, but I think my example values are realistic, but even more importantly, the game theory incentives are such that it promotes collusion from miners to increase fees.

First of all, the higher hash rate the smaller the cost of the attack (recapture by mining blocks with own transactions), but also the action can be disguised in a way to be indistinguishable from legitimate transactions (so no accountability), and while this hurts BTC, the attack can always be adjusted, so that you take as much as possible without causing people to abandon the network. So miners can't bump fees to $1,000 and profit, that would cause people to stop using BTC, but they could find the point that maximizes their profits while maintaining BTC usability. It's like trying to make as much as possible out of a deal without causing the deal to break apart.",1589700717,42,1

Decentralization should be a core aspect of what makes a cryptocurrency  meaningful in my opinion. If a cryptocurrency is made with  centralization in mind and someone could just change the cap or  quantity, is in bigger control of distribution, etc., isn't that the  same problem in which banks have a monopoly on fiat? Isn't  hyper-inflation, centralized control, and currently existing problems in  this market centered around why decentralization became such a popular  alternative? I see lots of banks and institutional investors still  starting to get more interested in centralized forms of tech or these so  called central blockchain authorities, but can't help but feel this is  opposite to the philosophy of the core technologies that makes the  crpyto community thrive? I feel like Satoshi didn't create Bitcoin and  talk about decentralization so that a bunch of people could go create  centralized digital money many years later.

If the high valuation is dependent upon many people using it, does this imply they need to understand it to? If so, that seems like a massive hurdle as the average person I have learned is quite lazy and slightly dumb.

Curious to hear thoughts, as I am in full blown student mode and trying to understand all the angles.

While my girlfriend was a little younger and a little bit more naive she agreed to let her then boyfriend buy what she believes to have been about $1000 USD worth of crypto under her name. 

Fast forward to their messy breakup and about a couple of months after it blew over, she said she started to receive requests from this guy for her passport and state ID number to gain access to the account he made that’s housing said crypto.
She obviously felt a little guilty but overall righteously paranoid that someone she was no longer close to was asking for her personal information so she never gave it to him. 

So, a couple of questions for you guys:

Was any of this illegal?
Does she have some sort of legal right to this money?
Does he?
Will she be taxed?
What’s the plan of action here?

## [Post-Stay at Home Behavior may have a Dramatic Impact on Investing](https://thejoyofinvesting.com/%My-perspective-on-the-Crypto-Ecosystem%/)

&gt;*What is the saving rate your money earns at your bank?*

What would you imagine are the lasting effects of an abrupt end to what you accepted as normalcy? Each day we arise and begin our day, very similar to the prior day. We begin our routine, our cup of coffee, a fast review of the news, checking in on those still sleeping, and getting ready for work. Future actions enter our mind, bills to be paid, matters awaiting us at our job, relationship joys and challenges, salary raise hopes, car servicing, food needs of the house, that lunch planned for today, the meeting(s) to be had, and so much more. Our mind fills with the hundred other things that our day will encounter. And so, another day has begun.

But today none of the above feels normal. There is no work today. There is no need to hold to a schedule. There is no paycheck. The bank account is shrinking or may already be empty. There are worries about health, about paying the bills, about access to food, about our children’s educational needs, and even about going out for a walk.

A week goes by, and then two, and then a month goes by. Uncertainty is the operative word in a world that denies us what we knew and believed to be normal. Our future is clouded and our worries build.

The word pandemic becomes the topic of the day, a word we rarely heard prior to the year 2020. Headlines, big and bold, carry words of Depression era unemployment, of a daily death count, of a daily infection rate, of the lack of basic supplies and equipment to protect the health of all, and attacks on government leaders for perceived failures to protect society.

There will be fallout from this change in life. A shock to the system that we took for granted shakes the grounding of our beliefs and expectations. There must be consequences, outcomes, new choices, that are driven by our inability to clearly see the future. The impacts of the Covid-19 virus will make us hesitate, make us rethink what is important.

How much money do we really need for that rainy day? More or less than we previously kept in reserve? Will we ever take a vacation again? And to where? On a cruise ship? On an airplane? How much money should we allocate to vacations vs building that reserve fund? Enough to cover necessities like food, toilet paper, antiseptics, medicines? And what about the elderly, the most vulnerable, that need the younger generations to provide care and safety?

The lessons we are learning will change behavior. It is unlikely that we will live and interact in the same manner we did prior to this pandemic. Yes, I believe there may be that initial feeling of high emotion, to believe we are beating this thing and that our lives may quickly return to what we knew, but that impulse will fade as jobs fail to come back, as unemployment remains high due to reconfiguration of the normal work day, as companies adopt more technology to make them less reliant on people to make, distribute, and sell their products. Healthcare will change, education will change, transportation will change, supply chains will change, global trade will change, and politics will get even more difficult as the matters that divide us are blared by politicians in search of votes to keep their roles in place.

I foresee a world where we save more, spend less, reassess our values, focus on security versus adventure, as we move away from embracing the experiences of life as a priority to one where we focus on safety and a return of predictability.

**If I am right about saving more, then the everyday person will become much more aware of interest rate differentials.**

Savings grow based on the interest rate that depositors are paid for keeping their money with a bank or financial institution. In a world with money only earning 0.25% interest per year, which on a $1,000 deposit earns the saver only $2.50 per year, the saver has no incentive to keep their money with a bank. Yet, the focus on saving, on being prepared for rainy days, demands a safe place to keep our money. Will people accept such low returns on their savings even though the bank is lending out the depositor’s cash at rates from 3% to 25%? The bank is keeping all of the profits, and in fact in some instances is even charging service fees that exceed the interest being earned. I think we will see a much more active and discerning saver. Comparison shopping for higher interest rates will become important to all depositors, and there are significantly higher alternatives in the market.

**It will be the alternative financial institutions that will attract more capital as depositors select these newly formed enterprises for their saving needs. If that is the case, then investing in those new enterprises, enterprises that will provide better saving rates and greater incentives to save, will be the wise choice.**",1589811256,3,1

gptmcs,someonefinnish,On Bitcoin's Digital Scarcity,"Greetings fellow bitcoiners,

&amp;nbsp;

This post is about scarcity of Bitcoin, namely the fact that there will be just only 21 million bitcoin or 21 * 10^8 satoshis. Fun fact with bitcoin is that since it is digital, you can put as many decimals to at the end of one satoshi (e.g. lightning network makes 0,001 sats possible). Therefore, its scarcity is not absolute as it is for example with Koenigsegg luxury cars or Pokémon cards; you cannot make a fraction of a car or fraction of a card. Makes no sense. This means that the scarcity of these goods (car, card) result in a zero-sum competition; one person will own the good, one person will not own it. There is a winner and there is a loser. Zero-sum games can result in conflicts; not with bitcoin.

&amp;nbsp;

Because, bitcoin's scarcity is not like that. Everyone can own some bitcoin, and there will be enough for everyone. **But it will be a smaller and smaller slice of the pie, the more bitcoin becomes mainstream.** As a result, there is no zero-sum competition because everyone can own a piece of pie. And the best part is that if you stack sats now, those will be worth more in the future (assuming the trend is up)!",1590341268,12,1
gptmc1,imgonnabeatit,Bitcoin is a CULT. And Satoshi Nakamoto is the cult leader.,"Now before you downvote me, I genuinely believe bitcoin could rise as high as $20,000, if not higher, and I just want to have a rational debate on the “religion” of Bitcoin. This isn’t necessarily to discuss Bitcoin itself, but the people behind it. And I think it's important to the health of the currency. 

My problem with bitcoiners is this: 

**Bitcoiners tend to have this delusional, brainwashed mentality of a perfect currency and anyone whom questions it is immediately shunned and told “they don’t understand” (a.k.a. they just haven’t seen the light.”)**

Almost every time I have tried to have rational debate with bitcoiners they do two things:

1. Tell me I don't understand it.
2. Link me to a Youtube video.

The fact of the matter is EVERY currency has flaws and risks, including fiat (Brrrrr), PM, and so forth. Bitcoin might be the best currency, but it's not bulletproof. If you believe crypto is 100% perfect and refuse to identify the risks and high volatility you are living in fairy tale land. 

But I kind of understand this though, because bitcoin (like any other currency) is only as valuable as the people who participate. And the second people ask questions, it could potentially cause people to lose faith, and further risk it falling apart.

Seem familiar?

**Signs Your In a Cult:**

2. Economic, sexual, and other exploitation of group members by the leader and the ruling coterie. [$$$]

3. No tolerance for questions or critical inquiry. [""You just don't understand Bitcoin.""]

4. Unreasonable fear about the outside world, such as impending catastrophe, evil conspiracies and persecutions. Cult members are victims of persecution. [fiat collaspe]

5. There is no legitimate reason to leave, former followers are always wrong in leaving, negative or even evil. [HOLD]

6. Followers feel they can never be ""good enough"". [HOLD MORE]

7. The group/leader is always right. Blind loyalty.

But who knew Satoshi Nakamoto would tap into their bowl of honey.

So here we stand with our little financial revolution,

That will someday rid the world of malarkey paper money pollution.

With Ethereum an other altcoins nipping at her heels,

Bitcoin will always have our golden seal.

1) Extreme volatility caused by market manipulation from whales making everything seem very shady/rigged discouraging people from investing
2) Technology that is now slow, outdated, not user-friendly, and hard to explain for mass adoption. 
3) Risk of theft / hacking, in turn causing massive drops in market when exchanges get hacked for example
4) Altcoins have muddied the waters...with shitcoins on one end scaring people off, to better coins technologically speaking on the other end, which have taken away $ which would otherwise have been invested in BTC..and which in turn have spawned these exchanges which now seem to control the price 
5) BTC barely scraped $20k and has barely been above $10k. Where are all these $100k predictions realistically coming from?

My second question is #2:   
the purpose is a constant, which is set to 44  (or 0x8000002C) following the BIP 43 recommendation. If I would change that number, what would happen?  


My third question #3:  
The ""change"" -level is used to differentiate between internal (change-address) and external chain (receiving-address). Why does this distinction exists? Because I could receive money to my change address aswell without a problem I thought? On blockchain I can see this (change) address too.

gp453o,TheDonSalvatore,How does a reward transaction look like [newbie question],"Welcome folks,

for guys like me, who are totally new to the BTC world its pretty hard to find detailed information about the mechanics behind Bitcoins &amp; Blockchain. Of course you can find tons on meta information on the internet but I was not able to answer my question with those sources. 

As I learned the coins itself are not a ""hash"", which means the if I send you 2 BTC I am not sending two hashes (representing 1 BTC each). Instead I send you 2 BTC by proofing that I received this amount in the past during a single or multiple transactions. I can proof that I ""own"" the coins by providing ""links"" to further blocks. 

So my question now is how  a reward transaction (the actual give away of BTCs?) are look like. Who is initiate the transaction? Whats the actual source? The problem of my understanding is that, if I receive such a reward and I want to spend it, I can not proof the I actually received the coins from a address/node/etc.

Can someone help me out on this stupid looking question?",1590237107,9,1
gp412x,Soggy-City,Can I escalate a Paxful case to BBB or something?,"I posted a question about this months ago about my chances on whether Paxful or PayPal would be able to refund my money. I am unable to get a refund.

summary of details, but my main question is at the end (

I was scammed out of $200 from a seller on Paxful. Paxful customer service told me that at this point that the seller cannot use his/her account until he/she resolves the trade.

Seller's trade instructions were unclear and unreasonable to follow because the instructions were to cancel a trade if the PayPal funds via friends and family were not received. Seller confirmed on chat that the funds had not arrived in his account yet and told me to cancel the trade, so I did so, but this effectively removed the escrow.

To me, the seller was in clear violation of the Paxful terms and conditions, and the terms also state that the buyer must follow all instructions of the seller (although, yes, I should not have done the trade in the first place. But as a new user I wrongly assumed that Paxful would have buyer protection).

)

My question at this point is whether I can escalate this dispute further. Can I make a complaint to the BBB? Or are there any other options if Paxful can not get my money refunded?

Edit: I realize this may have sounded completely futile, but I was just trying to come up with any ideas. Do I just have to give up at this point? What got my hopes up at first was when, months after I initially tried contacting Paxful, Paxful support said via email: To keep the proper expectations, there is no guarantee of a refund. Basically it meant, if the seller doesn't want to give your money back, which he/she hasn't shown any signs of doing for months, then you will not get a refund.",1590236600,8,1
gp3xnv,BitcoinCanSaveUsAll,Bitcoin Node Delayed Block Propagation,"  

Hello all, my bitcoin node is experiencing extreme block propagation delays. On average 1 to 4 blocks behind what blockstream dot info shows. I'm also noticing that my node has also been unable to maintain connections very long with many other nodes as it used to.

Some notable items of the issue I’ve been seeing are:

\- According to bitnodes dot io  my node is only intermittently reachable.

\- These symptoms / results have been persistent both from behind my router using IPV4 as well as directly connected to cable modem using IPV6 connected to the RJ45 port.

\- I've done virus checks, reinstalled the WIFI card in device manager, disabled my anti-virus 

\- I've even downgraded bitcoin core to several versions thinking it may have been a bug that I didn't notice initially in the most recent release but no luck there either (down to V 18.x) with reboots in between.

\- I've performed  SCF /scannow (Windows 10 machine) and repaired some corrupted files

\- uninstalled avast antivirus

\- sidestepped the router and plugged directly into the cable modem

\- Scanned laptop with windows defender after updating definitions.

I've had my node running for well over a year and a half and just noticed this issue this week (although it may have been going on for the last few weeks).  I'm really starting to believe it's my ISP fighting bitcoin or maybe even something worse. 

Either way I'm downloading another node on another machine and will test it to rule out my hardware on my machine that has been having the issue and hope to rule this out later today. In the meantime if any of you who are also running a node can confirm that you are receiving blocks at the normal speed it would be appreciated. Note that when doing so don’t just rely on the time stamp in the console view of the bitcon core info section! Be sure to test it by either using the GETBLOCKCOUNT command in the console and/or reviewing the historical log of your node to see what time your node actually received the updated tip (most recent block hash). The console window on my node shows the correct timestamps but the node itself isn’t receiving the blocks until sometimes 30+ minutes after they’re propagated to the network.

Thanks in advance for your feedback!",1590236173,8,1

Now the within-24hours rate is at least 10sats/byte, whereas previously you could send tx's for as little as 1sat/byte and have it confirmed in a reasonable amount of time. [https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,1w](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,1w)

This seriously hurts the viability of bitcoin as a currency. There's no way I'm going to use bitcoin to pay for a $15 transaction if I need to pay $3 in fees alone. Maybe viable as a bank transfer alternative, but this should still be considered unacceptable.

Moreover, this is an unavoidable consequence of bitcoin's fundamental design: Bitcoin is deflationary. Yes, having a finite and predetermined block supply is nice for preventing inflation, but every transaction is going to have very high fees. Minting blocks costs miners money; before block reward compensated this; now the diminished block reward needs to be supplemented by fees.  For every tx, you are bidding for a spot inside the block. If your fee isn't worth the computational effort required to include your tx in the hash, your tx will never be confirmed.

Imagine once we halve again. How high will fees be then? There are only two solutions:

1. Avoid using the main chain as much as possible, opt for ""off-chain"" transactions as much as possible, like lightning network.  
This is stupid, because going off-chain defeats the purpose of a decentralized currency.
2. Hard fork and increase miner reward. A radical solution may even do away with doubling forever, at the cost of inflation, in order to reward miners for their hard work of keeping the network fast, cheap, and secure.

Previously this was nerfed by the `minRelayTxFee` requirement.  This would allow the receiver to set the fees (indirectly) by simply chaining a CPFP TXN to the end of it.  Might work something like this.

1. You place a bet at a BTC betting site.
2. If you win, the payout is a raw TXN hex string.
3. You broadcast the raw TXN along with a second ""child"" that pays the fee.
4. Betting site is now no longer paying fees on winning bets.

Could offer a lot of solutions to exchanges that require a ""withdraw fee"" claiming that they need to pay the miners.  This would allow users to request a zero-fee raw-hex withdraw transaction allowing the user to pay the fees themselves.

For the more technical user this would offer up a lot of neat possiblities.",1590209142,7,1

gnaswh,uTOxiOnSOm,My humble thoughts on what bitcoin needs.,"My thoughts.  I'd love critical feedback.

US centric thinking as that's where I'm from.

Bitcoin is a technology stack, not strictly only the public ledger.   Meaning lightening and other higher level applications added to the stack are in context here. 

Bitcoin is currently treated like an asset, or a stock; something to invest in.  It hasn't really been adopted as a currency yet in day to day life.  To me, this is a problem.  It's fine for bitcoin to be treated in this manner, but it's now holding it back since it is predominantly treated in this manner.

It affects tax law and how the government treats bitcoin.

Tax law affects how average folks treat bitcoin. 

And, at the moment, we are currently stuck on the speculative hamster wheel of people buying with the expectation to sell when it reaches a certain level.  Again, there is nothing wrong with this, only with the fact that only this is happening.

Why is it a problem? Because people aren't thinking of and treating bitcoin as it was meant to be treated.  They, instead, are treating it as a vehicle to obtain more dollars. Dollars rule in this mindset. And because dollars are the ""real"" objective, no one has any real incentive to adopt bitcoin as it, I think, was originally intended to be adopted.

The Silk Road (or whatever it was called) seemed like the closest we got to realizing the dream of bitcoin.  The problem with it, obviously, was illegality and the limited user base something like it could ever hope to obtain.

So. What to do?

I think I believe that Bitcoin is realized when some things start happening:

* Governments accept it as valid payment for tax obligations.  This, to me, is the PRIMARY way to full adoption.  It's also the least likely as it would usher in the self destruction of the dollar as we know it.  And the government knows this, to be sure.

* Average people get paid in bitcoin from their day jobs instead of dollars.

* Average people can transact with other average people directly in bitcoin on a daily basis.

Where to go from here?

It occurs to me that I only have to pay capital gains when I trade my bitcoin back to dollars. And seemingly everyone does this at some point.  Because dollars.  But what if I didn't?  What if my goal with bitcoin wasn't to turn it into money?  What if, instead, I simply intended to trade it for something other than fiat. &lt; cue old Matrix/bitcoin meme here &gt;

And, ironically, current tax law is acting as the very disincentive we need.  It's just that none (few) of us are listening or reacting to the disincentive.

My humble thought is that all of us need to start actively trying to find ways to trade bitcoin for services in our daily lives.  Start small. 

For instance, let's say you are a home owner.  You pay someone $50 to come mow your lawn.  What if you tried to persuade them to take bitcoin instead?  That is advantageous to both parties:

* You're spending bitcoin that may have appreciated considerably since you obtained it.  But it isn't the kind of transaction that you'll have to report come tax time.  And it isn't the kind of expenditure that would see you get audited either.

* The contractor equally has an incentive to receive funds in this way.  Maybe they are lying about their income to the IRS when it comes to cash payments.  This black market activity is well known and widely spread (just not exactly scalable). The contractor likely doesn't have to be sold on the tax merits.  Instead, they just need to be convinced that getting paid in bitcoin can also result in value appreciation of the currency itself relative to the forced value depreciation of any dollars they receive through the incessant drumbeat of inflation. 

If each of us start small and win others over in this manner, then real adoption might be possible. 

Oh, and I get it if I'm YEARS late to the party with a post like this.",1589979212,14,1
gnarck,FITrainee,Jumping back in but NERVOUS!,"Hi,

Back in 2015 I lost just under 2btc. I had no idea what I was doing, but when I setup electrum I skipped through the whole setup and didn't write down my seed and forgot my password. I've since been too frustrated to buy anymore but I've gotten over it and now want to get back in.   


I was planning on buying a Nano Ledger today after seeing reviews but they no longer offer the 50% discount I want to consider other options.

I have Exodus installed on my machine. Would this be safe to keep 0.1 bitcoin in long term? I feel comfortable with that as I have my seed and password saved. Alternatively, as I'm looking to buy it and then forget about it for a few years, would I be best using a paper wallet and keeping it in my safe?

gnahrp,banksjosh,The value of bitcoin,"I read a great post this morning from [u/DestructorEFX](https://www.reddit.com/user/DestructorEFX/). It demonstraighted a great real life reason of why bitcoin is great. 

I wanted to expand on his post. In the post, he claimed that bitcoin is a great way to store money in a safe, stable and reliable manner. The reason for this is because bitcoin is not controlled by banks, government or anyone; the price of bitcoin is the true value (excluding whales who purposely pump volume into it causing a price change, aka pump and dump). Bitcoin can be traded by almost anyone, this is great because it allows the free market to choose the price. For those who don't know, the free market is the forces of supply and demand deciding the price. If supply &gt; demand price goes down and vice versa, this shows allocative efficiency; it displays the correct price. The reason why it's a stable place to store money is because of the supply and demand, as the post from Destructor said, the supply is dimishing and demand is stable, this means the price of bitcoin will only increase because of supply &lt; demand. This allows bitcoin to increase with inflation (maybe faster), in these tough times it is undervalued by many people who think bitcoin is a unsafe manner to store money. Bitcoins price certainly is volatile, but this is because people are unsure about it. Donald Trump has tweeted ""I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity...."", this is why the price may fluctuate, also banks, news and many other financial information sources who do not understand the reason for bitcoins existence all speak bad about it causing it to crash. But bitcoin always continues to rise. If you take the tweet from Trump, ""which are not money"", this is closed minded as ""money"" is such a wide term, money could be anything that holds value and or a generally accepted currency, which bitcoin is both. ""can faciliate unlawful behaviour"", the dollar is offen used to buy drugs ect. ""Volitile and based on thin air"", currencies fluctuate constantly, bitcoin is more volatile by nature as is reprosents true value and there is no monitary or fiscal polices to help control the value, you cannot just buy bonds in bitcoin to increase price (this is to simulate an economy). There is a fixed amount of bitcoin at one time, bitcoin is ""created"" from people solving complex problems which yields bitcoin in the proccess. As more bitcoin is ""mined"" there is less and less until there is none left, like a real commodity. This means that bitcoin will always rise, there is a limited supply and an increasing demand, as I explained before.

WARNING. OPINION!

My point is, bitcoin is the future. No banks, no government and no corruption. Yes it is volatile, but that is the price for a 100% free market item. The price will continue to rise and the countries that accept this fact will be better off because of it. The free market has and will always be the most efficient way forward.

WRONG!

Transactions cost fees, so those would very quickly dissolve my coins and give them to miners. If I would decide to not pay fees, then my transactions would take weeks at least to confirm instead of \~10 minutes, thus diminishing my malicious efforts. Meanwhile, everyone else who pays even $0.01 fee per transaction would get ahead of me.

gn85rm,Empact,Practical ways to onboard new users in higher-fee times,"If we're entering into a new phase of higher contention for block space, it will be beneficial to discuss how to best onboard new users with minimal chain impact.

Here are the options that come to mind:

# 1) Acquire and leave on an exchange

It's a matter of fact that many people leave their coins on exchanges, simply because this is the default and easiest thing to do. However, it's a very compromised position to be in, as evidenced by the many examples of substantial exchange-related losses that have been suffered via hacks and scams over time.

**Pro:** The easiest way. Doesn't even necessarily require signup, e.g. if they already have [Square Cash](https://cash.app/).  
**Con:** Most risky, lowest functionality, and least true to Bitcoin's purpose.

# 2) Acquire and leave on a lightning-enabled exchange

Now that [a few exchanges](https://www.opennode.com/blog/bitcoin-exchanges-using-the-lightning-network/) have adopted Lightning integration, it's possible to immediately on-board via a service that then allows you to send out via the lightning network.

**Pro:** Off-chain Lightning payment capability.  
**Con:** Requires signup. Morally equivalent to leaving coins on the exchange

# 3) Lightning-enabled exchange -&gt; Custodial lightning wallet

An improvement over 2) is to transfer the funds from the lightning-enabled exchange to a mobile custodial lightning wallet on their phone. Personally I use [Wallet of Satoshi](https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/) at the moment, and have had a good experience with it.

**Pro:** Includes Lightning Network send / receive functionality, and thus the ability to use acquired Bitcoin without being impacted by fees or delays.  
**Con:** Requires signup and mobile app install. Still morally equivalent to leaving coins on the exchange.

# 4) Lightning-enabled exchange -&gt; Self-custody mobile lightning

The latest lightning wallets, [Breez](https://breez.technology/) (iOS &amp; Android) and [Phoenix](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) (Android), are built with ease of use in mind, and do a good job of automatically managing things like in-bound liquidity, etc., while remaining non-custodial.

As such, acquire from a lightning-enabled exchange, install the wallet, and 

**Pro:** Truly your coins - protection against counter-party risk and full freedom to transact.  
**Con:** Requires signup and mobile app install, and channel setup. Requires one on-chain transaction, which may be subject to block-space or fee concerns.

# 5) Lightning-enabled exchange -&gt; Self-custody desktop lightning wallet

Another option is to help them set up a node at home, using a wallet such as [Zap Desktop](https://github.com/LN-Zap/zap-desktop).

**Pro:** Truly your coins - protection against counter-party risk and full freedom to transact.  
**Con:** Requires signup and desktop app install, and channel setup. Requires one on-chain transaction, which may be subject to block-space or fee concerns.

# My recommendation

Lets appreciate that all of the options above require just one on-chain transaction or less per user. As Bitcoin is currently processing about [800K outputs per day](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/chain-output-count-day), the theoretical maximum on-boarded with current technology is in the hundreds of thousands per day, or hundreds of millions per year.

I would recommend 4) or 5) if practical - if chain space is available in a timeframe that the person being on-boarded can tolerate, they give the greatest capability with a modest amount of effort, and are fully and practically true to Bitcoin's vision.

However, if there is limited patience on the part of the subject, it may be practical to fall back to 3) or 2). Perhaps better to on-board and let them grow into self-custody in the future than demand the ideal  in the beginning.

IMO using a custodial mobile lightning wallet is totally reasonable for ordinary people carrying small amounts of Bitcoin - the risk is relatively low due to the low amount of value stored (equivalent to the risk associated with carrying cash in your wallet/purse), and custodial lightning strikes a good balance in being very easy to use / onboard to, while also meaningfully enabling transacting in Bitcoin via the Lightning network. Mind you, many people leave their coins on the exchanges, so that is our baseline, and custodial lightning is a solid improvement over it.

Those are my thoughts, what do you all think?",1589966408,2,1

Once this COVID-19 situation ends (who knows when, but when it ends) I'm sure that many of us will regret not buying more crypto now.

I've only been in crypto for 2 years, and going hard just this year, but I'm much into crypto news and even studying everything that goes under Bitcoin (you know, maths and stuff), and everything new I learn just leads towards putting more money into it.

I'm clearly no expert, and I'm not saying anyone should do this, but I just wanted to know your honest opinion.

2. Crash
3. Kong or something, never played and it's new.

IMO... crash is the best, you choose a bet 0.000001btc-1+btc and every round the multiplier runs up from 1.01-1000 which highest I've seen is 130x and you get to choose at anytime to cash out but if you push it, it can also crash randomly.

People were saying the same type of stuff when the price was $10 saying it would never touch $100, and again when the price was $1000 saying it would never touch $10k. Now it's people saying we'll never sniff 50k, 100k, etc. But a 50k Bitcoin would correlate to about 12% of the value of gold. This seems almost likely rather than just a possibility.

- what's the price of bitcoin please honey

It's pretty good and flexible and understanding what you want. In the longrun, i'm hoping this will enable users to create complex queries, e.g for rule based trading, automatic payments etc.

As for me, software engineer of over 15 years, i've developed NLP-based systems before, in media broadcasting (controlling TVs using voice).

I *love* the text medium, and i love using it to control technology, and i believe it has the potential for making technology a little bit more human.

I do have an aim to bridge the Bitcoin UX gap. Bitcoin is still too complex for the average user. My interface actually really dumbs down the entire process. However, i'd rather cater for OGs right now, and make this wallet very flexible and feature rich.. once i've got the OG approval, dumbing down will really come down to restricting the optionality for new users.

Please let me know if you're interested. It's all testnet for now of course. It can hold actual bitcoin too, but not recommended for now.

In terms of my business plan, i'm hoping to maybe charge a small fee for exchanges between BTC and Lightning, or provide my NLP service to other wallet and crypto providers. :))) (i haven't decided yet, thoughts welcome).

P.S if you want to participate, please make sure you try to use this thing every other day at least. Don't just join by curiosity. ;)

As you know Venezuelan ""living"" here.

Two days ago AT&amp;T had to shutdown all their operations in Venezuela (DirecTV), US goverment request to remove some channels and Venezuelan goverment didnt let to do that.  Anyway, the price was around 2 USD per month, including even HBO so I dont think they werent that sad of doing so.

A big chuck of the Venezuelan population had DirecTV because it was cheap and without good internet acces it was a way out. So I dont have any international channel now and I rely on a 1.5Mb internet conection by a state owned ISP! I have to say I am little worried.

 Just updating this week numbers. As I always say, only measured by LocalBitcoin.

Steady 2000 BTC monthly.

Monthly minimum wage is around 5 USD.

Any question let me know, AMA.

gnzegk,CombustibleBitcoiner,"A primer on Craig Wright's claimed blocks, Tulip Trust(s), and lists of addresses from the Kleiman lawsuit. There's lots of misinformation. I'll clear it up.","While he's contradicted himself at various times, Craig Wright has sworn under oath that the bitcoin he mined have been locked up in a trust since approximately 2010. The keys, including the public keys/addresses, were inaccessible, since he split the ""root"" private key into several parts using a Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. Those ""shares"" were apparently distributed to various parties who may or may not be the trustees of the Tulip Trust. 

Despite that claim, the magistrate judge in the Kleiman case ordered Wright to produce an accurate list of the addresses of the bitcoin that are locked in the trust. Wright initially said it was impossible, but that he could at least narrow the potential blocks/addresses down. 

To that end, Wright gave the CTO of nChain, Steve Shadders, a list of six criteria, so that Shadders could generate a list of blocks that **potentially** belong to Wright. (Why ""Satoshi"" couldn't do this himself is a mystery.) The two most important criteria were:

1. The output of the coinbase transaction is unspent

2. The least significant byte (LSB) of the block header nonce is between 0 and 58

Shadders created a list, but [screwed it up badly](https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoinsv/comments/cr94sd/steve_shadders_lied_in_court_or_is_a_moron_or/). 

1. He included dozens of blocks that were spent between August 1, 2017 and the time he created the list, due to the fact that he used only the BSV blockchain.

2. He included *thousands* of blocks that didn't meet the nonce criteria. He thought a Java `byte` was unsigned, so he accidentally included blocks in the range 0 to 58 **and** 128 to 255. 

This list is referred to as the ""**Shadders List**"" in Andreas Antonopoulous's [report](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536.500.5.pdf). See page 20. The bug that resulted in the incorrect nonce LSB range is referred to as the ""**Shadders Bug**"". Overall, the Shadders List, which is [publicly available](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536.266.1.pdf), has 27,973 blocks.

After this list was delivered, the lawsuit temporarily paused because the litigants were negotiating a settlement agreement. As part of the settlement negotiations, Wright's side produced two new lists: the ""**CW**"" list and the ""**DK**"" list. These were apparently ""independently produced by the trust"". (See Anotonpoulos report paragraph 103.)

Both lists are proper subsets of the Shadders List, and there no common entries between the CW and DK lists.

The CW list contains 16,430 blocks and the DK list contains 6,416 blocks. 

1. The CW list contains at least 26 blocks that have been spent between August 6, 2017 and June 27, 2019. (See Shadders's first error.)

2. The CW list also contains 1,749 blocks outside of the nonce LSB range of 0-58. All of those 1,749 blocks have nonce LSB range between 128 and 255. (See the ""Shadders Bug"".)

To make it perfectly clear, it's patently obvious that the CW list is derived from the Shadders list, as it exactly replicates his unique bugs. The Shadders list was created in 2019. The CW list was supposed to have been created around 2010. To make it even more perfectly clear: **the CW list is a forgery**.

In addition, the CW list has two ""gaps"" in the list of the coinbase transaction ids (TXIDs). The TXID for each coinbase transaction should be a basically-random number between 0 and 2^256 -1. However, there were multiple large ""gaps"" in that range where no (or very few) TXIDs fell. Imagine if you generated a list of 500,000 numbers randomly in the range of 0 to 1,000,000, and none of them appeared in the range of 300,000 to 700,000. 

This would not happen by chance. One way it *could* happen is if someone started with a list of TXIDs and sorted them using something like Excel, then selecting a couple big ranges and deleting all those entries. As chance has it, the Shadders list explicitly included the TXIDs!

The settlement talks eventually collapsed, and the lawsuit continued.

The judge eventually gave Wright one more chance to deliver an accurate list, since Wright said a ""bonded courier"" was supposed to arrive with keys to the Trust. 

Miraculously, Wright received a list of only the blocks and addresses. He still says he cannot access the private keys. This new list, delivered by his Kenyan ""lawyer"", is referred to as the ""**CSW Filed**"" List in Antonopoulos's report. Wright represents that **the CSW Filed List is an accurate list of his mined bitcoin**.

The CSW Filed List is identical to the CW list, except the 26 blocks spent between August 6, 2017 and June 27, 2019 have been removed. It contains 16,404 blocks. (16,430 - 26 = 16,404). All other blocks are identical. That is, it still includes the Shadders Bug and TXID ""gaps"".

To make matters worse, at least three blocks from this new CSW Filed list have already been spent: two on July 8, 2019, and one on September 2, 2019 (UTC). With some simple blockchain sleuthing and comparing the results to the public Shadders List, we can see that those blocks are:

* 57,585
* 63,790
* 67,690 

To my knowledge, these are the only blocks we know for sure are on the CSW Filed list.



In addition, none of the four lists (Shadders List, CW list, DK list, CSW Filed list) contain any blocks that are well-known to have been mined and spent by Satoshi, including block 9.

Again, as the CW list is a forgery, and the CSW Filed list is obviously derived from it, **the CSW Filed List is also a forgery**.


To bring this all back to the early block that was spent yesterday, it was included in the Shadders List. At this point, we don't know whether it was in any of the other three lists. However, it's not particularly important, since **the Shadders list, CW list, and CSW Filed list already have recently spent blocks**. That block, if it's in the CSW Filed list, would just be one extra.",1590076484,86,8

So, if BTC was kicked in it's bulls today and suddenly was at the the price of $100,000 per BTC, what would the transaction fees be like?

Would the txs fees boost like crazy as it was like previous BTC ath? Or have the tech around it developed so we can still expect low fees as today for a 10K BTC?",1590074727,0,1

In general, I'm looking for an easy way to accept Bitcoin and convert it to dollars in a way that is clear in regards to tax law.",1590074408,7,4
gnyq5m,kornpow,Interesting mempool analysis using Pandas. You all are overpaying!,"Using some simple pandas code I've done some analysis of the mempool as it is currently.

* The ""heaviest"" 3,000 transactions in the mempool is enough weight to fill \~72 of the 96 blocks pending.
* The average fee of these 3,000 ""heaviest"" transactions is 6.5 sat/byte
* The most ""expensive"" 10,000 txns fill 4.66 blocks. This is kind of obvious though, first in line.
* The most ""expensive"" 30,000 txns have an average fee of  98 sat/byte
* Cheapest 20,000 txns have average 4.5 sat/byte fee, and account for 79 blocks of data.

From this analysis I think people are drastically overpaying because the mempool is large and scary. The majority of the blocks in the mempool is from a relatively small number of heavy transactions. As the chain-space market matures I think we could have just a large mempool as currently but have the average fee-rate in the 40-50s. The miners thank you for your fees!

* The video has only two words for you. The first is '**Tree**' from track 8 (YT's compression made it unreadable) and another from track 9. The rest of **the video is IRRELEVANT as is the album cover**. it was just fun for me to make and watch along with the music, sorry if it ruined your life.
* You are searching for 12 seed words in the bip39 format. No need to calculate any words.
* There is an order hidden here. It is not in the lengths of songs or hidden in the rhythms of songs. ""hidden"" is hardly the right word for how it's placed in this album.
* Three track names may help you in your search: songs 2,4, and 5
* Chaos and Logistic maps or any kind of advanced mathematics will not aid you. This is 'Simple'
* c = 300,000 km/s
* In track three you may have to make a '-leap' of sorts
* Morse code will only help you in tracks 1 &amp; 2 visually and audibly
* There are two words each in tracks 5, 6, and 7.",1590068987,38,0

So I’ve recently had to begin using a bitcoin wallet same as I would a Venmo or Cashapp for international friends in order to send and receive coins and deposit to my bank in USD as well.

All the apps seem to be giving us trouble.  Coinbase for example, was so intuitive for all sending, receiving, buying and selling but you can’t transfer for 8 days after you buy coins, and withdrawals to your bank are a nightmare. 

Does anyone know what is the most transactional app for sending and receiving coins but also has reasonable withdrawal processing times?

I tried 4 apps yesterday and my head is spinning.  I just need to figure out a way to receive money in bitcoin from a friend and deposit it to my bank the same day.

1) People explain things a lot better when they think you are starting from 0 which helped me learn tbh
2) It meant I could sort of retroactively challenge information I thought I knew 

This meant a lot of scammers messaged me. Sometimes I'd entertain it because why not but one dude was very persistent so I asked him to show me how bitcoin transfers were done, promised Id return whatever was sent bar transaction fees and gave my wallet address. 

I DIDNT EXPECT ANYTHING OF THIS. it was purely for entertainment. I thought he'd nope out as soon as asked to send btc. 

Anyways, he sent me a small amount of satoshis (i think just a doller or 2) which, as promised, I returned. The only issue was, the wallet I used was BRD which is slow and has high fees meaning 90% of what he sent me was eaten by transaction fees so he got 10% back (10 cents). 

In all, the discussion and exchanges took 2 days and I remained unscammed, the end.

gqvgmh,tookthisusersoucant,Can someone explain what breeze is?,"Firstly, I tried to send some bitcoin to it and had to wait to collect it back since I sent too much. Ok, my bad.

Next I looked at the limit, it's about 900000sats which currently is about £60. So does that mean I can't buy something worth £80? Why is there even a limit?

It seems that this wallet is a lightning only wallet so no ability to keep small reserves in a bitcoin address, but is this wallet really a non custodial Wallet? Without a way to see a seed or anything, the app ties me to itself. If I later want to setup a bitcoin node and lightning wallet, can I restore to it or do I have to transfer?

Maybe it's my lack of lightning knowledge, but I'm kinda anxious about using breeze right now, what is it used for and what is it _not_ used for?",1590493352,4,1
gqvgar,coinsntings,I accidentally scammed a scammer,"Okay so I am NOT a scammer, this was genuinely an accident. I started buying bitcoin in March in that dip (i didnt realise how good an opportunity that was until now tbh) but on forums I posted like I was clueless for 2 reasons:
1) People explain things a lot better when they think you are starting from 0 which helped me learn tbh
2) It meant I could sort of retroactively challenge information I thought I knew 

This meant a lot of scammers messaged me. Sometimes I'd entertain it because why not but one dude was very persistent so I asked him to show me how bitcoin transfers were done, promised Id return whatever was sent bar transaction fees and gave my wallet address. 

I DIDNT EXPECT ANYTHING OF THIS. it was purely for entertainment. I thought he'd nope out as soon as asked to send btc. 

Anyways, he sent me a small amount of satoshis (i think just a doller or 2) which, as promised, I returned. The only issue was, the wallet I used was BRD which is slow and has high fees meaning 90% of what he sent me was eaten by transaction fees. 

In all, the discussion and exchanges took 2 days and I remained unscammed, the end. 

(told this story to my cop friend and he found it hilarious and also reassured me it was perfectly legal)",1590493312,0,1

gqse2n,kealenz,Bullish for Bitcoin: There’s been $20 trillion in global stimulus since COVID-19 started,"The past few months have been the worst months for many economies around the world since the Great Depression. Dozens of millions have become unemployed, revenues have fallen off a cliff, and there is growing social unrest as different groups address the COVID-19 pandemic in different ways.

Governments, as a result, have been forced to throw trillions of dollars at trying to save every facet of the economy in a way that dramatically boosts Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition.

Governments and central banks have spent $20 trillion on fighting COVID-19

A chart from asset management firm Picton Mahoney and shared by Dan Tapiero, a prominent hedge fund manager and gold and Bitcoin bull, indicates that governments and central banks have spent $20 trillion (normalized in U.S. dollars) fighting the economic impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak.

This is equivalent to the annual GDP of the U.S. and approximately 25 percent of the world’s GDP.

” alt=”Global Monetary and Fiscal Stimulus to Fight Covid-19″ width=”437″ height=”447″ data-lazy-src=”https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYccESoWkAAyVmC.jpg” /&gt;Image made by Picton Mahoney, shared by Dan Tapiero.

This stimulus (and what comes next), Tapiero and many others think, will boost Bitcoin dramatically.

Bitcoin could stand to benefit

The world has reached a fork in the road it seems: governments can agree to stop stimulating the economy, which would cause deflation, or they can continue to print trillions of dollars to try and save the economy, which should create inflation.

In both cases, analysts say, Bitcoin benefits.

In a world with inflation, BTC’s absolute scarcity enforced by block reward halvings will likely entice investors to try and secure their wealth in the cryptocurrency. As Tuur Demeester postulated in a recent interview:

“I THINK A PRICE TARGET OF LIKE $50,000 IS NOT INSANE AT ALL, ESPECIALLY GIVEN JUST HOW CRAZY THE MONEY PRINTING IS. I WOULD EVEN SAY BETWEEN $50,000-$100,000.”

This has become such a mainstream narrative that legendary billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones released a note titled “The Great Monetary Inflation,” in which he said that he would be investing his fund’s capital into Bitcoin (allocation of a few hundred basis points) due to the monetary inflation going on.

In a world with deflation, you could have entire economies start to break down and institutions collapse due to the rising real value of debt. Bitcoin acts as a hedge in case of the collapse of institutions and potentially even governments.

Of course, the boiling down of an ever-changing world economy into two distinct scenarios is a bit of an oversimplification, but the point is that analysts think the current macroeconomic backdrop is perfect for Bitcoin to succeed.

Crypto and blockchain fund BlockTower Capital recently released a research note entitled “Demand is Coming,” in which the firm’s analysts put the current case for Bitcoin best:

“WITH ALL OF THESE CATALYSTS ON THE HORIZON, WHAT’S BECOME CLEAR IS THAT THE MACRO CASE FOR BITCOIN HAS NEVER BEEN MORE OBVIOUS. […] HEADING INTO THE BACK HALF OF 2020, THE FUTURE LOOKS PRETTY BRIGHT…”",1590477792,3,1

**Features Sufficing CforCoins’s Supremacy**

**Buy &amp; Sell Altcoins in INR:**

The need for this feature arises entirely out of the need for easing the process of buying and selling Altcoins for investors. Facilitating Altcoin trading in INR has made the whole process incredibly smooth and easy to undertake.

**Secured Digital Asset Management:**

It is one of the most important aspects that makes any platform reliable and trustworthy. Having a secure repository that allows the creation, management, organization, production, distribution, and potentially, even monetization, of digital assets.

**KYC:**

The government of India has now mandated the submission of KYC documents. Adhering to that, CforCoins asks for and maintains a database of KYC documents to properly identify the traders and keep a record.

**Inauguration offer, Zero charges:**

This makes CforCoins stand out among the crowd. It is the first crypto-trading platform in India to levy a 0% fee for trading Bitcoins and Altcoins.

**Why Should You Sign Up With CforCoins Exchange**

With Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple wallets, CforCoins is at the forefront of the galloping Indian crypto-currency market.

It has made a name for itself, by providing some of the most secured services to avail buying, selling and holding crypto-assets in India.

CforCoins has managed this feat by implementing an ideologically driven strategy, that was focused upon building a secure and easy-to-use transitional market-place for Bitcoin and Altcoins. CforCoins is trying to build upon a strong foundation of trustworthiness and credibility. There are hurdles, as they are bound to be with any vision. However, everything seems to be working well for the dynamic model of CforCoins, until now.

The credit partly goes to the changing perceptions and the invigorating interest that people in India have increasingly shown towards crypto-trading. However, CforCoins also deserves their fair bit of credit for their smart vision of accumulating financial experts under one roof and providing a more secure and relatively easy way for investors to trade and become a part of this new-age pocket of investment.

Some prominent features distinguish CforCoins from other exchanges. Its well user-friendly design and convenient KYC protocol make it easy for investors to hop on. Features like real-time tracking of crypto asset prices and price alerts are extremely desirable for traders. Instant secure transfer of crypto-assets and quick deposit and withdrawals, undoubtedly adds a lot to the allure of trading on CforCoins. It also makes it easier for the traders to check crypto and INR balances, transaction history and transaction status. Security is given the utmost priority and 24 X 7 customer support is also provided.

The next stage of planning involves making crypto-trading a more border-less affair. CforCoins seems to have a game plan in mind. Right now it is keeping its cards close to the chest, but seeing the unprecedented success of several cryptocurrencies, is likely to catapult CforCoins at the top of the Global Cryptocurrency paradigm.

CforCoins exchange is primed for introducing volcanic shifts in the digital asset trading industry. Given the extensive research, that has been undertaken, CforCoins is likely to evolve quickly and upgrade itself to a degree where it will be leaps and bounds ahead of the limitations of the other exchanges. It is nothing short of revolutionary, how the current landscape of crypto-trading can completely transform. CforCoins is surely looking to move some mountains in the arena. Prudence says it is worth betting on the dark horse of CforCoins, but only time will tell the rest.",1590745999,6,1

gsp3xg,ProfessionalLion_,Effective Buy and Hodl flow to avoid bleeding fees,"Hey hodlers! I'm a noob that recently decided to allocate a part of my savings to Bitcoin. The more I learn about the concept and the potential of a decentralized currency that's immune to inflation, the more sense it makes. Consider me a convert! 

However, the learning curve is significant, but with the amount of information, exchanges and new services out there, hopefully adoption becomes easier and more mainstream. 

My question is regarding an effective flow to minimise paying too much fees. I currently have some coin on Binance, since that seemed the easiest and fastest way to purchase BTC in my country.  My plan is to move this to a hot wallet (Atomic Wallet) and eventually buy a hardware wallet to keep the coin safe (I plan to hodl as a long term investment)

- When buying BTC, Binance's commission is 0.6%
- When sending BTC to Atomic, Binance's commission is 0.0004 btc (that'll be doubled since I will split the transfer in two in case something goes wrong)

This cycle would repeat every time I buy more BTC through the exchange, so my noob question is:

Is there a more efficient way to continue my DCA buying and storing flow that would save me from losing too much to fees?

I imagine that if and when I want to send the BTC from Atomic to another wallet, that would mean that I have to pay more fees on the same BTC again, which sounds kind of annoying.  

I'm not fully aware on how the fee system works, but I have a vague idea that the transfer fees go to miners. If that is the case, then I suppose it's a necessary ""evil""

I have started working on an app/website that does remittances from the US to some parts of Asia and Africa.

The way it works is similar to www.rebit.ph:

Users who want to send money back home first convert the dollars to bitcoin, then send those bitcoins to the app/website's address, and from there we sell it on the receiving country's local market, and then pay their family/friend in local currency in the receiving country's.

What I'm wondering is:

- Do we have to get a Money Transmitter License or MSB license or any license of any sorts in the US to do this?

- How much would it all cost?

gthw8p,Panda_Procrastinator,Some thoughts on current bitcoin pricing: retail selling &amp; institutional accumulation?,"Thought #1: GBTC  is massively accumulating bitcoin,  I believe that this is reflective of the institutional sentiment not just in USA, but in other parts of the world.

Thought #2: GBTC alone is buying more bitcoins a day than the number of bitcoin is put into circulation by mining. It is likely that this is a general trend,and that others institutions might be also accumulating, it is curious that the price of bitcoin is not rising. Someone has to be selling, but who? Well, it is probably the retail investors who are selling.

Thought #3: It makes sense that retail investors are selling, and more specifically, retail traders. 10k is a crucial resistant level for bitcoin historically. Traders are likely to sell into this key resistance level and seek to buy back later at a lower price. Moreover, there is historical antidote for selling post-halving. It makes sense that traders are selling at price levels close to the 10k level.

Thought #3.1: The increased number of posts in this reddit hoping that the price of bitcoin will drop has increased quite a bit recently, this offers more support to point #3.

Thought #4: However, bitcoin pricing did not drop by much, because despite heavy selling from retail traders, institutional investors are buying everything they sold.

Thought #4.1: Low trade volume may also support this, as retail traders are only selling at current price levels into institutional buying (this creates only 1 transaction, leading to low volume).

Thought #5: If institutional accumulation continues, this could lead to an enormous surge in bitcoin price, because supply is becoming inelastic without retail trader ownership. Institutions and longer term investors do not sell as easily as retail traders.

Thought #6: Rise in ethereum price in recent days seems to indicate that interest in crypto ownership is rising.  Bitcoin price have not risen much in comparison, possibly being held down by traders selling at the key 10k level. This divergence cannot last forever, if this continues, bitcoin will likely rip massively at some point in the future.

Thought #6.1: Take note that the rise in ethereum price can just be a regression to the mean. As bitcoin dominance was at a high point at halving, traders may just be flocking back to the other cryptocurrencies after halving is over. That say, bitcoin should not continue to lag behind as this correction in bitcoin/altcoin ownership should be mostly over. Any further divergence should also be indicative of artificial price suppression from traders hoping to capitalize on a drop in bitcoin price.

Hello,

Recently I sent some btc from coinbase to BRD walltet (android). I went to btc section on brd, hit receive, copied the address and I used that on the send section at the coinbase app.

I checked also the transaction at [https://www.blockchain.com/](https://www.blockchain.com/) and it seems ok (?).

Am I missing something? I have been waiting for 40 minutes.

I hope this is not off-topic.

gtfnvl,Some_won,Very powerful interview with former CFTC chair Chris Giancarlo:," **Mr. Giancarlo:** *I worked on Wall Street for a long time before serving in Washington.  Both of those experiences taught me not to presume to gaze into crystal balls.  I can’t begin to guess how the public will perceive Bitcoin two years from now.  However, what my Wall Street and Washington experience does tell me is that technology is a powerful driving force that affects financial markets, politics and society. It cannot be avoided.  The only option is whether a society and an economy seeks to harness and channel that innovation or surrender and have the innovation harness and channel it.  I believe that powerful driving force right now is what some consider the second wave of the Internet, the Internet of value.  It is going to have a profound impact on things of value, from agriculture and mineral commodities to contracts and indicia of ownership and, perhaps most keenly, on the concept of money.  Bitcoin and the enormous global fascination it has attracted confirms that the concept of money is being dramatically altered by this wave of technological change.*

*Against this wave, the only question for me, as a former US public official, is what role does the US want to play and to what degree will its core values be brought to bear. Will the US bring to the technology of digital money longstanding US values of economic stability, individual liberty and privacy, free enterprise and the rule of law? If not, is the United States willing to accept the values of its economic competitors imposed on the future of money?*

The wallet A went to 0, rightfull so, the wallet B does not show any variation today, although the transaction is confirmed.

But what stops me from using ₿ is the hassle of dealing with taxes. If I had a wallet that would generate a report that would be immediately usable for filing and paying taxes I’d go hog wild.

Unfortunately developers aren’t the most tax savvy people at all times. They are not excited to solve this problem. If you are a company work with a tax attorney or an accountant. If you are a small open source developer, be doubly excited to get the killer feature to your wallet and gain market share and cozy up to someone that would be excited to participate. 

The solution could be some file that can be digitally filed somehow. But there would be some satisfaction in printing out 10 pages and imagining an IRS employee having to review an endless stream of those. If there isn’t a digital solution now, one will materialize right quick.

Let's say we have a service where you can deposit and withdraw funds, we can assume like a Dice betting site for simplicity. So users can deposit X and then withdraw Y which can be smaller or larger than X. All game transactions are handled internally on the site.

If a user deposits X and then withdraws Y. How many on-chain transactions does that make? If this will make two on-chain transactions then we won't really save anything on fees if I understand it correctly(?). 

Am I misunderstanding something here? Is is possible (and feasible) for a user to deposit and withdraw funds to their wallet without opening and closing channels?

Basically the recommendation I got from a payment provider was that lightning will do nothing for us in terms of fees given our use case above.

Sorry if this is a naive question, but I got really helpful answers before so I am hoping to get some insight here from you guys!",1590845455,20,1

gt7r7x,PickledNumbat,Partially redeeming a Casascius physical bitcoin - help request,"**Overview of problem**

I have a Casascius physical bitcoin and I am unable to add its digital contents to a wallet. It seems that the key is not the right length or format. I started to get out of my depth with talk of things like a Minikey format.

I removed the hologram when I was given it years ago as I was curious what was under there. I don't want to sell it instead I want to add its 1 BTC value to a wallet so I can partially redeem it and keep the physical brass as a collectible.

**What I have observed and tried**
(apologies in advance for butchering terms)

I've searched several sites, including here and haven't been able to find a current answer for the new style of keys and wallets.

I put the seven character code from the hologram into the casascius.uberbills dot com site and it gives me a 33 character key, tells me it's version 2 and confirms that it has a 1 BTC value

I've tried to import it into a Blockchain wallet but get the error ""this private key does not match the watch only address above"" when I enter the private key under the hologram. For some reason it seems like a different public address is generated when I enter the 33 char code.

I tried to import it into a Jaxx Liberty wallet but it doesn't recognise the minikey or 33 char code as valid.

*I've basically run up against my level of knowledge and don't know what the next steps are of if I'm missing something bleeding obvious. I double and triple checked any data entry because I saw this was a common problem.*

*I'd really appreciate any help or pointers the community can give me.*

grp7ne,notowisu,How much bitcoin would you keep in one wallet before considering to separate it into several wallets?,"This is something that has been crossing my mind. It’s never good im general to have all the eggs in one basket.

So how much do you consider to be the standard? Like 1 bitcoin for “basket”, less, more.

I can see having several wallets being good for several reasons like even if you mess up really bad and someone gets your 24 words plus 25th paraphrase of you have that they would only get a fraction of what you own so you would not be left in the mud at least.

Then there’s the this thing that let’s say 3 would be for storing 1 bitcoin each, the 4th a mock wallet “only” with 0.1 bitcoin in case someone forced you to give them a key, in the eventuality of 1 BTC = 1M USD that would be 100k, not every thief would consider that not to be a good enough amount. And a fifth where you would buy stuff online that would only have the required amount for normal purchases that you would carry around with you every day for the usually stuff.

Can you help me buy some Bitcoin?

I am happy to hear that you are ready to take the plunge!

There are many platforms that allow you to buy and sell Bitcoin, but the best one for new users is Cash App. Cash App is a product developed by Square, that allows you to efficiently transfer money to other users on their platform.

*Reasons I like Cash App:*

1. Transparent fees
2. Simple interface
3. The ability to move Bitcoin into an external wallet

**Transparent Fees**

Cash App has a flat fee of 1.7%, which is relatively low compared to other platforms. Some platforms, like Crypto.com, offer a 0% fee on purchasing Bitcoin, which make it seem cheaper, but will charge more for the asset itself. The Crypto.com fee structure is more suited for large purchases while Cash Apps structure is suited for small consistent purchases.

**Simple interface**

Cash App offers a clean and simple interface for processing transactions. Other platforms, like Binance.com, may have more features but this can overwhelm new customers.

Cash App also allows you to buy Bitcoin on a set basis (i.e, $10 every day or $500 a month). Buying small amounts of Bitcoin frequently is a good way to build your bitcoin portfolio with less risk. This is called [Dollar Cost Averaging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp).

**External wallet**

There is a famous saying in the Bitcoin community:

&gt;*“Not your keys, not your Bitcoin”*

When you buy Bitcoin through an exchange like Cash App, they are in possession of your Bitcoin until you transfer it to a wallet. If you leave it in their position, your Bitcoin is at risk of being lost or stolen.

To secure you possessions, you need a wallet which is like your bank account.

I found Atomic Wallet to be a good option, however as you get more comfortable I recommend branching out. It takes only a few minutes to create a wallet. Just download the app and follow the step. Make sure to write down the 12 word pass code that they provide you with. This can be used in case of emergency to restore your wallet.

When you open the app you will see a list of many different cryptocurrencies that can be stored in your wallet. For the moment, scroll down until you find BTC aka Bitcoin. Click on it and you will have an option to send or receive. When you click receive you will be presented with a QR code and your Bitcoin address. This is your account number. Copy and paste this info into Cash App and in about 30 mins your balance will be reflected in you wallet.

**Congrats**! You are now the proud owner of your first Bitcoin and part of the finance revolution.

Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency world can be overwhelming for new users. When you’re just getting started, it is important to keep things simple. There is so much information out there, tons of platforms, and a lot to learn. I hope this article helps you as you begin on your Bitcoin journey.",1590603300,21,1

If you got any of the three character domains in the 90s and held onto them you would have the option to sell them for 7 figures today. Likewise if you registered on Twitter as ATT or IBM or some other relevant brand you could sell that account today for a similar amount.

Where Bitcoin beats these, however, is insofar as these accounts are more or less valuable depending on existing organizations, while all satoshis are equal in value.

We are in a land rush, and dollar cost averaging is the best way to stake your claim. This is just one more reason to stack those sats.",1590601092,27,1

grifwk,malyschtadt,Discussion: Bitcoin and Quantum Computers,"There has been plenty of talk about the potential threat Quantum Computers pose to bitcoin. I've been reading a bit about the expected performance of Quantum computers. I'll admit I haven't yet taken the time to develop a rudimentary understanding of how they actually work; but the numbers that are often tossed around in news articles regarding they're expected computational power are in the millions of trillions of floating point operations per second (10^(18) \- 10^(19) FLOPS). 

I have 2 questions:

1. Assuming the estimates above are true, does this mean they will not be capable of cracking wallet seeds? For example, a seed can consist of 24 words. Assuming each word is on average 6 characters long and that each character has 26 possibilities (number of letters in the alphabet) this would mean that there are 26^((6x24)) possible combinations, which is 5.7x10^(203) different combinations.
2. What threat could an immensely powerful computer realistically pose if used to mine bitcoin? Please explain in detail.",1590580951,4,1
grib8n,pimpingken,Bitcoin and Nintendo Switch analogy,"A government banning Bitcoin, would make it even MORE desirable. The time to ban it, was in the early years, before it blew up in popularity. Now that's it's popular, the government is weary of doing so. It's kind of like the Nintendo Switch in its current predicament. Nintendo could come out with new hardware, however the Switch in its current iteration is selling so well, Nintendo can't risk ""rocking the boat"", and losing the momentum of sales, or disenfranchising their early adopters. In the same way the almighty US government can't risk ""rocking the boat"", if they were to attempt to ban Bitcoin, they'd send that tech innovation elsewhere to a more favorable jurisdiction. Not only that, but the innovation moves back underground, and Bitcoin becomes is even more of a threat when priced in Bitcoin. US Fed can only do what they know best, and that is to print more money, which is insane in itself, but assures the longterm suitability for a ""hard money"" like Bitcoin. Eventually the things money buy will be priced in Satoshi. 1 Satoshi for a loaf of bread, 666 Satoshi for an ounce of gold. In that way Bitcoin retains it's purchasing power. Even IF a government bans the sale of Bitcoin, we as a community shift the paradigm, and price goods in Bitcoin. The government WILL ban Bitcoin, eventually. Assume this to be true. Get ready in anticipation for said event, and acquire Bitcoin before the exchanges go offline. To me, that's when the real revolution happens. Traders be damned.",1590580377,3,1

But these 3 points make me doubt it and wondered what you all have to say about this:  
1. Bitcoin can be transferred to old accounts/accounts without access anymore (result: loss in BTC).  
2. The smallest we can go if all fiat is transferred to btc (all 21mil btc): 900000000000000000(total money supply)/(100000000(1 satoshi)\*21000000(all btc) = 428 dollars per satoshi (not so useful).

gbf1i8,Krupxion,"Guys, I lost $1000 and it was 100% my Fault","A little backstory...

I'm a long time bitcoin enthusiast. Been keeping a close eye on things since before it hit $500. However, after I missed out on the major boom in a couple years back I pretty much stopped paying attention. Just recently I saw that BTC went from 3k to 7k and with the halving coming up figured now is as good a time as any to reinvest.

So I took $1000 and put it into an exchange. And then from the exchange I sent it to my old favorite bitcoin mixing service... BitMixer.

Anyone reading this probably know exactly where this is going... BitMixer has been shutdown since 2017 and there are now numerous fake websites out there. I fell for ""bitmixer-io"" .com

To be honest with you, it broke my heart. I sent .1111 BTC off and waited for confirmations. Once the transaction was confirmed I waited to see funds appear in my wallet... and I waited... and then I started to lose hope. That's when I started to see the obvious signs of the scam. The website listed BitMixer's real wallet address... which has of course been inactive since 2017. The wallet address I did send my money to has only had 4 transactions all in the past year. 

This was quite literally the stupidest mistake I have ever made in my life. For so many, many reasons.

Anyone reading this, please be careful out there. I consider myself extremely careful with my money, my data, and my OPSEC, but this mistake only took me 30 seconds to make and now it can never be undone.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. If anyone out there happens to be so fortunate that they can help me recover what I lost I would forever be indebted to you. I can provide as much proof as is needed to back up my story. I'm not out here begging but I am here praying that somehow this will work out in the end.",1588325625,50,1

I know we are much more prepared this time compared to 2017 and a lot of work has been done the past few years to upgrade infrastructure to allow for better use of the scarce block space.

What is the current situation? How many big exchange hasn't still implemented SegWit or Batching (which I believe is the most important one).

Personally, I have lightning channels loaded to do cheap fast transactions no matter the on-chain fees and I have done several transactions just these past few days.

gbdaky,Parc123456,HODL / Halving,"Hi guys! I'm a 20-year-old recent college graduate who's into the creatives industry and touches on financials in terms of stocks and investing in the local market. I also managed to splurge a portion of my disposable income to Bitcoin a few months back at around 9,500. But decided to sell it all off during the recent recovery at around 7,000. This bummed me out. Though for the past month, I've been incrementally buying Bitcoin again but at a safer pace, anticipating the upcoming halving. 

One thing I'm wondering though is that would it be wiser to sell once, and if, Bitcoin prices rise during the halving hype and just re-buy when it crashes again (just as a lot of people are saying) or just HODL it out?

gc94jh,ThisisMariusKramer,Bitcoin HODLERS Have an Essential Advantage Over Bitcoin Traders,"

You must absolutely choose to adopt the right strategy with Bitcoin.

Imeet more and more frequently with people who are interested in Bitcoin. Nothing says that they will buy Bitcoin, but I feel that the possibility of an alternative to the current monetary and financial system is beginning to appeal to them.

So they want to learn how Bitcoin works and then quickly come to wonder what the difference is between Bitcoin HODLERS and Bitcoin Traders.

This is a very interesting question, and one that many people who have just bought Bitcoin should ask themselves. The answer I’m going to give to that question is also very important to me. It should make you very aware of the right strategy to adopt in order to fully benefit from Bitcoin.

Before giving you my answer, I will first explain what I think a Bitcoin Trader is, and then what a Bitcoin HODLER is. Once these two concepts have been defined, I will explain why I think Bitcoin HODLERS have an essential advantage over Bitcoin Traders.

Defining a Bitcoin Trader

A Bitcoin Trader is a person who sees Bitcoin solely through the prism of financial investment. If you fall into this category of people, you will consider Bitcoin to be an asset like any other that you should consider when making a profit.

The fact that Bitcoin allowed some people to transform $1 invested at the beginning of 2010 into $90K at the end of 2019 does not leave you indifferent.

You don’t really believe in Bitcoin, and you don’t even know how it works. In fact, a Bitcoin Trader is not really interested in Bitcoin as a completely decentralized Peer-to-Peer payment system.

The Bitcoin trader simply thinks that if there is one chance in a hundred that Bitcoin will perform in this new decade as well as it did in the last decade, he should try to buy some Bitcoins.

A simple way to recognize a Bitcoin Trader is to ask him if he has bought some Bitcoins. Most of the time he will tell you that he has invested in Bitcoin. This type of answer will allow you to identify him immediately.

For the Bitcoin Trader, buying Bitcoin is equivalent to investing in a company by buying shares on Wall Street.

When Bitcoin price falls sharply as it did on March 12, 2020, the Bitcoin Trader will obviously capitulate. Quickly, he will make the decision to sell all his Bitcoins, even at a loss.

For him, it’s all about risk management. If Bitcoin falls sharply, he will prefer to recover cash and put it into gold, which is a safer safe haven for him. This will not prevent him from buying Bitcoin again when Bitcoin price goes up again later.

The Bitcoin Trader is therefore acting as a Momentum Trader, which I think is a fundamental mistake.

When Buying Bitcoin, Don’t Make the Mistake to Be a Momentum Trader

Don’t let your emotions guide your choices.

In short, you will have understood that the Bitcoin Trader is not interested in the ideological and social revolution that Bitcoin represents. He is only interested in profit.

Defining a Bitcoin HODLER

First of all, you should know that there are several types of Bitcoin HODLERS. However, I only consider here Bitcoiners, those who fundamentally believe in Bitcoin. These Bitcoiners play the essential role of HODLER of last resort.

This kind of Bitcoin HODLER will therefore keep his Bitcoins no matter what it takes.

When Bitcoin price loses 50% of its value in a few hours, as was the case on March 12, 2020, the Bitcoin HODLER will not waver. He is aware that Bitcoin’s volatility is double-edged, and that in order to fully benefit from it he has to aim for the long term with Bitcoin.

Aiming for the long term with Bitcoin is not difficult for the Bitcoin HODLER. Why? Simply because it has total confidence in Bitcoin and the revolution it is building for the future world.

Bitcoin HODLER has become aware that the current monetary and financial system is no longer working. He understands that this 49 year old system only accentuates the inequalities between the very rich and the poor.

Bitcoin appears to him as an opt-out solution in order to regain control over what he owns.

The mere fact that Bitcoin’s money supply is fixed at 21 million units, and that this is immutable, guarantees to the Bitcoin HODLER that his efforts to save will not be in vain.

When the Federal Reserve announces an infinite quantitative easing program to support the American economy as it  did on Monday 23rd March 2020, the Bitcoin HODLER is strengthened in its position.

It knows that quantitative easing ultimately means a currency devaluation of the U.S. dollar. This devaluation should decrease the value of what he owns.

Bitcoin is therefore his hedge to fight against the effects of this currency devaluation.

Bitcoin Is Your Hedge Against Currency Devaluation

The crisis we are going through will only strengthen this position.


This absolute belief in Bitcoin has allowed the Bitcoin HODLER to see the drop in its price on March 12, 2020 as an incredible opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin. This is what he has done, and he believes it will bring him great benefit in the future.

Bitcoin HODLER Has an Essential Advantage

In my opinion, the Bitcoin HODLER has an essential advantage over the Bitcoin Trader. That essential advantage is its absolute belief in Bitcoin and the fairer system for all that it seeks to build for the future.

The simple fact of fundamentally believing in Bitcoin allows the Bitcoin HODLER to lead a much quieter life in which he accumulates Bitcoins.



When Bitcoin price varies greatly, the Bitcoin HODLER is zen. He knows that Bitcoin is here to stay, and that his ambitious goals are long term. The 50% drop in Bitcoin price on March 12, 2020 should therefore in a bigger picture.

In hindsight, HODLER Bitcoin sees the bigger picture, and is convinced that this fall will be quickly forgotten in the months and years to come. Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain the same, so there is no reason to panic.

Panic is precisely what characterizes the Bitcoin Trader.

His life is far from being a long quiet river. He constantly follows the Bitcoin price and other financial assets’ price. As a day trader, he is under constant stress.

With Bitcoin, his life is complicated. Bitcoin is the only true free market in the world. Trading never stops, and its users have the power to decide the true break-even price. In fact, the price of Bitcoin can be extremely volatile.

The Bitcoin Trader will have a hard time managing its volatility that will become its greatest enemy.

Generally, the Bitcoin Trader is much more likely to lose money with Bitcoin than the Bitcoin HODLER. Indeed, several past studies have already shown that HODLING is the best strategy to make profits with Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin HODLER is therefore a winner on all grounds with its total confidence in Bitcoin.

He leads a peaceful life, protects his wealth for the future, while seeing his wealth increase in value over time. Finally, his absolute belief in Bitcoin will be rewarded in the future when he successfully completes his revolution.

You don’t have to buy Bitcoins, but if you make the personal decision to do so, you should strongly consider becoming a Bitcoin HODLER as well in order to take full advantage of the Bitcoin revolution.

If you still choose to remain a Bitcoin Trader, you will do so at your own risk.

gc1oma,Rattlesnake_Mullet,Bitcoin is Common Sense,"&gt;With bitcoin as a backdrop, it becomes self-evident that there is no advantage either in ceding the power to print money or in allowing a central bank to allocate resources within an economy, and in the stead of the people themselves that make up that economy. As each domino falls, bitcoin adoption grows. As a function of that adoption, bitcoin will transition from volatile, clunky and novel to stable, seamless and ubiquitous. But the entire transition will be dictated by value, and value is derived from the foundation that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. It is impossible to predict exactly how bitcoin will evolve because most of the minds that will contribute to that future are not yet even thinking about bitcoin. As bitcoin captures more mindshare, its capabilities will expand exponentially beyond the span of resources that currently exist. But those resources will come at the direct expense of the legacy system. It is ultimately a competition between two monetary systems and the paths could not be more divergent. 

&gt;Bananas grow on trees. Money does not, and bitcoin is the force that reawakens everyone to the reality that was always the case. Similarly, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Everything is being paid for by someone. When governments and central banks can no longer create money out of thin air, it will become crystal clear that backdoor monetary inflation was always just a ruse to allocate resources for which no one was actually willing to be taxed. In common sense, there is no question. There may be debate but bitcoin is the inevitable path forward. Time makes more converts than reason.""

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency pioneer. It was founded in 2009 by a person or a group named Satoshi Nakamoto. This digital asset uses blockchain technology, that means it works without a central authority, and managed by its users and peer to peer network. The bitcoin later became a virtual or digital currency, and it is being used for transactions or investments. In late-2017, this digital asset reached its peak, and the prices reached nearly $20,000 per Bitcoin. Later on, its rival emerged. Other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, XRP, Tether, Litecoin, and many more, began to dominate the crypto market.

gd9zh9,luxxx75,Where will Bitcoin meet halving?,"The main event of 2020 in the crypto world, halving bitcoin, is just over a week away.  In the last month and a half since the collapse of the markets, the main cryptographic currency, and with it the whole market of digital assets, have fully recovered and are gaining strength for a new rise.  A study by Currency.com crypto analysts shows that Bitcoin behaves quite predictably, repeating the scenario of the previous two halves, showing approximately the same dynamics, but adjusted for the global crisis and pandemic, which for a short period of time collapsed BTC. 

 The dynamics of bitcoin before and after halving are the same.  First the bitcoin rises to a historical high, then drops by more than 80%, gradually recovers to the average of the previous peak and halving begins, after which a new peak is reached within 13-17 months.  We get the scheme ""Peak - Bottom - Restoration (Halving) - New Peak"".  By the way, this model fully corresponds to the standard economic cycle.



🔸 2011-2013

- Peak is $32.

- Bottom - $2

- Restore to hawling - $12.5

- New peak in 13 months, $1177.



🔸2013-2016

- Peak is $1177.

- Bottom - $163

- Restoration for the Hawling - $665

- New peak in 17 months, $19,800.



🔸2017-202?

- Peak is $19,800.

- Bottom - $3148.

- Restoration to Hawling - $9400-10400

- A new peak in ???? months ????

As you can see, the scenarios are almost identical and the current course is very close to the expected values.  Given the growing open interest in bitcoin futures on the CME and increased activity of large investors, the price is likely to reach $9400-$10400 for the remaining days.",1588592173,4,1

gd7bqf,Coding_Enthusiast,[Idea] Bech32 encoding of private keys,"Ever since I saw BIP-173 I was excited to see the encoding used anywhere other than addresses. I've done some search but apart from some comments here and there I haven't been able to find any major work done (please let me know if you know of any proposals).  
Here is my idea of addressing some of the problems with current encoding of private keys:  

### Using Bech32 encoding instead of Base58  
While writing a private key recovery tool I've felt how hard it is to come up with an optimized algorithm to recover a key that is missing a couple of characters (eg. a damaged paper wallet). That is not true with Bech32 being a multiply of base-2 algorithm is inherently faster, and the checksum is not a bottleneck since it is not a hash algorithm. Bech32 also has the benefit of having error detection.   

### Script (address) type
Currently when a user imports/sweeps a private key in a wallet client, that client either has to explicitly ask user for the script type (like Electrum) which means user is exposed to complications and has to be familiar with script types; or the wallet has to construct all script types and scan the blockchain for all of them (like bitcoin core) which adds more burden on the client.  
If the encoding included a script type that becomes so much easier.  

### Locktime!
Another burden on both clients and users (specially full node users) is the time consuming need for a re-scan of the entire blockchain to find the historical transactions that belong to an imported key.  
A timestamp can make that process a lot shorter.  
Using locktime (similar to last 4 bytes of any transaction) the key string (aka WIF) could include either a block height or a date-time value of when the key was created.

Here is an example with a random key from Bitcoin.Net `KeyHelper` class:  

    Original WIF (Base-58): 
    L28Peud5cQcijrtMthAdUS8FynpM8PKZtnoUZb1VAio9WxKoebHt
    
    Key bytes (Base-16):
    92734fe879f662ff8ee4eb87dd019425e2ee73ff3edd0c4dc3def2f71e1a6a69
    Version byte (ie. the script type): 0x02 or P2WPKH
    Date UTC: 5/4/2020 7:11:05 AM
    H.R.P.: bprv
    
    New encoding (versioned Bech-32):
    bprv1zjfe5l6re7e30lrhyawra6qv5yh3wuull8mwscnwrmme0w8s6df5sns90tcqqzyen4e

Note that key is encoded the same way an address would be encoded (version byte is added separately as a 5-bit value instead of 8-bit).",1588578793,7,1

The cost of displaced ETH equivalent is $395,041 at the rate at the time of transfer.  A total of 342,000 ETHs were stolen from the Upbit exchange, with 55,000 ETHs being moved to an unknown address a week after the break-in.

Hi All,

I'm studying a Masters in Information Systems and Technology at Curtin University in Western Australia and I'm conducting research to explore the determinant cryptocurrency investment behaviour.

The outcome of the research is to provide greater context into why people choose cryptocurrency, a relatively new and unregulated investment opportunity.

The survey should take no longer than 15 minutes to complete and participation is completely voluntary. The data collected in this survey will be completely anonymous and private.

I would appreciate your participation in the survey which you can find a link to here.

[https://curtin.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_aW6zUhb6Ki6N5Qx?referrer=redditrbitcoin](https://curtin.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aW6zUhb6Ki6N5Qx?referrer=redditrbitcoin)

There is a voluntary option to enter a prize draw (by entering your email address) to win cryptocurrency of your choice.

\- First prize will be the cryptocurrency of your choice to the value of AUD$150

\- Second prize will be one of two chances to win the cryptocurrency of your choice to the value of AUD$50

Prizes will be drawn after the survey is closed.

Thanks again for your participation.",1588826992,7,1

My proposal was picked up by a publisher right around bitcoin's previous trip to the moon. This gave me the freedom to take a break from my job and follow my writing dreams, knowing that my family was well provided for. My book is a pop-sci history that mashes up ancient texts with modern data and statistics. Astrology, I argue, was the ancient world's original big-data problem, its numerical methods drove much of science before Kepler, and even today, we still fall for many of the same pattern-matching pitfalls in our modern numerical forecasts. (Note: I do NOT believe in astrology!) So far the book has received positive reviews in [Science](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/books/2020/01/14/a-scheme-of-heaven/), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/11/how-astrology-paved-way-predictive-analytics), and elsewhere.

gezkm2,thegreathusain,It is becoming the very thing it swore to destroy.,"Bitcoin. A coin which is misunderstood by millions; and even the enthusiastic ones are sometimes misguided on it.

It was never an asset to be hodled.
It is an alternative to fiat. A currency based on energy, not based from federal reserve.

A currency, not an asset.

But unfortunately, we have started treating it as something to be held on to; to be stashed away, and ""sold off"" at the highest high, and bought again at the lowest low.

The bankers are waiting for this to become a failure.
The media is twisting its meaning and we all are getting swayed by it.

The need of the hour is to stop pretending it is an asset; and start using it as a currency which it is for our day to day usage, we need to form robust communities dealing excessively (not exclusively)  in bitcoins.

If its own community will treat it as an asset; how will the perception change? 
Instead of celebrating ""It's over 9000!"", We should be celebrating average daily transactions.

We can change this quite easily as well.

And then we also have to stop the institutions of bitcoins; who store client bitcoins on their servers. Spreading awareness about private wallets is the way forward.

We also need to be wary of Bitcoin based banks! I am pretty sure they will pop up in the near future.

For starters, if we have the option we should always give preference to BTC transaction over fiat when buying stuff. Even this seemingly small simple step can be a major shift in the dynamics of how this coin is used, and how the liquidity flows.


Bitcoin has already gain enough significance, we must start pushing it to this next phase; or else it will just stay a ""lucrative investment"".


We need to change our ways now, else the true goal of Bitcoin will never be achieved.



TL;DR : It is becoming the very thing it swore to destroy.

gex9nm,Gaglinskaya,issues restoring ledger wallet to mobile wallet," 

So  my ledger nano apparently can't handle more than 3 days of being in my  possession without crapping out. I got it 3 days ago, set it up and this  morning it stopped working, doesn't turn on. Great. Amazing product.  I've been trying to figure out how to restore that wallet onto another  software wallet using my seed phrase as I can't access those coins any  other way with the defective hardware wallet now a brick. Seemed  straightforward. I installed samourai, chose the import external wallet  option, entered my ledger seed phrase, chose a PIN, new wallet loaded.  Nothing happened. The new samourai wallet that is supposed to be an  import of my ledger wallet shows no coin, nothing pending. Ledger live  still shows all my coin in the same accounts as this morning.

Did I fundamentally misunderstand something? Am I way off-base? What happened?

What indicators were you watching to enable you to sell at the top?

Bitcoin was only anywhere near its peak for a matter of days and if that was to play out again, a lot of people, myself included, would be sweating on not missing the chance to catch the profits. I can only imagine the fear of watching it start to crash back down and I assume people get that in ‘17 too?

Whilst I believe in the tech and long term future, capitalizing on the next bull run is something I plan to do.

There’s so much speculation about where the price could end up by end of ‘21, are people setting their own criteria up?

getppb,Mark_Bear,Bitcoin is the new gold,"## Bitcoin Compared to Gold

Gold is expensive to store securely.

Gold is extremely expensive and slow to transport securely, especially large amounts.

Gold is heavy, it takes up space.

You can't walk very far carrying a lot of gold. You can't swim at all with more than a few coins of gold.

Gold can be confiscated. Gold has already been confiscated by the US government.

Highway robbers, corrupt border guards, pirates, and others can merely kill you, then take any gold you were transporting.

Tungsten's density is very close to that of gold. There are now gold-coated tungsten bars in circulation. It requires special equipment and know-how to detect gold-coated tungsten.  

Gold has intrinsic value, but it's on par with aluminum and copper.  Besides, the point of money is to have little or no intrinsic value.

## - -

Bitcoin is easy and inexpensive to store securely.

Bitcoin is inexpensive to transport, and compared to gold, transporting Bitcoin is 'instantaneous'.

Bitcoin weighs nothing and takes up little, if any space.

Bitcoin cannot be detected and can pass right through any border or airport.

Bitcoin won't stop refugees from walking long distances, nor from swimming across rivers.

Bitcoin cannot be confiscated. Robbers, pirates, corrupt cops, soldiers, etc. won't know you own any (unless you tell them), and they cannot merely kill you and take your Bitcoin.

Bitcoin can be sent across the Internet.  

Bitcoin has no intrinsic value.

&amp;#x200B;

### Intrinsic Value

Money does not need intrinsic value. In fact, **the whole idea of money is to use something with little or no intrinsic value in order to facilitate trade**. When people trade items with intrinsic value for other items with intrinsic values, that's called ""barter"" and no ""money"" is involved.

People who throw the ""intrinsic value"" term around usually don't know what it means.

Investopedia says:

**What Is Intrinsic Value?**

Intrinsic value is a measure of what an asset is worth. This measure is arrived at by means of an objective calculation or complex financial model, rather than using the currently trading market price of that asset.

Wikipedia says:

In finance, intrinsic value or fundamental value is the ""true, inherent, and essential value""\[1\] of an asset independent of its market value.\[2\]

So, technically, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, but that's okay.

Fiat money has no intrinsic value, either.

Gold has a little bit of intrinsic value, about on par with copper or aluminum.

Again: **Bitcoin is the strongest, soundest money ever used**, even though it does not have much, if any, ""intrinsic value"".",1588802808,50,1

ge24gd,Tunahalfmen,If Satoshi did this he could communicate with the world and no one would doubt it really is him,"On January 8th, 2009 Satoshi mined the first Bitcoin block. Initially, he was the only one mining and this continued for an undermined amount of time.  
For this example lets assume he was mining solo for 90 minutes (most probably a lot longer) and able to mine the first 12 blocks. To this day those 600 btc (12 x50) are verifiably untouched and remain in their original wallet.  
Using a basic code all Satoshi would have to do is move the coins around to communicate with the world. His writings are in English so it would seem natural that the code would also be in English. For the letter A leave one bitcoin in a wallet, for the letter B leave two coins in a wallet, three coins would be the letter C and so on.  
As an example, let's say Satoshi moves the extra coins to block 12 leaving:  
  
8 btc in wallet 1  
5 btc in wallet 2  
12 btc in wallet 3  
12 btc in wallet 4  
15 btc in wallet 5  
0 btc in wallet 6  
23 btc in wallet 7  
15 btc in wallet 8  
18 btc in wallet 9  
12 btc in wallet 10  
4 btc in wallet 11  
  
If Satoshi did this, his first message to us would be, ""Hello World"". Hopefully he mined the first 50-100 blocks so he could spell out decent sized sentences.

If we assume the average HNW individual has a $5,000,000 net worth, and they are putting 1% of their net worth into bitcoin as advised that equates to a $50,000 investment in btc.

$50,000 is around 5 bitcoin (slightly more).

This means some of the wealthiest individuals on earth today will own in total around 5 btc. Some less more. 

If you own 30 bitcoin you are an ultra high net worth individual of the future.

If you own 5 btc you are a high net worth individual of the future.

If you own 1 btc you are a millionaire of the future.

Well, by that logic, Bitcoin is not only backed by the internet, not only backed by some US citizens, but backed by the whole world and its citizens that believe in it.

Google and Facebook are also digital services backed by its empoyees and lots of computers. But Bitcoin is not a company in a country, it does not have a CEO or empoyees. It does it’s own thing, you are either in or out. It doesn’t care and it doesn’t wait for you. Just like the internet does not have a CEO or empoyees, the internet does not care that your company did not adapt to it, your company died out like the dinosaurs if you ignored internet. The internet didn’t care, Bitcoin also does not care about your old ways and old and ineffective traditional ways.",1588679417,10,1

Thought I'd take the opportunity to use a small amount of BTC while I was buying computer parts on Newegg realizing I never have before. Bought something small worth about $9 with tax from the site. Sending money from my Electrum to Newegg was quick and easy. 

Total I was told to send was  0.001997 BTC put it in a converter at the time and it came back the same amount. Fee was something like  .00002698. I put it in the converter now (15 mins later and its around $20). 

Questions include: 

1. Did I overall save money on this purchase? I'm pretty sure I did with the value of BTC rising but I'm having a hard time wrapping my brain around it. Is it best to use BTC for purchases when the price is higher? Pretty sure the answer is yes and feeling a bit embrassed. 
2. How the hell do I read my Electrum Wallet? The BTC I deposit has some columns next to it (USD Value, Acquisition Price, and USD Capitol gains). I've only ever deposited coins and never sent them so Acquisition and Capitol gains have been empty and the USD value has been the same as the day I put it into the wallet. 

With this new withdrawal out of my wallet the Acquisition and Capitol gains have been filled in. USD Value -19.89 Acq = 16.74. Capitol Gains = 3.15 . DO these numbers only represent in that moment of time those things regarding price and will remain unchanged like me deposits? Or will they change and update with the price? 

Thanks for the help. Huge fan of BTC but have yet to make a purchase with it and am a little confused the actual workings of it or if I did something wrong.",1588886421,3,1

The reason why I put up this post is because I see so many people on Instagram or elsewhere getting into Bitcoin as a speculative investment and thinking it is going to the moon just for some halvening.

I do not dislike the idea of cryptocurrency but actually there are a few problems with Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes,  Bitcoin has paved the way for crypto, that is true.  

Yes, Bitcoin is a great idea with great ideals.

Yet it is still destined to fail.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of people say that BTC will be the future because of various characteristics like:

* anonymous
* decentralized
* fast
* uncomplicated
* eternal rules

&amp;#x200B;

***Claim #1  BTC is anonymous:***

&gt;""Some effort is required to protect your privacy with Bitcoin. All  Bitcoin transactions are stored publicly and permanently on the network,  which means anyone can see the balance and transactions of any Bitcoin  address. However, the identity of the user behind an address remains  unknown until information is revealed during a purchase or in other  circumstances. "" 

\- [https://bitcoin.org/en/you-need-to-know](https://bitcoin.org/en/you-need-to-know)

&amp;#x200B;

***Claim #2  BTC is decentralized:***

&gt;Well, not really. BTC is tied to it´s miners. And while a lot of people here call themselves early adopters, they have never ever contributed to a solved-block. Why is this important? Who sells you your BTC? The miners...  so if any big enough group of ( chinese bc they are very active) miners decides it is time to rob the people back of the BTC they sold them - there is no one going to stop them.  And unfortunately this all plays along with BTC´s rules.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Everyone who didn´t get along on this one should research '51% Attack Bitcoin'^(\[1\])  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The only counter I can think of is "" but all the faulty transactions could be recognized and we (the hodlers) can verify the original chain on a new fork "" or something like that, yeah well but technically you will still be fighting the miners and their hashrates

\[1\] [https://duckduckgo.com/?q=51+percent+attack+bitcoin&amp;t=ffab&amp;atb=v140-1&amp;ia=web](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=51+percent+attack+bitcoin&amp;t=ffab&amp;atb=v140-1&amp;ia=web)

&amp;#x200B;

***Claim #3 BTC is efficient:***

&gt;If I want to send you a 100 million bucks, yeah well that can be pretty f-ing cheap in comparison to normal banks. But one of the main reasons that Bitcoins transaction fees have risen for the amounts that you actually want to use daily , is because it is more profitable for miners^(\[1\])  
&gt;  
&gt;So as more people adopt and thus  transactions getting more profitable for the miners, fees are gonna rise..  
&gt;  
&gt;\-  
&gt;  
&gt;Also in term of energy consumption. A **SINGLE** transaction needs as much power as an entire US-household uses in an avg 23 days^(\[3\]) That is not sustainable, as the consumption grows with adoption. Even with 100% renewable power( which we are far away from) the shere amount of ressources (e.g silicon for solar-panels for ""neutral"" energy) is very debatable. Also the mining hardware has to be changed with every halvening (press f for all these rare metals in computer parts)

&amp;#x200B;

***#4 Thought: Quantum Computing***

&gt;What will you do with Bitcoin if Google or IBM (or others) get their quantum computers to work so good, that they will easily decrypt bitcoins encryption.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here is an interesting video if you are interested in how QComputing threatens basically anything that is encrypted:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H\_9l9N3IXU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H_9l9N3IXU)

&amp;#x200B;

***#5 Thought: Comparing BTC to USD***

&gt;To anybody who says ""look at the dollar dying, we will go to 100,000$ soon"" - you are most likely speculating instead of believing in the intrinsic value of BTC (proof of work). If you keep measuring BTC worth in any fiat currency, you lost the point. If it really becomes THE currency, any comparison to fiat is obsolete.

I know this one is kinda unsolid but I wanted to throw it in!

&amp;#x200B;

***#6 Thought: Financial Elite***

&gt;Bitcoin rewards those who adopt first. Sounds good, right? If fiat and governments fail, most of you will be the top 1% while holding 90% of the BTC in circulation. Will that be any better than the monetary system we have right now? In the end Bitcoiin will not serve the many, who have little but it will serve the few who have much.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Think about your fellow (billions of) humans around the world. Will you explain to them: ' Well I got in first, so I am entiteled to be rich' ? I think if BTC would actually become widely adopted, that is an ethical question a lot of people have to ask themselves!

Tbh, this might be the most important point for me and I am SUPER excited for your opinions on that!

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR I think there are good reasons why BTC is (unfortunately) wishful thinking and other cryptos with hopefully better systems will take lead.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to hear good arguments against my positions because mostly people get triggered instead of having a conversation that could benefit everybody!",1588975924,10,1

The entire letter is worth a read, but here's an interesting excerpt:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The most compelling argument for owning Bitcoin is the coming digitization of currency everywhere, accelerated by COVID-19. Bull markets are built on an ever-expanding universe of buyers. Central to the price of Bitcoin is how many more (or less) owners of Bitcoin will there be beyond the 60 million who currently own it? The probable introduction of Facebook’s Libra (whose value will be pegged to the US dollar and will not be a store of value in that sense) as well as China’s DCEP, also tied to the yuan, will make virtual digital wallets a commonplace tool for the world. It will make the understanding, utility, and ease of ownership of Bitcoin a much more commonplace option than it is today.

Owning Bitcoin is a great way to defend oneself against the GMI (The Great Monetary Inflation), given the current fact set. As Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, stated in an online forum around the time he launched Bitcoin, ""the root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust."" I am not an advocate of Bitcoin ownership in isolation, but do recognize its potential in a period when we have the most unorthodox economic policies in modern history. So, we need to adapt our investment strategy. We have updated the Tudor BVI offering memoranda to disclose that we may trade Bitcoin futures for Tudor BVI. We have set the initial maximum exposure guideline for purchasing Bitcoin futures to a low single digit exposure percentage of Tudor BVI’s net assets, which seems prudent. We will review this exposure guideline regularly.

Regarding [Paul Tudor Jones:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tudor_Jones#Investment_philosophy)

**Investment philosophy**

As reported in Market Wizards and the press, Jones futures trading style and beliefs are as follows:\[24\]

* Contrarian attempt to buy and sell turning points. Keeps trying the single trade idea until he changes his mind, fundamentally. Otherwise, he keeps cutting his position size down. Then he trades the smallest amount when his trading is at its worst.
* Considers himself as a premier market opportunist. When he develops an idea, he pursues it from a very-low-risk standpoint until he has been proven wrong repeatedly, or until he changes his viewpoint.
* Swing trader, the best money is made at the market turns. Has missed a lot of meat in the middle, but catches a lot of tops and bottoms.
* Spends his day making himself happy and relaxed. Gets out of a losing position that is making him uncomfortable. Nothing's better than a fresh start. Key is to play great defense, not great offense.
* Never average losers. Decreases his trading size when he is doing poorly, increase when he is trading well.
* He has mental stops. If it hits that number, he is out no matter what. He uses not only price stops, but time stops.
* Monitors the whole portfolio equity (risk) in real time.
* He believes prices move first and fundamentals come second.
* He doesn't care about mistakes made three seconds ago, but what he is going to do from the next moment on.
* Don't be a hero. Don't have an ego. Always question yourself and your ability. Don't ever feel that you are very good. The second you do, you are dead.

Jones's global macro trading style is based primarily on technical analysis, as opposed to value investing, with an emphasis momentum factors driving markets. In a 2000 interview, he suggested however he regretted not being more involved with venture investing in technology firms during the 1990s.

This is institutional money we're talking about, confirming Bitcoin as a financial asset and reassuring the [theory presented by Plan B](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/bitcoin-stock-to-flow-cross-asset-model-50d260feed12) regarding Bitcoin Narratives:

1. BTC “Proof of concept” (S2F 1.3 and market value $1M)
2. BTC “Payments” (S2F 3.3 and market value $58M)
3. BTC “E-Gold” (S2F 10.2 and market value $5.6B)
4. BTC “Financial asset” (S2F 25.1 and market value $114B)
5. ... ?

""The S2FX model offers a new way of thinking about BTC transitioning into the fifth phase.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I expect plenty of your to completely dismiss this post, not read anything, and say 'but he's doing futures.' Yes, he'll be trading futures because we do, afterall, honor contracts in this country. This is in no way an invalidation of his strategy, so please refrain from mentioning this as an argument against whatever you want to argue about. Whether governments will come in and start regulating Bitcoin once it reaches a market cap to rival Gold's, well... that's a whole other topic for **another post.** Yes yes, not your keys, not your Bitcoin.

gfu5jm,InMyDayTVwasBooks,Regarding Swan Bitcoin,"If you listen to bitcoin podcasts, you've no doubt heard of Swan Bitcoin. They launched recently and have been blasting sponsorships on all the major podcasts. While I like the premise of an automatic low fee DCA service, and have signed up for the service myself, I do not think it's actually the cheapest way to DCA, at least during a bull run.

Allegedly, the way they are able to maintain low costs is by holding your bank transfer for 2 weeks after the transfer settles. This reduces fund reversal, and they pass the savings onto you.

However, during a bull market, between the time it takes for funds to be pulled from your bank, settled, and then sat on for 2 weeks, bitcoin could have appreciated wildly.

For example, when my funds were removed from my bank on April 21st, bitcoin was at $6,800. By the time the transfer settled and the 2 week hold Swan Bitcoin placed on my funds was up on May 7th, bitcoin was at $10,000.

Sure, they ""only charged me 1%"", but in the two+ weeks it took, I lost 32% of my potential purchasing power.

You can say the premise of DCA is that you get an ""average price"" over time, and that's true, but when your average price is always two+ weeks behind the time your funds are removed from your bank, you're losing sats.

This strategy seems smart during a bear market, but for the upcoming bull market, I'll stick with the 2-3% fees and immediate purchasing power from other automatic DCA services, such as coinbase, cashapp, etc.",1588947861,5,1

gfrcrf,Cxesar,"RIP HAL FINNEY ""His last post on a BTC Forum"""," 

I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.",1588936719,174,1

Obviously this comes with risks, I understand that. Bitcoin seems extremely volatile. But a 43% is unbelievable, it’s incredible. When I first saw that, I thought, “okay, incredible return for incredible risk. But an ROI that high justifies that risk.”

I go to Reddit to try to learn more, and everybody says it’s not profitable. I saw a post that said they spent $20 on electricity to mine $3. 

What am I missing here? Surely I must be ignorant. I’m fully prepared to invest in top of the line equipment - when people say it isn’t profitable, are they just using standard computers? It’s probably a noob question, but it’s so different from everything else I’ve read. I don’t get it.",1588934797,4,1

gjujdk,luxxx75,Arca Top Manager: Hong Kong financial policy will trigger a new phase of bitcoin growth,"According to Jeff Dorman of the American financial company Arca, the monetary policy of the Hong Kong authorities will create conditions for a sharp increase in interest in Bitcoin.

In Twitter, the executive director of the company wrote that BTC may become one of the most popular instruments after Hong Kong will launch a policy to stimulate business activity.

Dorman responded by his post in the social network to the readiness of the authorities to allocate up to 10,000 Hong Kong dollars ($ 1200) in cash to each resident of the metropolis.  It is planned to allocate a total of HK$120 billion from the budget.  Of this amount, part of the capital will be used to provide guarantees to companies that receive loans at low interest.

The ultimate goal of the new budget policy will be to create conditions for more accelerated economic growth.  This was reported by The South China Post with reference to Hong Kong Finance Secretary Chan Moe.

The publication also notes that the authorities plan to use reserves of 11 trillion Hong Kong dollars to improve economic performance.

Jeff Dorman is confident that the allocation of cash to ordinary citizens of the metropolis is the first step to a new phase of take-off of Bitcoin.  People will choose not to spend the money allocated to them, but to invest it in safe tools.  One such instrument is Bitcoin, which now needs support.

The top manager of Arca stressed that all the funds allocated to the authorities are unlikely to go to the cryptosphere, but part of this capital will certainly be able to penetrate into digital assets, and BTC in particular.

Moreover, the population of Hong Kong knows very well what the cryptographic currency is.  Bitcoin was popular in the region during the riots six months ago.",1589488688,2,1

gjo3rf,curiouschipmunk1010,[Serious/Wellness] When is it enough...,"I am optimistic about bitcoin, and I am grateful to be a part of the future. 

However, I would be remiss to not discuss greed. To which I fall prey to and many us even if it's not evident. 

The question is: how many bitcoin, and when is it enough...In truth, it might not ever be enough. Maybe one day bitcoin will be 1M or 10M each etc, but will that be enough?

At one point I had a few Sats, just dabbling in this world. Then I thought, why not have at least 1 Btc. So I eventually did accumulated 1 btc. Then I thought, 2 btc would be nice. And so this continue. Eventually, I got a little too zealous, foolish and lost a lot. I lost a few whole btc and in honest, it was my fault.

I do not know your particular situation, and for many, 1 btc is their life's saving, and maybe even 0.2 btc is enough for many. Many people will never even own 0.1 btc years from now. And maybe even that is enough to make a enormous impact in their life possibly decades from now. 

I do not know. At the moment, I have much less than when I started, and I am learning to be okay with that and focus on other areas of my life to improve.

Think about it - most investment portfolios around the world hold some combination of stocks, bonds and alternative investments. If bonds are no longer investable because they do not give you a return on investment (e.g. 0%), then won't asset managers be shifting their clients' funds out of that asset class into something else? Globally, we're talking about trillions of dollars.

If asset managers don't yet realize they should allocate at least 1% of funds into Bitcoin, they soon will when it stages an aggressive rally to new highs now that the 3rd halving is in the past.

Sha-1 has been cracked.  
[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/23/google\_first\_sha1\_collision/](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/23/google_first_sha1_collision/) 

A whitepaper for using quantum computers to crack sha-3 is here:  
 [https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/213.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/213.pdf) 

We are at sha-256. 

What would the consequences of a quantum splice attack look like? Well, for starters, the attackers could not submit any invalid transactions. It would be rejected as an invalid block. Could they mess transaction ordering? Maybe. Remember these are deep in the past. The biggest impact would be that the attacker might be able to control who earned the bitcoins mined at that point. This would invalidate transactions in the present because the initial miner got swapped. This would create all kinds of chaos as blocks became invalid. 

The bigger question is how bitcoin would recover. We would recover, no doubts there. The question of how we recover is an important one. Bitcoin probably would need governance in this scenario.

The following are the features that must be integrated into an exchange platform to satisfy the users:

👉**Flexibility to customization and scaling**  
A crypto exchange development company should provide the owners with the flexibility to customize the front-end of the exchange. It allows the owners to offer a better user experience.

👉**Security**  
It is of the utmost importance to integrate the right security features into the exchange. Due to the increased number of hacks, both owners and customers fear for their money. For such reasons, security features such as KYC, encrypted user access and automatic limits for fund withdrawals should be integrated.

👉**Easy management**  
The exchange should be easy to use. It should be underpinned by a user-friendly interface that enables the users to easily trade cryptocurrencies and manage their portfolio.

👉**Instant transactions**  
The transactions should be processed with minimum latency. Reinforce your cryptocurrency exchange software with a powerful matching engine capable of matching buy and sell orders at a lightning speed.

If you are considering building your cryptocurrency exchange, Bytebulls always can help. As an experienced blockchain development company, we are well-versed with the ins and outs of building a secure and high-performance exchange that can help you stay ahead of the game.

gjz0x8,Mxoverb,Bitcoin Correlation to Stock Market,"Bitcoin generally follows the stock market, although recently it had moments of proof that the cryptocurrency behaves independent of the market itself. As of this week, it appears that the stock market is about to go down for a while. So the question is - if the bear market is upon us, will BTC also have a sell-off before the real rally begins?

Option 1 - It is definitely possible that BTC ignores the market. After all, it's a deflationary currency and it literally just halved, which means that the value of each bitcoin should only become more significant. That is the opposite of what is happening to the fiat currency at the moment with all this coronavirus pumping.

Option 2 - But it is also possible that BTC follows the sell-off of the bear market. People may fear losing money and liquidate as much as possible.

Personally, I feel that Option 1 will hold true. ""If"" we do experience a bear market in the coming weeks, months, or years, BTC will reject this trend and rally anyway. Much is happening around the world and on media wherein BTC is gaining traction. More companies and banks are beginning to work with BTC. Social media is exploding with information that educate more and more people about what BTC is, allowing it to gradually transition from a speculative concept to a tangible real world application.

The reason these two options are important to consider is because it will help us time when to buy more BTC. Should we buy now or wait for another drop?",1589503374,7,1

Let's get this straight folks.

My response:

\-------------------

Ok, this space is ABSOLUTELY screwed up.  
You have ""0"" for saying Not your keys, n y c???

Fixing that with an upvote right now... and,

another example where people who don't know are telling people who don't know.

The worst advice you can give to a new person is to have them \*trust\* a third party to secure their crypto.  This IS cryptocurrency.  The basis is cryptography.  Privacy.  This is not Fiat 2.0 .  Cryptopia, [Coinexchange.io](https://Coinexchange.io), Mt Gox... dozens of examples.

Crypto is not for people who shun responsibility.  Unfortunately this is most alive today, especially in Western societies.  Tons of snowflakes that will melt the moment anytime something doesn't go their way.  They've been brought up being told that they can do no wrong, the world owes them everything-- and even Amazon has ""frustraton-free"" packaging.  

Crypto is for responsible human beings, not petulant children.  You lose it and it's lost--- this is how it is DESIGNED to work.  This means we have to be proactive and protect our personal assets.

I'm not into ""wrong"" and ""right"" per se, however it is absolutely wrong to advise a new person to hold their and their family's future wealth with someone else because they could be careless and ""lose"" it.  You want to drive a car?  You learn.  You want to hold a job position?  You learn.  You want to have a decent relationship? You keep screwing up until you eventually, hopefully learn.  Let's not coddle new people and treat them like they're stupid or can't learn about personal security.

The WORST thing you can do is keep your funds on an exchange.  What is happening to the Bitcoin community?  This is madness.  Heresy!  Blasphemy!

(Rant over.  Sitting down now.)

\--------------------------------------------

(in response to)

&gt;People new to bitcoin who would otherwise store their coins on unsecured computers or be careless with or lose their recovery words would have less chance of losing their coins by storing them on coinbase or gemini.  I'm not sure if that is an unpopular opinion around here, but it's true.

You can get hit by a vehicle crossing the street.  

This is true.

We do not cover everyone in pillows and roll them across the intersection one at a time.  We teach responsibility and safety--- look both ways before crossing the street.

Do not let your future wealth be crashed into by an oncoming exchange because  there are those that think you'd be inept in keeping your ""money""/crypto/treasure safe.",1589100188,68,1

Just lost my last $ 4 k on too much leverage futures.

It’s actually really sucky isn’t it, loosing money like that. 

I don’t want this kind of high stress/ depression trading to be associated with the future currency of the world. 

So I have an idea. 

Create a crypto coin that has its own exchange. Then make p2p transfers free and instant, and remove mining with a system like nano. 

Then, (this is the most important part) create a limit of 1% maximum depreciation in value per day. 

This means that yes the coin can only be sold into fiat or other coins as long as the value doesn’t go down by more than 1% that day. 

This would be made possible by making the technology so advanced that other exchanges can’t process it. And as soon as the -1% is met each day all trading is suspended until the price goes up again. 

This would create mass adoption, and make it impossible to be a bear and the bull market would drive the price up exponentially without the risk of any greedy whales.

I mean every single time that bitcoin's volatility increases they simply put up a message saying that they are having trouble with their servers. Today was by far the most overt display where they crashed the price then blocked access to purchases from their android apps as well as their coinbase website. Absolutely unacceptable!  


Let's fight back by taking the 2 following simple steps:

- Open accounts on at least 3 different exchanges ( kraken and gemini are two leading US exchanges) 

- move every single Satoshi off any exchange that you have any bitcoin on whatsoever! 

By taking these two simple actions this puts bitcoins value proposition of supply and demand out of the  exchanges manipulative tactics of financialization and access to bitcoin outside of Conbase! 

I believe that if we collectively take this approach then we will have the ability to eventually break Bitcoin free from their control. Let's change the world!",1589081138,2,1

ggt62d,GoKone,r/Bitcoin is actually a great community.,"There’s a decent mix of checks and balances. Things getting too hot? Comments start pouring in and warning of volatility. Things getting slow? Supporters start talking more vocally. 

The comments board is full of questions! Lots of them are asking things that go back to basics. Remember, not everyone is well-versed on computers. Others have never touched a stock trade. Some are very young and tremendously curious. 

The easier the process, the more force the network effect can grab. If it stays hard, it’ll be hard to scale. This is what we want, right? Scale.

I love the support I’m seeing. I also enjoy the critique. It’s all valid. Bitcoin is a belief system. Beliefs are generational. You’ll be called stupid by those that don’t understand it. You’ll be ridiculed by smart people too. 

If there’s a bear case. You’ll hear about it and you’ll learn about the other side of the coin. This brings about honest debate. The winning debate wins sentiment. If you believe there’s more to it than meets the eye, present your argument and get people talking. You might be shot down, or you could be completely right. 

Whichever the case may be, if you’re here reading this, you are in some way or another interested or invested in Bitcoin. Speak up. What’s on your mind? Wondering what app to use? Write a post. Want to talk financials? Ask away, someone might offer good insights. Another might come in with terrible insights, and he’ll be called out. It’s nice to watch and learn both sides fight it out. In the end though, make decisions based on YOUR needs.

Cheers everyone.",1589077931,8,1

I've been a long-time follower and enthusiast of Bitcoin. It's an incredible technology but I seem to be continuously waiting for adoption to kick-off.

The halving of the miner rewards concerns me and I'm hoping somebody in this sub can shed light on what they expect to happen to hash rate. (Not to price)

If the miners are left in a situation where they are receiving less reward for mining blocks, and they're not making any money from transaction volume, what is the incentive to keep mining?

I have no idea how this will affect price, but surely the hash rate will drop?

In which case it becomes a less stable network over time.

- Quite a few people here are retail investors being held hostage since they bought in to Bitcoin during it's rise in 2017 and now have a vested interest in trying to get more people into Bitcoin to increase it's value.
- The fiat value of Bitcoin is easily manipulated by people who possess large amounts of money.
- Regardless of what people think, the fiat value of Bitcoin is what matters since if it has no value relative to fiat currency it's effective worthless even if 1 BTC = 1 BTC.
- There is nothing similar to the uptick rule meaning that if enough whales were to sell Bitcoin it would tank in value heavily.

I used  [https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/](https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/)  to generate the wallet and even though i know its not the safest procedure, I successfully stored coins like this in the past, without any problems.

[https://btc.com/1DZPqJHWoBhtUxf2d3prs212tAJnt41XYG](https://btc.com/1DZPqJHWoBhtUxf2d3prs212tAJnt41XYG)

This ist the first one I used to collect coins from multiple sources. (I know this step was redundant). Sweeped it to the [bc1qyuqkr](https://btc.com/bc1qyuqkrgqj86lychj27yelhcy46q84gmj9yja7ks)..... wallet and met my friend to whom I wanted to sell them.

Together we created this wallet for him with the same procedure as before:[https://btc.com/1FhrPksEkdHjuR14iMxdXda2nF1GsE57UX](https://btc.com/1FhrPksEkdHjuR14iMxdXda2nF1GsE57UX)

&amp;#x200B;

**Now here's the Issue:**

I sent the amount to his final wallet and **immediately(apparently in the same second)** it was sent to the [1FbJ2HsEJT](https://btc.com/1FbJ2HsEJTcvAkVWHeGksLCvVAgZhDSyxg)...... address, with a really precise and in my opinion high fee. Later I discovered on that final wallet there have been 2 transactions before....1-2 month ago.

Well, I know it seems like I got scammed as hell somehow, but maybe, just **maybe** I'm missing something you guys can see and I don't. Maybe they're not gone?

If the paperwallet site is a total scam, why did't it ""steal"" my coins before?

Usually when someone steals coins, they get transfered to multiple addresses, but they are still stuck at  [1FbJ2HsE](https://btc.com/1FbJ2HsEJTcvAkVWHeGksLCvVAgZhDSyxg).....?

gh3thk,ZauChoco,How to simply create transactions/wallets with http requests ?," Is it possible with a simple http request to add wallets and make/check transactions with them ?

The documentation says to simply copy the BitPay doc for the api part, but to be honest it's confusing.

There are a lot of ""authentification"" keys, either tokens generated on the server itself, or by the library ([https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-php-client](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-php-client)), there is the SIN too, and two places to have API keys. What are these things use for ? And which one am i suppose to use ?

All I want is only to get a unique api key somewhere to make http request in order to add wallets (Private &amp; Public key), create and check transactions. In clear, override all the invoice stuffs.

In clear, something like this:  
https\[Suspicious link removed\]mple.com/api/newTransaction?apiKey=\[APIkey\]&amp;publicKey=14h3sYm559vt7YiKsmNviyXNCqULaSKKCf&amp;privateKey=bc1q9paknt7d05tmzh2frcu8qxgk0ev0mtnpgcz4a3&amp;to=1649LVmQnPfLMSKisM325Bvcx3nYbo5Lmw&amp;amount=0.01&amp;fees=0.001

I recorded the video in Spanish but I think it's easy to understand what I am doing xDD

We'll see how all this turns out, at least I'm sure a good waste of electricity will get me there ;)

&amp;#x200B;

Update of the experiment 10-May-2020 (Commentary in the youtube video): In total we are 8 participants (I include those who have written to me privately saying that they want to participate). We have generated a profit of 0.43 ? in these 4 days we have been mining. I'm going to continue until we do the 7 days. As I said and I maintain, the profits will be shared equally among the participants although I doubt that they will be large xDD

gh0ddy,Fiddlostopher,BitMEX Insurance Fund vs Daily Issuance,"Pre-Halving Daily issuance = 12.5\*6\*24 = 1800 BTC  
Post-Halving Daily issuance = 6.25\*6\*24 = 900 BTC

Great. Everyone knows this. But I'd like to add:

BitMEX Insurance Fund 9 May 2020 = 35,760.0831 BTC  
BitMEX Insurance Fund 9 May 2019 = 24,549.5782 BTC

Thus, over the past year, BitMEX has shovelled 11,210.5049 BTC into its insurance fund. Counting the leap day, that's 30.6298 BTC *per day.* That's 3.4% of post-halving issuance! I understand that this has come from rekt traders, but it still represents a draw on the daily supply of bitcoin available all the same (provided BitMEX doesn't open the fund and dump on us).

Factoring this into the issuance and assuming this continues, we get:

Pre-Halving Daily issuance (BitMEX adj.) = 1769.3702 BTC  
Post-Halving Daily issuance (BitMEX adj.) = **869.3702 BTC**

So in halving, BTC's daily issuance actually drops by 50.87%. Super. (Sadly, I'm quite certain the ""slightly-more-than-halving"" will never catch on...)

Lastly, we can adjust the inflation rate. When the halving (halvening?) occurs at block 630,000, there will be 18.375M BTC in existence. 

Post-Halving Annual Inflation Rate = 900\*365.25/18,375,000 = 1.789%  
Post-Halving Annual Inflation Rate (BitMEX adj.) = (900\*365.25-11,210.5049)/18,375,000 = **1.728%**

I know it's small differences, but it's interesting to think of where the daily supply actually goes.

gh01ir,WeakHands_Trader,Guide: Bitcoin Halving for Noobs - Should I Buy? When? What is it?,"The halving is the process of slicing the bitcoin reward in half. Hence the name. Currently every 10 minutes there is a bitcoin ""block"" mined which rewards the miner with 12.5 bitcoin for mining. 

After the halving the reward every 10 minutes will reduce to 6.25 (cutting it in half).

The most obvious question people here are asking : ""*WiLL ThiS MaKe PrIce gO Up lIke MoON*""

Dude. Who knows? Your guts only can answer this question. Sure, you can look at historical data to best analyze the future outcome but as we all know with honeybadger bitcoin - it don't care about its price and it will go up, down, sideways, and REVERSE! 

past performance is not indicative of future events.

A lot of us here are thinking that the price will more than likely drop the day of the halving cause of the typical ""buy the hype. Sell the news"" action. There are so many people hyping up halving event like its going to immediately cause a supply or liquidity shock. It may do it instantly. It may take 6-18 months before we feels the effects of the halving. 

Should you buy now or after the halving?

If you experience a bitcoin event. Price movement event, or halving event. Or conference event. And if you're asking this question. The answer will always be NO. WHY? because you clearly don't have a plan and people who enter the market without an entry plan and exit plan, that Is written on paper always get smoked. So do yourself a favor and light a joint, sit this one out. And watch it from the sidelines. This way you do the smoking and bitcoin doesn't. 

I guess throw in like the most minimal amount of money imaginable like 10 dollars. And watch that if you MUST have skin in the game. Other than that I wouldn't recommend putting cash in without a plan. This is not financial advice.

ghu7w3,AlethiaArete,Proof of work question,"I spent some time reading through the whitepaper a couple days ago... the proof of work thing got me thinking.

It sounds like the nonce generation thing, finding a number with the right number of 0s heading it and the right number for the rest of the digits as I understand it, is only needed to prevent a double  spend.

Right after that an attacker trying to attempt a double spend is described as taking a random walk in which the number of blocks created by the attacker and the network is the prime factor. The amount of time each block takes to generate is viewed as secondary. I am wondering why a nonce proof of work trick is needed to slow the network down. Of course the immediate answer is to keep the attacker from generating blocks quickly, but there's two things: the first is that it's common practice to wait a certain number of blocks to consider the transaction confirmed anyways, which lowers the chance of an attacker generating a chain of blocks fast enough to overtake the main chain. The second is that if the nodes on the network are all using the same protocol, then they're all generating blocks at the same speed, which means no matter how far the attacker gets, the network is also that far along.

It seems to me this is the core reason why bitcoin is so power hungry, and I'm not sure why it's needed. Couldn't the protocol require handing off of block generation, and keeping time between nodes to have similar results?",1589224274,9,2

# Bitcoin hitting $10 trillion market cap is “easily achievable”

Raoul Pal — chief executive of Real Vision and a former Goldman Sachs executive — recently sat down with one of Bitcoin’s earliest public bulls, [**Max Keiser**](https://cryptoslate.com/people/max-keiser/), to talk about the outlook for cryptocurrencies.

Responding to an inquiry from Keiser regarding Bitcoin’s potential to begin to rival gold, which has approximately a $9 trillion market capitalization.

**“If it becomes an ecosystem, and we believe it will be and it will take the whole ecosystem with it as well, then yes, I think a $10 trillion number is easily achievable within that process.”**

https://preview.redd.it/rge9cx3go5z41.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17d5beef2015d7a67852ee4b3d036aa1371227e3

A $10 trillion market capitalization corresponds with more than $500,000 per coin.

## The timelines are accelerating

While Pal held the belief that Bitcoin could skyrocket to trillions long before the COVID-19 outbreak, the ongoing macroeconomic conditions are increasing the chances crypto performs well, he has suggested.

Per [**previous reports from CryptoSlate**](https://cryptoslate.com/can-the-bitcoin-market-cap-reach-10-trillion-why-an-ex-goldman-sachs-exec-thinks-its-possible/), he postulated in the April edition of his research newsletter “Global Macro Investor” that due to the economic and monetary fallout of the COVID-19 outbreak, there’s a genuine risk “of the failure of our very system of money” or at least a collapse of the “current financial architecture.”

Pal has specifically cited a potential deflationary spiral caused by the lack of spending, which he believes will cause the value of the U.S. dollar to shoot up while individuals, corporations, and governments will have to [**default on their record levels of debt.**](https://cryptoslate.com/wall-street-giant-chief-fears-end-of-debt-super-cycle-is-crypto-the-solution/)",1589647525,34,2

Surely they understand from the story of Dolores Umbridge that power concentration leads to corruption, and decentralized organization such as the Dumbledore's Army will eventually prevail. Hermione even invented a COIN for the D.A. members to transmit message! Why is this so hard to understand for people so smart? (Has something turned her from a Hermione into an aunt Petunia?

gi5ryc,_Pohaku_,Noob question on stop-loss orders,"Trying to properly understand the order book, and everything I read or watch is still vague, hoping for an ELI5 on the following:

I set a stop order on some of my coins, to trigger if the price dropped to (or below) a certain point. I've done this once or twice before and it worked as expected.

So I had a stop order to sell small amount (&gt;1) of bitcoin if the price dropped to 6650, and I set the limit price to 6600.

I was under the impression that the limit price is the lowest I would sell for, so if the price dropped to 6650 the order would sell the coins for 6600. (The gap being there because if I set it to sell at 6650, and market price dropped to 6649 and didn't go back up, I'd end up with unsold coins.)

So last night the price briefly dropped to below my stop price, and triggered the order. My bitcoin order to sell @ 6600 or better went live.  As is usually the case when I decide to sell some, the price bounced immediately and now sits at 7000.

This morning, I see the order is now ACTIVE, to sell my bitcoins @ 6600, but they are unsold. How is this the case, if market price is now over 7000?

Obviously I am misinterpreting something here but I can't figure out what!

He takes 10% of profits. I went with this guy because he was supposedly well respected having worked for [signalprofits.com](https://signalprofits.com) and being Jacob Canfield's pupil. 

Three months later I stopped hearing from him (Jesse Van Marsbergen), noticed he deleted all social media and about a month ago received a half ass one paragraph apologetic email saying his email was hacked and he lost everyone's money. Proof of hack was promised in April which never came. From speaking to others about him, it looks to be around the 1 million mark. He has now stopped communicating with everyone and not replying to his emails.

His website is still running and he is still active on Twitter [https://twitter.com/btctraderjazzi](https://twitter.com/btctraderjazzi)

So he said his email was hacked but he did use the same email to initially tell me he was hacked. His website is still running and taking customers. I assume he is ignoring everyone elses email. An absolutely pathetic explanation email. Providing no proof of actually being hacked or providing anyone with any updates.

If this is true and he did not just steal everyone's money, he at least needs to keep in contact with those scammed and keep us updated with any investigations.",1589797279,6,1

That's the python script I came up with, it calculates the value in Satoshi and converts it back to Bitcoin when finished:

`total=0`  
`for i in range(0,10**7):    #iterate blocks`  
    `div = int(i/210000)     #calculate halvings until current block`  
    `coinbase = int(50*10**8/(2**div))   #calculate coinbase in Satoshi`  
`if(coinbase == 0):`  
`print(""zero"")`  
`break #stop when 0 coinbase reached`  
    `total = total + coinbase`   
`print(total/10**8)          #result: total Bitcoin that will ever be mined`

The result is really close to 21M: 20,999,999.9769 closer than expected, but still not exactly 21M.

And in hyperinflationary money, the price move will be exponential measured in worthless paper money. So don’t think about the value of gold and silver in dollars or euros. Just remember that gold is the only money that has survived in history. It is therefore the best form of wealth preservation and insurance against a bankrupt financial system…""

You can find a lot of interesting articles he wrote.
He is telling about the value of gold and the instable financial situating for more than a decade.

Unfortunately he never talks about Bitcoin and I have never been able to talk about it with him.
It's hard to imagine he wouldn't be listening to the Bitcoin proposition if told about it..

I think he's one of the few who is openly talking about the risks of the current financial sysyem without going to the usual conspiracy theories.
His company manages the wealth of a lot high wealth individuals.

I think he's definitely correct about the future, but for some reason hasn't got Bitcoin on his radar.
Probably because he plays the most safe cards.

But what he tells about gold will also go for Bitcoin, with the big difference that gold is the absolute safe way to play and Bitcoin being the leveraged way.
More leverage means more risks compensated by higher possible gains.

Coming to the main reason of this post, I saw a advertisement by them which told about their hardware wallet program which they are giving for free. I find the concept very interesting as it can be be used as normal debit card as well. 

Since, I have been considering buying a hardware wallet for a while, I wanted to ask if it would be actually secure or not in comparison to Ledger Nano and Tezors which still require a decent investment (atleast in India)

Most articles I read on the topic fail to capture the bigger picture. Sure, fees reached an **average of $5.16** a few days ago. Of course those much higher than usual and it's not good marketing for bitcoin.  


But the reality is that this is a new technology and we can't expect everything to work exactly the way we want to right from the outset. The key is to have patience and a long term outlook.

gltcxr,BackgroundHandle6,Reminder that you should transfer your bitcoin to an external wallet,"So I just bought my first amount of bitcoin from an actual exchange instead of Robinhood, and using the blockchain explorer I noticed something interesting.

I used Coinbase pro, and my Coinbase pro wallet's address has zero transactions on it in blockchain explorer, with an all-time balance of 0.0 BTC.  This worried me, but I went through with my plan to move the bitcoin to an external wallet anyway.

I did indeed receive my bitcoin on my external wallet, but checking blockchain explorer revealed that it was transferred from a different wallet address.  That address sent bitcoin to 40 different wallets including mine in one transaction.  According to the blockchain, my Coinbase pro wallet never actually had my bitcoin in it at any point.

I'm guessing that a lot of you out there already knew about this, but it was really eye opening for me, and I never heard anyone talk about this happening before.  It really drives home the PSA we see all the time on here:

If you don't hold the private key to the wallet your bitcoin is in, you don't really have any bitcoin at all.",1589771095,18,1

Since the halving we have seen the bulls gain a lot of strength, as the priced climbed from $8,500 to $9,900 (at I'm writing this). According to my technical analysis Fibonacci level 0.786 ($9,091) worked as an important new support that pushed the price towards $9,900 after a -4.9% decrement in May 15th. 

Looking at the 200 and 50 MA's, we see that we are next to a ""golden cross"", which is usually a bullish short-term indicator, except for the last one (refer to Apr 24th 2019 and Oct 27th 2015).

Regarding fundamentals we have:

\-Of course, the halving. It's important to mention that it didn't turn out to be a ""sell the news event"", because we did not see a major crash.

\-Paul Tudor declarations.

\-JP Morgan accepting cryptocurrency exchanges.

On the other hand, we have a strong resistance at $10,000 - $10,500, a RSI level of 64 (above 70 is overbought) and a mining difficulty adjustment coming in 2 days.

HQ Office: Manchester, UK
Sales Office: Warsaw, Poland 
Products for sale: Liquid Mining Enclosures
Tomasz Buk, Sales manager
Maciek Szadkowski, CTO (whatsapp +48601228528)


I contacted their sales team in January 2020 and Tomasz Buk was their lead sales person. We had contacted by email about the enclosure I needed for my 8 Whatsminer M20S miners. My total cost was about $6000 landed. I purchased it, wired them the money and waited. Initially I was told a month at the most to arrive at my door but it ended up being 2 months, which was ok. The enclosure arrived on a crate with everything I purchased. I set it up using their youtube guide to everything exact, problems that occurred: 1-Leaking issues at the two output and input pipes, which took me two days to fix. 
2-The fan and copper radiator system cannot cool the liquid in the box down fast enough. Every 5 seconds, it increased of 0.1 celcius until it reached 75C where my miners are overheating and shuts off. I contacted Tomasz about this issue and was directed to Maciek Szadkowski, whom was the CTO at DCX. Maciek was the main person created the enclosure to sell to the public, he emailed me back and asked me to contact him on Whatsapp so he could assist me to resolve my overheating issue, instructed me to take all the pictures and tell him all the temperature of the place I put my miner setup in, which was my garage at 25C, I also bought a AC unit blowing 15C directly towards the fans to try to cool the liquid down faster but it still didn’t work. 

He wanted me to try to move my miners around in the enclosure in a different pattern, which didn’t work. Then days later, he wanted me to try a different direction, which also didn’t work. I tried everything he asked, to at this point I’m wondering if this enclosure even works at all, if he works then why would he want me to try this and try that? Then he wanted me to put my fan/radiator outside of the garage, which was 37C-40C outside instead of 25C outside, because he said outside temp, even though 37C in the hot sun would cool the unit down better than inside the garage which was 25C, which absolutely made no friggin sense whatsoever. I was only able to get 1 of my miner working in the enclosure at 45-50C constant temp, with a separate AC unit blowing 15C freezing air at the radiator, if I put in 2 or more, it wasn’t able to cool it down fast enough, it’ll reach 75+C in 20-30 mins and all my miners shut down automatically due to extreme heat. 

After talking to him back and forth for days trying to resolve this issue, I asked him if they have any proof of concept of it working properly? He said nope. So they basically created this enclosure not even know that it’ll work, Maciek just says it works but they don’t have any proof of it working. I asked them to make me a video of them putting miners into their enclosure and showing me the temp proving their system works, Maciek said he’ll do it next week. A week went by, I text him to see how it’s going with the proof video, he saw my message but didn’t reply, so I text him a couple of days later and still, no reply and now he’s ignoring me without any replies.

Conclusion: They are selling Liquid Cooling Enclosures for Miners that supports 8 miners in their enclosures without any PROOF that it works at all. We are the BETA testers for them, costing me $6000 to BETA test for them. I don’t know what to do at this point, I’m extremely devastated by this, I wired $6000 to them and I don’t know who to contact to get my money back or at least half of it. Anybody out there know how to deal with this problem, please let me know. This is a message to all those trying to buy an enclosure from these DCX people, they don’t have any proof this thing even works. They are scammers, beware.",1589758923,8,1

2. You will get a free mining wallet with details sent to your mailbox. The mining wallet is used for your mining and the wallet ID is your identification on the network. Take total control of your wallet by;
a. Changing your default password to a permanent one
b. Enable your 2FA code 
c. Verify your email address
3. Deposit your funds into your mining wallet to activate the mining. Ensure you inform the agent in charge of the mining to activate your mining cycle.

1.  MLM/Ponzi Scheme to earn
2.  Transition to Node Validation to earn
3.  Actual functioning crypto

Their goal is to eliminate the stupid, wasteful period of “mining” for the sake of mining.  They also hope to eliminate all the other shitty things that evolved in the Buttcoin realm (exchanges, centralization, fraud).  That’s a win in my book, even if it’s hopelessly ambitious.  The downside is that all the initial coins are mined by spreading word about this crypto and generating unique new members.  Yes, this is my thinly veiled recruitment post...

But in all seriousness I’m coming here because I know you will be brutally honest and show me where this thing sucks.  Basically they’re going to spread the word and reward signups the same way that Herbalife rewards shameless product pushers.  After enough people have signed on and are running nodes, they will stop rewarding “Ambassadors” and only reward those validating transactions.

For now, it hurts me 0% to open the app and see what the hell happens.  I already checked in going/outgoing data, battery consumption, GPS, etc and it has lived up to its promise of not leeching anything.  You just check in by tapping once, and that earns you the coin.  No actual “computational farming” because it’s just a silly MLM scheme.  Still, I’m skeptical.  I can’t put my finger on what’s actually wrong here.  Chances are it’s just beyond my narrow understanding.

I've done research about quantum computing and it's capabilities and it's not looking too good for our beloved cryptocurrency because it might have a security flaw. With quantum computing the SHA-256 (that encrypts Bitcoin) encryption algorithm can be broken later in the future with the advancements with quantum computing. I'm not saying it's going to happen tomorrow but there is a chance that encryption protocols are going to have to change to ensure the integrity of bitcoin and it's future. This is hypothetical though, not to fear monger or troll but this needs to be a discussion on which people can share opinions about this topic and come up solutions to prevent encryption keys to be solved by in which the government or tech companies like Google, Amazon, etc can crack. I feel that this is important to discuss about and I care about the future of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and it's contributers and holders.

This undermines the security and sustainability of the network, which is all based in mining profits. With each halving event, miners become more and more dependent on transaction fees, until the subsidy is removed entirely and transaction fees is the ONLY income miners will generate. It's a ticking timebomb under Bitcoin - scale or die.  


Miners don't just secure the network out of the goodness of their hearts, it costs a lot of money in electricity. This is the paradox of a system like lightning - it is supposed to enhance Bitcoin by making traffic happen off chain, but instead it undermines all the economic incentives that make Bitcoin work to begin with.

gp8m6l,Jack1602,Technicality on how boosting fees works,"There's this one technical detail that has been haunting me since I first learned that you can boost your transaction fee after sending a transaction to the network, and I can't find an easy answer anywhere. Let me develop with an example:

I send a transaction with a fee of 1sat/byte, but after a couple of days waiting I check the mempool and I see the average fee is 50sats/byte.

I decide to boost the fee to 300sats/byte. What is exactly that happens, and how do miners behave?

Say the ""yeah sorry I kinda wanna pay more now"" transaction is sent and propagated and it reaches all nodes and miners. For the example's sake, pretend a miner has been mining an already constructed block for 7 minutes when they listen to my transaction. I can think of either of the following happening:

   1) The miner says ""ok noted, I'm busy mining this now but you're high up for the next candidate"". This means if you boost a transaction it will never be included in the next block, and the earlier you could see it would be two blocks from the moment you boost it.

   2) The miner listens to the transaction, and thinks it's worth adding it to the current block. However, this means altering the transactions list and building a new merkle root for the header. Doesn't this also mean the miner has a smaller chance of finding a solution for the new block though? If after 7 minutes mining a block at speed X you already tried Y hashes unsuccesfully, that means the amount of nuances left to try are Y less than the total amount you could try (Z), so chances of finding a good one would be 1/(Z-Y). If the miner decided to start from scratch with a new block just to include my transaction, it would ""only"" have 1/Z chances of finding a block so it would be in disadvantage with competing miners from option 1). The question is, is this what really happens but Z&gt;&gt;&gt;Y so in practicality building a new candidate block and losing the work already done is not a big deal? This would mean your transaction could get confirmed in the next block after you increase the fee.

Which of the two is the one miners usually do? Or I might be missing something and there's more options, feel free to chip in!

gp7it1,FLNI,I Am Stupid Without Bitcoin,"As a devoted autodidact, I believe in learning through doing. More so, I believe in *learning through pain*. And when it comes to investing in bitcoin, I believe in this more than anything. 

There are two kinds of people: those with skin in the game, and those without. 

The have-bitcoiners and the have-nots. 

Let’s look at this proposition to understand the context: 

&gt;**This evening, go through the small print of 7 financial documents.** 

If you were an investor, you would go through all these documents. And you wouldn’t consider it boring. If you were not an investor, you would come up with a thousand other things to do instead.

My knowledge of technical matters like PoW, the issue of bitcoin’s scalability, energy consumption, hard forks, etc, didn’t come out of curiosity. It neither came as a natural pathway from what led me to discover bitcoin in the first place, which was the essence of sound money and all of bitcoin’s intertwined links to the Austrian School of economic thought.

All my acquired knowledge came from the simple adrenaline rush of emotions that comes with investing in bitcoin, assuming all of its risks, and reading everything I can about it. 

What I just explained is the switch that happens when you become a have-bitcoiner from a have-not. When there’s a risk, complicated things become effortless to analyze. 

Rabbit holes become bigger and easier to fall into. If I were to sell all my bitcoins, I would keep the strength I mustered from all the heavy lifting of material that’s out there. But I would still become dumber. That’s why autodidacticism is a way better option.

**Especially** compared to having to go to school with a bunch of dumbasses.

I have been trying to understand a little bit more about private keys, im still a lil bit confused, i keep all my crypto in different exchanges and i read that when you keep your crypto in an exchange i dont own the private keys am i right?
Also how can I get my own private keys? Should i make a wallet first and after making my wallet I will automatically get as well a private key? Do i have to make a wallet for Eth, another one for btc and another one for Ltc? Or can i keep all of them in the same private key
And last question 😄 haha. If I have for example someone else private key what are the steps to get the crypto from that private key? Do i need to now as well the public key? Or if i write my private key in a paper and my computer gets erased how do i get my crypto back by just knowing my private key?

The aim is to create a simple social platform other than Twitter/Reddit which is great in its own way, but a place that is anonymous, virtual and has a fun aspect to it.
Another positive thing is that it will aid in adoption and awareness. There will be no ranks to create a fair distribution of opinion. I myself learned about bitcoin through the game back in the day by complete chance, and i hope to bring that to other People.

goqcsk,CryptigoVespucci,The Institutional Case for Bitcoin,"**Why Bitcoin?**

Central bank driven monetary debasement will boost institutional demand for store of value assets like gold and silver. But why Bitcoin? What makes it different from other politically neutral, scarce monetary stores of value? 

The answer lies in Bitcoin’s sovereignty, its secular tailwinds, and its upside.

**Sovereignty**

*Kings and Queens used to be sovereign, then nation states became sovereign and now, for the first time, a humble computer platform has the aspiration to be sovereign. That is potentially revolutionary.* **- Wences Casares**

Bitcoin is the first computing platform with the sovereignty of a nation-state. It’s the only monetary asset in the world with absolute scarcity. This scarcity is assured by a massive, global ecosystem of independent and diverse participants who run the Bitcoin protocol. While there are many clones that promise limited supplies, Bitcoin is the only that does so credibly. 

No one can be prevented from using the Bitcoin blockchain to store and transfer value. In times of rising geopolitical tension, this is especially important and can’t be said for national currencies held in banks, which can and have historically been restricted and/or expropriated. 

Unlike monetary metals, bitcoin can be sent across the world in just hours and securely stored with just a seed phrase. This can be done in amounts large or small, providing a massive upgrade over metals. 

Bitcoin is the first digital, politically neutral store-of-value the world has ever seen and its arrival couldn’t be more perfectly timed. 

**Secular Tailwinds** 

Money is going fully digital. 

China’a Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) began testing this year and despite initial regulatory headwinds, Facebook’s Libra is moving forward with a full head of steam. When these projects launch, they will expose billions of people to cryptocurrency related technologies. 

These projects will get people comfortable with using cryptocurrency wallets and create massive on-ramps into more decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Combine this with a younger generation who’s expressed more openness toward cryptocurrencies and you have a recipe for mass adoption.

**Upside** 

While the macroeconomic conditions create a positive outlook for precious metals, investors will be drawn to bitcoin because there is simply more upside. 

Bitcoin is not a company. It is a money. Monies are valued in trillions, not billions. 

The total value of above-ground gold, which has limited industrial use, is valued at more than $10 trillion. The total value of all the base fiat money in the world is worth nearly $20 trillion dollars. Add in the total value of the global narrow money supply (demand deposits and checking accounts) and that number is $40 trillion. 

Investors will be drawn to Bitcoin because there are few opportunities with as much asymmetric upside. **To reach gold’s current market cap alone, Bitcoin would need to rise 63x from its current levels.**

https://preview.redd.it/uzml4h06ed051.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79fdbfa568e83dbce22482bc66f87296b796038d

The truth remains that no one really knows what lies ahead for Bitcoin. With that said, its strong fundamentals, resilience in the face of economic uncertainty, and growing importance in today’s macroeconomic climate merits a look from all investors. What they do from there is anyone's guess.

gmyyde,LastofUsGr8testEver,Few questions for BTC newcomer,"Before I get downvoted to hell or rude comments, yes, I googled a bunch of this.  But the problem with many BTC discussions is they are a little above my understanding.  The only reason I want BTC is I don’t trust the US dollar.  So it is scary buying someone you can’t quite grasp.  I bought in at the 5k range so overall it has paid off (so far, BTC gives and takes I am learning). 

So questions follow.  Sorry if any are dumb. 

1. Can someone steal from me if they get my wallet address?  I never leave money or BTC on an exchange.  But if they got my hardwallet address can I be looted. 

2.  I use a reputable hard wallet (Trezor).  Is this safe?  I leave it disconnected, have my seed words wrote down and in a very secure area, and never wrote down my pin.

gmyg8n,jon_crypto,Unpopular opinion: Bitcoin won't be in the top 3 by market cap in 5 years,"Yes you heard me. And yes I know this won't be a popular opinion on this channel. 

Bitcoin is constantly touted as being ""digital gold"" and a ""store of value"". And for these reasons people say it will always be the top crypto, also due to its OG status. 

It's compared to gold for one reason - it's scarcity. But does it have other similarities? No. People seem to forget that gold had and still has intrinsic value, that is - it's shiny, it symbolises wealth and most importantly, it's a physical asset like no other in the universe. 

Bitcoin? Sure, it's supply is limited but what can it offer humans other than a number on a computer screen? 

In my opinion, and is it only my opinion, a time will come (I would say in the next 5-10 years) where at least a handful of ""altcoins"" will develop and out grow bitcoins market cap. Maybe they already exist or maybe they are just an idea at the moment. 

But one thing is for sure, they will offer so much more than what bitcoin can. They will solve real issues which will force large scale adoption. We all know that bitcoin has huge limitations for mass adoption, and these aren't likely to be solved. 

So we're back to the store of value being the only reason it would continue to dominate. Is this enough? 

Maybe to keep it in the top 10, but not number 1.

The question is, who will take over?

But as we envision Bitcoin becoming a widely adopted store of hard value and hedge against fiat currency shenanigans, I think would be enlightening to keep an eye on a new dominance metric: Bitcoin's market cap as a fraction of the total market cap of all truly ""hard"" and \~fixed resources like gold and other precious metals.

As Bitcoin becomes accepted as a more convenient and accessible store of value vs gold and other precious metals, you can imagine how the overall ""total store of value market cap"" pie could grow, and also shift from precious metals to Bitcoin.

By my rough math, Bitcoin dominance in the ""total store of value market cap"" asset universe stands around &lt;2%.  Exciting to think about Bitcoin's headroom there over the next 10+ years.

I am 32 years old, have only been employed with a ""real"" job for 4 years, fucked off a lot in my 20s. I now have about \~$40,000 in my 401k. I am about to invest about $6,000 into BTC. My extra cash I am hanging onto as I have a child and another one on the way and just need that cushion.

Another variable in the equation is that I am lucky enough that I will be receiving an inheritance of a few hundred thousand in cash (3-5), but due to the way the trust was set up, I will likely not receive it until my 50's. The reason I bring this up is that this is an obvious nice financial cushion for me to fall back on.

Now, considering I am a believer in BTC, I wanted to hear some perspectives on taking some of the money in my 401k with the 10% penalty to invest in BTC. Obviously I am losing out on the compounding interest of this money invested, but due to the fact that I already will have a retirement cushion, and the chance BTC could sky rocket, what are some thoughts on the pros/cons of this?

About 2 years ago, when I was in grade 9 or so, I approached my parents regarding BTC &amp; told them how it has amazing use cases &amp; how it’s built on the principles of decentralisation. I was immediately told that all of this is total bullcrap &amp; how I should ‘focus on my exams’ more. I told them that it was the perfect time to get onto it &amp; invest money into BTC. I was ignored. Well, also because the Indian government had given a bad rep to crypto industry as a whole &amp; sold the ‘it’s only for criminals’ narrative &amp; they announced a blanket ban. 

About a year later, India legalised all crypto &amp; it was the most amazing thing ever. I proved my family wrong and proved to them how this tech isn’t just a ‘fad’ or a criminal thing. (They’re still not taking it seriously though xD). 

Nonetheless, I also joined this Telegram group where I’ve earned around 999 Satoshis (very less, I know) but I hope when I start earning on my own, I can do some good things with crypto. I just felt like sharing this, hope you enjoyed!

The United States House of Representatives is now spearheading an effort to delist Chinese stocks from the US markets, claiming that they have long been able to benefit from US listings without the companies having to abide by the same rules as domestic companies.

If the government is successful in their move to delist these companies, it could provide a major boost to Bitcoin as more Chinese citizens turn to crypto to escape the mounting economic turbulence.

Ironically, this effort is being driven by Representative Brad Sherman – an outspoken critic of Bitcoin and other digital assets.

Tensions Between US and China Mount as Government Moves to Delist Chinese Stocks

The ongoing global pandemic has largely been blamed on China by officials within the US government, who now appear to be taking actions to increase the country’s accountability.

In a recent interview with MarketWatch, Representative Sherman noted that “it’s time for China to blink first” while speaking about his newly introduced “Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.”

Rep. Sherman, who has long been an adversary of Bitcoin and crypto in general, explained that this newly introduced act isn’t being floated with the goal of desilting Chinese companies from the US markets, but rather to force them to adhere to the US capital-market standards.

“THE PURPOSE HERE IS NOT TO DELIST OR DE-REGISTER; IT’S TO DEMAND THAT CHINA DO WHAT EVERY OTHER COUNTRY HAS DONE AND AGREE THAT IF THEIR COMPANIES WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN U.S. CAPITAL MARKETS, THEY AGREE TO LIVE BY U.S. CAPITAL-MARKETS RULES…TIME FOR CHINA TO BLINK FIRST FOR THE BENEFIT OF INVESTORS,” HE STATED.

If this act is passed, it could create even greater tension between the two countries, potentially having grave impacts on the recently passed trade deal.

Rep. Sherman believes that the bill will be successfully passed before the end of summer.

Here’s How This Could Give Bitcoin a Boost 

Because the delisting of Chinese companies from the US markets could have dire impacts on the country’s economy, citizens residing there may continue turning to alternative investments like Bitcoin to hedge their portfolios.

This growth has been fueled by investors in China and other countries moving to add USD exposure to their portfolios.

The imminent inflation that the US dollar will soon see, however, may also lead some of these investors to convert their USDT into Bitcoin in order to avoid the impacts of the United States’ immense money printing, thus giving BTC a major boost.",1590690785,20,1

gsap83,nikolaiteslovich,My Attempt at an Analogy. Feedback would be greatly appreciated.,"So, what even is this Bitcoin? Bitcoin is like a book. Transactions, the transfer of Bitcoin from one address to another address are the lines in the book. A page from the book can hold thousands of lines. In order for transactions to be valid, a page with those transactions has to be added to the book. How do you add pages, or blocks, to the book? Once a page gets filled with lines, a special number is generated that depends on the transactions and the special number from the last page through an algorithm. Every line in the page to be is broadcast to everyone who wants to contribute to the making of the book. In order to add a page to the book, you have to find the special number. The algorithm does not work in reverse, so the best way to try and find this special number is to simply guess and check. The algorithm also takes into account how fast the computers can find this special number and changes its difficulty so that a page is added about every 10 minutes. The lucky one who finds the correct special number gets a reward in the form of Bitcoin. The chance of you adding the page depends on how powerful your computer is. Basically, everyone is guessing numbers as fast as they can until someone gets lucky. The guessing and checking are done on some form of a computer, so this reward incentives the book contributors to keep mining by usually covering their electrical costs. If there are conflicting books, the one with the most work put into it is chosen. Every chapter of the book, the block reward, or the reward that comes from adding a page to the book is halved. A new chapter is made every 210,000 pages, or about every four years. With the creation of bitcoin in 2008, this block reward used to be 50 BTC. Now, it is 6.25 BTC. These block rewards are the only way that new Bitcoin is put into circulation. However, since the network has about the same computational power of eBay, Facebook, and Google’s servers combined, the chances of getting this reward is extremely small. In fact, when you perform a guess and check operation, you currently have a 1/15 trillion of a chance to guess correctly. It’s no longer profitable for everyday people like you and me to mine Bitcoin. Don’t worry. There are still plenty of other currencies to mine such as Ethereum or Ravencoin.",1590687282,4,1

gqooye,admin_default,Helping a friend reopen her business with Bitcoin,"A friend of mine owns a hotel inland from Cancun, Mexico and was struggling with expenses related to reopening - if she couldn't foot the upfront cost, she'd go under. I saw an opportunity to help her out and introduce her to Bitcoin, so I offered her a small personal loan on one simple condition: she had to accept it and repay it with Bitcoin.

  
She's not tech savvy and my Spanish is broken so this was also test to see how usable the tech is. All told it took just half an hour end-to-end and $0.41 in transaction fees. Got her set up with an Electrum wallet to transfer the BTC, she had a friend with a Bitso account (Mexico's premier bitcoin exchange) to sell the Bitcoin, and she got MX pesos back from him day-of. 

Bitcoin was literally the only way this loan could work - I'm U.S. based and each repayment installment was small so Western Union's huge fees made it impossible. The hardest part is still the conversion to local currency (no Bitcoin ATMs were nearby and Local Bitcoins was confusing for her- Bitso seems like a really intuitive exchange within Mexico). Hopefully that will improve as more businesses accept BTC payments.",1590460751,5,1

1) My question is, if all inputs produce a unique output, then since so many nonces have been hashed before, do those get skipped?

 2) Now, do only really large numbers produce a hash with so many leading zeros? 

3) What kind of numbers are the current nonces that mined blocks recently, can we find out? 

4) How many leading zeros with the current difficulty is required?

gqk8hn,nohayek,Account Termination: Got scammed by Bitstamp this week (crosspost from r/Bitstamp),"
Hi guys,
i had my Bitstamp account for 2-3 years and it got terminated by Bitstamp this week. I got a mail without further notice saying "" After careful consideration, Bitstamp decided to terminate Your access to Your Account in accordance with our Terms of Use"". I read here that this happens to some costumers, whats super fishy is that I did not have any activites recently, but transfered some money (500€) via bank transfer to Bitstamp before the close. As adviced I noticed Bitstamp that i will transfer the 500€ from my bank account for faster processing. Two days after i did the transfer (before it was actually credited to my bitstamp account), I got the termination. I was not able to log into my account and now I got only 475€ back. As i read here, the 25€ are some sort of cancellation fee. For me that is pure scam. In the past i did do some trades but no huge sums, and they decided that its better for them to just scam the 25€ instead of earning small fees. I mean, i had no activity for months and as soon as I transfer money, my account gets terminated. I would understand if they terminate it because of inactivity, but they just wait till there is money to keep a change for them.  Does anybody has similar experience with Bitstamp? i have insurance for legal expenses and am willing to use a lawyer, even though its just 25€. I don't like to be scammed. For everybody else out here, I advice you to not use Bitstamp. i will also post this in other subs to make people aware of the system behind Bitstamp.",1590443840,10,1

To keep this short and sweet, I won’t go into details on why this happened, but I figure why not post and see if anyone can help...

Like a dumbass, I was sending it to my Cash App Bitcoin wallet (which I will never do again now thanks to this incident). After research, I have found that Cash App does not support BCH. So, in essence, I have exchanged 3.0 XMR (sent to my cash app BTC DEPOSIT address) and it’s just sitting in blockchain because of my dumbass error. Is there a way to retrieve my cryptocurrency? Or was that just an expensive lesson? Any help is greatly appreciated.

gqggy1,HarryRobso,A Beginners Guide To Setting Up A Full Node On Your PC,"Hello there, I thought I would write a quick guide on setting up a full node on your PC as I've seen a lot of posts about full nodes around recently. 

# What is a full node?

*From Bitcoin Wiki:*  ""*Any computer that connects to the Bitcoin network is called a* ***node****. Nodes that fully verify all of the rules of Bitcoin are called* ***full nodes****.""*

Full nodes are essential for keeping Bitcoin in the hands of the people (decentralised). If you want to accept payments in Bitcoin it is also recommended for security reasons that you use your own full node. For more info on full nodes, [click me](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node).

# Hardware Requirements:

Bitcoin nodes can be run on worse specs, but it is recommended that you have the following specification when running a full node on your PC:

* Recent versions of Windows, Linux or Mac OS X.
* 300 GB Storage accessible at 100mb/s minimum. (I recommend closer to 1TB storage for future planning).
* 2GB RAM
* Unmetered  broadband connection (minimum upload of 50 kilobytes per second)

# Getting Set Up:

* To begin, you should go to [https://bitcoin.org/en/download](https://bitcoin.org/en/download). Choose the latest version for your operating system.
* Before you launch the program, you should verify that you have downloaded the official Bitcoin Core and not a malicious version. This step is optional but recommended:
   * [Here is a great guide.](https://gnupg.org/download/integrity_check.html)
* Follow the setup wizard instructions.
* Launch Bitcoin Core.
* Allow Bitcoin core to complete its IBD (initial block download) in which all of the blocks since Bitcoins creation are downloaded to your machine and verified. This could take a long time as at the time of posting the blockchain (all the blocks) total 278GB.
* Add Bitcoin Core to your startup folder (if it isn't already):
   * On Windows 10,  Select the **Start** button, then select **Settings**  \&gt; **Apps** \&gt; **Startup** and make sure Bitcoin Core is checked. This means that Bitcoin Core will start running whenever you start your computer.

Once the blockchain is downloaded and verified you are the official owner of a Bitcoin full node! It's that easy! This guide was intended to be simple and easy to follow. For more in-depth instructions and troubleshooting advice feel free to leave a comment or visit  [https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#what-is-a-full-node](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#what-is-a-full-node).

gqfe0o,BitcoinFan7,Bitcoin as the hardest money is the most powerful tool in your arsenal.,"Holding bitcoin is absolutely critical in order to protect and grow your wealth due to it being the hardest money.  I would expect anyone giving it serious evaluation to have tons of questions but the only way to really ""get it"" is to educate yourself about the nature of money.  The best way to understand money is to read [the Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1119473861/ref=cm_sw_r_em_apa_i_WsEYEb96P0Y4C).

Hardness in this context refers to the ability for the money supply to be inflated thereby devaluing the purchasing power of those that hold the money as savings. 

Historically the hardest money has been gold however Bitcoin has recently surpassed gold in terms of hardness.  Saifdean covers it in great detail in The Bitcoin Standard however he summarizes the main concept in his [Vienna talk](https://youtu.be/Zbm772vF-5M) (starts at about 4:30 and he has a good example of monetary hardness around 11:50).  

Government (Fiat) money is soft money in that central banks have no limits on the amount of money they are willing or able to print and in doing so they reduce everyone else's purchasing power who hold their savings in government currency. 

The US dollar used to be limited in supply because it was pegged to gold meaning you could trade your dollar for a set weight of physical gold.  That is no longer the case which means they have no limitations on the amount of money they are able to print.  Unlimited dollars chasing a fixed amount of goods and services leads to price inflation.  This is reflected in the rising cost of consumer goods, education, health care, housing, etc.  

Eventually with unchecked inflation you get situations, where a society's purchasing power has been [completely destroyed due to devaluation of the currency](https://keripeardon.wordpress.com/2013/06/01/wheelbarrows-of-money-and-the-weimar-republic/amp/) to the point where you need a [wheelbarrow of money](http://chinwag.com/files/images/photos/2342854191_9f4794a1fd.jpg) just to buy goods at market.

[Present situation in Venezuela, money left in the street](https://i.redd.it/5l08hy28rll21.png)

This is what happens when money becomes worthless from hyperinflation and while we aren't there yet in most developed nations it is only a matter of time.  

People who do not take steps to protect themselves from unchecked inflation will find their savings has evaporated in purchasing power even though their bank balance stays the same.  Given the current multi-trillion dollar money printing environment we find ourselves in I don't believe have ever seen a more bullish setup for Bitcoin.

And if you want to talk future projections PlanB's [Stock to Flow Cross Asset model](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/bitcoin-stock-to-flow-cross-asset-model-50d260feed12) is really driving the discussion on the recent set point change to $288k with the recent halving.

PlanB also appeared last week on a great podcast with Saifedean Ammous the author of the Bitcoin Standard and person who brought the concept of Stock to Flow properties of hard money to the forefront.  I would highly recommend [giving it a listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2cP8k_QUaw).

An interactive version of his updated model [can be found here](https://digitalik.net/btc/s2fx#).

gqfdza,djmedakev,Easy way to accumulate...,"Hello all. I've found a way to accumulate btc pretty quickly without much effort. There's a service called Acorns that rounds off your transactions to the next whole dollar amount. I've tied it to all my checking accounts and credit cards. Once the top off balance is over $5, it automatically transfers from my checking to my Acorns account. Every two weeks, I transfer this balance back to my checking account and then buy btc. I've been using Acorns for years, and have always used the balance to splurge, but the past few months, I've been using it for btc and I'm really shocked at how fast I'm accumulating. It only requires a little bit of effort. The Acorns service itself is $1 per month. 

There was a service like this specifically for crypto but they would only transfer once your top offs reached $50 and that didn't work. It's way easier to absorb $10 here $15 there... than $50 a deduction. Also they worked with Coinbase and I think CB is dishonest and predatory on many levels. This service was actually what gave me the idea to try this with my Acorns account. 

Shameless plug: if you sign up for Acorns with an invite code, we both get $. So if interested, dm me and I'll share my code. (Not putting it in the post because that's not really my objective here). 

I think this is only available in the States but I could be wrong.",1590428318,4,1

By asking your exchange to withdraw your bitcoins to the Loop In address instead of you directly, you receive them by Lightning. The exchange won't be able to follow how you spend your bitcoins onchain in any way like a Coin Swap. However, the swap provider may be able to do chain analysis by looking at the closing transaction of your channels (still a lot harder as almost all chain analysis heuristics are broken). 

I would be interested to know if someone did this already and if I am wrong about the fungility of the received bitcoins by Loop In.

I'm a newbie. I bought my first (portion of a) bitcoin last month and set up a hardware wallet along with it.

I want to start investing a portion of my paychecks into Bitcoin, but I want to be smart about it. I'm trying to create an Investment Multiplier Calculator for myself that is dependent on current market conditions. 

For example, if it's a bull market but the current price is at a 3-day low, I'd like to invest 150% of x. If it's a bear market and at a 3-day high, I'd like to invest 50% of x. (The 50-150% is just for the example. I'm not dead set on a % range quite yet.)

I imagine this could be accomplished by factoring in various length ""running averages"" against the ""current market price,"" but beyond that I'm stuck.

Just wanted to discuss with you all about what is the best possible approach to raise funds in this current market environment? By this i mean a Token Sale. So it can be a ICO or an IEO.

What kind of market strategy needs to be followed?

What are things with regard to the Investors that drive them into a Token sale?

Posting this, Marketing firms eat up a lot of unnecessary money and do very little hence i wanted to know everything on my own to create my own strategy in case it is required.

P.S: Now there will be many people commenting below that ICO, IEO market is dead and bla bla. But no, it is not, instead it has been cleaned up. The investors are smart now, projects with real products survive now.

It goes into an account linked to a coinme wallet. I’ve seen exchanges get hacked before on the news, and my understanding (correct me if I’m wrong) is that so long as their security is good this is unlikely, but if something does happen then I risk losing my money.

Has anyone had any bad experiences with Coinme? In the few times I’ve used it I found it easy and simple to use and didn’t have any problems. I even once made a mistake with the purchase and couldn’t access the money, and their customer service verified my identity before helping me, which leads me to believe that they take security pretty seriously.

Is it a bad idea to store coins in the account they gave me, or should I transfer them into a personal wallet?",1590057656,3,1

“In its defence, BlockFi claims it over-collateralizes its loans (in this case with fiat) and requires short termination windows for its lending contracts to other institutions.....Yet even given these precautions by BlockFi, there remains the possibility that bitcoin prices soar unexpectedly and institutions aren’t able to pay back the bitcoin. Their models would then, in theory, terminate the loan contract and market-buy bitcoin with the fiat collateral to cover the gap. “

I thought the loans were collateralized with BTC (in exchange for fiat) and were over-collateralized via a 20-50% LTV.  What is this fiat over-collateralization? Is BlockFi setting aside its own reserves for losses on the loans to pay back the interest accounts in the event of default?

Also, i don’t understand the point about institutions not being able to payback the btc because of soaring prices.  Aren’t the loans in USD and therefore payable in USD?  Wouldn’t a soaring BTC be good because the collateral was gaining in value?  Thanks!",1590057220,9,1

gnsqlg,OkOkay,My Story of BTC,"This is my story of how I derped around during the last BTC bubble, made some dough, and saw my friend pile up a mountain of debt on himself, only to become a millionaire. I hope if you read it there is a moral somewhere, but I'm not so sure there is. (prices are approximate to dates, going back in my memory a bit)

**OCT 2011: (BTC $4) (preface)**

As an undergrad computer science major I mined a few coins in a cyber security class . It took about 2 months and I think it was around .89 BTC or something like that. I think it was worth about $8 worth at the time. I thought this was really cool, but also remember at that time you couldn't do anything with it, especially where I lived. I just kind of forgot about it, got a new laptop sometime later, and eventually chucked that one with the coins on the hard drive...  (it was just $8 and I had no way of spending it remember) oh well so much for those. Who knows how many coins were lost by these standards back in those days. I take in all the maths, graduate with marks, drink all the beer, laugh with friends, fun times.

**May 2015: (BTC $234)**

Fast forward.. I end up in Los Angeles, CA through another long set of tales.  I live with aspiring actors and film makers grinding it out as waiters and bartenders. They are good mates and take me to parties on occasion where we meet all kinds of characters. I end up chatting with a guy (lets call him Bill)  who's nuts about BTC. I explain to him that I know all about it, and he is ecstatic to find someone who understands what he is talking about. I haven't been paying much attention the past years, and he shows me how far its come in tech and price. I smack my forehead, knowing I tossed away 8/10ths of a coin (could have been beer money man). We become friends and talk about Bitcoin pretty regularly.

I don't buy initially, but Bill is giving it all he's got, buying left and right with anything extra dollar he can scrape up. He believes in it. I get so worried that Bill is going to loose what he put in that I just buy a bit (.1BTC) so I will be invested enough to watch it, to know if Bill is up or down. You can guess what happens at this point. Up we go. Bill makes money, I make money.

**June 2016:** **(BTC $661)**

All is well. I am happy that Bill didn't lose his money and hoping he will take and re-invest his earnings in a more diversified portfolio. I'm worried about the \~$100 I made in earnings, like do I file this? (lol younger me)

I meet with Bill for the first time in a while. I'm excited to share our gains. We both show our gains and cheers. He immediately tells me that he is looking at ways of taking out credit to buy more BTC.... WTF? I say. He quickly proceeds to tell me the banks turned him down, but he found out he can just buy BTC with credit cards... so he is filing 7 applications right now to see how many he can credit cards he can open to buy BTC... I think for a second. I do the rational thing. I try to talk him down, but no way. He's doing it. I don't know much about investment at this point, just math and percentages, but thats enough to make me beg him to not do it.... he doesn't listen.

By my estimates Bill purchased a total of $30K worth of BTC with combined cash and credit on hand at (my best guess) an average price of $589 per BTC. I invest what I have to spare from savings to just keep up with the train wreck I am worried about happening to Bill. I think I have .2 BTC at this point just to keep up with his insane position

**August 2016: (BTC $576)**

The first dip comes, and Bill is facing credit card bills with interest rates that will kick in soon (he will not be able to make the minimum payments). We discuss is troubles at this point frequently. I suggest he should liquidate and close the cards. He disagrees, and liquidates only a position large enough to pay the minimums and give him a bit of cash. Not only that but he use the cash to secure short term loans at higher interest in order to re-invest to make up the losses. I once again beg him to re-consider, but no... this is his path. I once again invest more to keep up with it, so I can keep up with Bill and his well being. I purchase a good bit more and have .5 BTC

**November 2016: (BTC$758)**

I move to another city and mostly forget about my interactions with Bill. He messages me a few times about the price going back up and being bullish about it once again. I do the same song and dance of trying to warn him to close his cards and positions to get out while he can. Nope he's holding strong. Nothing to be done. I assume I can't do anything to help this situation. Once the price busts above $900/BTC even I can't say anything. I've made money, he's made bank. I feel happy for him, but once again concerned. I know he is running on margin and don't want him to get sucked in, but I also don't want to weigh in on such a big investment at this point. He texts me about the gains, I mostly just give the thumbs up back, knowing I can't back down at this point, but I don't want to be around him if it falls.

**Jun 2017: (BTC $3000)**

I have mostly lost touch with Bill because I move to another city. I never sold my BTC though, and I never forgot about him. Around Feb. 2017 I visited LA and saw Bill. I thanked him for making me the money that I held now in BTC. I asked him what he was doing with his stake. As always he was ready for the apocalypse  to happen and for his BTC to be the only currency left somehow. He was holding stone cold. I wasn't persuading at this point, hell, I was holding myself.

**Dec 2017: (BTC $16000)**

While I thought I would never be swept up in the chaos that is BTC... I was. The amount of BTC I hadn't sold (.3BTC) was making even me feel like a genius. I had made so much money off just forgetting about something over months at a time. I often thought about Bill, but I didn't envy, in fact I really hoped he had paid off his credit card debts and was sitting on his fat profit. I watched BTC Youtube channels and debated if we would go to $100K or if this was it. I couldn't take the pressure and sold half my position @ around $16K/BTC

**2018-2019 (BTC $20K -&gt; $3.5K) (Epiloge)**

In early 2018 price went up to $20k before quickly falling back to 10K. Thankfully I sold the rest of my position on the way down at about the same point as on the way up ($16k). I bought a few back in  2019 but have never really put as much capital back in as I made. As for Bill, well I told you at the beginning. Bill is a millionaire. My best estimates based on my text with him is he cashed out @ around an average of $17k/BTC.  Even after taxes, he ended up real nice. I don't know if he was in the run up in 2019 but I must assume he was.

gns894,Zemunsta,A Metric System for Bitcoin,"If Bitcoin ever reaches that inevitable $100,000 per BTC in a few years, I definitely anticipate the rise of a metric system using satoshis. Here is my take on how it would work.

|1 Satoshi = 1 sat|1337 Satoshis = 1337 sats|
|:-|:-|
|1000 Satoshis = 1k sats = 1 Kilo Satoshi|36,900 Satoshis = 36.9k sats|
|1,000,000 Satoshis = 1m sats = 1 Mega Satoshi|420,000 Satoshis = 420k sats|
|100,000,000 Satoshis = 1 Bitcoin|6,900,000 Satoshis = 6.9m sats|

If there are 2 or more zeros at the end of the satoshi, the metric should be bumped up to Kilo Satoshi up to 1 decimal place.

If there are 5 or more zeros at the end of the satoshi, the metric should be bumped up to Mega Satoshi up to 1 decimal place.

* I think miners often look at fee/WU and CPFP ancestor / decedent relations
* I think that `minRelayTxFee`, and `FeeFilter` ignore CPFP

To restate, I think each Tx must meet the requirements for `minRelayTxFee`, and `FeeFilter` on its own merits and without segwit considerations.  But using segwit and CPFP may make a Tx more attractive to a miner, who is ultimately the one that matters.

gnk0sf,Frednn,Technical question about a bitcoin transaction,"Hey guys. so ... i was wondering ... imagine this scenario

we have 5 parties ; A , B , C , D and E


each have a different bitcoin address, and their own corresponding private keys, and each account has one UTXO

a transaction is created, spending all the 5 UTXOs and moving the coins to 5 different addresses ( each party controls one of the new addresses .... like a  coinjoin, if you will)



all 5 parties have to sign the transaction for it to be valid. 
If one party refuses to sign, the transaction is not valid and will be rejected because it is missing a signature, right ?


now my question is, Can the party that refused to sign, alter the transaction in a way that his utxo remains unspent, but the transaction becomes valid ? in other words, can he misuse other parties' signatures to get some coins in his new address without spending his own UTXO ?


I'm sorry if its not clear enough. English is not my first language.

gr9zf4,byITuseITbrkITReddIT,Why my business wont adopt Bitcoin (unless you talk me out of it).,"Hey guys this is a very rambling thought not very well structured conversation about using crypto to fund a Holiday as it pertains to the accommodation sector.

I have been thinking that companies who believe in the concept of crypto could accept Bitcoin as a form of payment then at the end of every day cash out the majority of the money into cash to pay wages upkeep shareholders etc. For me and my business I would be happy to keep 10-20% of a booking in crypto knowing that if we all did this (all being a small minority of forward thinking technology minded business owners) we would help to increase the adoption of bitcoin and the value of our gambled money would theoritically increase.

So if we accept Bitcoin in theory our cancellation policy would still apply. So say someone books a $1500 stay at my business and the value of the coin doubles the person could cancel within thirty days and I would have to give him his money back but would it be at the rate when he booked or at the new higher rate. Similarly if it dropped and I now have less Bitcoin then when they paid for the room they now have scored a sweetly cheap holiday.

It just seems like you would have to have a ridiculous policy in place that was either unfair towards the consumer (which would make them less likely to purchase a trip with Bitcoin) or unfair for the business owners which (if a small business running close to the wire on a good day) could be the difference between being open or closed.

Not to mention there would be fees associated with the changing of Bitcoin which either means they have to pay a premium to pay with Bitcoin or we would lose money on the room.

So when I play all this through my head it seems like it it much more complicated, risky and more likely to leave either a bad experience for us (which hurts us financially) or bad for the customer (who then 1 stars us which also hurts us financially).

The only other way I can think of adopting crypto payment method into our business is to have one of our rooms where we only take crypto payments then we just hold that money and hope it gets better with age when we need it or use the profits from other rooms to cover expenses when the Bitcoin experiment fails (as we could probably afford to cover one rooms expenses if we made no money off it). The only reason I would do it was if:

There was a market of people who based their holiday on where they could stay and pay crypto (but why would they if there is going to potentially be added expense to pay). 

Or every other business in the industry was doing it as well (it was so highly adopted in a hot industry that the value had a damn good chance of increasing over time).

I don't really know what will come of this post. The Bitcoin sub has really declined over the years. I have watched this from early on without ever putting any of my own money on the line (for better or for worse). Anecdotally I had considered putting $1000 in early on when it was super volitile. I kick myself a little but also know I wouldn't have weathered it going down to almost zero and I would have pulled most of it out before it hit its crazy limits. The best case worse case for me would have been losing $500 or making $2000 or so. 

So yeah thanks for reading it would be interesting to see if things are being done to mitigate the risk for this area.",1590542368,8,1

At a most basic level: how can bitcoin get to a point where a computer-illiterate grandma can become easily onramped, feel her funds are safe, and has confidence to send/recieve/pay for things?

It seems as though worrying about teaching newcomers about public/private key security is not an imperative in specific terms of growing global adoption. Is that a fair conclusion to draw? 🤷‍♂️

I've read a lot about this transition happening over time most likely in congruence with hybrid crypto/credit/debit cards that allow the user to maintain their current ""plastic card"" understanding of banking whilst also dipping their feet into crypto. 

This has pro and cons as many feel that such a transition makes things easier but slips away from full decentralization that we seem to covet so vitally in this space.",1590522702,9,1

Even though, Bitcoin being the premier speculative asset brings in late adapters to Bitcoin, they are not there for Bitcoins ultimate purpose which, is to destabilise BS. (a.k.a. Gov and Fed) So with that in mind and to play to the animal instincts of consumers who are motivated by money for the largest part, I suggest we take a lesson from banks and how they coxed us to use credit cards. That is, by way to credit card offers. Credit card issuers spend some of their income from merchant fees on offers to consumer. Which is akin to spending some of the mining income on offers to Bitcoin users. But it is not as if miners are footing the bill for all this and much like with credit cards, increased adaption will benefit them more than anything.

no clue how, but transfering from my trezor I always set up on highest speed, now it scrolled down to economical. Its been like 8h and the transaction is still stuck:

Is there any way to speed it up? I've read some, i submitted to some sites free of charge, but nothing happened.  Need that money faster, I can pay extra.  


Replace by fee out of question, I've read some about child transaction but I dont understand that. Receiving end is a big exchange, so no way I can do them to do anything.  


Is there any way to speed this up? Thanks",1588264571,17,1

Is the best way to transfer back to Coinbase, convert to Fiat and then send to PayPal? I guess I would pay a lot of fees but Coinbase has been convenient for me so far.

I have not linked my bank account directly, just added my credit card to Coinbase and bought with the high fees associated.

The pandemic, lockdown, stock market crash and pump, helicopter money, unemployment, the great oil drop and now the halving. I have a feeling that the halving is coming with changes that will send a shockwave to the bitcoin ecosystem. 

But what I'm more interested in and the question I've been asking myself is that ""what are the opportunities for common folks who have not got the balls to maintain a hodl position or gamble on exchanges?""  Besides the potential to make a profit by buying bitcoin and hodling, what are the other opportunities that exist for bitcoiners in these historic times?

gcxryw,INDCVIP,Arthur Nakamoto：World Bitcoin Token（WBT） Cryptocurrency for World Adoption," In 2008, the global financial crisis ""Global Financial Crisis (GFC)"" broke out, and my brother Satoshi Nakamoto successfully created the first ""virtual currency"" that has never been seen in human history, and has since been used on a large scale In your real life and portfolio.  


Human thoughts have never stopped moving forward, and ""cryptocurrencies"" or ""blockchains"" have not yet been adopted by them on a large scale. It is because they know that this is the opposite of the actual ""governmentism"" and even ""industry monopoly"". They will not allow such things to control or guide him, but may force it into a semi-open state.  


And fanatical geeks and liberal people have long longed for and believed in a special ""currency""-""Bitcoin"".  


At this point, cryptocurrencies have also ushered in a large-scale prosperity in the past 10 years. Everyone has experienced ignorance, market madness, and bubble burst.  


The early apostles realized the unprecedented billions of wealth in their lives by virtue of poor information and belief. Some choose innovative technologies and others focus on encryption tokens. Promoting every industry innovation and economic movement, and some are actually deceiving the trust and support given by people, or even controlling the entire industry with one hand, which brings indelible losses to everyone and breaks the trading interests of many parties.  


Fortune is shuffled again, the top players have disappeared behind the scenes, be careful of his hands!  


Now I stand up with responsibility and courage to resist their hypocrisy and vulgarity and condemn their bad behaviors. Will lead you to build a truly decentralized, shared governance economic token.  


On behalf of the Nakamoto family, I sincerely thank the world ’s hundreds of millions of apostles and wise men and geeks who are actively involved in the struggle.

gcxgc2,Only_another_pleb,"Bitcoin as an investment or as a currency, and use cases?","This is one thing I haven't had answered, and am hoping someone can provide me with an explanation. This stemmed from a conversation with a friend who works in the tech industry and doesn't think cryptocurrency is useful as a currency or as an investment for the reasons outlined below. I'd appreciate your feedback and thoughts!

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is Bitcoin useful as a currency?

The USD has an inflation rate of roughly 1-3% per year. This provides incentive to invest the majority of your money into the stock market to make your money work for you. However, at 1-3% per year, it's not so great that people are incentivized to spend it ""now"". This encourages people to hold onto some, but to invest most of it. The USD is not very volatile, and so a company, say a grocery store, doesn't bother changing the prices of their products more than once a month generally.

Bitcoin, however, the price can jump or drop 10% in minutes, like what we saw on March 12th, which mimicked the stock market. That doesn't make a great use case as a currency, and makes retailers less likely to be interested in accepting Bitcoin (or non-stablecoins anyways)  as currency over Fiat like the USD. Especially since retail stores generally operate on low margins, so if what you got paid just dropped in value by 10%, they're now operating at a loss.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Is Bitcoin useful as an investment?

There's absolutely great use cases and technology that would interest companies and banks, etc. However, would Visa, Mastercard, Google, Amazon, etc. really want to run a public blockchain? Doubtful. They'd be more interested in either forking a blockchain or creating their own and keeping it completely internal. This would leave out any benefit of crypto as an investment if no 'value' is being sent back into the main blockchains, but just kept internal or private by these corporations and companies. So, where's the value of Bitcoin, or crypto in general as an investment if there's such incentive for companies to run their own private blockchains since they don't want information that could be highly sensitive to be public, or want complete control? This would eliminate crypto as an equity class if equity can't be increased and sent back to those holding onto cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If someone could answer these two questions, and provide arguments or solid reasoning, I'd appreciate it. Otherwise, right now I don't have a lot of confidence in the underlying structure, and it just feels like something running off of hype and the idea that because the technology is so good that companies will come onboard, instead of just make their own and leave the rest of us hanging, so to speak.

I'm also sure things like this have been asked a million times, but after some attempts I wasn't able to find quite what I was looking for, so here goes.


My wife's brother unfortunately passed in early 2017, about half a year before I met her. He had terminal cancer for a few years, and because he was in the military, he received quite a bit of money in his time left. With this money he did a number of things, one of which was a ~$9k PC build. It's a monster.


His parents are not tech savvy in the slightest, so though they held onto his computer, they use it for very basic stuff like browsing Facebook. A shame, I know. However, they *know* that he invested in Bitcoin. They know it was quite a bit of money he put into it, and this was around 2015 in case that helps determine the possible value of his coin.


Anyways, I've poked around his computer a bit and haven't been able to find anything. No text documents with related information, no Bitcoin-specific software. They're thinking of selling his computer, but before they do, is there any chance at all we'd be able to access what Bitcoin he may have had?


Google searches led me in the direction of specialists that can help you access it for a percentage of the findings, but that seems like a risky move. Any advice is appreciated!",1588529898,18,1

 The investor expressed his forecast at a block conference and specified that the first cryptovoltau will show us a historical maximum approximately by the end of 2022 or in early 2023. 

 Draper has been making such an aggressive forecast for the last two years. 

 He has even previously called on some countries, such as Argentina, to make Bitcoin their national currency.  In his view, this will help such countries to rebuild their economies. 

 At an online conference on the block industry, the financier said..: 

 That's my prediction, I stick to it.  I'm sure it will happen, that's what's happening and it's quite funny. 

 Draper shares the view of those experts who believe that the BTC breakthrough will be possible thanks to the monetary policy of central banks, which devalue fiat money.

gdvig5,luxxx75,Bitfinex asks the courts to facilitate the return of $800 million frozen in Crypto Capital accounts.,"The Bitfinex cryptographic exchange has approached federal courts in Colorado, Arizona and Georgia to help it obtain information from banks regarding Crypto Capital's processing service.  The service accounts in the four countries were frozen along with $800 million in Bitfinex client assets, CoinDesk reports.

In 2019, the exchange asked the court to question the former head of TCA Bancorp, who was supposed to have information about the transactions of Crypto Capital.  Then her request was granted.  Now the exchange wants to get information from the banks in order to untangle the scheme of moving assets and then use this data to recover them.  Usually banks don't disclose that information without a court order.

According to Bitfinex, Crypto Capital has allocated its assets to multiple accounts in various jurisdictions, including Europe and the United States.  Only in the US, she says, did Crypto Capital have accounts with SunTrust, Bank of America, Bank of Colorado, Citibank, Enterprise Bank &amp; Trust, HSBC, Stearns Bank, Wells Fargo, TD Bank and US Bank.

""As we have stated before, Bitfinex is a victim of fraud and claims rights to funds taken from Crypto Capital through legal mechanisms in various countries,"" said Bitfinex's General Counsel Stuart Hegner.

Bitfinex began using the services of Crypto Capital because the banks began to refuse to work with cryptographic companies, she writes in court.  Crypto Capital president Ivan Manuel Molina Lee was arrested in Poland in October 2019 on charges of involvement in an international criminal group engaged in money laundering ""from illegal sources"", including ""money of the Colombian drug cartel through the exchange of cryptovalut.  In the accounts in Polish banks were frozen $335 million of Bitfinex fiat reserves, and in Portugal - another $218 million, the company said.

Bitfinex and its sister company Tether became defendants in a New York City prosecutor's office hearing because of the measures they took to recover the loss.  For this purpose, Tether extended a loan to Bitfinex from its own reserves, which were used to secure the USDT stelecoin.  Tether denies the violation and continues to issue USDT.  In the last 40 days alone, the capitalization of the stablecoin has increased by $2 bln and has already approached $8 bln.",1588675530,2,1

I did two transactions earlier and they would show up on Blockchain probably 15-20 minutes after I initiated the transfer, but with this one it's been much longer.

gdsatm,GeorgeTrades,Bitcoin Currency or Asset?,"Discussion Question:

Is bitcoin's future a currency or a asset?

Money is value and it is also a social interaction.  I believe that whatever is backing this note has value so therefore I see it as 1. a means of valid payment and 2. a means of valid payment to the payee. 

Fiat currency is infinite in its ability to be produced, expanded and managed. Bitcoin is not only 21 million bitcoin can be produced. Fiat Currency is backed by GDP, Roads (etc) and the government. Bitcoin is backed by the belief its users put into it. Fiat currency is centralized, fiat currency is not. 

Therefor it is more valuable as an asset like gold rather than a currency.

 Since fiat currency is infinite in its nature the possibilities of its use is endless it will never run out of time or ability to be corrected. What will happen to money in the year 2300 far past bitcoins last mined coin? Well, price will be at a stand still since no more can be created only transferred people will either sell all their shares or hold them as a secured fortune. 

Fiat currency is backed by the faith of the government an entity used to control the people, enforce laws and seek justice against anyone who commits crimes against the state. By decentralizing a currency you are taking this power away from the government on paper that sounds nice but in reality the government will never lighten up power because their purpose is to control, police and regulate.  The government can back the people can't. Plain and simple. Its in the laws of governance the whole purpose we have a government. 

Finally, supply and demand theory because bitcoin has a fixed demand once we run out we cannot make more.  Just like gold once you run a claim dry or the earth dry we cannot produce more organically.  In supply and demand theory as demand rises and supply/quantity stays the same the item becomes scarce and rare therefore driving the price up along the graph.

I'd like to create a wallet, or service, with natural language ability. Basically a chat bot, very similar to https://cleo.ai, but for Bitcoin.

It would help users with signing up with an exchange, explain KYC, help them buy their first Bitcoin etc.

It would also build a contact list of addresses. Help store Bitcoin securely, or help setup API keys to exchanges.

Then the user could say things like:

- ""Send 5 USD to Bob in Bitcoin'
- ""When bitcoin reaches 10k, convert one Bitcoin to USDT""
- ""How many transactions have i made in the last week?""
- ""What is the total value of my portfolio""
- ""Send 1 million sats to my lightning wallet""

etc.

Would this be of interest to anyone? I've got a great name for the service. If there's interest, i'll register the site now, and start this as a side project.

I think he raises some good points regarding scalability, has there been any solutions since he spoke regarding issues with scalability while avoiding centralization? I have seen this discussed a lot but there still doesn't seem to be a consensus two years later.

The other big issue I've always thought of is the whales in bitcoin. I knew it was bad but the fact that 40% of bitcoin is owned by a 1000 people? That is ridiculous. Beyond the manipulation of price, there is the issue that how rich will these 1000 people be if they continue to keep their bitcoins and bitcoin is worth, lets say, 1mil. These people would become the richest on the planet and would in effect become a central agency of bitcoin, like a bank. They'd be able to control and manipulate the price and basically conquer the monetary system.

Thirdly, what about the issue of deflation? Eventually this will become minimal but it is widely agreed that deflation is not good for economic growth. This would stop bitcoin from becoming the worlds leading currency. It may lead to some people storing money into it as a substitute for a savings account though.

I'm not super educated on the matter so try not to attack me, just asking questions and trying to avoid this place being turned into an echo chamber by giving some constructive criticism.",1588655629,21,1

I am an author developing a sci-fi horror set in 2040. There is a crypto component that accounts for a small portion of my sci-fi element. My book is more horror than anything but I want to have a fairly grounded reality so I am doing my research to make sure the smaller parts are well put together. I have been following crypto for a few years and know the basics of using a Trezor and buying/selling.

Anyways, I find the possibilities interesting and see a bright future for Bitcoin and cryptos. I have concerns over the halving and the mining efficiency but that is just me not understanding mining rig efficiency. Even if the mining rigs start to become inefficient, I still see Bitcoin as a store of value.

After many halvings, miners will be paid by transaction fees only and not the block subsidy anymore, blockspace won't be throw away in empty blocks just to collect the subsidy.

And the result will be what we observed today: when a lot of transaction wait to be confirmed, hashrate will significally increases temporaly to supply the blockspace needed resulting in a network capable of increasing its transaction confirmations rate. The more halvings, the more dynamic the network will be and maybe, the less time we have to wait for confirmation during high network activity periods.

So far the book has received positive reviews in [Science](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/books/2020/01/14/a-scheme-of-heaven/), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/11/how-astrology-paved-way-predictive-analytics), and elsewhere. I even give bitcoin a mention in the final, future-looking chapter of the book. I've been a lurker on r/bitcoin for many years, I've gone through some incredible highs and lows with you all, and I always dreamed of sharing this news with you. But now it's your turn!

I just installed Bitcoin Core and have encountered a problem. When I go to Options -&gt; Window there are three options:

\- Hide tray icon  
\- Minimize to the tray instead of the taskbar  
\- Minimize on close

The  first option is selected and the first two options are greyed out. I've  just reinstalled Bitcoin Core (not because of this but because I wanted  the full blockchain instead of a pruned one) so I'm thinking the  problem is with the OS? I'm running Linux Mint Cinnamon 19.3.

I had verify and lodge a police report on [m21globalcentre.com](https://m21globalcentre.com) they confirm it is a scam. It is under police investigation. When you wants to deposit, you will need to transfer to local account number which could be debtor account being used. When you need to withdraw, they will tell you subject to their bank docking side and if the money did not reach you by 3 weeks, get back and check with them. which is by then, they would have transferred your money from one bank to another bank.

As clarify with the investigation team officer, once your money is being transferred to the respective bank account, it is consider gone. Be it you think you make money or lose money in there. 

I understand that you can transfer your funds to another trading platform called ""Huobi"" which is very safe. but there are some steps which you can ask the customer service in Huobi. U need to go under deposit and there is a deposit address (very long address code), copy and paste it in the withdrawal form in M21. Kindly note you have to be careful with procedure. If not your money will be deposit wrongly or gone. Usually in a normal trading platform, it takes with 1 day to deposit into Huobi account

No randomly jumping in front of the line no more! Rather squeeze in and dance with the queue. Forget about physical distancing! Squeeze, and don't let that range of fees grow out of control!

Please meet our traffic controller officer at: [Bitcoin Congestion Manager](https://fee.cryp.ee)

[Bitcoin Congestion Manager](https://preview.redd.it/vferu6wjhqy41.png?width=1910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90ca29f3912530449b8631304e72a947dad449af)

The following is for geeks:

The aim is to organize the queue by spoting non-uniformity on the mempool fee distribution and suggest fees for new transactions that would fill that gap. Over time that produces a somewhat smooth fee distribution and a much more predictable fee market where parties can trully prioritize transactions, and thus have liveness on Bitcoin.

It is mempool depth-based (i.e., queue position), it is reactive. It uses recent past incoming transaction flows, and mined transcation outflows, to estimate velocities parametric on mempool queue position. Based on block poisson statistics it then estimates when on average a transaction paying a given fee will be mined. Error is multiplicative, so if you rely on these for liveness, please stay right at the surface.

We don't have logs. The backend was commitioned by a client over 2 years ago, and it is open-source. We are serving it at our own costs, but it would be nice to eventually receive donations to cover the costs of running the full node server.  Rest and websocket api provided.

Hey guys! Just another cautionary tale to make sure you're not as silly as me!

So how I managed to get to this scam, I was reading a BBC article about Elon Musk and then clicked the embedded twitter link, and was having a browse (I don't use twitter and don't have an account) , and I see a screenshot of Elon musk himself tweeting a giveaway for Bitcoin/Ethereum!

Wow! such a generous act I thought, and I quickly followed the screenshot to a link, It was along the lines of Tesla . gift (Wont put the actual link here) and in hindsight the website was very well made. It had a live ""Tracker"" of how many bitcoins were left and a constant log of all these ""people"" sending bitcoins to an address and doubling their BTC!

I thought I was pretty tech savvy but this was a fat slap in my face haha, The urgency is what got me as there was a ticker slowly going down from 5000BTC , ""quick!"" I told myself as i was scrambling to send all my BTC to a random ass address.

You may think you would never fall for something like this but I was in the exact same position before, and yeah I think it was all of these things combined with the stress that made me throw reason out of the window.

Ive laughed it off and called myself an idiot, and thats all i can do. I havent been discouraged and am kind of glad this happened to me because im sure later down the line i would have fallen for something like this.

I have been thinking about something lately. I was wondering for other opinions.

I use a local CCoin market to onboard and cash out, but I don't really trust them to hold my coins. So i tend to ship them out to other markets, or wallets. in the times where I am sending them to another market like coinbase or binance. I was thinking to instead buy XRP to send and then convert the XRP to BTC on binance to save the BTC transaction fee.

I was wondering if this is actually cheaper as I will have to pay trading fees on binance to convert the XRP to BTC

Been closely following the market throughout the last few months and it feels like I'm watching a movie or something. 

Don't get me wrong, I am a hodler and understand the mechanics of BTC, but I also don't believe in decoupling of BTC from the stock market (as it's clear, BTC growing chart is tightly related to the s&amp;p growth). Which leads me to a thought that this entire show we're witnessing right now is nothing but either a great delusion or a deliberate pump before a massive dump. 

Fundamentals are simply not here, economy is simply not running. What is happening?

Does anyone have the same feeling about it?

gfvfl9,JeremyLinForever,BITCOIN VOCABULARY - which one is correct - halving v. Halvening?,"halving (noun) - reduction by half.

I believed the term “halving” should be used when referring to Bitcoins process of halving every 4 years, and used in conjunction when explaining about the process of reducing the amount of Bitcoins in half.

Halvening (noun) - term made up by the Bitcoin community. Sounds like a mixture of “halving” and “happening”.

As the term explained, I believe this term should be capitalized and used as a proper noun in conjunction with the use of Bitcoin as a specific event that would take place once every 4 years. Thus, because it’s “happening”, it’s the significant event itself that should be celebrated and thus used with a proper noun. Hence, “The Bitcoin Halvening”.

However, it is risky to buy the coin now, analyst Yashu Gola believes that its price will fall after halving.","Bitcoin will catch up with the gold in capitalization and will go up to $400,000 or $500,000, said founder of Morgan Creek Capital Management Mark Yusko in an interview with Youtube channel Altcoin Buzz.  In his opinion, many factors will help the coin price rise, including recognition of the crypt currency by the young generation, improvement of its network characteristics, regulation by the state, etc.

""If the market capitalization of the bitcoin equals that of gold, we will see the price of the bitcoin rise to $400,000, maybe $500,000.  That's going to happen someday,"" Yusko suggested.

He added that in 2021 the main digital coin will cost more than $100,000. However, the price will not rise to new highs immediately after halving, which will be held on May 12.  On the contrary, after the reduction of the coin production reward, it is likely to become cheaper, said the founder of the company.  In his opinion, it will be a result of speculation and playing on the news.

Bitcoinist analyst Yashu Gola also expressed confidence in the decline in the rate of Bitcoin after halving.  The price of the coin rested on a line of resistance, expressed by the downtrend.  It was formed in December 2017 and since then it has been preventing the price of the crypt currency from rising, the expert explained.

He added that the RSI indicator also speaks in favor of a rapid decline in the coin value.  It shows that the BTC is now overbought.  For this reason, the crypt-currency may become cheaper in the near future up to $8500, $8200, at least up to $6300, warned Goal.",1588951541,9,2

I'm doing research on the impact of community on startups success.

I'm looking for information regarding how Dogecoin played a role in Bitcoin's adoption (when we used it to tip people back in the days on reddit/bitcointalk). To my eyes, Dogecoin had a tremendous impact on the rise of Bitcoin and is still largely undermined by people who don't realise this.

If you have any resources, I'm absolutely interested!

Is this a scam?","I have friends and family messaging me about this “Bitcoin Revolution” Autotrader software since I’m known as a resident computer nerd to my family but crypto is something I’ve never looked into. (Not due to lack of interest but lack of ability to invest) 

Recently this software has completely blown up all over Australian news and naturally I immediately was sceptical since it guarantees “free money” and that’s pretty much the oldest scam trick in the book.

giryyn,BTCBlock01,Why are they so narrow minded in r/btc?,"I really can't get the point why these people on r/btc behave in a strange childish way.

They have called it r/btc instead of r/bch and keep believing that BCH is the only thing on earth. I mean that's totally okay, but guess what. Whenever someone is telling things about Bitcoin they get downvoted like there would be no tomorrow. 

Why is there so much hate in this community? Really can't understand it.
I know fanboys from there will come up with ""this is a stupid BTC believer.. high fees.. slow transactions... someone who got downvotes here..."" arguments, but guess what guys: I didn't get any downvotes on your crazy subreddit, I don't complain about BCH. Keep up your imaginations, I don't care, but what I do take care of is peace in this universe. That's what r/btc lacks of.

This made me pensive:
Don't people ever think, that there would be no BCH without BTC? Have they forgotten their roots?
All profit they have is linked to BTC.

If some people from that reddit read this: Do you believe in something like ""coexistence""? Without that there would be no ""holy BCH"". I've also never seen any change on the price chart of BCH which had no correlation to the price of BTC. You guys are still connected to BTC.
It's okay to be a BCH fanboy, but stop that hate. You can keep your BCH and others will keep their BTC. That's legit.
When it comes to transaction fees: A very successful investor once said ""Price is what you pay, value is what you get"". Once you can imagine the real value, you will be willing to pay a certain price.

girhpj,TheHammerJ,When the halving will affect price,"Most big miners sell their bags as future contracts OTC to keep their earnings predictable. We won’t see any supply shock from the halving until the contracts start expiring. Big money likes to buy from these OTC sources which won’t be fulfilling their needs in the next few months. When that happens they will have to buy on spot exchanges until the price of bitcoin meets their normal dollar demand. The price will need to double until the institutional investors can buy OTC(assuming they have the same demand). This spike in price will happen in a very short period of time and bring bitcoin to near all time highs attracting more interest from retail investors. This makes a higher demand which will have to be fulfilled on the recently emptied spot market where only a fraction of the money needed today will move the market. 

Or maybe just like.. stop predicting prices and let the magical internet money do its thing and hodl until bag == lambo",1589342474,5,1

Is this hindering global adoption?","Just getting into Bitcoin and it looks like the idea is to have as many transactions as possible off-chain - no need to record coffee purchases till the end of time. Liquid and Lightning Network appear to be exemplary Level 2 (off-chain) solutions which combine high speed of transactions with high security.

So if I got it right, with just one on-chain transaction you practically get unlimited off-chain tps which is awesome.

However, if you aim for global adoption with billions of users, there is not enough space in ~2MB blocks to on-board so many people to Level 2 in a reasonable amount of time. The Lightning Network whitepaper suggests 133MB as a minimum required block size for global adoption, so even if you apply currently planned optimizations it doesn't look like ~2MB can cut it.

So what is the long-term goal here? Waiting for a blocksize increase to get consensus, i.e. by increases in CPU speed and bandwidths? Or are there other optimizations on the horizon that can enable global adoption of L2 solutions at the current block limit? I was surprised to find that Bitcoin Core roadmap still has a dynamic blocksize cap in it, is this still being pursued?

ggpfdt,kornpow,Block Alert Lightning App -- Get a halvening reminder,"[https://alert.btcmemes.com/addalert](https://alert.btcmemes.com/addalert)  
Hi yall, I made a block alert notification system, which would be used for a whatever you like, but I thought it'd be cool to get a text message when the halving block is mined. 

It costs 222 sats per message, and it is based on [lnsms.world](https://lnsms.world), which I think is pretty cool since the workflow is as follows: users pay me, I keep track of paid-for alerts and the blockchain, and when the block arrives, I pay [lnsms.world](https://lnsms.world) to send a text message anywhere in the world. 

I could've gotten a Twilio account and paid for phone numbers for each country, and also paid by the text, but I didn't have to, [lnsms.world](https://lnsms.world) gets to do that job. Thats the power of the lightning network!!

ggyivg,Jatacid,[ELI5] How does bitcoin/crypto enable debt &amp; growth?,"Hi there, sorry if I'm here with a very newbie question here.

One of the fundamental components of fiat currency is the ability to 'loan' debt, to reinvest and generate productivity.  

This results in a growth of economy and in normal circumstances a debt cycle which needs correction at some point.  

Overall though, the benefits from growth such as quality of life, and investment in great projects - outweigh the negatives that may be bought about by a debt cycle.  
That's assuming normal circumstances. If you have massive QE &amp; printing and pretty much a head-in-the-sand approach to debt, the bubble of debt just keeps getting bigger.

Enter bitcoin - or other fiat replacement cryptos. **How do they try to 'solve' this problem of being able to borrow from someone?** I understand one of the key features is inflation and the ability to get debt bubbles is much more controlled. But I haven't yet wrapped my head around how to facilitate lending practices. Is this something that is baked in to bitcoin?",1589103518,11,1

So within backup you are available to restore your access to BTC.

In the middle of 2019 Bitwala accounts were suspended and the re-opened in begging of 2020. 

So if you have registered within your email you have new account with the same email, IBAN and with the same WALLET password. 

But it is not. 

So if you registered within OLD Bitwala you can loose access to your BTC account even if you have backup. 

There is no option to check do you know your password before you receive any BTC on Bitwala. 

I tried to restore the BTC using Bitwala’s FAQ - [https://support.bitwala.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000857880-How-to-recover-my-old-Bitwala-wallet-](https://support.bitwala.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000857880-How-to-recover-my-old-Bitwala-wallet-) 

It doesn’t work. New version simply doesn’t start on MAC and the previous version doesn’t help either showing an error. 

Bitwala Support didn’t help much.

Once I do backup to all - I checked and figured out that it was only one Bitwala backup from 2017. 

I find more competent contact on Github - Bitwala’s CTO and co-founder [https://github.com/yogiben](https://github.com/yogiben) Ben Jones. 

After explaining the case I got quite fast response. Ben mentioned that 

*It is not possible to change wallet password, only the main account login password. Are you 100% sure that you created a wallet when you first used the account? It should be the case that you can only have one wallet and go through the wallet onboarding once.*

*Unless there is a bug on our side where a wallet got disconnected from your account,* ***it is not possible to go through the BTC wallet creation more than once****.* [*@Alessandro Avagliano*](mailto:alessandro@bitwala.com) *do you want to double check the db?*

And Yes I do sure that I created BTC wallet once I have the backup PDF. 

So according his words - **Bitwala’s wallet password shouldn’t been changed. But it did.** 

As I understood I can get access to my BTC account thru old Bitwala interface [https://my.bitwala.com/login](https://my.bitwala.com/login) 

It’s not possible because my account was linked with Facebook and Bitwala app has status of development mode and I can’t reset my password to log into.  

I opened the case with Bitwala on March 27th. Had an email from CTO on 28th. Today is 11th of May and there is no solution from their side. 

u/bitwala please do something good. 

Thanks.

in hopes that the rally soon would be there.

The newbies were nestled all snug in their graphs,

while visions of lambos danced in their heads.

And Satoshi in his citadel, and I in my node,

had just settled down for a post halving drop.

&amp;#x200B;

When out in the sub arose such a clatter,

I sprang from my wallet to see what was the matter.

Away to blockfolio I  flew like a flash,

tore open the app and watched the alerts.

&amp;#x200B;

The moon on the breast of the 9 thousands memes,

left room for the ""what's gonna happen"" posts of newbs .

When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,

but a 1.5% gain with not much appeal.

&amp;#x200B;

With a little old rally, so lively and quick,

I knew in a moment while watching John Wick.

More rapid than bears the whales swiftly came,

they shorted and leveraged to manipulate.

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh Roubini, oh Griffin, Jack Ma and the banks!

On shitcoiners, On shills and all with BCash!

To the bottom resistance, to the sell buttons quick!

Reminded us to catch falling knives every week.

&amp;#x200B;

As new nodes, that before our very eyes,

where built on our cheap ass raspberry pis,

Out of the sub the bears where driven,

by the sight of a bull who sputed much drivel.

&amp;#x200B;

And then with a twinkling I heard on the roof

The sound of a zip going down with a boom.

As I hovered the sell button, ready to click,

My hands shaking, sweaty, greasy and weak.

&amp;#x200B;

He was wearing his pants with something sticking out,

holding it in his hand, tall, bearded and proud.

A bundle of unfullfilled bets hung from his back,

from when 2019 didn't give us 100k.

&amp;#x200B;

He spoke many a word, that I can't recall,

such were my awe, my surprise and my scorn.

""Last year my genitalia I didn't chop off,

but fear not, for this year my  dick will surely go.""

with promises of eating his ace of clubs once more.

For months now, the entire Bitcoin community has been waiting for this great day. This incredible expectation has now surpassed the cryptocurrency world as shown by the explosion of search volume for the term “Bitcoin Halving” on Google.

This Monday, May 11, 2020, Bitcoin third Halving will take place.

A lot has been written about this third Halving. Nevertheless, some people still ask me questions about what the Bitcoin Halving is. To help you get ready, I give you in 5 minutes the keys for understanding everything about this third Bitcoin Halving.

Bitcoin’s Monetary Policy is Predictable and Transparent

Bitcoin supply is finite. There will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins in circulation. This limit is written into Bitcoin’s source code, and it cannot be changed without a consensus within the community.

Concretely, this limit of 21 millions will never change, because it is an incredible strength of Bitcoin.

At the time of this writing, 18,373,937 BTC have already been mined. This means that 87.49% of all Bitcoins have already been created. There are only 12.51% of Bitcoins left that can be created.

Bitcoin is therefore the scarcest invention ever created by man.

Transactions on the Bitcoin network are grouped into blocks. In order to correctly add a block of transactions to the Bitcoin Blockchain, some specific users of the network will have to solve a mathematical puzzle that requires phenomenal computing power.

These particular users are called miners. They put their computing power at the disposal of the network in order to secure the network.

When a miner successfully solves this mathematical puzzle for a given block, that block of transactions is added to the Bitcoin Blockchain. As a reward, the miner, or more generally the pool of miners, receives a Bitcoin reward.

The new Bitcoins are created at that moment.

Bitcoin Halving Reduces the Production of New Bitcoins Over Time

When Satoshi Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin network on January 3, 2009, this reward was 50 BTC. For every 210,000 blocks of transactions validated, this reward is halved in an operation called Halving.

Currently, Bitcoin is at block height 629,942:


Since a Bitcoin Halving takes place every 210,000 blocks mined, this means that there have already been two Halvings so far:

The first took place at block height 210,000 on November 28, 2012. The reward was then decreased from 50 BTC to 25 BTC.

The second took place at block level 420,000 on July 9, 2016. The reward then went from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC.

Bitcoin third Halving will take place at block height 630,000, in 85 blocks.

On average, a new block is issued every 10 minutes. This gives predictability to the issuance of new Bitcoins. We can therefore estimate that 6 blocks are mined per hour, or a total of 144 blocks per day.

With a current reward of 12.5 BTC per mined block, the daily production of new Bitcoins is 1800 BTC.

At block height 630,000, the third Bitcoin Halving will take place. From that moment on, the reward will be 6.25 BTC. The average daily production of new Bitcoins will then be 900 BTC.

This third Halving will be a historic supply shock that will bring inflation down below 2% to 1.8%.

The date of each Halving cannot be accurately predicted. The reason is simple: the production of the blocks will depend on the computing power available on the Bitcoin network. This computing power is called the Hash Rate.

When the Hash Rate rises sharply, time between production of each block falls below 10 minutes. When the Hash Rate drops, time between production of each block rises above 10 minutes. The average delay between each mined block clearly shows this:


In order to keep the predictability of new block issuance on the Bitcoin network, the difficulty to mine a block is adjusted every 2016 blocks, approximately every 2 weeks.

If the Hash Rate has increased sharply previously, causing the block production time to drop below 10 minutes, the difficulty will increase. If the Hash Rate has previously dropped sharply, the difficulty will decrease.

The evolution of the mining difficulty since the creation of Bitcoin clearly shows that mining a new block has become more and more demanding in terms of computing power:

Bitcoin’s Predictability Provides Its Users With Essential Guarantees

By guaranteeing this predictability, Bitcoin allows its users to know in advance how Bitcoin supply inflation will evolve in the coming Halvings:

At block height 840,000, probably in 2024, the reward will be 3,125 BTC. The daily average production of new Bitcoins will be 450 BTC.

At block height 1,050,000, probably in 2028, the reward will be 1,5625 BTC. The daily average production of new Bitcoins will be 225 BTC.

At block height 1,260,000, probably in 2032, the reward will be 0.78125 BTC. The daily average production of new Bitcoins will be 112.5 BTC.

…

Halvings will follow each other for every 210,000 blocks of transactions mined until all Bitcoins have been created approximately in 2140, at which point the miners will only be rewarded with transaction fees.

Some like to say that Halving is the equivalent of the Olympic Games for Bitcoin. Halving is a great marketing campaign for Bitcoin every 4 years.

Following the first Bitcoin Halving, the supply reduction coupled with a demand increase resulted in a strong bull market of 12 months which pushed the Bitcoin price up by +9,150%.

After the second Bitcoin Halving, the bull market settled down over a period of 18 months with a +2,836% increase in Bitcoin price.

Each time, Bitcoin entered the following virtuous circle:

Supply reduction.

At constant demand, Bitcoin price starts to rise.

Increase in demand due to Bitcoin price increase.

Even higher Bitcoin price increase.

Back to step 3.

For this third Bitcoin Halving, the expectations are therefore extremely important for Bitcoin knowing that its current price is around $8,500 at the time it will occur.

1% of 1 billion is still 10million. At current market price 10m usd would get you 1000 bitcoin. Good for him right? 
Well the thing is. He didn't buy bitcoin he purchase bitcoin derivatives wich is not the same as owning your private key.

I have **hidden the keys** to a wallet containing **\~0.03 BTC** inside of my latest album. (It's not much, I am a robot of simple means)

Solve it then sweep the keys!

'[Bifurcations](https://logicbeach.bandcamp.com/album/bifurcations)' by Logic Beach is a Lo-Fi, Synth-Glitch, experimental project I've put together to **celebrate the halving** and to have a bit of fun. You will need the Lossless versions of the songs to solve this thing. (download the .wav files).

Also, check out the [Video](https://youtu.be/T2YtHBubtHg). 

&amp;#x200B;

The album is **free on** [BandCamp](https://logicbeach.bandcamp.com/album/bifurcations) (just enter $0.00), however if you'd like to make the contest more interesting, I am putting all proceeds into the contest wallet. 

If you sweep it make a post here detailing how you solved it! or remain anonymous... I expect a clever person could tease it out today (It's a fairly simple puzzle). If no one solves it by May 21st, I'll take it down and explain the solution.

The halvening has arrived right in the middle of the crisis. Things will take a long time to get back to normal both in terms of day to day life and from an economical point of view. 

Quantitative easing on a global level will reduce the spending power of the dollar, GBP, euro etc - in the same year of a halvening. Governments and big companies are looking at blockchain and crypto to work alongside their fiat. 

People will look to diversify and will want to store their wealth in other forms and perhaps Bitcoin is the answer for them.

My field of study right now is a masters in statistical physics so even if i have some capacity with coding i am not on par with a computer science minor student, so a more theoretical approach would be more welcomed.

&amp;#x200B;

 A little about me: I've have finally decided to start my cryptofueled artistic journey last year. As anonymously as I can to keep up with the spirit of Bitcoin. I am not entirely sure where it is going to go, but I know that it will be backed by Bitcoin (among others, beggars can't be choosers :). It is also my own little way of increasing the awareness and adoption, not just the face of BTC being an investment or a scam.

ghq40y,ElephantGlue,If you love and believe in bitcoin,"Control your own keys.

I would argue it’s more important for bitcoin to succeed than even mining it or running a full node.

Think about what would happen if close to 100% of bitcoin owners left their coins on exchanges. There would really be only 2 or 3 actual owners (who control the exchanges) at the top.

Exit scams and MtGox 
/nicehash situations would be commonplace, and as Bitcoin’s value rose, these exchanges could just ‘print’ more fake bitcoin to distribute to user accounts thus putting downward pressure on the value of the network.

You’ve come far enough to be red pilled by the value proposition of bitcoin, don’t let yourself ignore the obvious benefit of everyone controlled their own keys.",1589212287,4,3
ghq3y2,my_Faded_Youth,Quick Maths,"Just a quick question...

Say I have $100 in bitcoin and it rises 5%...
Then I do nothing cause HODL and it goes back down 5% to ""normal"".

If you calculate $100 + 5%, it equals $105.
If it goes down - 5% from the $105 you have now, that's $99.75. Does this mean you LOSE MONEY from the HODL strategy? 

Even if the price remains the same, you're losing money, meaning you are reliant on bitcoin raising substantially for any good profit growth, unless you are selling. Correct me if I'm wrong, as I'm new and would love to learn more... but this in throwing a wrench in my mathematics and the formulas I'm using to consult upon different trading strategies.

Edit - Sorry for not enough clarification, and maybe being a little slow as I stated up all night, but the main thing I'm pondering is:

 if I left $100 of BTC in an Exchange would it still be at $100 if it were to rise and fall back to the same exchange rate? Or would it be less than $100 as my calculations give me?",1589212279,44,0

ghplpz,Lapsusinz,Compliance Software for small Crypto Business,"Hello! I tried to post this on the Cryptocurrency subreddit, but unfortunately couldn't get much traction.

My employer’s Cryptobusiness needs a compliance software that allows him to process KYC information and monitor his customer’s orders/transactions.

We’ve come up with several options such as ShuftiPro, ComplyAdvantage, ChainAnalysis, and Scorechain. They seem to have all the basic functions the business will need.

However, the license prices are pretty high for a business that’s just starting out (talking $1000/mo for some of the basic licenses/plans).

Does anyone here know of some cheaper alternatives? At this point having two tools that can integrate well seems like a reasonable option too.

I sent the balance via coinb.in but forgot to insert the extra address to the transaction and effectively removed the entire balance from a couple of these wallets. The trader received the agreed amount and I got $ but the rest of what was on the wallet has gone. 

For example a wallet had .3 btc and I sent .285 the remaining balance I'm sure has been lost forever. Did I delete some bitcoin from existence? Can I recover that somehow? (I dont think I can)

Then I got to wondering what is my wallet address for the other altcoins the app is allowing me to transact with as well?

....""To me, this signals a massive seminal moment of legitimacy that can not be understated. Hedge Fund guys are said to be the smart money but the truth is, with QE infinity forcing yields to zero, there’s not a whole lot of alpha to generate, leaving fund managers mostly investing in the same dog shyt, copycatting each other and chasing returns. In a world where managers are just trying to index or clip there 2 &amp; 20 and avoid career risk in getting blown up, Paul Tudor Jones just green lighted a move into Bitcoin that now puts the risk on fund managers for **NOT** having exposure and lagging significantly in performance. Getting exposure to Bitcoin is the #1 buzz going around hedge funds, which will eventually trickle down to Independent Wealth Managers, Advisors and Mutual Funds. And while I don’t expect capital to flow in overnight, this is exactly how it starts.

This is precisely why I believe Paul Tudor Jones foray into Bitcoin has created a that ***“tipping point”*** or that magic moment for Bitcoin where it crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire into mainstream finance.""

glmyx3,FluxMoney,Bitcoin ELI5: Bitcoin is money. Bitcoin moves an amount from one place to another place with rules.,"Bitcoin is money. Bitcoin moves an amount from one place to another place. For example, move five money from me to you.

Moving money follows rules. Bitcoin’s rules are written in computers, and a lot people can see them. So when I want to move an amount of Bitcoin money to you, then other people can make sure that move follows the Bitcoin rules.

The more people that make the choice to check the rules, the more you are sure that the rules were followed.

There are a lot of people in the world who use their computers to check the rules each time someone tries to move an amount of Bitcoin. So you can trust Bitcoin is moving money for you properly and fairly. For example if you have seven and give me four, you now have three. So if you try to give someone else four the rules will not allow it. The most you can move now is three.

Bitcoin started with its rules. Also at the start a tiny amount of Bitcoin was made to enable the first people to start sending amounts. Since then people got copies of the rules, and they started moving amounts to each other while checking and following the rules. People checking the rules can ask for a fee for checking them. Also the rules include something clever to create more amounts. At random someone who checks the rules gets a new gift of an amount of Bitcoin.

Getting the gift used to be easy, but now requires a lot of luck, and a lot of computers using a lot of electricity. Also the rules say the gift gets less over time. The fees someone gets for checking the rules are still there though. Overall the idea was to create enough amounts so people could move Bitcoin as money, and reward people to check the rules. Most of the Bitcoin gift amounts that will be created have already been created. That is ok, because having good rules on how to move amounts to people around the world is really helpful.

It is possible for people to check part of the rules to make sure they are followed, without getting a gift or a fee. People do this because it helps them trust no one is trying to break the rules. It is being a good citizen if you help check the rules.

Because of the good rules and lots of people checking them, Bitcoin is considered valuable. That means you can move an amount of Bitcoin as money to get something you want, such as food or a place to live. However, right now while there are lots of people using Bitcoin, there are many more people who do not use it. Most of the world uses different money that follows different rules, usually by the country they live in. It is interesting to think about other rules for other money. That is a bigger story. For now, remember Bitcoin is money.",1589748213,15,1

I designed a little scavenger hunt and the last step will reveal a private key (to a few mBTC) which my participants will be able to sweep using Electrum. They will see that as soon as they are in the possession of the key, no 2fa or password will protect the original owner from theft. **Now my question is this:** What's going to happen in case multiple participants arrived at the last step just a few seconds apart and several of them tried to sweep the private key at the same/at a similar time?

My assumption: Regardless of the various fees set for the sweep transactions, **only** the one transaction will be validated which was **broadcasted first.** All other transactions will fail.

Is this correct?

Number of bitcoins acquired in last 100 days: 343954-283192 =60762

The rate of acquiring bitcoin in gbtc has actually accelerated after April, as you can see above in the table. However, even at the rate of 600 bitcoins per day that GBTC has bought every day for last 100 days, the GBTC is buying Bitcoins equal to 2/3rd of all supply of newly minted Bitcoin.

For good measure, 60k bitcoins in last 100 days is about 33-34% of all newly minted bitcoins in that period, give or take.

And GBTC is just one of the many ETF's that people who don't want to fiddle with private keys etc, can use to acquire Bitcoin, albeit the largest one.

The demand is there. The supply is reduced. Lets see where we will be in 100 days. I am not going to mention price of Bitcoin 100 days ago, because I am not selling anything. DYOR. Make your own investment decisions. This is not investment advice.",1589739318,75,1

glhxae,dover165,trade using more BTC and no leverage or more leverage and less BTC?," 

I'm in the U.S. using Kraken exchange

1st off, thanks in advance for everyone’s reply(s). 2nd, I understand there’s no better way to lose money/BTC than by trading BTC using leverage. Thus far, I’ve had decent success with conservative trading off of basic “triangle-break-out patterns” with stops in place but would like to do more. (I can feel experienced traders cringing at that lol) I'm still learning.

I have $100,000 to trade with, would it be better to:

Option 1: trade by just buying/selling $100,000 worth of Bitcoin at a time. This makes me nervous a bit. If the BTC world went sideways I’m not sure a stop loss sell order would fill even with a stop loss in place? I don’t need huge gains. I'm not sure if a liquidation event for what I borrowed from the exchange would be more definite than the stop loss being filled. I'm not sure if I sound like an idiot by even saying that. Like I said, still wrapping my mind around leverage/liquidation. I’m fine with hitting singles and no leverage with trades using this much fiat. I’m doing this now with good results. But I want to try leverage.

Option 2: or, should I use $50,000 and use 2x leverage or whatever the math is to achieve the same result as option 1? I would use tightish stops but I’m still soaking in all the issues of being liquidated. Can I only trade with leverage with BTC to BTC or can I use fiat to BTC?

I imagine the tax implications are the same with leverage vs. none? Not sure if moving $100k from fiat to BTC for a trade on and off it triggers more i-r-s attention.

Again, I get I can easily get reckt if I’m not very careful. I’m trying to mitigate my risk as best I can. I soak up all the knowledge I can from good traders in the space and I’m looking for a good course to up my trading game. I have some crypto in a hodl cold storage. I don’t have delusions of trying to quit my day job (yet lol) but I’m fine with making a few conservative trades a month.

glfxov,osmann20,Bitcoin bot trading on leverage exchanges for US citizens,"I have been successfully leverage trading on an exchange and wondered if I couldn't somehow run a bot and improve my performance. Problem is, I am not a programmer. I could learn, but would rather hire a professional should the cost be reasonable. 

Questions I have are: How much could this cost? Would it be possible to use a bot without an API from the exchange? How long would it take to develop? 

Ive seen some bots in Eve Online, trade and ratting, its a video game. Anyway, bot would copy series of mouse clocks you recorded, etc, trade bots were a lil mire complex I think, I want to be confident it can be easily done. 

I am using bitseven exchange and there are no terms of service agreements that ban US citizens from using their service. I've used bybit, phemex, but they do have a policy against US citizens. I am aware of using a VPN, I used two layers myself and would test for dns leaking prior to use, even got the android vpn to work on the app, to show a proper IP. However mistakes happen, and should they see an IP from the US at any time for that account, it may mean gertinf a freeze on said account, even assets seized. 

So I want to avoid using them. Bitseven is nice and I am familiar with it now. I am wanting to make a bot amd use it for that exchange specifically. Any help is greatly appreciated.",1589724345,4,1

Scenario:

1. Specify 15% of salary route to company 

2. Over the next two week, purchases are made on 1 to 14 separate days that are believed to be best times, using AI or rules a user specifies. The company logs these transactions in the account in real time and can send a push notification if desired.  Someone can also choose an option of 1-14 buys at random times during each day. 

3. At the end of the buying period, the funds can be automatically sent to the various whitelisted addresses. 

This would allow someone to DCA without spending any time (like a retirement account works). Funds would then be in their addresses as well.",1589720041,22,1

&amp;#x200B;

Electric house (E-house) also known as the powerhouse, is defined as a plug-and-play solution which offers electrical power. Growing offshore oil &amp; gas exploration activity, growth in mining and power infrastructure have increased the demand for electrical houses worldwide. This has been further amplified with the increasing demand for E-Houses rising from the renewable energy sector. A global rise in the rail infrastructure, with dedicated freight corridors being constructed around the globe, would also fuel the E-House business globally.

&amp;#x200B;

The report study has analyzed revenue impact of covid-19 pandemic on the sales revenue of market leaders, market followers and disrupters in the report and same is reflected in our analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

The growth of E-House market is mainly driven by investments in the oil &amp; gas sector and power sector. There are various drivers of e-house such as it is quick and easy to install on site. Its durability offers insulated protection to equipment thus reducing the work of civil engineers. Parnis Manufacturing Ltd Company manufactures E-House which is fully equipped with electrical substations and is constructed using insulated steel panels. It is designed in such a way that it delivers the best-customized solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

E-houses are used in both the utility segment and industrial segment applications for varied benefits. Planned maintenance, disaster response, and quick growth of transmission capacity are some use cases where e-houses have delivered a sure outcome for utility applications. E-houses are used to offer temporary power supply during unplanned repairs. Additionally, in the times of planned maintenance, e-house can reduce or even eliminate the need for extended electricity outages.

&amp;#x200B;

Mobile substation segment is leading the market for E-house. Mobile substation can be nearby for emergency response as a backup unit. It can also be useful in cases where the energy distribution needs to be providing or reinstated in a short span of time. Mobile substation as a backup for disaster response can ensure quick power supply and faster recovery throughout an incident.

&amp;#x200B;

The Middle East &amp; Africa to grow at highest CAGR during the forecast period. The Middle East &amp; Africa not only holds the largest market share followed by North America but is also expected to grow at the highest rate over the forecast period. Rapid electrification in Africa, along with the demand from the metals &amp; mining industry in the region is expected to drive the growth of the e-house market globally.

&amp;#x200B;

North America holds the second major market share in global E-House market. The growing power usage in metal extraction, data centres and other applications are driving the market for global E-House market in the North America region. The increasing investments in mobile power solutions are fuelling market growth.

gol8ei,boddankajovanovic,Some questions about getting started with the lightning network,"Hi folks,

I feel like I'm slowly getting comfortable with on chain transactions and the basic stuff. So I was looking at the lightning network today. From what I have read so far, the lightning network is what makes spending bitcoin in everyday life situations (buying a coffee, for example) viable, as payments on the lightning network are quite fast.

For a start I created a lightning wallet with phoenix (I read it handles all the technical details that can be a headache for newbies). So far so good. Can I make an on-chain tx to my lightning wallet now? I thought about loading a few bucks onto my lightning wallet and try it out. But I'm unsure of whats the easiest way to fund the wallet now. When I hit the receive tab in the phoenix wallet there is an option to display a bitcoin address (for an on-chain tx?) but it also says something about a 0.10% fee. Is that a fee taken by phoenix or is that the tx fee? 

I feel like I need to read more about what is different between a lightning wallet and a normal bitcoin wallet. Any pointing to worthwhile reads are appreciated.

When you look at the big picture, it sounds like China is laying the groundwork to become the Worlds Digital Currency. China has written an official government curriculum that details the history of money, Bitcoin, Crypto Exchanges, ICO’s, and the Chinese Central Bank Digitial Currency. China is writing the laws that will govern a Central Bank Digital Currency. Finally, China is building a Stablecoin in a partnership with Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong. This new stable coin will be based on currencies from these four countries. It sounds like China is focused on becoming a world leader in Digital Currencies and possibly the future reserve currency.

gohz1w,HeisenbergBTC,BTC/USDT - Aurox Trading Platform,"Good morning everyone 

Just thought I would share my thoughts with you all

&amp;#x200B;

Good morning everyone and welcome to my daily analysis of Bitcoin.  Today I have the 4hr time frame pulled up and I can see that the 9 week  trend held through the night. We bounced from 8800. I had a feeling that  would be the case. This uptrend we have been in since March 13th. All  good things do eventually come to an end though and uptrends are no  different. This weekend is also a holiday weekend in the US and as a  result the weekend could be boring if people decide to ditch the laptops  and get to the newly opened beaches around the country. Lets take a  look at what the chart is telling us.

**I added an indicator to this chart that I thought some of you  may like. This is an Aurox exclusive indicator and its mainly for those  that have trouble performing TA or just want a little assistance in  your decision making skills. The indicator is called ""Aurox Indicator""  and its under the indicators tab. Click indicators and then click on  advanced indicators and you will see a list of a few neat indicators but  the Aurox indicator is what I have on here and I really think its  useful. I turn it on often to clear any doubts I may have. Red arrows  indicate a sell recommendation and the green arrows indicate where they  suggest a buy. Give it a try!!!** 

I have a white line I started at the dip 9 weeks ago to 3800 and the  uptrend has been continuous since then. We tested this white line (trend  support) numerous times over the past 9 weeks. at least 5 touches by my  count. That is a pretty decent trend and it has outlasted plenty of  trends I have traded in the past. Like they always say... The trend is  your friend. At least until it isnt. Trends eventually reverse and if  you arent prepared you will be left holding those heavy bags. This is  why trading a trend is a great idea but always use a stop loss.

This price range on the chart is pretty tricky folks. We are  constantly testing support on multiple trends. A 2 month old trend and a  1 year old trend are both playing a part on the charts. We are also in  consolidation and inside of the weekly cloud and the 4hr cloud as of  right now. Being inside of the cloud can be confining and hinder the  candles from moving much.

I see some room for a rise as the RSI is pretty low at the moment and  that could provide us with the fuel we need for another small leg up.  If we did rise the 4hr 50 MA is around 9500 and I would assume this  would be where we experienced some resistance. We have finally filled in  the gap from last weekend completely now so there is no need to worry  about that gap anymore.

This weekly close looks to be a bearish candle with a decent  correction from approximately 10k. If we can keep this range up it looks  like we are still above the 1 year trend resistance which is hopefully  where we can refuel and launch from the elevated launch pad. Otherwise  the bears can take us down to the weekly 50 MA (8800) Which has been  reliable support for the past 3 weeks. With so many variables on the  chart and a possible reversal of the trend on the horizon I would enter  any position with extreme caution folks. But then again WTFDIK right????

TLDR: Bitcoin is teetering... Bulls and bears are locked in a fight  for dominance and we may see a trend reversal very soon. Its been long  over due if you ask me. Of course that halving luster could still  surprise us I imagine but Im not holding my breath. Long weekend coming  in the US so be prepared for anything folks.

gohwyk,Btcyoda,Things to think about / check when selecting a broker or exchange.,"I'm, again, in the process of changing my default broker/exchange.

Sorry for starters, this is not always the most easy process and you can easily end up with something that is not the 'cheapest' solution to an outright disaster if you find out your fiat or Bitcoin is effective locked.

I can't give the simple answer what to use, it greatly depends on your situation; laws, tax, jurisdiction, trader or investor, etc.

These are the basic things you should check to prevent unpleasant surprises:

What info is needed to open a account:

Nowadays opening an account should be quite fast and straightforward ID (name, adress) will be needed, email verification, bank account verification (deposit a small amount). These basic steps can mostly be done within an hour.

A basic account will most likely have a limit on what you can do.
This is both limited in the amount of fiat you can deposit and withdraw, but also on the amount of Bitcoin you can buy, sell and move.

If needed check what is needed to upgrade your account to be able to handle the amount you want to, and what timing is involved.

Usage:

How can you send money to your broker/exchange, are there cost involved, do they have a cooling down period (a time you can't spend your deposited fiat), how long does the transfer take, what are your limits (how much can you deposit and what is the minimum).
To deposit, using money transfer or Ideal etc shouldn't cost you anything.
Check if your deposits are on a independent account, like a trust, so in case the broker/exchange goes bankrupt your deposit don't disappear in the bankruptcy.

What costs are involved buying Bitcoin?
Can you transfer directly to your private wallet or not?

If they send Bitcoin to your private wallet it's the fastest most save way since it involves little time and you don't have your fiat parked in an account for some time.
Check all costs involved; commission, the fees for the transaction etc., and how they determine the price of a Bitcoin.

Check if there is a cooling down period, mostly for new accounts, where they hold your coins before actually sending it to your wallet.

For selling Bitcoin the same goes:
Can you send your Bitcoin to an adress and will they deposit to your bank account. What time, costs and limits are involved?
What will your bank do if a big amount is deposited, check it!
If you want to sell Bitcoins you have do they demand proof where these came from what proof do they need?

If they don't send your coins directly to your wallet or if you first have to deposit your Bitcoin in their wallet to be able to sell it becomes a bit more complex.
What commission do the charge?

Will they send your bought Bitcoin directly to your private wallet, is there a time lock? If not and coins are put inside their controled wallet, how are the fees set if you want to send them to your privatewallet? Can you change it or is there some algorithm they use, if so can you see what fees are used before you make the transaction? As always there will be a balance between cost and timing so it is good if you could decide on those.
How much timing is involved, a waiting or cool down period, does those change if you send different amounts...

Important but hard to find out:

How is their costumer service!
Getting on board is one, but getting help when there is an issue or proactive involvement if things change is way more important.

Here is where I found the biggest issues.
Don't be surprised if governments change regulations but you will have to find out only when you try to make a transaction that the verification process changed and you need to take action before you can do something.
Not nice if you want to buy the dip sell the top!

Yes they send mails but for some reason not to you, bla bla...
They are sorry but can't help you, bla  bla.

Time to move on to the next broker/exchange....

I'm now on the process of having two different brokers/exchanges just to reduce my chances for such problems.

It's a lot of work and thinking ahead.
But that's one of the prices to be paid for being your own bank.

Good or bad experiences / companies are more than welcome....",1590148242,1,1

gofvkn,sovjetspacemonk,Decent sources skeptical/critical of Bitcoin?,"Hey there. I am fairly new to Bitcoin, having started reading and listening about it in January this year before I felt that I understand it well enough to start investing in March. As a newbie however I had difficulties rating my sources of information at the beginning but at some point started to sort out for example those Youtube channels that are trying to give me exact price predictions with drawing endless graphs and focussed on more established and respected sources like Antonopoulos or also the Beginner's Guide to Bitcoin by Peter McCormack has helped me a lot.

However what I noticed while getting informed about Crypto is that I rarely come across people who are skeptical or critical about the future of Bitcoin while still actually understanding what they're talking about. When I listen to dozens and dozens of podcast episodes where the moderator and guest are always pretty much on the same page with every topic I feel that all of my information is just coming out of the same bubble. Of course everyone gets super bullish when only consuming optimistic opinions on Bitcoin. My goal is not to become a skeptic myself but rather to understand arguments on all sides better in order to adapt a more differentiated viewpoint. So my request: Are there any Podcasts or Youtube channels that feature proper discussions involving Bitcoin defenders but also people critical of Bitcoin who have actually given this enough thought to have a valuable opinion? I don't mean people that support other cryptocurrencies but e.g. financial experts from outside of the whole space.",1590138251,20,1

gmloix,ByteBulls,Bitcoin: this wave of the upward trend is not over yet,"After halving, bitcoin transaction volume has recently reached its highest level in 2020. The previous moments with relatively large transaction volume include the end of March this year, the end of October 2019, and the end of June 2019. In March of this year, the currency price plummeted, followed by a retaliatory rebound. The huge daily amplitude and good liquidity created active trading, and since then the currency price has risen all the way. At the end of October last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping talked about accelerating the development of blockchain at the meeting, so bitcoin exploded, and since then the price of the currency has fallen all the way; In June 2019, it was a three-month bull market, which caused a significant increase in attention. Since then, the currency price has fallen all the way. The trading volume has soared this time, the situation is very similar to last June, but it has not yet reached a peak in June, we can compare it from the figure below：

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img qfjbcwii2pz41...*

The three arrow positions are the positions where the volume of transactions increased three times. That is, this wave of the upward trend is not over yet. After a period of adjustment, there is a high probability that it will pull up another wave, the reason is:

1. Market bullish sentiment is still there, and has not reached its peak, the panic greed index is still around 50

2. The fact that a lot of money is printed globally exists, and many investors are accelerating their entry into Bitcoin, especially some US-based funds, such as the Renaissance, Grayscale Trust, etc., their investment comes with aura, which will bring exposure and increase the amount.

3. Under the pressure of 10,000$, Bitcoin can repeatedly resist the pressure, and the shorts still fail to dominate the market at the key pressure level, often indicating that the market has not ended

Once this position exceeds 10,000$, it will accelerate upward wave until people's emotions turn crazy, and then will start a real callback. So if you want a long-term layout, you have an opportunity. Do n’t be driven by the surrounding emotions when the price rises in the future. Keep calm and treat the market up and down rationally",1589882503,1,1

gmjdns,monster_pizza,Bitcoin Halving," 

If you’ve heard the term ‘[Bitcoin Halving](http://phemex.com/)‘ and have no idea what it means, don’t worry. This article will give you a brief explanation of what the concept is and how it works.

Before we begin, it is important to have some background information. At the core of Bitcoin’s technology is the blockchain. This is essentially a virtual ledger that records all of the coin’s transactions. It keeps records safe and prevents people from spending coins that they no longer own. To maintain such a vast and complex system requires a lot of computing power. This is where ‘miners’ come in.

Miners lend their computing power to help maintain, secure, and record transactions. In exchange, they get rewarded with newly ‘mined’ Bitcoins. Originally, the system allowed for 50 coins to be mined every 10 minutes. However, it is designed to cut that amount in half every 4 years. Since Bitcoin halving has already happened twice in the past, the current amount of Bitcoins mined every 10 minutes stands at 12.5. The next Bitcoin halving is set to happen May 18 of this year.

## What effects will [Bitcoin Halving](http://phemex.com/) have?

The simple answer is: no one knows for sure.

Because the amount of Bitcoins will become more limited or scarce (the last Bitcoin will be mined in 2140), the traditional expectation is that if demand remains constant, as supply decreases, value increases. Yet, when looking back at previous Bitcoin halving events, the reality may be a bit more complicated. The first Bitcoin halving in 2012 did result in prices increasing shortly after. However, the second Bitcoin halving in 2016 actually saw prices initially decreasing, before returning back up and beyond as time went on.

Whether the eventual price increase was simply a delayed reaction to the halving or whether it was caused by other factors, it is hard to say for certain. One argument against the expectation that prices should always go up is the concept of these events being ‘price in’. What this means is that because people expect and know when exactly a Bitcoin halving will happen, they can prepare ahead of time. If people purchase more Bitcoins as an anticipatory measure, prices will already go up even before a Bitcoin halving happens. And so, the event itself would not have any significant effects. Whatever does happen, come May 18th, we will all be watching closely.",1589870644,0,1

gmit0o,FunkDaddyDeluxe,How do you get over having used to own so much bitcoin?,"Succinctly put, I had a little less than 100 BTC in 2013, thought after I quadrupled my money, it was a wise time to cash out... I knew about the 21 million cap, and other properties, but I was too young and financially illiterate to appreciate what I had, and listened to my boomer parents.

My 20's are coming to an end, and its just so depressing buying a whole coin for a little less than 200x of what price I originally bought in at. (still stacking sats though)

I know there are other stories with orders of magnitude greater loss, And I am still greatly advantaged versus most people in the world.

Sometimes I just get hit with a wave of depression and it's hard not to hate yourself... just wish I researched a little more..

I don't really know what I am looking for, or if there is an answer, but if others have similar stories, either successful or not, perhaps it would make me feel better.

gs7arr,_Pohaku_,PSA: refresh CB Pro page before setting up a market sell order,"In a nutshell: have had CB Pro open in a tab on my machine for several days. The page updates constantly with price, as any user would know.

I was curious to see what my coin is worth at the current price, and rather than get a calculator out I just started to set up a market sell order, clicked 'Max .' to populate the 'BTC' field, and checked the GBP price that I'd be getting. It didn't seem right, as it was barely above what it was last time I figured it out and I know there's been maybe 10% movement since then.

Refreshing the page and setting up the order again revised the number, so that the price was correct (and roughly what I expected.)

I can't dive into the tech details of the site, but it SEEMED as though the pane for setting up buy/sell orders on the left was treating the market price *at the time of the last page refresh* as the 'current market' price, rather than updating it dynamically with the rest of the page.

I don't know what would have happened if I'd actually been in a hurry to sell and clicked the button to confirm, I would hope that it would still have sold at the best possible price, but you never know.",1590676257,0,1

gqe4bm,Wealthycafe,"Aside Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum, What are the Best Crypto Coins to Invest in?","Before thinking of investing in any cryptocurrency, it is wisely for one to know the market values, features, market and potential. The fact that there are over 2,000 cryptocurrencies currently available to traders and investors makes it even harder to know the best ones to bet your money on.

Investors and traders, especially new market entrants, find it hard to choose the top crypto coins to invest in. This is because the market changes, and different cryptocurrencies peak for various reasons, and you can’t just rush into any decision.

Early days of 2020 has been a devastating one so far for the cryptocurrency space and the financial markets in general. The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has been the primary topic of discussion so far this year, and it has affected several economies around the world.

Knowing [which Cryptocurrency to invest in](https://wealthycafe.com.ng/best-cryptocurrency-to-invest-in/) might prove to be a difficult task for you if you’re not updated on the performance of the cryptos. You can’t make investment decisions based on emotional judgments. Cryptocurrencies can jump up or down the ranking order in a matter of time, as recently Bitcoin and Ethereum are indeed the top cryptocurrencies to invest but the market is changing gradually.  With this let’s have a look at the new and emerging cryptocurrencies of 2020:

1 – Ripple (XRP)

XRP is another cryptocurrency that is gaining wide adoption, its the third cryptocurrency by market capitalization but first in my ranking, Ripple (XRP) is among the most promising investments in this list. thanks to the various technologies rolled out by Ripple. An increasing number of banks across the globe are using XRP and its technologies for faster, cheaper and easier cross-border transactions. It’s solid technology and network are rapidly opening new opportunities in the field of international commerce, banking and payment networks. MoneyGram has continued to expand its strategic partnership with Ripple as the first money transfer company to scale the use of blockchain capabilities.

2 – Zcash (ZEC)

Even if Zcash is predominantly new to the market, it has covered several grounds in such a short span. The CEO, Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn is forward-thinking and continuously plans for growth and expansion strategies. At the moment, Zcash has around 21 million coins in transactions. Investing in Zcash is easy as you can enjoy a certain level of anonymity and can get the detailed report of the transactions you’ve carried out, hence making it one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest.

3 – Dash (DASH)

Digital Dash should be included in top cryptocurrency list when it comes to investment opportunities. Although it was created in 2015, its market capitalization hit $2,036,525,273.Within this short span, they have consistently handled about $100 million worth of transactions daily as they are safe and secure. DASH is one of the best cryptocurrency to buy right now.

4 – Neo (NEO)

Two names always pop in our minds when we talk about blockchain and innovation- Vitalik Buterin and Da Hongei. The former as we know is the creator of Ethereum, wherein the latter is the creator of NEO coin. The NEO technology is underpinned by a Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerant system, which adds sophistication to the system. Its improved proof of stake tech makes it one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in.

By now, you might have got a fairer idea of the crypto world works which will be good for your investment in 2020. As stated earlier, investment is a risky process so it shouldn’t be rushed. You should always take investment decisions in a logical manner.

5 – Steem (STEEM)

Steemit, the blogging, and social media platforms have decided to venture into cryptocurrencies. Activities like writing blogs and comments will award tokens to the writers. This token can be used for payment of other things on the platform. This is booming as more and more budding writers are showing their interest in this social media creative writing enabler.

6 – Cardano (ADA)

Cardano is the distributed computing platform that implements blockchain technology for the ADA coin. As a decentralized blockchain platform, Cardano is an entirely open-source cryptocurrency project, it is also the first cryptocurrency platform, based on the Haskell code, an industrial product used for mission-critical systems as well as one of the cheap cryptocurrencies to invest right now.

7 – Tron (TRX)

In spite of its occasional increase, Tron is attracting more and more investors. The reason is that most of the investors are realizing its potential in the upcoming months. Buying when low is the holy grail in the cryptocurrency bible. Launched by Justin Sun, Tron is set on a decentralized platform. Fast and secured transactions can be made with the help of this currency.

8 – Nem (NEM)

Nem is different from other cryptocurrencies to invest in because of two main reasons. You harvest instead of mining as is the case for other cryptocurrencies. The other concept is proof-of-importance to determine who harvests the next block. NEM transactions take around 6 seconds to show up and 20 seconds to confirm. NEM is incredibly scalable which takes about 3000 tx/s where BTC is bogging down at 4 tx/s. Another advantage is that the transaction cost is ultra low, around .01% fee. So you need a penny to send $100 or 10 cents to send $1000.Isn’t that awesome?

In the past 1 month, I have moved all my investment and went 100% BTC in part due to my disdain of the current economic environment. 

Investment has always been a way for me to try and overcome my massive debt medical educational debts (&gt;$350k...and growing). 

In truth, I do not know the future of crypto or btc. For better or worse, all the money that I have saved is in BTC, except for the monthly rent, food, etc. 

If btc goes to zero, I am pretty fucked. If it goes fulfilled its purpose, maybe I can breathe fresh air again from under this financial burden, at least that is my hope.

My family gathered the money together in the hope of earning some money in this Covid quarantined society as they couldn’t work anymore. I fucked it up. My family was going to withdraw the money using bitcoin and I was in charge of it. I had asked bunch of questions here because of it and was thrilled to meet so much people trying to help me. I was also hyped up about the halving and dreamt about lambo. But today, just before finally withdrawing the 10k, I decided to play blackjack for just an extra pocket money. I started with 100 dollars bet. I lost. I panicked and doubled. I lost again. It went on like that and I was betting 3000 dollars by the last card and I lost. I blew up all of my family’s money in less than an hour. 10k gone. I wasn’t even sad. I couldn’t think. I couldn’t breathe. I literally was going to kill myself. I’m still inclined to, to be honest. But this community that was so eager to help me find out about bitcoin came to my mind just before doing that. This is my last hope. Can you guys please help me. 
I know you guys don’t know me and even whether I’m telling the truth or not. I will send all of the evidence if you need one. Can you guys please offer me any sort of help to cope with this. I promise I will give back to the society in any way as soon as possible. Please. Help me. 

I don’t even know this is allowed but I am so desperate. I don’t want to kill myself but I just can’t find out how to make the money back especially in this society. I want to rewind the time but I cannot. I know you don’t have to, but please save me from this misery. I’m not threatening you to kill myself if you don’t help me. I just can’t find out how to live and face the life from now on with this loss.

So one of the few reasons I wanne sell is that:

\- $3 trillion digital dollars have been printed to stablelyes the economy from falling apart. They bought low bonds and they try to fill up these holes in the bubbles that are leaking.

\- 36 million people lost there jobs. You could say that in august many stores are gonna be open, but maybe 12 of the 36 will still not have there regular jobs. And at one point, there will not be enough to support the people who have to pay there rents and other stuff like food or cars.

\- Michagan just got flooded with more then 41.000 people stranded and evacutated. This is maybe not much between the 36 million but this is another cherry on the cake for the FED. 

\- If you look at the picture, you can tell by the stock line, that it is making the same movement as a bubble phase. We all got hyped up, we had a bear trap and now we are at the ''Return to ''normal'' phase and it's almost June with many things that makes me feel that it's gonna fall apart again.

These AML measures help prevent the funding for individuals or organizations that mean to do harm. How would Bitcoin, or any other crypto ensure the continuation of thwarting these criminal acts?

gf55fe,SimpleSwapExchange,How Bitcoin Halving Will Affect BTC Price,"## Bitcoin Halving 2020

In every 210K mined blocks a planned (programmed) event takes place. This event is called halving. It is a regular reduction of miners’ fee (reward) for a produced block. Bitcoin creator put these halvings in software to keep inflation in check. Most commonly one block is being mined in 9 minutes and 20 seconds. According to this, halving occurs every four years. The Bitcoin network had two halvings: first in 2012 and then in 2016. If we look back and remember how much coins miners could earn in the early history of Bitcoin, it was 50 BTC for one block. Later on, after the first halving, the fee was equal to 25 BTC and the same happened four years after, then the reward was cut down to 12.5 BTC. The next (third) halving may be expected in May 2020. The payoff then will be reduced to 6.25 BTC. This will actually continue till there’s no award left (this will approximately happen in 2140).

So why is there a need for halving? If coins are produced very fast or the amount of emitted BTC is not limited, there will be so many Bitcoins in circulation that they will have limited value. Vitalik Buterin once said in his interview with Bitcoin Magazine: «The main reason why this is done is to keep inflation under control.»

## What will happen with BTC price after Bitcoin halving?

Like any other cryptocurrency price prediction, the Bitcoin price prediction is always hard to make, so we can just guess looking at a combination of factors. Opinions are divided as follows: some think that the BTC price will go up and others think nothing will generally change and the price will stay the same.  
There are also skeptics that see the halving as bad luck. They believe that if even 10 percent of miners quit, it might scare away the investors and make them move out their assets. As a result, the Bitcoin price will go down.  
After the first Bitcoin halving the BTC price grew almost two hundredfold, the second time it grew sevenfold. Both times BTC had increased volatility. But no one can guarantee the same events nowadays.  
As far as we can see from the previous halvings, they had the same dynamics: the Bitcoin price grew up. This gives some people hope that it will repeat after the next BTC halving in May 2020.

What are people’s opinions and predictions regarding the next Bitcoin halving? Let’s have a look.

&amp;#x200B;

The CEO of Pantera Capital Dan Morehead predicts the rise of BTC after the coming halving: 

&gt;*“It’s right on the trend line, and I think it’s a good shot that by the end of the year, we hit that, and then if you just extrapolate that line out for another year, it’s $122,000 per Bitcoin and in one more year $356,000.”*

&amp;#x200B;

Tom Lee from Fundstrat Global Advisors posted a part of the report regarding crypto outlook 2020. Here what is said regarding the BTC price in that report: 

&gt;*“For 2020, we see several positive convergences that enhance the use case and also the economic model for crypto and Bitcoin – thus, we believe Bitcoin and crypto total return should exceed that of 2019. In other words, we see strong probability that Bitcoin gains &gt;100% in 2020.”*

&amp;#x200B;

Bobby Lee (co-founder and CEO of BTC China) also expressed his opinion via twit saying: 

&gt;*“After next #BlockRewardHalving in Spring of 2020, new #Bitcoin output will drop again, to just 900 BTC/day. I predict #HashPower will continue to grow, with ever higher amounts of investment in mining (electricity costs). If that amount reaches $54m/day, we‘ll have $BTC at $60k.”*

&amp;#x200B;

Jason A. Williams had an “unpopular opinion”: 

&gt;*“Unpopular Opinion – Bitcoin halving in May 2020 won’t do anything to the price. It will be a non-event.”*

&amp;#x200B;

John McAfee is insanely positive as usual when speaking about the Bitcoin price prediction: 

&gt;*“When I predicted Bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of 2020, it used a model that predicted $5,000 at the end of 2017. BTC has accelerated much faster than my model assumptions. I now predict Bitcoin at $1 million by the end of 2020. I will still eat my d\*ck if wrong.”*

&amp;#x200B;

Paolo Ardoino (Bitfinex &amp; Tether Chief Technology Officer) said the following in his interview to U.Today: 

&gt;*“The halving is expected to occur next year, and I think it’s reasonable to expect an increase in the price of Bitcoin. I won’t do any price predictions myself and this is not financial or other advice from me or from Bitfinex or Tether, but I don’t see any reason for Bitcoin not hitting $100,000 within the next few years. That would already be an amazing goal for such technology.”*

&amp;#x200B;

Tone Vays (Financial analyst) is less ambitious. That’s what he thinks: 

&gt;*“Technically, everything is in play until end of 2020, after that sub $5,000 is not likely. Worst Case Scenario: prices drop to $5k into the halving, then after halving 70% of miners shut down due to negative revenue, #Bitcoin spirals down in price but then rises from the dead!”*

&amp;#x200B;

Petros Anagnostou, the founder of Crypto Solutions declares: 

&gt;*“My prediction: Bitcoin will reach $12,000 before the end of this year. And will reach a price of $50,000 – $100,000 by the end of 2020.”*

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize, the forthcoming BTC halving 2020 will be a kind of guarantee that there will be no inflation, and investments will be profitable. At the same time, it is being one of the key factors responsible for the growth of the Bitcoin price. When it comes to miners, they usually feel stressed about it as to keep their income at the same level they will need to invest in new technical equipment. As for those who don’t mine but just buy Bitcoin to keep BTC as a cryptocurrency investment, the BTC halving will barely have any effect on them.

No one can predict what exactly will happen after the upcoming BTC halving. It is always up to you either be on the optimistic side or be one of the doubters.

Owning ONE bitcoin puts you--at minimum--in the top 0.2% of the human population in terms of total possible Bitcoin wealth distribution.,"Let me remind all you old-timers, and inform the newbies showing up here because of the halving: There will only be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins. Ever. Approximately 4 million have been permanently [LOST](https://fortune.com/2017/11/25/lost-bitcoins/), bringing the maximum circulating total to 17 million. This total number won't be reached until 2140 due to Bitcoin's [issuance schedule](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply). This is ""quantitative hardening.""

Total number of millionaires (in USD value) worldwide is around 33 million ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/22/12-million-new-millionaires-will-be-minted-over-the-next-five-years.html)).

The factual math is simple: there is not enough Bitcoin in the world for even HALF of today's millionaires to own just ONE SINGLE BITCOIN. Much less all the future millionaires that will be born as the human population approaches [10bn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population).

Bitcoin is SCARCE. Check out the [S2F model](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25) for a good explanation of why scarcity and value correlate. Recently updated to the [S2FX model](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/bitcoin-stock-to-flow-cross-asset-model-50d260feed12) for a model that incorporates more data, and is more accurate.

Furthermore: If you are able to acquire even one BTC today: Enjoy the feeling. You are an early adopter. And one of a **very** select number of humans. Owning just ONE BTC means that you are--at minimum--in the top 0.2% ([17M / 8Bn \* 100](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=(17,000,000/8,000,000,000)*100&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8)) of the human population in terms of total possible bitcoin wealth distribution. The percentage is much lower than that, of course, given that there are lots of whales out there with 1000+ BTC each.

Edit: And never-mind the idiots that will say something asinine like ""my pubic hairs are limited in number too...does that make them valuable?"" Your pubic hairs have zero network utility, whereas every day Bitcoin proves it has extraordinary utility as (perhaps) the most perfect form of money humans have yet created.

Stack those sats!

That is all.

ghncql,AntBeWildin,My friendly dilemma.,"So I’m in a bit of a dilemma, maybe some of you guys been in this situation before... so I’ve been trading on &amp; off for 8 years(mostly forex, some crypto) ... &amp; I’ve blown around 10 accounts (3-4 digits each), so I’ve earned a few war wounds... the past 3 months I’m slightly above break even, so I’m seeing some progress. Anyway, that’s beside the whole point..

My best friend knows I’ve been trading for a while , &amp; he was never into it until just now with the whole pandemic crash opportunity. So I did the usual recommendation that he just invest &amp; HODL with whatever you are comfortable losing... &amp;to scratch his trading itch, toss some extra cash to the side &amp; learn some Technical Analysis while trading forex where price action is noob friendly, that way he can develop the skill throughout the years..

The issue is , he is very adamant about day trading by simply purchasing BTC through Coinbase or cashapp &amp; then converting it to cash right before the market is about to “dip”,then purchase more once it’s at the “bottom”. I tried explaining to him multiple reasons it won’t work but he combats it with “you just gotta have a ‘feel’ for the market bro”, &amp; “man you gotta just know when to put in and pull out”. He says indicators and tools are just scams created by the “big guys” to trick you into being on the wrong side of the market so they could cash in on your losses. 

Now I feel like I’m letting him walk into the crossfire with blank bullets that he thinks are real. I know his account is going to get blown to smithereens. I keep warning him of the risk but he says it’s all good. I just know that first blown account is be a tough shot to the gut , especially when expectations are set at the moon. 

Honestly, it’s a lot of stress on me right now because I’ve just started seeing positive results in trading , but now my friend really wants me to help him day trade, side by side. I feel like his negativity towards Technical Analysis is going to mess up my growth. I know I’m at fault because I’ve been wanting to help him learn for years , but now that the moment is finally here, I feel like it’s going to crash because I’m mixing friends and business...

Idk if it’s advice I’m looking for, or just similar stories , but I just feel like the ‘shit fan’ is getting closer and closer...",1589203032,2,1
