I hope this was not you. But a lot of small investors bet big and lost when their long positions got liquated on Bitmex and drove the price down by $1,500 in three minutes. What stop the press! It only took three minutes for a bunch of small investors to lose $100 million! Bitcoin is very volatile, but when you mix that with leveraged trading, it can cost you a lot very quickly. Watch this entire video as we dig into the News of what happened to the price of Bitcoin as it fell from $10,500.

gvuxou,heist95,Bitcoin Adoption Spotlight: Iran,"Iran's parliament discussed Bitcoin yesterday, with a representative urging the rest of the govt to ""take Bitcoin seriously, because if it can be managed, it can be a good opportunity for the country."" 

Though this statement may not seem like much, it comes on the heels of months of progress made by Iran's government in terms of Bitcoin adoption. 

* Earlier this year, a bill was proposed which regulates Bitcoin exchanges. Though regulation has its downsides in terms of privacy, a regulated onramp makes it easier for consumers to trust and adopt Bitcoin.
* Iran recognized cryptocurrency mining as an official sector of its economy and has issued over 1000 permits for companies looking to set up mining operations in Iran. State-subsidized electricity under 1 cent makes Iran a particularly attractive place for miners. 

Iran has encouraged the use of crypto-assets as a way to skirt around US-imposed sanctions. No matter the underlying reasons, Iran is taking a proactive approach to Bitcoin, which is good in the grand scheme of things.

We made a special gift in our special edition boxes and that's a $5 dollar gift in bitcoin. We want to support bitcoin with this and of course we also accept bitcoin as a payment method. We love cryptocurrencies and believe this is the future.

Our product (argan oil) is called the liquid gold of the world and what could be better than exchanging it for the digital gold (bitcoin).

Everything is demonstrable with us and can be traced back more than 300 years, our area has been designated as an endangered area by UNESCO.

Whoever buys this cosmetic product will directly support our region in the south of Morocco. There is no one between your product and we as producers, no one can exploit our region anymore . Everything will flow back directly to our region and families, so you immediately help create a better life for our region. 

Our products will be shipped from Belgium. Our company is located there, this is because logistics can be arranged better from Belgium.

We hope for support from the crypto community, we have been working on this for more than two years and want to support our region and the crypto community to the maximum by strengthening the adoption of bitcoin.

I got paid 3 BTC in a week, I then realized that their payments were automatic and are performed as soon as your timer is done. At the time of payment, I wanted to just take my profit and leave but that 1.5 BTC right now is at 24 BTC because I decided not to take it out. If you think like me, you'd know what I did next. You are right. I went in full time with extra 10 BTC and 65 ETH, and these investments are growing just as expected, double every week. I went all in.

Hello, 

I am currently studying and am getting student loans in some months just because I only have to pay back around 50% of what I get in total by the end of when I am finished and I use it to pay for public transport.

So therefore I had the idea of investing some of that money (I get around 500 Euros monthly so I would invest 300\~400 Euros) into Cryptocurrencies.

I don't spend too much money on going outside, clothes and still live with my parents so I do not really need most of the money.

I already have some Euros of BTC since I used to mine around 2017 up to early 2018 so I know a bit about BTC.

My questions are:

Would diversifying be a good Idea? I am planning on investing around 60-70% on BTC maybe the rest on ETH and other cryptocurrencies maybe something like Ripple.

Currently I use Blockchain Wallet to store the couple of BTC that I have, is it safe on long term? I heard many people talk about BTC Sticks like Trezor or Ledger are they safer to use and can you store multiple cryptocurrencies on those sticks?

&gt;maybe something like Ripple. 

* ( I am planning on long term investments so you never really know if something might get hacked in the future)

Do you guys know a good website to buy BTC in Europe or specifically Germany with fair prices.

Would you guys think that investing is rather stupid for me to do as a student?

* Else I would spend the money on clubbing anyway so the money I invest is not really needed for me to ""survive"" as I would waste it anyway.

I did a small trial run in sending a small amount of money from my bank and bought some bitcoin. (Wtf? Fees seemed high.) Sent 10x more money and bought some BTC. (Wtf? Outrageous fees!)

Learned about Coinbase Pro and cheaper fees...

Transferred a good amount of money to my Coinbase wallet in USD so that I could send it to Coinbase Pro to buy more BTC. (Cheaper fees!)

They put all my accounts on a 10 day hold yesterday. Today I logged in to find ALL my trading has been put on hold! Can't move money in or out!

Contacted CB customer support and they are looking into it.

Do you think this is a Coinbase problem or could it stem from my rather conservative bank? Has anyone sent money to Coinbase from a Credit Union?

**We've got to start thinking in satoshis.**

We're already doing it to a degree. Several places are selling things denoted in sats. This is good. It avoids decimal confusion such as 0.00000375 BTC. It's much easier to say, ""375 sats.""

In part, this is why I've long pushed for sats as the default unit and for the ""shi"" symbol „Ç∑ to represent it. See [why use „Ç∑ for sats?](http://satoshibitcoinconverter.com/why.htm) and [Satoshi Day](http://satoshibitcoinconverter.com/satoshiday.htm).

2,100,000,000,000,000 is 2.1 quadrillion. That may look like a lot. But hah! Don't think small. One million dollars used to be amazing. Now we talk in numbers like $2.5Billion or $1.3T. Understand, 2.1Q is nothing in terms of sats.

By comparison, consider USD pennies. The U.S. government magically fashions trillions of dollars out of thin air for every ""crisis"" that comes up, calling it ""Quantitative Easing"" or ""QE."" ""BRRRRR,"" says the paper money printer. Since there are 100 pennies in every dollar, that's trillions of dollars multiplied TIMES 100. 2.1Q is nothing in terms of sats.

In the U.S., we hear of QE1, and QE2, and QE3, and QE4, and...

Instead of QE,...

**I suggest: 2.1Q**

Do not be deceived, 2.1Q is small. One sat has value.

gxqt4j,StartYourHustle,Bitcoin Maximalism.,"Hello everyone,   


I am a small time Bitcoin - enthousiast.   
Got on the Cryptocurrency boat in 2018 (way too late to my liking) but been having a solid interest and spreading the ""Crypto-message"" for some time now.   


I like to keep things simple and do not jump too fast to conclusions.  
I have my own website/blog where I talk and discuss various coins. 

&amp;#x200B;

My current position on bitcoin is as follows: 

While I do believe in the potential of blockchain technology (the thing which powers many coins and tokens), I find myself focusing less and less on altcoins (with good reason... except for a few stablecoins) and going all out on Bitcoin.   


The reason thereof being mostly technical and to a lesser extend economical.   
Technical reasons beautifully summed up by Gilles Cadignan in his article on medium:  [https://medium.com/@gillesCadignan/the-other-bitcoin-standard-226e743687dd](https://medium.com/@gillesCadignan/the-other-bitcoin-standard-226e743687dd) . (My own remarks to be found here:  [https://dhconsultcomfort.wordpress.com/2020/05/15/discussion-the-other-bitcoin-standard/](https://dhconsultcomfort.wordpress.com/2020/05/15/discussion-the-other-bitcoin-standard/) ).   


Recent developments and uncovering of major trading-platforms ""promoting"" bitcoin only to spread and sell lesser altcoins (or their own shitcoins to leverage failing fiat money) only more confirms the idea Bitcoin rules.   


This ""leveraging"" is something explained in detail by Rusty Russell on his blog:  [https://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=607](https://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=607). (My own elaboration can be found here:  [https://dhconsultcomfort.wordpress.com/2020/06/02/enemies-of-bitcoin/](https://dhconsultcomfort.wordpress.com/2020/06/02/enemies-of-bitcoin/) ).   


I am probably preaching to a choir here but am curious to the opinions of others where it concerns altcoins vs Bitcoin.   


The compilation of arguments made by Rusty Russell and Gilles Cadignan are logic and straight-forward enough. Or is this thinking wrong?",1591449395,6,1

gxhno9,vx48,Why is open-source a better option for HW wallets?,"Hey folks,


recently gotten interested in investing in bitcoin and feeling plenty overwhelmed at the flood of info to go through before diving in. One of which was on having a hardware wallet to store the coins in. To briefly summarize what I've read in these communities thus far:

1. It's crazy to keep coins in exchanges and should move it to wallet immediately
2. HW wallets are more of an insurance than software wallets as they're not as prone to malware attacks and hacks in general
3. Ledger and Trezor seem to be the most popular choices


So that all sound pretty straight-forward enough. One thing I kept running into in the comment sections was people mentioning Trezor being the better product as they are ""open-source."" Now I'm more of less familiar with the definition in the software space but how does it apply with wallets in this case? Why does it make it better?


Also, if you guys could kindly recommend a safe exchange for a brand new beginner to start with it'd be greatly appreciated. I'm currently based in Canada.

gxftu2,melissaBrian0,Antminer T19 May Not Affect Bitcoin Hash Rate but Keeps Bitmain Ahead,"
The Antminer T19 by Bitmain may not have a big impact on the Bitcoin network, and it comes out amid the firm‚Äôs internal and post-halving uncertainty.

Earlier this week, Chinese mining-hardware juggernaut Bitmain unveiled its new product, an application-specific integrated circuit called Antminer T19. The Bitcoin (BTC) mining unit is the latest to join the new generation of ASICs ‚Äî state-of-the-art devices designed to mitigate increased mining difficulty by maximizing the terahashes-per-second output.

The Antminer T19 announcement comes amid the post-halving uncertainty and follows the company‚Äôs recent problems with its S17 units. So, can this new machine help Bitmain to reinforce its somewhat hobbled position in the mining sector?

T19: The cheaper S19

According to the official announcement, the Antminer T19 features a mining speed of 84 TH/s and a power efficiency of 37.5 joules per TH. The chips used in the new device are the same as those equipped in the Antminer S19 and S19 Pro, though it uses the new APW12 version of the power supply system that allows the device to start up faster.

Bitmain usually markets its Antminer T devices as the most cost-effective ones, while the S-series models are presented as the top of the line in terms of productivity for their respective generation, Johnson Xu ‚Äî the head of research and analytics at Tokensight ‚Äî explained to Cointelegraph. According to data from F2Pool, one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools, Antminer T19s can generate $3.97 of profit each day, while Antminer S19s and Antminer S19 Pros can earn $4.86 and $6.24, respectively, based on an average electricity cost of $0.05 per kilowatt-hour.

Antminer T19s, which consume 3,150 watts, are being sold for $1,749 per unit. Antminer S19 machines, on the other hand, cost $1,785 and consume 3,250 watts. Antminer S19 Pro devices, the most efficient of three, are considerably more expensive and go for $2,407. The reason Bitmain is producing another model for the 19 series is due to what is known as ""binning"" chips, Marc Fresa ‚Äî the founder of mining firmware company Asic.to ‚Äî explained to Cointelegraph:

‚ÄúWhen chips are designed they are meant to achieve specific performance levels. Chips that fail to hit their target numbers, such as not achieving the power standards or their thermal output, are often ‚ÄòBinned.‚Äô Instead of throwing these chips in the garbage bin, these chips are resold into another unit with a lower performance level. In the case of Bitmain S19 chips that don‚Äôt make the cutoff are then sold in the T19 for cheaper since they do not perform as well as the counterpart.‚Äù
The rollout of a new model ‚Äúhas nothing to do with the fact that machines are not selling well,‚Äù Fresa went on to argue, citing the post-halving uncertainty: ‚ÄúThe biggest reason machines probably are not selling as well as manufacturers would like is because we are on a bit of a tipping point; The halving just happened, the price can go anyway and the difficulty is continuing to drop.‚Äù Product diversification is a common strategy for mining hardware producers, given that customers tend to aim for different specifications, Kristy-Leigh Minehan, a consultant and the former chief technology officer of Genesis Mining, told Cointelegraph:

‚ÄúASICs don‚Äôt really allow for one model as consumers expect a certain performance level from a machine, and unfortunately silicon is not a perfect process ‚Äî many times you‚Äôll get a batch that performs better or worse than projected due to the nature of the materials. Thus, you end up with 5‚Äì10 different model numbers.‚Äù
It is not yet clear how efficient the 19-series devices are because they have not shipped at scale, as Leo Zhang, the founder of Anicca Research, summed up in a conversation with Cointelegraph. The first batch of S19 units reportedly shipped out around May 12, while the T19 shipments will start between June 21 and June 30. It is also worth noting that, at this time, Bitmain only sells up to two T19 miners per user ‚Äúto prevent hoarding.‚Äù

Hardware problems and competitors

The latest generation of Bitmain ASICs follows the release of the S17 units, which have received mostly mixed-to-negative reviews in the community. In early May, Arseniy Grusha, the co-founder of crypto consulting and mining firm Wattum, created a Telegram group for consumers unsatisfied with the S17 units they purchased from Bitmain. As Grusha explained to Cointelegraph at the time, out of the 420 Antminer S17+ devices his company bought, roughly 30%, or around 130 machines, turned out to be bad units.

Similarly, Samson Mow, the chief strategy officer of blockchain infrastructure firm Blockstream, tweeted earlier in April that Bitmain customers have a 20%‚Äì30% failure rate with Antminer S17 and T17 units. ‚ÄúThe Antminer 17 series is generally considered not great,‚Äù added Zhang. He additionally noted that Chinese hardware company and competitor Micro BT has been stepping on Bitmain‚Äôs toes lately with the release of its highly productive M30 series, which prompted Bitmain to step up its efforts:

‚ÄúWhatsminer gained significant market share in the past two years. According to their COO, in 2019 MicroBT sold ~35% of the network hashrate. Needless to say Bitmain is under a lot of pressure both from competitors and internal politics. They have been working on the 19 series for a while. The specs and price look very attractive.‚Äù
Minehan confirmed that MicroBT has been gaining traction on the market, but refrained from saying that Bitmain is losing market share as a result: ‚ÄúI think MicroBT is offering option and bringing in new participants, and giving farms a choice. Most farms will have both Bitmain and MicroBT side by side, rather than exclusively host one manufacturer.‚Äù

‚ÄúI would say that MicroBT has taken up the existing market share that Canaan has left,‚Äù she added, referring to another China-based mining player that recently reported a net loss of $5.6 million in the first quarter of 2020 and cut the price of its mining hardware by up to 50%.

Indeed, some large-scale operations seem to be diversifying their equipment with MicroBT units. Earlier this week, United States mining firm Marathon Patent Group announced that it had installed 700 Whatsminer M30S+ ASICs produced by MicroBT. However, it is also reportedly waiting for a delivery of 1,160 Antminer S19 Pro units produced by Bitmain, meaning that it also remains loyal to the current market leader.

Will the hash rate be affected?

Bitcoin‚Äôs hash rate plummeted 30% soon after the halving occurred as much of the older generation equipment became unprofitable due to the increased mining difficulty. That spurred miners to reshuffle, upgrading their current rigs and selling older machines to places where electricity is cheaper ‚Äî meaning that some of them had to temporarily unplug.

The situation has stabilized since, with the hash rate fluctuating around 100 TH/s for the past few days. Some experts attribute that to the start of the wet season in Sichuan, a southwest Chinese province where miners take advantage of low hydroelectricity prices between May and October.

The arrival of the new generation of ASICs is expected to drive the hash rate even higher, at least once upgraded units become widely available. So, will the newly revealed T19 model make any impact on the state of the network?

Experts agree that it won‚Äôt affect the hash rate to a major degree, as it‚Äôs a lower output model compared with the S19 series and MicroBT‚Äôs M30 series. Minehan said she doesn‚Äôt expect the T19 model ‚Äúto have a huge impact that‚Äôs an immediate cause of concern,‚Äù as ‚Äúmost likely this is a run of &lt;3500 units of a particular bin quality.‚Äù Similarly, Mark D‚ÄôAria, the CEO of crypto consulting firm Bitpro, told Cointelegraph: 

‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt a strong reason to expect the new model to significantly affect the hashrate. It might be a slightly more compelling option to a miner with extraordinarily inexpensive electricity, but otherwise they likely would have just purchased an S19 instead.‚Äù
Bitmain continues to hold leadership despite internal struggle

At the end of the day, manufacturers are always in an arms race, and mining machines are simply commodity products, Zhang argued in a conversation with Cointelegraph:

‚ÄúBesides price, performance, and failure rate, there are not many factors that can help a manufacturer differentiate from the others. The relentless competition led to where we are today.‚Äù
According to Zhang, as the iteration rate naturally slows down in the future, there will be more facilities using ‚Äúcreative thermal design such as immersion cooling,‚Äù hoping to maximize the mining efficiency beyond just using most powerful machines.

As for now, Bitmain remains the leader of the mining race, despite having to deal with the largely defunct 17 series and an intensifying power struggle between its two co-founders, Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan, which recently resulted in reports of a street brawl.

‚ÄúDue to its recent internal issues, Bitmain is facing challenges to keep its strong position in the future thus they started to look at other things to expand its industry influences,‚Äù Xu told Cointelegraph. He added that Bitmain ‚Äúwill still dominate the industry position in the near future due to its network effect,‚Äù although its current problems might allow competitors such as MicroBT to catch up.

Earlier this week, the power struggle inside Bitmain intensified even further as Micree Zhan, an ousted executive of the mining titan, reportedly led a group of private guards to overtake the company‚Äôs office in Beijing.

Meanwhile, Bitmain continues to expand its operations. Last week, the mining company revealed it was extending its ‚ÄúAnt Training Academy‚Äù certification program to North America, with the first courses set to launch in the fall. As such, Bitmain seems to be doubling down on the U.S.-based mining sector, which has been growing recently. The Beijing-based company already operates what it classifies as ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs largest‚Äù mining facility in Rockdale, Texas, which has a planned capacity of 50 megawatts that can later be expanded to 300 megawatts.",1591400430,1,1

I apologise in advance if I waste anybody's time here however I need suggestions on whether I can establish if I received a payment from a  mining contract I took out in 2013.

Back in July 2013 I bough a Bitcoin mining contract from a website called [bitcoinfrenzy.com](https://bitcoinfrenzy.com). I paid $49 for  ""1 GH/s Bitcoin Mining Power ‚Äì 1 Year Contract (#1GH001) ""

This website no longer exists and it may have been a scam as I was quite flush back then so I bought the contract and thought no more of it.

After the initial purchase email in July 2013 I heard no more until November 2013.

13 November 2013 - Newsletter email stating: ""After a long struggle Mining is started for July to till date customers . The order status for all paid orders will be updated within 48 Hours . And we will update""

16 November 2013 I have an email stating that the order had been processed 

22 November 2013 Email stating that payouts have been made from wallet address  1LKpQYvMCyfa5AwD8KrDknhjGfP87xWsVN  

No further emails after this point.

When I check the blockchain for this address I can see coins were sent  to multiple addresses on 22 November 2013.

I do not know what wallet address I provided to bitcoinfrenzy for receipt of any payout.

I did create a wallet on blockchain in May 2013. I have accessed this wallet and there is no transaction history showing.

I have an old version of bitcoin-qt on an old hard disk drive which has a wallet.dat file created April 2013. I have been unsuccessful when trying to load this wallet.

I have all hard drives/laptops from 2013 and since.

Views on: Am I wasting my time here? I s there anything else I can search my hard drives for?  How can I access my old wallet.dat (and none of the results I've found while searching have worked).

NB if one of the receiving addresses from the payout belongs to me the coins will be unspent, there will be no transactions after 22 November 2013 and there may not be any other transactions prior to this.

Any thoughts ? Thanks. If thats a dumb question, I just want to say that I am pretty new to the whole crypto thingy.",1591392732,0,1

I got into contact with a seller, that seemed legit at first, to do a business deal with me and my buyer but he ended up scamming the buyer of a large bitcoin transfer that was sent directly to the him. The problem is, I was too eager to go through with the deal and my buyer had asked me if I would take responsibility for the btc transfer (even though it did not go through me), and I said yes because I didn't want to lose the opportunity. The buyer now says I owe him all the money from the transfer but I don't have the money to pay him back. I will have to pay him back over time if I can't find another solution because he probably still has the text of me saying I would be responsible for the transfer.

gzn8ic,Ghostcarapace3,A proposal for a bitcoin based attack on ethereum's price. Let's eat their lunch.,"Everyone! Makerdao has launched bitcoin backed crypto loans. That means if you hold btc, you can put it in the smart contract, and get dai, and then use that dai to buy more btc. In other words, we can leverage our way past 10k with the money we have.

The catch is that DAI is denominated using oracles that follow ethereum, not bitcoin! Nanananananaana. Soooo if bitcoin goes up in relation to the value of ethereum, and ethereum stays steady in value, we can liquidate our loans at a slight profit. Ethereum holders will be the ones that takes the loss. Basically, we can arbitrage the three way exchange between bitcoin, dai and eth to make profits off the spot market value of eth.

The only problem for us is that we have to move together, in a large movement that splashes ethereum down. Or we need a whale who wants to play. If you are interested, post your interest below, we can do a telegram group for this. If you are an ethereum holder, you should sell your eth now and buy bitcoin if you want to stay safe from this attack. Eth is going down! xD

EDIT: Why this attack works. Makerdao price oracles depend on the spot value of the dollar, in relation to ethereum to determine market rates. If more dai is printed, the market value falls, and the interest rates on loans rises. This means people are incentivized to pay down their crypto loans. However, this calculation is based on the ethereum spot price vs the dollar, not the bitcoin spot price vs the dollar. That means if we print a bunch of dai, and the spot price of dai for eth goes up, people already locking in with eth who are leveraged in will be the ones who have to pay more. They will go through liquidations for their loans.

When their loans are liquidated, they are repurchased at lower prices. Since we are pumping btc, and not pumping eth, the people with leveraged eth loans will be the ones forced into hard liquidations. At that point, we can deleverage safely, without crashing the market, because the makerdao liquidations is where the value of the eth chain is eaten by the btc chain. Gravy?",1591709641,14,0

gzj5qg,hectorhan,Bitcoin VS Blockchain,"If you are new to the cryptocurrency world, you have undoubtedly heard the words ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù and ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù mentioned constantly. Many often use the terms interchangeably. Although related, the reality is that each represents a unique concept. This article will help you understand the basic uses and differences between them.

## What is Blockchain?

Blockchains are essentially electronic ledgers. Their entire purpose is to record transactions. In terms of cryptocurrencies, any time a coin is transferred, a permanent record of this action is securely added to a blockchain. Governments, businesses, and individuals also use and maintain ledgers for a variety of purposes. So what then differentiates blockchains from these traditional ledgers?

The most significant difference is that of ‚Äòdecentralization‚Äô. While the examples mentioned above involve a single specific entity that has control over all records, it is quite the opposite for blockchains. There simply isn‚Äôt any one single person or institution that oversees these transactions. Instead, all participants, regardless of their location, have a copy of and help maintain the virtual ledger.

In other words, every person that chooses to participate in this system becomes a network node. As such, they provide computing power to help verify, maintain, and secure transactions. Combined with cryptographic processes, blockchains are a much more secure and tamper-resistant option than their traditional counterparts.

## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is the first and most popular cryptocurrency ever created. It was designed to be anonymous, decentralized, and secure. To achieve its goals, the virtual currency uses blockchain technology at its core.

As mentioned above, each time a Bitcoin is transferred or moved, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain. Participants around the world offer their computing power to help secure and record these transactions. As a reward for their help in maintaining the system, these ‚Äòminers‚Äô receive newly generated Bitcoins.

The result of this system is an online currency that can instantly be shared all over the world. Users can remain anonymous as all they need is a computer, a virtual wallet, and an internet connection. In addition, because of its decentralized nature, there is no government that can control the supply of this currency.

## Key Takeaways:

* Bitcoin is a decentralized, anonymous, virtual currency.
* Bitcoin uses blockchain technology to securely record transactions .
* Blockchains are virtual ledgers maintained by users all over the world.
* Blockchains are also decentralized and employ cryptography to remain secure.",1591691943,4,2
gzj4qt,facepalm5000,Simple transaction verification script,"I'm working on writing a small command line tool to verify transaction outputs before transactions are signed and/or broadcast.  The goal is to provide an independent sanity-check on wallet-generated / wallet-signed transactions (don't trust, verify) to test whether the specified to addresses in the transaction belong to your master pub key, for use BEFORE signing and certainly before broadcasting. At a minimum, this would validate that the change address belongs to you, since as I understand there are attacks where compromised wallet software can construct transactions with bad change addresses, with wallets that don't provide sufficient validation of change addresses.

So the functionality would be after you generate a tx but before signing, or after signing but before broadcasting, you run the tx hex and master pub key through this function to test the outputs:

(master pub key, transaction hex) -&gt; print out list of transaction output addresses, with confirmation of whether they belong to your wallet, and the addresses' derivation paths (m/0'/0'/0/etc...).

So my question is, before I go and write this myself, if anyone knows any open source command line tools out there that already do this? or if anyone has pointers to code examples to do this kind of hd wallet / address manipulation?

She doesnt bring it up and I'm just not sure if I was being scammed.

2 - would running a Bitcoin core on a mac but store the data on a fast NAS be ok in principle? 

3 - would I make my system more vulnerable to external attacks? I have a SSL certificate on my NAS but as I have work data on it I really do not want that compromises.

4- I Have 4BTC and looking to HODL and I currently store offline on a trezor. In the future can I get my trezor to speak with my node?

5 - once the node is running if I want to buy more BTC must I buy them on a exchange? I use kraken.

h9azn5,sundevil671,Coinstar and Cash.app Alternatives,"Hey All, I am hoping for some tips for some alternative way to get Bitcoins that can be accessed quickly...something nearly as convenient as these 2 options but less shady than [Cash.app](https://Cash.app) (banned me without warning or cause after buying BTC a few times) or a complete ripoff like Coinstar (claims a 4% transaction fee, but doesn't mention that they decide the exchange rate at whatever price they want that is always way less than the actual rate; for example, I fed $980 into a machine a few hours ago, and by the time it is ready to transfer out, is worth about $840 a few hours later). Aside from dealing with some random stranger on a matchmaking site connecting buyers &amp; sellers, is there any other US-legal platform that can perhaps handle some of the same functions as Coinbase without the 3-5 day delay required when buying coins with a checking account (and then dealing with the bank's refusals &amp; security obstacles based on the assumption that anyone trying to deal in BTC is a criminal)?

If you are uninsured and you own stonks, you will have to sell stonks to pay for medical bills or they can force liquidate your stonks via court order asset levy. Bitcoin, on the other hand, people with large hospital bills are better off holding. Court can't take your bitcoin.  


**Death -**  everytime a hodler dies, their coins will either be taken by a relative or lost forever. Think of how many people own bitcoin in secert. Or have their private keys locked by a password that isn't written down anywhere. For example: whatever the modern day silk soad is called, i bet that guy who owns it has a bunch of bitcoin and aint telling nobody about them. He dies of covid and those coins are gone forever. More coins destoryed = lower supply = price goes up

h95vbt,fresheneesz,Securely storing your coins with the Tordl Wallet Protocols,"[The Tordl Wallet Protocols](https://github.com/fresheneesz/TordlWalletProtocols) are holistic open-source guides on how to create and use secure bitcoin wallet setups. The protocols consider things like security against theft, safety against accidents, and inheritance. Some of the protocols can be resilient against the [$5 wrench attack](https://blog.keys.casa/how-to-protect-your-bitcoin-from-5-wrench-attacks/). 

I was partially inspired by the Glacier Protocol to create this, though I wanted a guide that was easier to extend and that others could build off of.

The protocols are aimed at tech-savvy people but you do not need to be an expert to use them by any means. The protocols are also designed in modular pieces, kind of like a software module, so that other projects can point to an individual protocol as part of their own guidance. Some of the pages even have a ""variable parameters"" section that defines what choices need to be decided on to use the guidance on that page.

I'm looking for a couple things from the community:

**Reviewers** to go through it, find mistakes, potential security holes, and other ways the project could be improved.

**Contributors** who can help actually write improvements and potentially be co-owners on the project.

**Ideas** on how to find contributors or people who could help me move this project along.

Please take a look and tell me what you think, either here or on github issues.",1592183102,4,2

What's more critical is that no explanation or reason was given. I have neither complaints nor no bad reviews, but instead many of my customers are very trustworthy.

What I'm trying to find out is How exactly do miners (whether solo miners or miners in a mining pool) decide which available transactions to try out (on the first try and on the subsequent tries).

I see that the Mempool can often contain thousands of transactions waiting to be put into new blocks, and just selection 10 of them yields an unbelievably high number of combinations (try the nCr function with n=1000 and r=10, and you'll see what I mean), more than even the most powerful mining pools can even dream of trying out in an appropriate amount of time.

Therefore, since miners eventually find successful blocks, they must also always manage to find a successful combination of transactions that will yield a successful block, and I'm wondering how miners manage to do this without having to go through the enormous amount of combinations of which it's impossible to try all of them.",1591953180,8,1

hbdkfu,KiFastCallEntry,"""Did Satoshi really have an bitcoin address?"" - how should we treat bare-pubkey P2PK outputs?","What's the genesis address of Bitcoin, which is supposed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto?  1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa right?

I'm afraid to say that some Bitcoin Core devs may disagree with that.

Technically there are indeedly several facts which are really not intuitive:

1. The 50BTC in the genesis block is not spendable. (this is not really related)
2. **Satoshi used raw-pubkey P2PK outputs, which is not same thing with the currently commonly used P2PKH public key hash outputs**, let alone SegWit outputs (both bc1-starting P2WPKH addresses or 3-starting P2SH-P2WPKH addresses require the public key to be hashed).
3. A lot of ""ancient"" transactions uses such raw-pubkey outputs, which are also uncompressed public keys. (this is not really related either)

However, quite a few things in the bitcoin ecosystem still recognize P2PK outputs as a thing of the same class with P2PKH, including Bitcoin Core itself.

Then guess what? The latest release (0.20.0) of Bitcoin Core has just removed one of the legacy traces of this issue: [Pull request #16725: Don't show addresses or P2PK in decoderawtransaction](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16725)

However it seems that the GUI wallet still hasn't remove similar logics, so that 1-starting P2PKH addresses could still show up if you create a new wallet and then import some ancient pubkeys into it, just like the screenshot posted [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16725#issuecomment-638602633).

Block explorers also behave differently on this issue. [Blockstream.info](https://Blockstream.info) won't show corresponding P2PKH address of bare-pubkey P2PK outputs at all, while [Blockchain.info](https://Blockchain.info) would show the full string of 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa.

In my own opinion probably Bitcoin Core is not doing something correct this time. However it's not good to confuse P2PK with P2PKH either.",1592482903,15,1

The reason behind Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to rise further and faster than any other monetary asset is ‚Äòhalving‚Äô.

If you can find the wallet files intact, can you take those coins? 
A few things you could probably educate me on:
Is the scenario of people having wallets on old pcs even a thing? I use trezor and trezor wallet today and mostly understand how it works, but I dont really know how bitcoins were secured back then.
If you found whatever files you need is there any further security to keep you from transferring them to another wallet? like for example my trezor has a pin code that only I know. did wallets have codes back then that would make finding one completely useless? 

a note, I understand that it is not likely at all to find an old pc, at let's say a garage sale or estate sale, that has a btc wallet securing any real amount of coins. But assuming you found one, could you even take ownership of these coins? 
I am asking this question because I think it could be a fun hobby scrounging for pcs from a specific timeframe and looking around for wallets. almost got the same reason that people play the lottery. it's not a good chance but what if? there are lost btcs out there because some poor chap died with them stored away that no one else knows about. this is certainly a scenario that exists. can they be recovered under certain circumstances?",1592474334,1,1

I currently have 1.007 BTC and I want to get to 2.1 to be part of the 10,000,000 club, but I want to see what you all genuinely believe BTC will be come the new decade.

My bet for 1/1/2030 is $5,100,000 USD. No bull, if it isn't 5.1M then the world is on fire and covered in lava.

hb8gpj,Mari0805,12 Reasons to Buy BTC!,"1. Bitcoin is the best performing asset of the last decade. How could you not own the best performing asset of the last decade? Not even .1%, seriously? 
2. Bitcoin thrives on uncertainty/chaos. We‚Äôre halfway through 2020 and it feels like a decade has gone by.  Bitcoin was born for this. 
3. Bitcoin is revolutionary technology that's changing the world as you read this. Consider a small Bitcoin investment as ‚Äúyour fee to learn about the future.‚Äù 
4. ‚ÄúBitcoin is an unstoppable force‚Äù -- US Congressman, Patrick McHenry. The Congressman is right. 
5. The world is waking up to Bitcoin. ""Smart Money"" investors already own Bitcoin.  
6. Bitcoin is the most fair money. Bitcoin enables equality of opportunity. (equality of outcome is not possible nor desirable) Everyone can participate in the same monetary system. Let's end government money discriminating against the poor, minorities, elderly, and helpless. 
7. Buy Bitcoin to support free speech. Free speech underpins a free and open society. Bitcoin is money, and money is speech. Don‚Äôt like watching governments and central banks bailing out their buddies while mainstreet suffers?  
8. Scarcity matters. We‚Äôve never had a truly scarce monetary good. To put it in perspective, there are twice as many millionaires (46m) as there are bitcoins (21m). Might be smart to get some before everyone catches on. 
9. The Roman Empire fell  Just like the roman empire, the US Dollar Hegemony won‚Äôt last forever.   The ‚Äúmonetary base‚Äù changes periodically. Bitcoin has a real chance of being the next monetary base.  Pound Sterling --&gt; US Dollar --&gt; ?? 
10. The Money Printer is stuck on ""Brrrrrr""  Fed Chairman Powell: ""the fed is not thinking about thinking about raising interest rates.""  How long before the Fed buys fine art?  Unlimited dollars chasing a finite 21m Bitcoins 
11. Bitcoin mimics an evolutionary strategy that's been working for over 1 billion years (decentralized network intelligence). Commonly observed in mycelium, neurons, the internet, and now Bitcoin. Bitcoin is Lindy. 
12. Good money matters. Money is foundational technology enabling humans to organize in a complex society. Money enables specialization + trade which increases wealth for everyone.   Bitcoin is the best money we‚Äôve ever had. Fix the money, fix the world.",1592458375,8,1

I'm Venezuelan living here and have taken the time to track and share this weekly numbers.

Considering now the goverment is officially taking BTC to pay for passports, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/her9xg/venezuela\_government\_is\_officially\_taking\_bitcoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/her9xg/venezuela_government_is_officially_taking_bitcoin/)

I think a part of that weekly Localbitcoin volumen comes directly for the goverment. It has been around 2,000 BTC monthly for months!  (only measured using  LocalBitcoin, there are other exchanges like AIRTM, Uphold, Binance and  so on, but no open data). Most of the Localbitcoin trades are in Bolivares.

I recommend reading this website, it is one of the best english websites for Venezuela news (they sometimes touch the crypto and economic situation).

[https://www.caracaschronicles.com/](https://www.caracaschronicles.com/) 

People  always ask what the the  average salary, not the minimum. Well I would  say around 20-50 USD  monthly. One doctor is around 30 USD. Teacher  around 20 USD.  Junior  engineer maybe 50 USD (The  engineers collegue  ""suggests"" around 200  USD monthly, but it is hard to find a place with  these wages)

Any question let me know, AMA. But check my links and sources first.

Scam/ Phishing/ Bitcoin Scam/ Fake Banks

Hi Guys! I just want to make everyone aware of one of the biggest scam going on currently and I was a victim of it. So they will try to get in touch with you through mostly Instagram or any other way saying they are investors and will have real company website in profile (they don‚Äôt work there) and that they are experts in forex trade and will work to increase our money by investing in one week. So to convince they will say we can even deposit minimum like $200 then they will have you make an account on sites like tradersplacefx (fake) or any other site. So on the account they will show you that the money is growing in a week, so fakely you will see that your deposit is growing to like $20,000. Of course you will get excited, so since your deposit grew they will ask you to deposit money certain amount of money ($2000 for me). I ll be honest I fell for all of this but I want to save other people‚Äôs money. So I deposited and then now it gets interesting they will make you create blockchain wallet and account saying that they will transfer the funds in blockchain wallet. So they will ask for your login info. So once you give login info you do see your deposit there but then they will ask you to deposit $5000 saying you cannot have empty wallet. Once you do they will lock the wallet address with private key (which you cannot retrieve) just can see the money sitting there. They will say we will keep adding the deposit whatever you deposit. So now your blockchain wallet has about $26,000 which is not yours. So now they will say that we deal with only one bank such as EUPHORIA SWISS BANK (Euphoriaswissbank), so I did some research they have made their website look like a real bank website [https://en-s.euphoriaswissbank.com/](https://en-s.euphoriaswissbank.com/) With pics of agents and all but I found out that it was a copy of a US bank that looks the same. So they will ask you to make an account there, you will see your money go into the bank. Now they will ask you to deposit about 10K for some BS reason, they will say it is to link offline and online account. But lets say if you do that also then they will send you another e-mail saying we have to deposit 14% for security of deposit which is another $6,500 . So now I got suspicious that they keep on asking for deposit here and there to transfer my money to my local bank. So I asked bank to provided me with FDIC and physical address of the bank, of course which they don‚Äôt have they will say its online bank that‚Äôs why. So I did not send anymore after that, then they will keep e-mailing you to deposit payment to transfer funds to your local bank. So Now I have money in their bank account, just sitting there and they will show fake numbers. SO guys BE AWARE, take my example and DO not Fall for this!!!!!! They are earning a lot by this, I even saw someone send about 125K I feel bad for that person. SAVE your MONEY!! I want to make  everyone aware and save their money because it does hurt losing hard earned money. I have lost about $21,000 L. At this point you cannot recover your money no matter how hard you try. 

Please Help share and remember the names of the banks or Instagram address might be different but do your research about bank (if no FDIC number or physical address not a real bank! I learned the hard way!. They will make it look like its very real bank and real site. So BE ALERT!!! And AWARE and help me Spread the word.

PS: If you think this above info helped saved your money, I‚Äôll really appreciate optional donation ( to recover my savings which I spent a lot of time saving L) to my bitcoin address:

Messari‚Äôs Ryan Watkins has crunched the numbers and predicts that if institutions allocate just 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, then BTC‚Äôs market cap could rise to above $1 trillion,
Watkins‚Äô research sought to calculate the impact on the BTC price of institutions following the famed hedge fund manager¬†Paul Tudor Jones‚Äô example of investing a ‚Äúlow single-digit percentage‚Äù into Bitcoin.¬†¬†
#CoronavirusLockdownUK #coronavirus 



The¬†researcher¬†predicts that a tiny percentage allocation from endowments &amp; foundations, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and mutual funds to BTC would result in around $480 billion in new money entering the Bitcoin markets.
Citing research by crypto researcher¬†Chris Burniske¬†that found fiat flows into crypto to typically drove price gains of between two times and 25 times during the 2017 bull trend, Watkins estimates that ‚Äúan aggregate 1% institutional allocation to Bitcoin can easily bring Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap above $1 trillion, or over $50,000 per BTC‚Äù.",1592991436,2,1

hesajh,-Nakamoto-,Sharing your hardware wallet,"So i'm hoping someone can help me with a question I've had for a couple days. I'm still kind of a newby to Bitcoin so excuse me if I say or asked naive things.

I finally convinced my dad to buy Bitcoin after explaining that even if he doesn't understand it or totally trust it he can trust me and have some coins as an insurance for the end of the world. (I consider this a great win considering he is almost 70).

So I've been how is the best way in practical terms to go through with it. And I've come up with this options:  
a) Help him create an exchange account with a friendly UI like Coinbase and send him the money there.  
b) Get him a hardware wallet and somehow explain to him how the hole recovery seed thing and wallets works.  
c) Store the coins for him and eventually give them to him when he wants them.

Clearly the easiest options would be either A or C (I don't think he wants to learn how to be his own custodian) , and I don't want an exchange to hold his coins (I don't trust them). So I want to hold the coins for him but I'm worried that in the future he might eventually learn how to store them. In which case if I send him the coins he would have to pay Capital Gains.  So I guess my question is if I got the tax thing right, and if so, is there any way around it?

Also, I have a Trezor One wallet which I understand generates new addresses for each transaction to avoid having all the movement in one account and therefore make it imposible for someone to follow your activity. I was wondering if in this case I could just store the coins for him and if in the future he  ever wants me. Could I just argue that he has a wallet within my wallet and therefore if he transfer his coins to his wallet he doesn't have to pay capital gains because they never left his control?

hd7zlh,ElephantGlue,Will there come a day where bitcoin cannot be traded for fiat?,"Just a question I‚Äôd like to see some differing opinions on.

I think it‚Äôs possible that if bitcoin continues to rise in value against the dollar that eventually people stop wanting to trade it for dollars entirely.

In order for that to happen though, companies like the power companies supplying power to the miners have to accept bitcoin as a form of payment.

I think this happens when people start realizing how much better an economic system based on hard coded protocols is than a system where a group of people at the top use theories based on crony capitalism and false pretenses for who should get the lions share of endlessly printed fiat.

So if these things happen, is it really that unlikely that a breakaway occurs where the people who believe in bitcoin only transact in bitcoin? 

Does this process necessarily lead to hyperinflation of fiat currencies itself?

I think it‚Äôs possible that when companies start accepting it en masse, this could lead to such a drastic push out of fiat that all fiat currencies start to hyperinflate together.

All of economic theory up until this point has been one massive experiment, and this has happened to many other fiat currencies. I think this could happen faster than most people realize.",1592750364,13,1
hd7uvy,MMadison93,BTC vs Alts price relationship,"I'm trying to understand the relationship there and make sense of the last bull runs. I've come up with the following but would appreciate someone telling me if I'm way off base or missing a fundamental piece of thinking?

Let's say BTC goes up significantly. Which translates to alts being worth less BTC, and BTC being able to buy more alts.

So during a BTC bull run, people will either:

1) Sell bags of alts (cheap) for BTC due to FOMO
2) Leverage BTC to buy more bags of alts (greed?)

If the latter outweighs the former, it will cause alts go up in BTC value as well. Alt bull run starts until people want BTC back, who sell alts and leave people holding bags again. Pretty accurate or?

This is a nice way of showing that a side chain can be supported without mining. It also shows that a side chain not backed by the same POW doesn't require support by a particular POW, like the UTXO model for side chains. This is still incomplete, though; we have some small side chains that are backed by both N POWs, but not by both T and B. We should see other side-chains supported soon as well, since the more N POWs supported, the more effective they are. In one case we can prove that the side chain N POW isn't backed by a POW (see our blog post about n-partitioning the side chains). In another case we could prove that the side chain N POW isn't backed by both POWs (see the article at the bottom of the original) but we might need additional proofs, perhaps: - The N POW backing isn't tied to a particular side-chain (for example Bitcoin-QT only supports it for blocks where it's part of a specific side chain)",1592738891,1,1

hd42u2,anon517,"If you're skeptical of Bitcoin, don't change.","The point of Bitcoin is that you SHOULD be skeptical. You should NOT blindly trust anything, or anyone. Bitcoin was made for you, because it is designed and published in the open. From the whitepaper to the source code to the transactions being transmitted over the network. The design is not hidden. It is available for you to scrutinize to an incredible detail that's never been seen before in monetary history. It welcomes skeptics with open arms.

If anything, we need more skeptical eyes. They are what make Bitcoin stronger and stronger.

And furthermore, with the prevalence of scams and shitcoins, skepticism is all the more important.

If you're NOT skeptical, you should be very worried for your own sake. And if you're skeptical and ALSO uninterested in understanding Bitcoin, I am sorry to say that is also a blindness. Being skeptical of everything out of only intuition and not actually looking deeper into what actually CAN be trusted will lead you to a blind dead end - you will likely be left on the wrong side of history.

Some of the most aggressive and most brilliant attackers have constantly been trying to break Bitcoin for the last 10 years and failed. And there are incredibly skeptical scientists, economists, and mathematicians who unequivocally trust Bitcoin through understanding it. 

We all understand, Bitcoin can be scary.

The first people to contemplate flying on an airplane (outside of the inventors) thought it was complete madness. Incredible risk. How can you trust the physics and science of flying? Is the physics of flight actually reliable? As a regular Joe not into aerospace science, how can it be trusted?

Well, early on only the physicists and scientists had confidence in the plan because they knew what they were doing (except when they made mistakes as humans do). Slowly but surely, more people saw that it was safe. And they also accepted flying. And now, flying in an airplane is pretty much a standard way to travel long distance.

Yes, trusting Bitcoin with your money is scary as hell and it should be. Your money is no joke, you need it to survive. And yes, if you don't know what you're doing, you can screw up with Bitcoin (e.g. losing your keys is like opening the emergency exit on the plane and walking out to your death). But we're getting better at protecting you every day, with tools and education.

And there's a distinct advantage in being in Bitcoin early. Not just in terms of ""financial gain"" but even just taking the time to understand it puts you ahead in case you really need it someday. You don't need to trust it, to understand it. Because someday, everyone may be using it (like the phone, the airplane, the internet) and you can either keep up or be left behind.

I'm thinking of doing the next steps.

- I use fiat to buy bitcoin on a standard exchange. This exchange has KYC. There is a link between my identity and the bitcoins.

- I create an account on Bitfinex. Bitfinex doesn't need KYC if you only work with crypto.

- I transfer my Bitcoins to Bitfinex and buy Monero

- I transfer my Monero to my Monerujo wallet on my phone.

- On my phone, I install Lightning Labs, Lightning wallet. (Or Eclair).

- I use XMR.to and convert my Monero to Bitcoin, using the Bitcoin address of the lightning wallet.

- I open a channel using the Bitcoins.

- I use the Lightning or Eclair wallet for standard bitcoin and lightning payments.

Am I correct that my bitcoin or Lightning payments are now entirely anonymous?

I will use another Bitcoin/Lightning wallet for payments linked to my identity, for example, charge phone or pay for a hotel room.",1592717709,4,1

In the case of 7-zip, those who are paranoid can embed the encrypted archive inside another encrypted archive with a different password that is very long and complex.  I'm thinking something in the order of 40 characters or more if the .7z will be stored on something like a cloud backup?

Let's say you're right.  Let's say the current system is completely unsustainable and melts down.

What do you think that looks like?  Do you honestly believe people are just going to shift to bitcoin and go back to work the next day?  That you can just lift and shift the house of modern society onto a new foundation with a couple of dudes and a forklift?

It will be complete and total chaos.  Entire governments will collapse.  The world will devolve rapidly into lawlessness and anarchy.  There will be wars - *everywhere*.  Every country will become fully militarized and have to defend its borders.  No one is going to give a shit about bitcoin.  They're going to care about not getting blown up or otherwise murdered.  It will be **years** of global strife.

And you're looking forward to this?  You're eager for this?  You think because you hodl a few bitcoins you're somehow going to be safe from a world where you have to constantly sleep with one eye open and protect yourself from very real imminent danger 24/7?

You really want to join a militia, barricade off your own territory, organize groups of people to do basic shit like filter water and dig holes for toilets?  Find ways of generating power?  Essentially re-establish the modern world and society from the ground up?

so I received money from him about $1k BTC. Everything was good till then.

After that, i contacted the support of Crypto Amity to withdraw funds to blockchain wallet. They said you need to verify the external wallet address. And for verification, you need to send 0.02 BTC  from the external wallet to the crypto Amity exchange wallet. I did that not once but 3 times and the total amount was 0.064 BTC. 

When I tried to withdraw my funds to the same blockchain external wallet then again there was an error for insurance. I came to know that I've to pay more 0.05 BTC to my Crypto Amity Wallet as insurance if I want to withdraw my all funds to an external wallet like [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com) etc. And they will return this amount after 7 days to my external wallet.

What's stopping a country from devaluing their currency by printing a ton of money and directly buying Bitcoin? They could buy them on international exchanges and give away their worthless currency for as much Bitcoin as they can get. They can then convert fully to a Bitcoin currency and be well above other countries financially as this massive global equity and debt bubble pops.

Hell, all a country would have to do is ANNOUNCE that they are going to do this. Just the announcement would trigger a massive buying frenzy and it would become a self fulfilling prophecy. It would probably cause a domino effect and other countries would start to feel the pressure to do the same lest they miss out on getting in on the next global currency.

hgedit,OneTrueWizardKing,Bip32 Password Recovery? - Using Trezor One w/ Exodus Wallet (Details Inside),"Hi everybody,   
I transferred some BTC into my Exodus wallet, which I have set up to work in tandem with my Trezor One. 

If you're not familiar, you basically log your Trezor's master key on the Exodus desktop app, and then when you boot up Exodus and plug in your Trezor, it'll prompt you to type in a bip32 password to access individual wallets. Only problem is,  if you mistype the password, it has no idea you've mistyped it, and just creates a new empty wallet. So the next time I logged in, I realized what happened, but I haven't been able to figure out the exact ""wrong"" password that I created the wallet with. Thankfully, it was only about .05BTC - sucks to lose, but not the whole sack.  


Anybody got any tips? I found this ([https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/pull/6219](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/pull/6219)), but I don't understand quite how to use it.

hgbina,brianddk,"TA Gurus, explain my chart..","This is a chart I made up that roughly correlates Bitcoin market cap to Bitcoin mining costs.  It is ""normalized"" through the halvenings.  It definitely shows a downward trend.  The ""normalization"" for halvenings applies a 100% coefficent post 2020 halvening, a 50% coefficent after the 2016 halvening and a 25% coefficent before the 2016 halvening.

The formula sprung from a discussion I was having on BTC wealth redistribution, and how the BTC holders rely on the miners to secure the chain.  The counter argument was that the holders could just pay for the mining themselves.

Since bitcoin is non-inflationary, this could be thought of as a type of negative interest rate.  If every holder had to offer a 100% subsidy to the miners to maintain the blockchain, what would that look like in the terms of a continual interest rate.  So here's the formula.

    Continual Interest function: 
       A = P*exp(r*t)
       ln(A) = ln(P) + rt
       r = ln(A) / ln(P) / t
       r = ln(A/P) / t   # (where t = 1/365, aka one day)
       r = ln(1 + I/P) / t   # (where A/P = 1+I/P; with 'I' being pct growth
    interest = norm_coef * ln(1 + daily_mining_cost / btc_market_cap) * 365

The datasource is from [bitinfocharts.com](https://bitinfocharts.com) referencing ""Market Capitalization"", ""Hashrate"" and ""Mining Profitability"" fields.  ""Daily Mining Cost"" is derived by ""Profitability \* Hashrate"" once correcting for unit scales.

So why is it after normalizing for the halvenings this interest function is on a negative trend over the last 5 years?

hioei0,daniel446,Bitcoin problems," The most critical flaw in Bitcoin is its lack of privacy. If you give me your Bitcoin wallet address so that I can send you a payment, you immediately compromise your privacy. I can see as a matter of public record how much money you have in your Bitcoin wallet (there are messy workarounds to attempt to fix this problem, which we will address shortly). The same situation applies even if you are the one sending Bitcoin. Any recipient can then see how much money you have in your Bitcoin wallet, both now and in perpetuity. To understand how critical this privacy problem is, consider the following scenarios: 

 1. You are travelling through parts of a country with a medium to high violent crime rate. You need to use some of your Bitcoin to pay for something. If every person you transact with knows exactly how much money you have, this is a threat to your personal physical safety.  


2. You are a business that receives a payment from a supplier. That supplier will be able to see how much money your business has, and therefore can guess at how price sensitive you are in future negotiations. They can see every single other payment you‚Äôve ever received to that Bitcoin address, and therefore determine what other suppliers you are dealing with and how much you are paying those suppliers. They may be able to roughly determine how many customers you have and how much you charge your customers. This is commercially sensitive information that damages your negotiating position enough to cause you relative financial loss.  


3. You are a private citizen paying for online goods and services. You are aware that it is common practice for companies to attempt to use ‚Äòprice discrimination‚Äô algorithms to attempt to determine the highest prices they can offer future services to you at, and you would prefer they do not have the information advantage of knowing how much you spend and where you spend it.  


4. You sell cupcakes and receive Bitcoin as payment. It turns out that someone who owned that Bitcoin before you was involved in criminal activity. Now you are worried that you have become a suspect in a criminal case, because the movement of funds to you is a matter of public record. You are also worried that certain Bitcoins that you thought you owned will be considered ‚Äòtainted‚Äô and that others will refuse to accept them as payment.

I know many of you are already familiar with other projects such as Gekko and Freqtrade, etc and would like to know why I started Jesse instead of using them. So here are a few reasons:

* Simple syntax for defining strategies. I have years of experience and a deep understanding of frameworks such as Laravel and Vuejs which are popular for their simplicity. I designed Jesse the same way. So #1 thing that you'll like about Jesse is how easy it makes it for you turn a strategy idea into actual code.
* Support for using multiple timeframes and symbols in a single strategy. I haven't seen any other project that can offer this **without the look-ahead bias**. Jesse does that.
* Trading more than one pair at the same time. Jesse allows doing this. I designed it using Routes, which is a concept borrowed from web development.
* It is accurate. This part was a real pain. I did it tho. Through hundreds of unit tests.
* Provides tools for getting and manipulating data in Jupyter notebooks.

## Example Strategy

Here is an example of a profitable strategy that shows the usage of TA and the syntax of the framework:

    from jesse.strategies import Strategy
    import jesse.indicators as ta
    from jesse import utils
    
    
    class SampleTrendFollowing(Strategy):
        @property

        def short_ema(self):
            return ta.ema(self.candles, 21)
    
        @property
        def atr(self):
            return ta.atr(self.candles)
    
        def should_long(self) -&gt; bool:
            return self.short_ema &gt; self.long_ema
    
        def should_short(self) -&gt; bool:
            return self.short_ema &lt; self.long_ema

Because according to them, they shouldn't have resisted, and are thugs who shouldn't be martyrd. A hateful bunch they are that this site has done very well to have removed from itself.

More context for those who don't know, .win is a Trump supporting website, and Trump hates Bitcoin. He has vowed to destroy it. Old idiot doesn't even realize you can't kill a decentralized internet network. That is more impossible than China's old vow to kill the internet when it was new.

hifg3b,jumper23sierra,"Is Bitcoin vulnerable to ""Wrapped"" technology on Ethereum?","Wrapping bitcoin up to be transported on the Ethereum network, saves costs and time at the expense of lower security and centralization(currently done by a 3rd party), but poses strong challenges to the bitcoin ecosystem.

Transaction fees are revenue to bitcoin miners may be one day be threatened by the growth in the ""wrapped"" bitcoin technology. 

As of the current moment the amount locked up in WBTC(and transacted?) is 75M and growing based on https://defipulse.com/wbtc.

If this persists, would we expect unprofitable miners to evitably drop off and eventually cause the ecosystem to centralize?

This situation is further exacerbated by the development of Ethereum layer 2 solutions to make transactions on the network faster/cheaper, and also a project(Renbtc) that is underway to decentralise the ""wrapping"" of bitcoin for use on Ethereum.

Fact (from fbi.gov). More white people are killed by police than black people. MUCH more black people are killed by other black people than any other race. Yet you are not allowed to post these stats, because it goes against the narrative. I‚Äôve spent the past month learning and seeing both sides. This is a rabbit hole and it goes deep.

hibbiv,SumDaysAreGood,"Teaching my 7yo daughter about Bitcoin, Money, Investing, etc. Advice needed","For starters, her weekly allowance will be in Bitcoin, around $5-$10. 

1. What is the cheapest way I can set this up weekly while minimizing fees? I don‚Äôt want to see it get eaten up in fees on such micro levels. Is there a better microinvesting app for such needs? Should I do it monthly and just tell her it is weekly to save? Heard Robinhood sucks but what about Cash App?

2. Anything out there that can help me teach her BTC white paper and what is hard money in kid friendly terms? No jokes please...this is tough to break down even for adults. 

3. I also would like to teach her about FIAT....the bad, the bad, and the ugly since it‚Äôs not going away. Spending, savings and even traditional investments. I want kid friendly list of words/definitions she should know such as asset, liability, reallocation, diversification, etc. What words do you think are important? Do you have a list I can turn into flash cards?

We are going to do weekly money lessons and she gets paid her bitcoin at the end of each lesson. She will be allowed to to sell up to 25% once per year at her choice or continue to save. She will be allowed to rebalance or change investment vehicles on intervals as well. After all, many kids do want to spend money on things and she should learn the pride in that too otherwise what is this for?

I‚Äôm not tying chores or anything to this because those are expected of her in our house as part of her contributions to the family, but I am thinking of having special one time odd tasks around the house for extra Bitcoin. 

I‚Äôm not going for dad of the year here. I just want to arm her with real knowledge outside the common core stuff and focus on how to stay out of debt and the importance. 

I even have a Nano Ledger for her. I‚Äôm ready but I want guidance. 

Can you help me with any of this please?",1593472720,24,1

hia382,Pantamis,Crypto to Fiat Atomic Swap with OASIS,"I find this project very interesting : [https://www.nimiq.com/oasis/](https://www.nimiq.com/oasis/)

&amp;#x200B;

It would unlock the possibility of atomic swap between ‚Ç¨'s and bitcoins and much more (an atomic swap is an exchange protocol where only two outcomes are possible by design, assets are exchanged or not. It is not possible for one party to take the asset of the other without leaving its previously own asset, protocol detailed [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap))

&amp;#x200B;

It is not released yet but I find this promising as it is the path toward totallly decentralized exchange between fiat and crypto without risks. It would be really nice to have this in a DEX like bisq to remove arbitration need.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously  there are concerns with censorship by the german bank, privacy (KYC required if you trade more than 1000‚Ç¨ a month) and they don't say anything about chargeback (arbitration is needed as soon as chargeback are possible). And maybe it will never be released.

&amp;#x200B;

gvkhf8,crrdlx,Did a sudden drastic drop happen? Yawn. Welcome to bitcoin.,"The market just dropped straight down about 500 points. About 5% in an instant.  Yep.

Bitcoin and crypto often get criticized for ""market manipulation."" Personally, I don't subscribe to the easy conspiracy market manipulation theories, even here. I see supply meeting demand. Or, a seller meeting a buyer. In the case shown in the graph, I see a whale making a sell, nothing more. The honey badger of bitcoin doesn't care about these actions causimg a drop in price and he'll bite back real soon.

I will say that I look forward to the day when ""whales"" like this will have only a tiny, tiny ripple in the market. You know how you buy a helium balloon and it's awesome? And the next day it's awwsome, but a bit smaller? And the third day it's peaked? Then it's ailing? Then shriveled? Then flat? As bitcoin grows, these whales are relatively shrinking.

The day will come.
Patience.

gvjskn,hectorhan,Different Types of Wallets for cryptocurrency,"Before you being trading cryptocurrencies or bitcoin futures, securing your funds is the most important thing. There are multiple options and methods to store your cryptocurrencies. In this article, we will cover some of the most prominent types of wallets.

Paper Wallets

This is the least technological option of them all as it involves printing your public address and private keys on a piece of paper. The benefit of this option is that you keep your cryptocurrencies offline. Of course, if your paper gets damaged or lost, you may lose your funds forever.

Mobile Wallets

This is perhaps the most used and most convenient option. Virtually everyone carries a smartphone today. This means constant and consistent access to your funds. However, you must choose a mobile wallet carefully based on how much you trust the company behind it. Because these are hot wallets (connected to the internet), the security measures the company employs are of utmost importance.

Desktop Wallets

These wallets may be slightly less convenient than mobile versions as not everyone carries a computer everywhere they go, but generally being able to access your computer multiple times a day should not be too difficult. Just be careful as your computer often remains connected to the internet and must be secured property through antivirus software and firewalls.

Web Wallets

This option can be accessed by any type of device with an internet connection as the wallet stores your funds online. Though convenient, this is perhaps the least safe option as it is prone to malicious hacking and DDOS attacks.

Hardware Wallets

Finally, we have hardware wallets or devices specifically designed to store your cryptocurrencies. They often come in the form of a USB Flash Drive with some sort of way to navigate through its options on a small screen. These can also be connected to your computer. This type of wallet is the most secure option and an excellent way to keep your funds offline.

Phemex Security

When you store your funds on Phemex to trade Bitcoin Futures with us, you can rest easy knowing that we employ various sophisticated security measures. We use a Hierarchical Deterministic Cold Wallet System which assigns separate cold wallet deposit addresses to each user. All the deposits are periodically gathered in the company‚Äôs multisignature cold wallet via offline signature. Withdrawal requests are rigorously scrutinized by both operators and founders and anything perceived as malicious is instantly stopped.

What's the best way to go about this? She's not tech savvy, so anything too advanced is out the window. My current plan is to help her set up a Coinbase account, and keep her crypto on the exchange- I'm aware of the risk and fees to this, but simply put, I want to keep it as simple as possible for her.

gvcrws,torchesXXtogether,Cancelling unconfirmed transactions,"A little background:
BTC is functional for me. I buy a small amount on Coinbase, send it to a blockchain wallet, and use it to fund the odd poker tournament here or there. I don‚Äôt know, really, anything about the technical side of things. (Which is to say, I‚Äôm not looking for long-term investments or anything) So, when I was chastised this morning for not using a different wallet, I really wasn‚Äôt sure what to do. Anyway, when I am transferring out of blockchain, I allow the platform I calculate the fee. I know I can make a custom fee. But I don‚Äôt know enough to do this reasonably. Last night (11:30 mountain) I sent a small amount of BTC out of my blockchain wallet. The platform assessed a 3sat/byte fee. I understand this is very small. Now, 13 hours later, I still have no confirmations. And looking at the mempool, it doesn‚Äôt look like this is going to clear at all. 

Do I have any recourse? Can I cancel it and resend it? Or am I stuck? Thank you.",1591122444,18,2

New to all of this and been doing the advised reading. Looking to starting getting involved, chunk of salary every week or month and see if some patience and a long ‚Äòhodl‚Äô will get me some good results.

Downloaded Coinbase &amp; Coinbase Pro. Seems to be the easiest of the exchanges to use in the U.K. I‚Äôve also read all the shit about them. 

Also first purchase will be a hardware wallet. 

Question is, despite its flaws is there any reason I should run into problems if I am simply using Coinbase to drop some cash into, buy some BTC once per week/month and them pop it straight into a hardware wallet?! The problems seem to be people leaving money on the exchange but I‚Äôm very new to this so anymore advice appreciated",1591121696,10,2

gvbr1g,LongAnteater3,BTC is helping me kickstart my life,"I've known about BTC since 2014, but mid 2018 is when i started heavily investing into it.   
I started off with a thousand, managed to make 30% from buying low/selling high and decided to take out a big loan in excitement. 

It didn't go so well at first, i made a bad trade and had to wait 6 months to make a profit.  
Obviously, the first thing i did was pay off that loan and be grateful for the few thousands i got.

2019 came around, i was done with loans for good so i decided to put 95% of my savings into crypto..   
It took a year and a half of bad trades and selling too early, but in the end, i managed to double my investment.  
I'm hoping i can double it again to afford the deposit on a quadplex.

The Bitminter mining pool will shut down mining activities on 2020-07-01. The website will stay up until 2021-06-01 so you can cash out any crypto currency on your account.

It is unfortunate to have to shut down after 9 years of mining. However, to keep going would not be fair to the few miners we have left in the pool. The efforts of miners who have tried to keep the pool going is greatly appreciated. But the pool has shrunk so much that we might never find another block. Attempts to bring big miners onboard did not work out.

A big thank you to everyone who mined with Bitminter over the years. This has been a grand adventure.

The original purpose of Bitminter was to make mining accessible to those who found other mining software difficult to operate. For many of our users mining in this pool was their first experience with bitcoin. I hope you enjoyed it and that you are still part of the bitcoin community.

Hopefully Bitminter was a useful service for you.

Best of luck for the future.",1591012846,9,1

guhl15,sunny_lts,"Brave organization running a bad business, BAT project centralized","Brave is so cheap they spent money and time and resources developing a ""Suspended Bat"" feature in their creators Dashboard. This is the money I have earned by running a BAT verified website waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack in 2018. I have been fighting again and again and again to get my account and my BAT out.

I've spent money on hosting and developing a website that brought me these funds. First they suspended my account without a reason (automatic security check). After appealing 5 times over the course of two years my account was finally released.

Come the moment to withdraw my BAT, I was time-gated by having to go through Uphold. To become a verified member on Uphold I had to order a new ID card, because they wouldn't verify me there either ( clever partnership ). But I did, I got verified and I sneaked past the system. My BAT was now ready to get withdrawn ----------- well not yet, I had to wait 1 month for the next cycle of payout to come. I really don't understand this system btw. So I gave it another 2-3 months.

BUT I gave them too much time, in this time the developers have made a new feature on their Brave creator's dashboard, signaling that the money I've earned in 2018 is ""suspended"", they even claim that Brave owns my BAT (a cryptocurrency, lol), so now I have to appeal again, providing the same old references I had to provide the first 5 times.

And I'm getting tired of this shit, instead of fighting to spread the usage and philosophy of BAT, I need to fight for something I've worked hard for and earned. At this point I am in a major deficit in terms of money and time spent proportionately to the reward that I didn't get at all.

And it goes against the whole ethos of this project. I want to burn this place down now, because not only has my trust been breached, I feel like a fool for supporting these retards for so long and advocating their use. I've written several medium articles about them among many other things, but I was wrong,

&gt;**The first warning signal is that the ERC20 token on the decentralized blockchain platform IS NOT IN YOUR WALLET. IT'S IN THEIRS. It's exactly, like running a centralized database which only one entity (brave) controls. That's enough, isn't it?**

The company of developers with no business education and experience should not run a business in the first place. You can't run a business without paying out your users, whatever it is you think you're doing, it's not right and because it's no way to run a business, there will be no future for you either.

So the next step will have to be to delete my brave browser and start a campaign to spread awareness on how this business is run, because it's important. We all think we're in some decentralized project, but it's all a single point of control with the funds they raised in a guise of their white paper, decentralization and ICO. If anyone asks what they've done is illegal today and they hold no responsibility, lucky, but they're officially scammers.",1591004247,6,1

gyg4p1,ting_jun48,"PSA, to get the full benefits of a hardware wallet, connect it to ur own full node. Only then is ur financial sovereignty complete.","""When you use the hardware wallet it is connecting to the ledger/trezor servers and telling you what you have in those addresses. You can‚Äôt actually verify what they are telling you is the truth. If you run your own node and connect that node to your wallets, you can verify the truth.""

But that is not the only reason. The fact that only economic full nodes can help enforce concensus is perhaps just as important: 

""Running a full node is kind of like voting where the weight of your vote is the amount of money you transact through that full node (sort of).""

In other words, when ur full node is not connected to ur actual BTC stash, u are giving up ur leverage to enforce consensus on the bitcoin network. Many don't realize that running a full node with an empty wallet does nothing for the network. It is completely redundant. 

That happens a lot these days because bitcoin core's compatibility with hardware wallets is minimal. U need to run code to connect it, and even then it is cluncky, there isn't even a GUI. It also happens because folks don't know about the importance of economic nodes.

Here it is from the wiki:

&gt;As explained previously, full nodes enforce the consensus rules no  matter what. However, lightweight nodes do not do this. Lightweight  nodes do whatever the majority of mining power says. Therefore, if most  of the miners got together to increase their block reward, for example,  lightweight nodes would blindly go along with it. If this ever happened,  the network would split such that lightweight nodes and full nodes  would end up on separate networks, using separate currencies. People  using lightweight nodes would be unable to transact with people using  full nodes. If all businesses and many users are using full nodes, then  this network split is not a critical problem because users of  lightweight clients will quickly notice that they can't send or receive  bitcoins to/from most of the people who they usually do business with,  and so they'll stop using Bitcoin until the evil miners are overcome,  which is the appropriate response. However, if almost everyone on  the network is using lightweight nodes in this situation, then everyone  would continue being able to transact with each other, and so Bitcoin  could very well end up ""hijacked"" by evil miners.

I recently managed to land my first job as a bookkeeper for a company, and part of that job involves remitting money to other accounts and clients. However, I was just made aware that my boss wants to deal in bitcoin and have a few questions seeing as I have zero experience in the bitcoin realm. 

So he wants me to use cash/bank transfer to buy bitcoin's locally (im based in Amsterdam) and transfer them to the company's crypto account. from there I can remit the bitcoin's as needed to our shipping company. It seems pretty easy at first but I'm quite out of my depth and would appreciate some guidance on the process and where I should begin. Any advice would be amazing. Thanks y'all.",1591545118,23,1

Moscow citizens will be able to vote on Vladimir Putin‚Äôs Constitutional amendments via a blockchain-powered system.

Russia‚Äôs upcoming e-voting on the Constitutional amendments will be implemented using blockchain technology.

Moscow citizens will be able to cast their votes on Vladimir Putin‚Äôs Constitutional amendments online via blockchain-powered e-voting. As announced on the Moscow government‚Äôs official website, Moscow voters can sign up for the upcoming e-voting starting from June 5.

Blockchain makes voting ‚Äúalmost impossible to hack‚Äù

Scheduled to take place from June 25 to June 30, the e-voting will be implementing blockchain technology to ‚Äúensure security and transparency.‚Äù As officially announced, blockchain will help to anonymize and encrypt each vote to provide safety and immutability of data.

As a blockchain network ‚Äúdoes not have a single server,‚Äù the chain is ‚Äúalmost impossible to hack,‚Äù the official announcement says.

The statement reads:

‚ÄúThe safety and transparency of electronic voting will be ensured by blockchain technology. Such a network does not have a single server: in order to change the information regarding bulletins, it is necessary to obtain the approval of most network participants, so the chain is almost impossible to hack. The vote itself is anonymized and encrypted.‚Äù
In the announcement, the Moscow government did not specify what kind of blockchain technology exactly is going to be deployed during the vote. The authority also did not mention any company assisting in implementing the technology for the voting process. Cointelegraph reached out to the e-voting customer support to find out more details on the matter. This article will be updated should they respond.

The vote could extend Putin‚Äôs term by other 12 years

During the vote, Russian citizens will choose whether they support the Constitutional amendments.

First introduced on Jan. 15, 2020, the Constitutional amendments proposal aims to allow Putin to serve two more six-year terms ‚Äî until 2036. If Russian people vote against the amendments, Putin will finally have to leave his Presidential post in 2024. Putin has been serving in office either as President or prime minister since 1999.

During his long-running rule, Putin has failed to introduce legislation for the cryptocurrency industry in Russia despite issuing multiple deadlines to adopt one. The Russian President may rule the fate of one of the biggest cryptocurrency and blockchain markets worldwide. As reported by Cointelegraph, Russia has been leading the world in 2020 by its share in global Bitcoin (BTC) trading on peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitcoins.

In late 2019, Changpeng Zhao, CEO of the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, Binance, called Russian President Putin ‚Äúthe most influential person in the blockchain space.‚Äù",1591379380,1,2

Supongo que las fuentes que aqu√≠ comparto est√°n erradas o muy incompletas.  


**Resumen de lo que dicen:**

Los 3 links afirman, sin explicar, que ser√≠a posible revertir una transacci√≥n de BTC no confirmada -0-, usando el protocolo RBF.

Con esta funci√≥n, incorporada en algunas wallets -Electrum, Green de Blockstream, etc.-, ser√≠a posible crear una nueva transacci√≥n con el monto exacto transferido originalmente y enviarla a la misma direcci√≥n con una tarifa m√°s alta. Esto podr√≠a incentivar a los mineros a procesarla, invalidando la transacci√≥n original.  


https://preview.redd.it/voam87bca4351.png?width=976&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eacd3e72504d641eba9662536e73c83b0b1d56a3

&amp;#x200B;

Una vez una transacci√≥n es confirmada 3 o m√°s veces, ya se agrega a un bloque de la cadena en modo irreversible. En otras palabras, una transacci√≥n confirmada no puede cancelarse, revertirse, etc. Bien.

Pregunta:

&amp;#x200B;

Pero si a√∫n no tiene ninguna confirmaci√≥n, ¬øse podr√≠a usar este protocolo?.  


**¬øSirve usar esta opci√≥n para tratar de revertir una transacci√≥n a√∫n no confirmada enviada a una direcci√≥n v√°lida pero err√≥nea?**  


Tambi√©n asocian este protocolo con el problema del doble gasto.  


Supongo quienes los escribieron han mezclado muchas cosas y dejado fuera tantas otras.

I've always been fond of the land of the free. My idea was to buy a property somewhere quiet, isolated, and nature-packed like the Snake River. From there it's all chill and nature.

My plan was the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program which, until mid-2019, stated that a one-million property should satisfy your application for a green card. Check out what I found out when I decided to look back at their conditions: 

""The standard minimum investment amount has increased to $1.8 million (from $1 million) to account for inflation""

That's almost a double right there! 

Break out of the current economy everyone. This is something very optional I'm going after. Imagine the same for your essential daily expenses over the long run. It's either Bitcoin as a currency, or will get back to trading meat as a currency. Papers just don't work

Keven from Grevio writing. I just wanted to give you guys an update on harnessing bitcoin mining heat for agricultural purposes. Well. for starters the business of breeding cricket in an industrial ways has been tremendously difficult to start. It took months/years of R&amp;D to finally reach breakthrough. Fortunately, with thousands of hard works, grants for the federal government we have recently achieve a¬†somewhat profitable method of farming.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, speaking about recuperating the heat. The set-up we uses to operate the ASIC miners is fairly simple. Each machine has an automated control that regulates it... similar to a thermostat. Then it's just plugging the system with power/internet and voila. If some people are interested about this particular thing, I could make a video describing each components and installation instructions.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

As for Grevio, we will be launching our cricket powder in the next few months. As of right now, we only sell the fertilizer (cricket poop waster).

When it showed up in Ledger Live, I noticed there was a huge number of addresses recieving money from it (it seems like 10 BTC was sent, split between a lot of recipients, one of them being me). The transaction details are here:

https://blockstream.info/tx/39c3a663e5c0b7aa02abaeaa0815bd452497f2d4835f7b513e0f7e88f84b6c80

I noticed on that page, the fee was listed as 0.001227 BTC which is a lot higher than I paid, but ofc I was only a fraction of the transaction.

So that left me curious - how did Coinbase come up with the fee they charged me? It seems like I paid a much greater portion of the fee than the fraction of the BTC I got, but I didn't pay anywhere near the full fee.

And is it likely this transaction included other customers funds (eg. that were withdrawing at the same time as me), or are all of those other addresses Coinbase return addresses (in which case, why is it split across so many, and not just me + them)?",1591356385,7,1

1. Miners' Bitcoin-denominated revenue was cut in half because of the Halving, making some miners unprofitable. These inefficient miners are selling reserves to pay for their electricity and operational expenses, holding out and betting on price to increase instead of cashing out and shutting down. 
2. Miners are selling their reserves because they're confident that there are enough buyers to support the price. Miners have been dumping reserves but the price has held up. 

Either way, miners seem to be bullish. For a more in-depth explanation, check out this quick [**article**](https://ryze.substack.com/p/ryze-recap-64-miners-selling-reserves) I wrote covering this.",1591283068,38,4

# Unprofessional just low life thieves using alias 

If you have ever registered on an exchange that has been compromised in the past, you will most likely at one point get a call from someone wanting to be your personal bitcoin investment broker who will promise you up to 150% returns on a monthly basis. I played dumb to get an idea of the information that they have and it appears that they will have your first and last name along with your email address and phone number.

Their website seems almost legit, they will even send you an email from their domain ([tradenix.io](http://tradenix.io/)) which btw is hosted with google suite services. They claim to be located in NYC however will call you from a local number.

Doing a quick search on google won‚Äôt bring you much, it will actually bring you to a website that has a lot of fake reviews that are all dated a few days apart. They claim to have been in the business since 2010 yet their website is only 132 days old.

Long story short. Be safe out there guys/girls. If it looks too good to be true and smells fishy.. It‚Äôs most definitely a scam. If someone can make you 150% per month, why would they want to only be taking 5% of it when they could just do it for themselves?

Given there isn‚Äôt many warnings out there, hopefully we can upvote this post and get it move visible on the search engines!",1591278211,1,1

I'm aware that I'm not a genius so let's get to the main point. I understand that this is the base value of BTC and why you should keep your money safe, hedge against inflation etc.. But can you please explain exactly, what will happen to the price, when USD hits hyper-inflation levels? The dollar is cheaper and its value is low, BTC numeral price rise with it? If this wouldn't affect other currencies, then for example BTC/EUR the price still would stay the same, right? As long as EUR is stable (yeah, I know it's totally not the case).   
So if I'm using inflated USD that doesn't mean that I can buy more BTC because I have more USD on me.   


My problem is that there's no base currency that we can compare them to. It would be great that we could compare it with gold, but that stuff is valued also with these inflated currencies. Although I found this site that shows price of Gold with BTC.   
 [https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-price-in-gold/](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-price-in-gold/)

h8dhca,Seandude_,Any feedback on this situation is helpfull,"Hey everyone, 

First off to start, this is not my situation rather its a situation my buddy brought to me that I am looking to help out to find the legitimacy of everything involved.


Disclaimer: I believe my buddys dad is just the victim of a scam, but before I tell him I just wanted to double check with you guys in case I'm missing something... ive been out of the space for a while now and I mostly trade ERC-20 tokens. Now because he doesn't know what he is talking about i am slowly uncovering all of the pieces involved and getting an understanding of what happened so I will update as more comes up.


**Situation** : Buddy's dad has been listening and subscribing to investor advice from Raging Bull and sites like that. He knows 0 about crypto/how it works but has found himself involved in with a few websites that look sketchy at best.

The first is ""crypto247trade"" now you don't need me to tell you that this sites name implies that it is not legitimate however he has paid these people 1k to ""invest"" for him which came along with $500 fees and 0 support. I logged onto his account and found that his ""balance"" shows 1k invested but 10k available with 1.06 btc available for transfer. In order to act fast I figured I'd try to transfer out the ""available"" btc on his account. I created a quick Electrum wallet and tried to put in a minimum test transfer to be safe... the transfer goes into a pending queue which has still yet to be processed (7 hrs later). It looks like this website says they will trade for people but just takes their money and gives them the run around.  When I spoke with their ""help desk"" they gave me virtually 0 information on why the transactions haven't gone through and the person didn't even understand what I was talking about when I said I was trying to transfer btc out to a wallet (Again I had a physical sigh when he sent me this website saying he put money on it) 

Next is CEX.IO which looks to be an exchange, i havent used it so don't know its legitimacy. But basically he went to set up an account they have him pay a 1 time activation fee of 1k... first MAJOR red flag and then 500 in taxes... after he paid he lost access to his account, i am trying to get him to reset the password so I can log in and see what the hell is going on there but I have no idea to this point.



My summary is that his ""investor advisors"" are imposters that have conned him into using these cheesy websites on the plain fact that he doesn't understand the space and doesn't know any better/ how to protect himself.


I plan on giving a crash course for him so he can understand where he went wrong but as of right now could anyone let me know if they have heard of these 2 websites and if my assumptions are correct?",1592075026,10,3

It's my first time buying Bitcoin or using the Bitcoin Wallet. I have tried to purchase BCH and BTC on the Bitcoin Wallet app, for android.

It asked for Identification to verify the transaction, so I included a picture of my passport, and a selfie (as requested). Within a few minutes, I had a notification advising that the transaction had failed as not all corners of the passport were visible. Fair enough. I have tried to resubmit a clear picture of my passport on the app and through the chrome browser, but each time I get an error message from MoonPay.

The error message reads ""An unexpected error occurred, please try again later."" The money has been taken from my account, but I can't access it on Bitcoin. It has been roughly 20 hours since this happened and I'm not sure how I can verify my identification if MoonPay doesn't let me submit a clear photograph of my documents.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks.

(by practical implications i mean withdrawal limits, gap risk etc) 

I hope this is clear but if not i‚Äôd love to have a conversation in the comments. i will add some context by saying i‚Äôm based in the U.S. 

i guess my broader question here though is the only safe way to own bit coin is to purchase it on an exchange and then store it in a secure wallet that you physically own? and if so, how does one transfer coins in and out of such wallets?

If you don't know this method, then I have some other alternative too. I have a Payoneer MasterCard and a Payoneer US/ Euro Bank Account. I will be able to withdraw my Bitcoins if I can exchange it for Payoneer USD or Euro. So,

**Question 2:** Can you tell me how can I withdraw my bitcoins to the US or Euro bank Account? You can say, it's an ACH or SEPA Transfer...

**Note:**

* I can't verify my identity because no one accepts my country.
* It is not a one-time process. I will use the preferred website every time I need to withdraw.
* Fees should be very low. I don't have that much money to afford high fees.
* No matter it takes how long.
* No matter it takes how many 3rd parties, but they must be trustworthy and fees should be less.",1592014615,14,0

gz3lxr,CoinjoyAssistant,An Insight Into Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP),"*While Bitcoin is the most famous and valuable cryptocurrency, its blockchain faces some challenges. In order to ensure the constant dominance of the currency in the market, the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) was introduced. While most BIPs have different levels of potential for positive impact on Bitcoin blockchain, some of them turned out to be much more successful than others.*

## What is BIP?

Bitcoin is considered the first cryptocurrency and still remains the most successful crypto-project, but it also has its drawbacks. And in order to surpass it, as well as to occupy its niche in the digital world, innovators have created many new currencies, each of which has its own blockchain, designed to provide functions that are not available in Bitcoin. Eventually, one of these new currencies could potentially knock Bitcoin out of the first place.

That‚Äôs why the work on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal began. BIP is a document where developers can submit a recommendation to fix a network problem. For example, after the introduction and implementation of BIP 141, also known as Segregated Witness ([SegWit](https://www.bitdegree.org/tutorials/what-is-segwit/)), the transaction rate on the Bitcoin network has increased, and commission fees have significantly decreased.

There are [three](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Improvement_Proposals) varieties of BIP:

* Standards Track ‚Äî these are the changes in the network protocol, checking [blocks](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-block-in-blockchain-Where-to-store-the-blocks) or transactions, as well as anything that can affect compatibility;
* Informational ‚Äî design issues, general suggestions;
* Process ‚Äî ideas that relate to processing outside the network.

## Bitcoin Lightning Network

The Lightning Network is a BIP proposal [introduced](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf) in 2015 by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja. It aims to make Bitcoin scalable with the help of instant payments that are performed outside the network. These external channels form real Bitcoin transactions with the use of standard scripts that allow transferring funds without risk.

The Lightning network came into force thanks to the introduction of wallets with many signatures, where the parties can conduct an infinite number of transactions without having to store all the details on the blockchain. The only information recorded on the blockchain is the number of Bitcoins contained in the wallet and the percentage of contributions of the parties involved.

In addition to enabling instant transactions, the update also provides other benefits for the Bitcoin chain. For example, registration for micropayments, as well as cross-chain payments. Moreover, the update also promotes the implementation of the functionality of smart contracts on top of the blockchain.

## MAST technology

MAST stands for Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree, a technology that uses the ideas of the [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) and the abstract syntax tree. This is a cryptographic tool that allows you to add large volumes of the hash to the data associated with transactions in the Bitcoin chain, due to their layout.

Three BIPs aim to introduce MAST into the Bitcoin network. The first is BIP 114, created by Johnson Lau, the developer of the Bitcoin core. The proposal shows how to increase network efficiency by introducing a new scenario, which he calls a merkelized scenario. The scenario reduces the need for large amounts of transaction data while maintaining greater privacy.¬†

BIP 116 and BIP 117 were proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Mark Friedenbach and are intended to support MAST in a joint implementation. In BIP 116, he outlines the operation code, which allowed validation of the data without revealing the entire set. BIP 117 is called the Tail Call semantics, and in combination with the first, it led to a generalized form of MAST. The difference between the offers of Friedenbach and Lau is that the first supports all the scenarios that are currently used on the Bitcoin network, and the second supports only native SegWit.¬†

The introduction of MAST has led to increased privacy, increased transaction speed, and the ability to include complex data sets, such as smart contracts. Besides, MAST allowed the Bitcoin network to process a much larger volume of transactions and, thereby, increased its scalability.

## How many BIPs are there?

Since absolutely any developer can submit the idea of improving the network to the community, more than 300 of these [ideas](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/README.mediawiki) have already been accumulated, and not all of them have been and will be implemented in Bitcoin.

gz3gc4,ZeroRobot,Lightning implementation,"I posted two posts before about fees and the overall sentiment seemed to be that Lightning is the remedy. Previous posts:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/gnv37d/bitcoin\_fees/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/gnv37d/bitcoin_fees/)  and  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/gtebjy/lightning\_question/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/gtebjy/lightning_question/)

I got a lot of good information and links from you guys so I wanted to follow up with our experience.

We implemented Strike as the provider ( [https://strike.acinq.co/](https://strike.acinq.co/) ) which was one of the recommend ones. Once implemented we have tested deposits using Wallet of Satoshi (iOS) and Phoenix Wallet (Android).

Strike API had good documentation and was really simple to implement. Their dashboard tools are basic but does the job. Integration took about 4-5 hours in total which is pretty decent. We had no issues, everything worked as advertised.

Using WoS or Phoenix Wallet was super simple as well. Install, create new wallet, put some funds in it and your ready. We had some casual Bitcoin users try it out and they had no problems getting started.

The performance really blew our minds. Instant deposits with virtually zero fees. Which we knew, but how simple it was and actually seeing the funds arrive almost instantly was just awesome to see.

Withdrawals are still not using Lightning but will use regular transactions for now so we have not solved that part. But allowing for easy payments in is a good first step.

This is truly looking like the next step for Bitcoin as a proper payment solution.

Thank you everyone that helped us out with this!",1591636517,29,48

I am fully aware of the complete infeasibility of an adversary to have a brute force strategy to search the key space for existing private keys. The odds of hitting a collision are infinitesimal.
Yet they are not zero, especially with several hot wallets just using 12-word mnemonics. So assuming we have large adoption of crypto in 25 years and thousands of dedicated machines run 24/7 just probing random mnemonics they might eventually out of infinitesimal luck hit upon one single existing key. What if this is your wallet holding all your crypto savings? Is this just a risk you need to take when using crypto?

h8zrgt,tookthisusersoucant,What is money?,"Hey all, this might be a bit outside of the ""Bitcoin"" realm, but I wanted to create a sounding board to help me grasp what money is, how it relates to economies, and where Bitcoin can come in. I'm just writing out my thoughts, and I'm open to comments and opinions or corrections :). Hopefully this can be helpful to others too.

Note, that I live in the UK and I feel like a lot of information talks about the dollar, and I never know if it applies the same to my currency. I will give examples in dollars, but they should apply to any world currency (eg. GBP) to the best of my understanding.

I saw a link recently on this subreddit to this site: [https://modernmoneybasics.com/](https://modernmoneybasics.com/). If I were to summarise what I learnt, it is a mental model that frames fiat currency in an interesting way, but I wouldn't be surprised if it did contain some misinformation. -- It claims that the model applies to any fiat currency.

OK. Pretend that all of a countries money = 1. If you own $100, you own a fraction of the countries money, so if there is $10,000 in the world you own 0.001 of all dollars. So naturally, if more money is printed, you start to own a smaller fraction of that money.

The Modern Money Theory (MMT) gives me the impression that money is basically a tool owned by the countries government (owned by someone who isn't the general public). Money is not an asset, it is a liability (hence why it loses value over time). People pay taxes and the Government will try to redistribute the wealth by investing in projects like The Army, Green Energy, etc.

This is supposed to be distributed in ways that help the country's economy, ensuring that the country is productive and is exporting things to other countries. When deemed necessary, more money can be printed to help redistribute wealth to the areas that the Government wants to invest in. I think that the more successful your economy, the more your money is worth.

This means one thing to me; PEOPLE DO NOT OWN/HAVE MONEY. Don't save fiat; it is a tool to help the economy, not a thing of value that you should store. I feel like saving actually keeps money from circulating in the economy and probably works towards needing to print money. Instead, buy assets; you put money back into the economy, and you get to hold onto your wealth. What can you invest in? Ok, that's not such an easy question to answer. Maybe buy gold (or \*ahem\* Bitcoin), or invest in yourself to make something valuable and ultimately start your own business.

MMT says that fiat has value because people pay taxes in fiat. Ultimately, we work, and earn in order to pay taxes (income, VAT, road tax, etc.). We spend in fiat, because the person accepting fiat will need to pay taxes and the next person will do the same, so now the whole country values your fiat currency.

Because of this, you need liquidity, you need to have some money to spend on groceries and living, and you need some money for a rainy day lest you end up in an emergency situation with not enough time to handle it with money. -- I think the more something costs, the more time you typically will have to pay it, so there might even be a formula you could create or use that helps you decide what to keep as cash, and what to spend.

So long story short, money is a token that represents a tiny fraction of your countries economy. It is also something that the government can manipulate and move around as it pleases in the same way a business invests in departments for its company. We are all just a cog in the machine that is our country's economy.

One thing I have not talked about, is the role of banks and credit and interest. I haven't expanded my thoughts in that area yet, but I feel like that they serve a different purpose.

Where does Bitcoin fit in? Well, just like gold, it is a potential asset. It has an interesting property though; it has liquidity. This give it the potential to be used for local trades, meaning that people can save their wealth and use it for local transactions too. It is global, so it also has the ability to be used for global transactions too. For now, it is an asset for saving your wealth; I think that as more people use it and favour it as a storage mechanism, more people will start to accept it for small trades too. Hey, maybe if there's a tool to easily calculate taxes from Bitcoin trades, that could help with adoption.

What would happen to fiat currency if everyone collected fiat for the sake of paying taxes, but used conversion tools to allow them to keep the majority of their wealth in Bitcoin while knowing the appropriate taxes to pay? Honestly, I fall short here, because at that point, you can no longer measure a country's economy by its currency. This is where I need to maybe learn how countries that do not have their own currency measure their economy.

I suppose governments, or ourselves, will have to invent new ways to measure and manage our economies, and I imagine i will be a much more transparent. I think it is an important question to answer as Bitcoin would shift wealth from being country wealth, to individual wealth (for everyone, not just those with enough income and education to invest in assets).",1592162045,14,3

h8tj1z,hectorhan,What is an ICO?,"ICO stands for Initial Coin Offering, Which is a important concept for any Bitcoin futures traders. It‚Äôs much like an IPO (Initial Public Offering), this is an opportunity to invest in a new company in the hopes of generating some future profit. However, unlike an IPO, you are not actually receiving any shares of a company when you participate in an ICO.

## Pros and Cons

To better understand the concept of an ICO, let‚Äôs consider the following example. You are a new entrepreneur that comes up with an improvement that no other cryptocurrency currently has. You want to implement your idea, but require the funds to do so. Rather than looking for venture capitalists or borrowing funds from a bank, you can ask enthusiastic people such as [Bitcoin futures](https://phemex.com/register?referralCode=BJWYL) traders or other crypto fans to give you money. In exchange, you give them some tokens or coins of your new cryptocurrency. If the project becomes popular, you still own 100% of it, but the people that received those coins will also benefit from the rising value.

The best aspect of this approach is that it is easy to start, anyone can participate, and there are hardly any restrictive regulations. However, this last point is also perhaps the biggest drawback. The history of ICOs is unfortunately plagued by multiple scams. Once a company receives your money, there is no guarantee that they will actually follow through with their promises. In fact, they may simply disappear the very next day. This is why it is very important to dedicate the right amount of research and due diligence before participating in such projects.

## Process

Absolutely anyone in the world can launch an ICO. Generally, the only requirements are creating a whitepaper describing your idea or project and developing a website to showcase the content. The next step is to simply convince potential investors. Because of all the fraud that has occurred in the past, new projects often attempt to get popular influencers and independent reviewers to speak positively about the project. In addition, programmers and representatives are constantly available on social sites to answer any doubts or questions. Finally, you must determine and execute a pricing and distribution plan and you‚Äôre ready to go. Once again, the major point to understand is that just as all other cryptos, ICOs are high risk high reward projects that must be approached with caution.",1592140086,1,1

Now more than ever Bitcoin is sold almost everywhere and through pretty easy tools and processes. 

At some point I would doubt that a Bitcoin ETF would bring something new to the market beyond being just yet another way among 100s to buy Bitcoin from a trustful seller, conditional that the ETF manager and its bank are trustful.

h78bvk,freistil90,[Change my view] Bitcoin is not succeeding because you don't want it to (in some form). 10.000$ per coin is a problem.,"I have been somewhat critical in CCs but see their potential. I see the appeal of not having a central bank, I however also see the problem if there is no central bank (e.g. enacting monetary policy will be much much harder). 

For me the largest problem is that ""Bitcoin getting up in value"" and exploding to 10,15,20k ‚Ç¨ in value is seen as a good thing. I think that's a problem. You're basically basing the whole intrinsic value of Bitcoin on its exchange rate against fiat currencies. Sure, FX is important economically later but shouldn't the focus be on using it as actual money? I feel like a lot of hype and focus is based on the value of Bitcoin translated as ""how much US$ do I get when I give my Bitcoin away again"". If you don't (or can't) use it to trade goods, it basically is just some overhyped speculation instrument and all that bull around decentralized, etc doesn't matter, you could just as well trade some stock. It seems like the absolute majority of people try to  ultimately get more fiat money through CC trading, I still haven't seen much of a primary use as a currency so far. 

But maybe I'm no seeing something. So enlighten me - why is the by far primary focus revolving around the exchange rate rather than the use as an actual means of payment, why is it seen as a good thing when Bitcoin explodes in value measured by fiat exchange rate (that just seems to make it more difficult to use it as a means to pay for goods...?) and why is the effort not focussing on enabling and creating an economy around the currency rather than ""trying to get rich quick"" efforts?",1591915183,50,0
h7874g,WorkingLime,"997,741,394,988 Bs. (bolivares) were traded in LocalBitcoin Venezuela last week (ATH in Bs.), that amount is 537 BTC. In both ways (Bs. to BTC and BTC to Bs.). One BTC is 1,940,000,000 Bs. Monthly minimum wage is 5 USD."," Hi guys,

Remember Venezuelan ""living"" here.

As I always say, it is steady 2000 BTC monthly (only measured using LocalBitcoin, there are other exchanges like AIRTM, Uphold, Binance and so on)

Finally,  goverment increased the price of the gasoline. Now one litre is 50 USD  cents (one gallon is 1.9 USD).  Old price was: 1 litre of gasoline =  0.0000000003 USD.

As the wages are that low, you have a subsidized amout of 120 litres monthly (120 litres for 3 USD). 

People always ask what the the average salary, not the minimum. Well I would say around 20-50 USD monthly. One doctor is around 30 USD. Teacher around 20 USD.  Junior engineer maybe 50 USD (The  engineers collegue ""suggests"" around 200 USD monthly, but it is hard to find a place with these wages)

Any question let me know, AMA. But check my links and sources first.

h77m1j,El-Duderino402,Bitcoin/Stock Market correlation for beginner HODLer,"Hi, I‚Äôm no economics expert by a long shot. I first purchased Bitcoins as a means of buying / transacting drugs tbh. I‚Äôm no longer doing that, I have a small amount of leftover BTC worth only about $100. I‚Äôm trying to decide if I should sell it off or invest more.

One of the things that has been hard for me to understand in my research is the correlation between the stock market and Bitcoin prices 

Common sense leads me to believe that inflation has a negative correlation with the stock market. High inflation would mean stocks are overvalued, and therefore sold. Am I right in that assumption?

That‚Äôs why it confuses me when people say that the upside of Bitcoin is that it‚Äôs a natural resupply, that you can‚Äôt just print money as with ‚Äúfiat‚Äù currencies. Most people I‚Äôve read say that inflation of the US dollar and other such currencies  is a good thing for Bitcoin.

My question is, why is there a positive correlation between Bitcoin prices and the S&amp;P or Dow Jones or whatever? Based on the logic I‚Äôve listed above, shouldn‚Äôt stock market dives increase the value of Bitcoin ?",1591912940,7,1

Step 2. Distribute 1 Vote Coin to all citizens of a nation through the same infrastructure used to issue tax returns, social security/insurance numbers etc. Only you can know the address your vote coin was sent to.

Step 3. Each candidate/party is given an address to send the vote coin to.\*

Step 4. Once your vote is cast, you can check it against the ledger of votes. No one would know your address, but you can always ensure that your vote was counted correctly.

I feel like this is a pretty solid strategy. Vote by mail fraud is already extremely uncommon, and this would take that idea and just make it even more accessible, since all you'd need is the app/wallet and the ability to identify yourself once to set up an account.

I know I'm not the first person to think of this, I remember seeing ideas like this thrown around a lot back when BTC was still nascent, but I think we sometimes forget about the power of the ledger.

&amp;#x200B;

\* *If there are more than two parties, like in Canada where I'm from, voters can divide their vote coin by any fraction and give as much or as little to whichever parties they choose. This allows someone to vote entirely for one party, or split their vote and support more than one candidate. This could then facilitate things like instant runoffs if done correctly.*  


EDIT: Basically every response in this thread has said this is a bad idea, yet I remain unconvinced.   


I think some form of ledger-based voting system will eventually exist, because an open system that is verifiable seems like the path to true democracy, but there are definitely roadblocks. ",1591905023,25,5

h144wb,acajic,Bitcoin vs Central Banking - reality check,"It's a common meme that bitcoin is a way of defying authority. Ideas about how it will, in time, replace USD and many other worldwide currencies. How now the world governments have too much power over our lives with the control of the currency and Bitcoin is supposed to change that.

  
I would like to get some opinions on how you see all these happy scenarios unfolding. Specifically, how do you see it becoming possible to buy a house using bitcoin in any forseeable future. The authorities will want to know the origin of money. And for good reason.  


There would have to be some kind of white listed BTC wallets whose owners are known to the government and these wallets should only have transactions to other white listed wallets. And for these transactions, tax should be paid.

The next question might be how does a BTC wallet become white-listed. Again, I suppose, you'd have to pay percentage of the contents of the wallet to the govt.

That's the most optimistic scenario I can think of and it still leaves us in a situation where the govt controls which wallets are allowed to remain white-listed and which aren't and for how long.   
What we do keep with BTC is a constant supply of tokens. But that doesn't mean much if you look at money-printing as a form of taxation. This tax will just get replaced by some other tax on those white-listed BTC wallets.

Come to think of it, there is no avoiding the role of government as it currently is.

h116v8,Sweet-Zookeepergame,A few bitcoin-questions which keep me busy,"Hi all,

I have a few basic questions about bitcoin.

Like most of you here, I‚Äòm following the crypto-topic for a few years now. I never bought or owned any crypto, because it just too expensive (Bitcoin in particular). Recently I decided to invest some of my savings in 0.5 BTC (bought it for around 4150‚Ç¨). I got excited and started reading and researching even more about bitcoin. One of the basic ideas, which is clearly very popular, is the idea of decentralization. Another one is the cashless digital currency of the world etc. Eventually providing financial possibilities for people without any access to banks.

In my short experience from buying to storing the ‚Äûcoin‚Äú a few thoughts and questions emerged, which I‚Äòd like to share with you and hear your opinion on them.

1.The first thing, which was the most obvious: you still need a bank account, in order to buy any amount of bitcoin. All of the exchanges require you to connect a bank account, in order to buy crypto. Or you can of course exchange crypto for crypto, but then you need to buy the crypto in first place anyway.

How is this going to solve the problem of decentralizing? You still need a bank, which provides the original buyer with a bank account, right?

In other words, how should one imagine a world with bitcoins only? If they are limited only to 21 million, the rich-poor inequality could become even bigger and worse than now, because (theoretically) only one single person could own all of it.

2.Storing bitcoin.I have to admit, storing bitcoin is relatively easy, but one wrong move could make all your crypto disappear.

After I bought the 0.5 BTC, I wanted to store it securely. I read too many stories of people‚Äôs wallets being hacked and loosing all their crypto etc. So I decided to buy hardware wallet (Trezor One). The experience was not good. First, I pay transaction fees to move the asset from MY OWN software wallet to MY OWN hardware wallet. This is basically paying transaction fees to move your money from A to B, whereas A and B are in the same room. That worked OK, but then I decided to have some ETH as well. Transferred the ETH to Trezor and boom, my ETH was not visible. The amount of ‚Ç¨ was correct (Bitcoin + Eth), but only the Bitcoin was visible. Nevertheless I managed go see my ETH through Exodus wallet and transferred it back to my software-wallet, because I felt nervous not seeing it in the Trezor Wallet itself. More transaction fees.

Then I tried backing-up the hardware wallet. Everytime the application said ‚ÄûApplication error: Interruption‚Äú or something like that. I had to google to find out that probably the usb-cable was shitty. I bought Ledger Nano X and it‚Äòs much better.

Long story short.

My thoughts on this: storing crypto securely is relatively simple, but I don‚Äôt see how this could be adopted by the whole world. Although my parents are good with IT stuff in general, I don‚Äôt know if securing bitcoins will be their thing. One wrong move and your coins could be gone. Additionally, a crypto wallet costs money and you can never be sure if the software-company behind it will exist forever to support wallet updates etc.

So, I have to admit: adoption of money is not that different. Having cash in your pocket is risky, because you can get robbed. Your bank account could be hacked. For people who get paid in checks - you have to take the check, go to the bank, stay in line and wait for your money. Takes time.

But there are laws, which protect you from losing money. In most european countries, you are insured for up to 100k EUR per bank account. So if your money gets stolen, the bank is obliged to give it back to you. And for stolen money in cash, there is police etc.

And yes, one more thing about the transaction fees: there are no transaction fees when I pay my rent for example.

3.Volatility:

today bitcoin is around 8600‚Ç¨, tomorrow it could be 400‚Ç¨, the day after tomorrow 20000k. If it is supposed to be a currency, it should be more stable, right? How can you be sure that you have the same amount of ‚Äûmoney‚Äú tomorrow?

4.Buying ‚Äûbigger‚Äú things.

Imagine buying a house. It costs 100 BTC. You meet the seller and then what? You transfer him 100 BTC, then wait for like 3 days until the full transaction is being processed and then? He receives the bitcoins and handles you the keys to the house. Is it yours? How can you prove that it‚Äòs yours?

In this type of bigger deals, I don‚Äòt mind when there is a third party like a lawyer or a bank, which approves the contract.

What are your thoughts on this?

5.I see quite often that bitcoin is being compared to gold.

And I agree, you can‚Äòt do many things with gold either. You can‚Äòt really ‚Äûpay‚Äú in gold in the supermarket or buy a house. Storing gold is even more difficult. Neither gold nor bitcoin solve any real problem, except that you could eventually make jewelry and nice churches from gold, which is - from point of view - not important.

And still here comes my general question at the end of this post:

What kind of problem does bitcoin solve? Why is there so much hype around it? Am I overseeing something? Maybe it‚Äòs not about being a currency, but something else/something more?

I want to understand why or if it‚Äòs worth holding my 0.5 BTC or rather sell it now, when the price is a bit higher and invest the revenue somewhere else.

Thanks for the comments and the discussion!

I just wanted to update folks on the latest feature released on [Microlancer.io](https://Microlancer.io) the ‚ö° Lightning Network-based freelancing gig platform. After much of my hard work, sweat and tears, the ""Services"" section of the site is available now. It's still a first version, so please excuse any bugs!

You can post any (legal) service you like, and also create multiple packages to offer. We've already had some awesome services posted, like offers to do watercolor painting and help with setting up your first node!

Last week's I have been using Sphinx, this app run on top of LN and use TLV to send messages on top of LN. That does it means that every message is a payment sent from one user to another. That also means that every message need a micro payment that guarantee that nodes route your messages. But if you use the oficial servers you aren't charged because the sats never leave their nodes, of course you can connect the app to your own node. 

Being told that the app is at beta stage and the Android version lack some features, but the devs are working hard to fix everything.

Features

The app support sending and requesting payments, you can send satoshis to your contacts directly and they can request satoshis from your. Also support paid images and paid messages. You post and image and set a price, the user pay and got the image or message. 

And the latest addition have been groups, just like telegram or Whatsapp but since it built on top of LN you can create paid groups. Yes, you can set a price to join to your group and also can charge an amount per message. 100 satoshis to join my group and every message cost 1 satoshi. 

You can check the current group at tribes.sphinx.chat and scan the QR code and join that group. 

The app is a wallet too!! You can pay from it. 

That is basically sphinx, probably the most exciting thing built on top of LN in my opinion. Feel free to join, sell memes and report bugs. 

Ps: at sphinx.chat you can find the telegram group

h0bs3s,toneblind88,Optimal DCA + BTFD Strategy,"Hi there!

I know that there is probably not a wrong answer to my question, but I wanted to get some input from those of you that might be more statistically inclined than myself.

My current accumulation strategy with BTC has been dollar cost averaging and I‚Äôve been doing that consistently every week for about a year. Every Friday, I‚Äôm buying $100 worth of BTC. There have been times when it‚Äôs been ‚Äúon sale‚Äù like in March when we had that big drop where I made additional purchases outside of my recurring weekly buys.

Like anyone who is and has been accumulating bitcoin, I frequently get the itch to add to my position. I want to stick to a plan, however to keep emotions out of my trading strategy and have decided that a good solution would be to peel off some savings and keep that in a separate account to use when we see drops in the BTC price so that I can use those funds to buy the effing dip.

The Lukki exchange has so many errors that settlement doesn't work normally. The Lukki Exchange does not handle the complaints of its members normally, but only tells them to wait.

&gt;  
&gt;This is not the only way to introduce entropy from dice rolls. Any time the Coldcard is showing the seed words on-screen, you may press 4 to ""mix in"" additional dice rolls. In this case, since the entropy of the Coldcard is being used as a starting point, **it is safe to add as few or as many rolls as desired.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Please note that each roll of a D6 dice provides only 2.585 bits of additional entropy. Therefore, for 128-bit security, **which we consider the absolute minimum, you need 50 rolls**, and for 256-bits of security, 99 rolls. The Coldcard does not limit the number of rolls.

The second bold statement of using 50 rolls seems contradictory to the first bold statement. Or is the 2nd bold statement referring to if you only use dice rolls and not the mix in rolls?",1592336371,17,2

haaobl,OptimusCannabis,Moving Forward,"Hello everyone, ive been investing in bitcoin for about two weeks now, and considering the amount of time ive been involved i feel like i have some good questions regarding the fluidity of use in the future... 


1. Loans: So is there a way to loan out cryptocurrency, in a legally binding way? To me this seems like a very important function if fiat currency is to be replaced.

2. Is there any justification to using bitcoin as a store of value, and Ethereum as a transactional currency? It seems to me the speed of transactions in the future could become detrimental to bitcoin becoming a staying power in the transactional world.

3. Has a comprehensive beginner guide been made, explaining how cryptocurrencys work, along with all the different exchanges and wallets? To me, there seems to be quite a large barrier to entry regarding cryptocurrencys. While the information is out there i haven‚Äôt come across a simple beginners guide that covers all of that plus safety/investing terms.

4. I think people may actually be afraid of the fact that cryptocurrency isnt regulated by a ‚Äúgoverning‚Äù body despite that being a benefit to the people in the know. Is there any comprehensive information explaining the benefits to being disassociated to a government?  

Anyways thats all the questions that seem to be important for now, hope everyone is enjoying the dormant price, and remember to keep buying bitcoin even if its at 1$ a day :D",1592335159,6,1

ha8guv,SpaceInstructor,I'm proposing crypto for a 1 Million Inhabitants City State on Mars competition. How can I expand the argument in favor of crypto?,"I'm submitting my economic proposal for a Mars City Design Competition at r/NexusAurora. I've seen both PROs &amp; CONs arguments of using crypto on Mars. What is your take on this feedback?

**Cryptocurrencies won't work on Mars. We need a proven economic model, not fancy experiments. Lives and Mission Success are at stake here. Please help if you have idea about the economics models that can support a city state of 1 Million on Mars.** 

Before we go blindfold happy on the crypto bandwagon I really want someone from the field to break down how the crypto issues from today will be fixed on Mars: high volatility, anonymous transactions for crime lords, high power consumption. I know I'm cherry picking here and the there is a wonder new crypto from 2019 that fixes all of the above. But before we say: I hear crypto is good let's use it on Mars because some enthusiasts say so without baking this up with some real study case of crypto running a successful economy. Let's put all our bets on this system that in 10 years of existence failed to create main stream support. We will figure out how to bailout when we arrive on Mars and it's a major problem there. Sorry for the harsh words but I've watched the crypto craze for too long to not have a stab at this. Let's figure out for real. What currency and economic model will we use on Mars? 

I have joined a team designing a city for 1 million inhabitants on Mars. Nexus Aurora is focused on open sourcing space colonisation.

I Invested US$71,000 and received $1,200 back and continuous excuses from Genesis Mining customer service representatives after end of my 2 year mining contracts when payments are to be paid. The Genesis Mining Customer Service Team like 'Tom' claim technical issues is the problem and unknown is the time it would take to resolve the problem. My first contract ended December 2019. This company has no telephone numbers or emails listed only online chat via submission. Yet I continue to get emails from 'Marco Streng' to invest more.

At present I'm currently working with attorney David Hass from [www.HaasLawPLLC.com](https://www.haaslawpllc.com/) and a research firm who was able to track down their company's CEO and all members of their organization. See the preliminary report so far emailed to me below. Genesis Mining continually shifts their location and their current address is sarcastically listed at the infamous Trinity Chambers, P.O. Box 4301, Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands renown for illegal activity. See [https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/287319](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/287319).

An investigative team has also been hired and is currently in Germany but I'm still awaiting their report and Genesis Mining seems to have multiple individuals in several countries as shown below. I'm posting this to help anyone else who has been defrauded and will hired a PR company shortly to get the word out on social media and main stream news. We are also exploring the possibility of a class action lawsuit and so please forward this to others affected. Almost many international, federal, and state agencies have been already contacted but I encourage you to do the same. Here are (3) three to start.

hb25sh,knjigeit,Dundle.com by Korsit B.V. is scam," Short story:  


1. I have made an order for 2 Mastercard gift cards and paid with Bitcoin through CoinPayments.  
2. Received email ""Verification required"" in which they ask me to complete KYC.  
3. I refused to complete KYC, they told me that I'm lifetime banned from their service, but no refund.  


\--------  


They  advertise ""Instant delivery directly by email"" and all they ask you  once you add items to the shopping cart is email address. Then you chose  payment option and complete the payment.  


But after the payment  is made, email is instantly received, but with KYC request instead of a  gift cards. Send passport and... ""We may ask you for additional  documents in the verification process.""  


It was order for less then 0.015 BTC!   


For 2 cards which I intended to use for quick online purchase I have to go through torture of KYC.   


But  I don't want to send anyone my passport or any other form of ID and  selfies and proof of address and who knows what they could ask. Even if  they gave this cards for free I would not send them my IDs.   
And why  should I? I used to order from Amazon with credit cards and was never  asked for KYC verification. Now, I have paid with Bitcoin, I can't  charge back or anything like that, so they can't say that they suspect  that I will defraud them.  


So, I have asked them on live chat why do they need my documents. The answer was:""That is the verification we need""  


And  since they don't offer Bitcoin refunds, when I asked what will happen  if I refuse, will they just rip me off the answer was:""You have been  banned from our services. Please do not contact us again. This is a  lifetime ban.""  


If I searched on Google before... There are people  complaining on Trustpilot, paid with Bitcoin, received nothing or  received KYC request, so it's not just me.  


Not sure how  they banned me lifetime since they don't have anything but email  address. Then never asked me for my name. Also, what am I verifying? I  could send anyone's passport. Yes, if I was a criminal making some illegal order it would be that easy. LOL.  


I'm not complaining  because of my loss. It's for less then 150 USD and I can live with that.  I don't even need it back or that cards that I have ordered. I just  want to warn other potential customers of Dundle/Korsit about their  unethical/scammy business practices.",1592434394,4,2

haxg7s,boddankajovanovic,Questions about anonymising bitcoin,"Hey.

I have started to read about anonymising bitcoin.  Some questions that arose have not been answered so far, so maybe you guys can help me out.

1. Do two different addresses A1 and A2 of the same wallet W1 have identical attributes (regarding anonymity and privacy) as two addresses A1 of W2 and A1 of W3? Or phrased differently, is it possible to tell if two arbitrary addresses belong to the same wallet?  
I am asking this because I want to know if I can continue to use my hardwallet for anonymised coins or if I would have to wipe it completely and set it up from scratch.   

2. Let's say I would transfer some btc from my main wallet into a wasabi wallet for coinjoin.  How would I transfer the anonymised coins back to my main wallet without de-anonymising them?  Any guidance on this would be greatly appreciated.  

3. Are you anonymising your bitcoin?  What are your reasons?   

4. I read about a Coinswap method that would help with privacy.  Would it be advisably to wait for coinswap and then use that instead of doing it now with coinjoin?

Thanks for your input.  Take care!

Genuine question, just curious. And I'm sure there are different opinions so open to all. 

Right now, with things about bitcoin approaching $1,000,000 the fractions keep getting bigger where buying a latte would be like 0.000005 bitcoin 

Is there a hope for it to be used as everyday currency (maybe after it stabilizes)? If so, are there any plans for getting that number to be a little more manageable for smaller purchases? I'm only so familiar with what happened with the halving, but that would have to happen a lot of times to get that same latte to something closer to 0.05

Sent out a call to friend network for a Poker Night using: [https://www.pokernow.club/](https://www.pokernow.club/)  (everyone loved this site)

**Methods:**

Onboarding strategy 

I promised 10,000 satoshis to everyone who played. 10,000 buy in. Winner takes all.

I offered iOS links to Breez, and Blue Wallet.

Part way though discovered Breez is 0.6GB download.

Revised recommendation info had to be sent: Lower security smaller download Blue Wallet, higher security much bigger download Breez (plus still testflight on iOS)

**Outcome**: 3 chose Breez, 3 chose Blue Wallet. 1 Breez attempt failure.

**Discussion:**

Complications

1. 1 Breez failure, old phone; struggled with big download/update blockchain.

2. My texting abilities were not normal that night due to Tmobile issues.  very slow for me to load someones wallet because i couldn't respond to texts.

3. Someone said, why couldn't we just Venmo? I said I don't have Venmo :)

4. Settling at end: I told the winner to send out 6 UNIQUE invoices to each of the players to collect her winnings. She wasn't thrilled at the work involved. I could have had her group text us her QR code, and then everyone could send her their 10,000 sats.

Good News:

I let the losers keep their sats as a consolation prize and paid out the winner directly via an invoice she sent me.

**Lessons Learned:**

For onboarding: 

1. Clarify download size issue with apps in advance. Breez delays in downloading and syncing were a little uncomfortable for new users.
2. Have people just directly text me their lightning wallet QR code.  Easier for new users than invoicing.

3. Settling at the end: 

Option 1: Have winner group text out their QR code

easier, but no ability for winner to track who is paid up and who is not.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2: Have winner text 10,000 sat Invoice to each player

harder, but winner will know who paid up and who didn't",1592850630,30,14

Will this ever be improved on the core itself or we will need workarounds offering pseudo-privacy forever which are clearly not good and most users will never use them?



Bitcoin's traceablilty, lack of fungibility and it's public transparent ledger are really big problems which make it impossible to be adopted as a common currency.

I can, for example, know how wealth is the person who I'm paying. Criminals could choose who they want to rob by knowing the exact ammount this person holds and who this person is paying (possible new victims).

In addition, a bussiness could check your funds and raise the price based on your wealth.

Also Bitcoin is not fungible which means that a bitcoin that may come from a criminal source could easily end up in your wallet; say you sell a product and this criminal buys you (nothing wrong here, you recieve a payment and he recieves a product). Now imagine the police catches this criminal and follows the trace of his payments, you could end up as suspect because you recieved a payment from his address...

These problems, like the non-existent privacy, make Bitcoin a very bad option as a currency. There are few workarounds like coinjoin, but they make the system less usable.",1592841948,25,2

The total value of BTC locked in Ethereum is a round 55m usd (5,800 WBTC), almost 6 times more than in its own lightning network, where BTC locked is 9m usd ( 950 BTC), 

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: https:\/\/defipulse.com\/lightning-network](https://preview.redd.it/2v6dqfhvjg651.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6da5c5194c92e20434c5ddd382a51ddcd8e04373)

*Processing img mxc08x9yjg651...*

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Why it is happening**

Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) in the above figure, is an ERC-20 token. Each token represents a ERC20 version of Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of transferring ‚Äúnative‚Äù¬†BTC to ERC20-BTC is that users can exchange various type of value in the world‚Äôs largest ecosystem via huge number of DApps.

On BTC and BTC-only lightning network, there is only one thing users can do: transfer bitcoin from here to there. It is a limitation that the potential value/power of BTC can not be unleashed.

This why users transfer bitcoin to Etherium. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Solutions from BTC community**

It is a huge problem. Losing liquidity is fatal to any economic system, especially to a public chain. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Blockstream‚Äôs Liquid**

[https://docs.blockstream.com/liquid/introduction-to-liquid.html](https://docs.blockstream.com/liquid/introduction-to-liquid.html)

[https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements)

Blockstream contributes one of the lightning network implementation, and it runs Liquid, which is a federated side chain of BTC mainnet. Liquid has its own ecosystem, world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency exchanges joined its federated network. It has advantages targeting user cases including issue tokens for different scenarios, confidential transactions, unique tokens, digital collectables, and so on. In addition, Liquid now supports lightning transaction for its assets within the side chain network. Hope in the future more applications will move to Liquid ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

**OmniBOLT**

[https://github.com/omnilaboratory/obd](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/obd)

[https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec)

OmniBOLT is a lightning network implementation that supports smart assets(tokens) circulation and exchange. Its onchain settlement layer is Omnilayer, which is proven secure and stable, and have successfully issued billions USDT in the past 5 years. OmniBOLT constructs lightning channels and transactions on top of OmniLayer, therefore various type of values are able to get into the lightning highway, like route 66, to inter-operate, to exchange between each other. Assets from whatever public chains will benefit from the liquidity provided by this highway. This meets the requirements from DeFi, decentralized games, or generally decentralized applications.

I've done some google-fu based on the photos he has posted, an although i've found a few plausible options, nothing really fits the pics he posted with the services.

what i know so far.  
\-Card was sent from Riga in Latvia.

\-The parcel was legit, I checked the tracking number in the latvian post website.  
\-They allegedly let you resell their services.

So, long term is WBTC good bad or neutral for BTC? 

Things to ponder. 

Scary scenario. Let's say \[censored shitcoin\] somehow loses consensus. Not likely, but its more likely than for BTC. In this scenario, ALL WBTC goes pooof. gone. byby. The btc that is locked in the smart contract also goes poof. It is a mass burning scenario. For btc hodlers, we would be justified, and we would be left holding a larger piece of a dwindling pie. 

Not so scary scenario. WBTC piddles around. Its never really used outside of niche usecases. 

Interesting scenario. \[censored shitcoin\] takes off, and wbtc becomes the most dominant form of traded btc because fees are a thing. People keep btc in their cold wallets, but use wbtc in the grocery store because it moves faster than btc. 

So... given these three scenarios, is the \[censored shitcoin\] network good for btc by providing wbtc functionality?",1592950433,9,2

I am BTC maximalist, crypto supporter and successful day trader with average fundamental knowledge (probably read most of the important things since 2017).

&amp;#x200B;

1. Blockchain as sort of (or) industrial revolution - checked, but what is the correlation with BTC value long term?
2. BTC scarcity (digital gold) - checked, but anyone can make something digital with fixed supply?
3. Store of value - hm, checked, while mooning.
4.  BTC is the first mover - checked, but the Wright brothers invented the plane. I don‚Äôt see any obstacle for something to overpass BTC on the free market in future. Dominance chart started at 100%, with lows at 35% (era of pump &amp; dump ICO-s). I can imagine today‚Äôs big companies‚Äô cryptos to be on the market tomorrow, providing some perks to customers.
5. Digital money - checked, but I am pretty sure each country will back their digital currency with something else then BTC. Probably toilet paper with some fine letters they send to banks and stuff. And it will be (thanks to BTC) able to move for (almost) free, instant and anywhere.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

YOLO - checked. If we are fast enough, and the Elite is slow (and greedy while planning), we might get there.

I just have an idea that in the future we might be trading crypto forex and big companies‚Äô cryptos just like stocks and that the momentum would be provided by some moving average and global trends, not by digital gold.

On the other hand, if company‚Äôs tech is being used as the base to build upon, I can only see a positive growth in value there (I ain‚Äôt shilling any existing company, just looking 10 years in the future).

Looking forward to get roasted!",1592949547,18,1

The larger the ballance the more the frequent the transactions.

hc1bgu,dancingbearstonks,Think i figured out whats going on with the repo market. Mortgages are getting margin called in the shadow banking system. Research...,"r/investing removed my post without reason, they are censoring this!

[This was co-authored by some federal reserve board members 2 years ago](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/KimEtAl_Text.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;III.C. The Warehouse-Lending Process shows the two stages of the warehouse-lending process. In the initial stage, shown on the left side, the mortgage borrower is approved for a mortgage from the nonbank originator, who funds the mortgage using a draw from a line of credit provided by a warehouse lender. Typically, the warehouse lender will only fund about 95 percent of the mortgage balance, so that the nonbank originator has some skin in the game for each loan. The collateral on the loan is the mortgage, and the nonbank in turn transfers the mortgage to the warehouse lender to collateralize the draw on its line of credit. **Since the passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, mortgage-collateralized warehouse lending has been eligible for accounting and legal treatment as repurchase agreements (repos).**

&amp;#x200B;

Next, turn to page 16: **III.D. Vulnerabilities of Warehouse Funding,** to keep it simple its the equavlant to adding stop loss to every warehouse line of credit (which are used to fund mortgages). Since the margin call is on the loan for the mortgage instead of the mortgage itself, we don't see forclosures yet, but instead the margin call money is funded by the repo. Shawdow banks take the margin call. They pay the call via repo loan and pay that back via bonds, hence why the fed is buying those, junk bonds to be specific

&gt;Ginnie Mae servicers can only obtain unsecured financing, such as **unsecured corporate bonds**, to cover their advances. The rates on this financing are high, especially because many nonbanks have highyield credit ratings.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr** most high risk mortgages(over 50% of total mortgages) that a bank wouldn't lend, was lent by shadow banks via a link of credit from the banks. Banks have tight stop losses set on these and have been issuing margin calls on tons of them.",1592575700,4,1

If you are here, means you believe in bitcoin. And you are obviously waiting for BTC to moon. But have you asked yourself what happens next? 

Imagine we are somewhere around 2022-2023 and BTC is at it's peak. Many of us will definitely cash out and enjoy the huge profits right. Let's say you are one of them, how do you imagine yourself doing that. Are there enough currency out there for everyone?

&amp;#x200B;

Ok let' make it a bit simpler and take a look at USDT. The supply has almost doubled since the beginning of the year. They might be preparing for the next bullrun because BTC/USDT is one of the most popular trading pair. But only around 5% of BTC can be converted to USDT. What will other people who want to cash out do in this case? Almost all the altcoins out there follow the same trend as BTC and therefore is not a good way to take profits.

People would want to take profits and spend their coins. Are we ready yet for this? Well there are several sectors who already started to accept cryptocurrencies. So that's a bit reassuring but personally i think it's not yet ready for the basic needs.

Then there are the FinTech projects which aims at overcoming these kind of barriers. Without doubt, the most successful one is [crypto.com](https://crypto.com). The CRO token has gained massive interest and is soon to be at the top 10. Can be used to buy gift vouchers that in turn can be spent in shops to buy stuffs. This token will definitely be handy in the mid to long term.

hbwhxy,Frequent-War,Scenario: Fiat Collapses/ Hyperinflation,"Hey there,


I wonder if we could have a discussion about the scenario if the Fiat monetary system we now live in collapses. There are a few things that I can‚Äôt wrap my head around. 

1. If we face massive inflation, than prices of 100k-1m Dollar per Bitcoin would definitely be realistic, but since there is massive inflation the dollars wouldn‚Äôt have the buying power that they have today. So in my eyes there is no incentive to change back my Bitcoin into Dollars or any other fiat currency. This idea opposes all those Bitcoin investors who are trying to buy bitcoin cheap and sell it high, just to change it back into Fiat-Currency and buy all the stuff they want to buy when they made a quick buck due to the increased value of Bitcoin. 

2. Assuming there is no incentive for anyone to change their Bitcoins back into Dollars or other national currencies than all the stuff humans desire should be able to be bought with bitcoin. 

3. Due to the properties of bitcoin massive inflation isn‚Äôt possible. So investing into bitcoin today is more like reserving buying power in the scenario that the monetary system we live in collapses sometime in the future. 

4. Following the thought of (2.) 
I definitely see some problems occurring with the Bitcoin Network due to scale ability and human psychology that paying for a bread with 0.000001 BTC just doesn‚Äôt feel intuitive. 

5. Following the thought of (3.) 
If we‚Äôd change to a Bitcoin based monetary system with bitcoin as the underlying value, wouldn‚Äôt that make people who are already heavily invested in Bitcoin (I‚Äôm talking about thousands maybe millions of Bitcoin) incredibly powerful since their buying power would dwarf those of the richest people on the planet today? Isn‚Äôt it problematic if so much power is centralized on a few persons nobody even knows (Satoshi)? 


Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I am hoping and deeply believing that the blockchain technology is going to change the world. Hopefully to a better, more equal and more efficient place, but I‚Äôm having my problems in believing that the first application of that ingenious technology is already the best thing we might hope for.

hbuc8y,Avaixus,Is this a secure way of anonymizing bitcoin?,"I was doing some research into Monero's anonymity &amp; how the public ledger is obfuscated making it impossible to track the transaction history of a monero coin. However this gave my an idea, I've heard of bitcoin tumbling services before but I view this as encryption, makes it really hard but not impossible to track.

Lots of coin to coin exchanges don't require an account, so you could in theory have 2 bitcoin wallets &amp; 1 monero wallet. Over tor trade the bitcoin for monero, then on another separate exchange trade that monero back into new bitcoin fully destroying any link between the 2 currencies.

This would be a lot cheaper, secure, &amp; faster then a tumbling service, however I am not a professional in this field, just a security conscious geek. What are your thoughts on this, &amp; is this a sound method on anonymizing your bitcoin?",1592542128,6,1

hcies4,btcdstate,"Is Bitcoin truly for ""the good""? Or is it a part of the deep state agenda (Some questions about the ""intentions"")","While I do know that every technology is about ""how to be used"" rather than ""intention of the creator"" I cannot help but wonder if it is truly beneficial for the humanity as a whole to go towards this trend of ""cash-less society""and ""digital crypto currency"". 

As eloquently mentioned in the BTC White Paper, the significance of BTC invention lies in absence of the ""trust"". It seems logical to assume that BTC creation is about extinction of financial censorship. 

This means that the state(gov) cannot hold or stop the funds. 

And here is where I get suspicious about intention behind the BTC creation. 

I believe the existence of deep state and its agenda, and seems to me that crypto currency is not designed for a financial freedom, but rather for a single goal :  to build a society where ""Money is Might, and Might is Right"" truly, in literal sense, stands (while it is true in todays society anyway). 

If government cannot cease the funds, what kind of intervention would stop a destructive force with malicious intentions to gather money? 

It seems quite puzzling to me how Deep States wants anti-establishment while the opponents of Deep State also wants anti-establishment. (Here, I assume the crypto enthusiasts are pro-anti-establishment and anti-censorship) 

Democratic Government in its truest form is not something that's meant to be questioned and vilified by the public. The reason why the Gov and the bureaucratic system is so corrupt is mainly due to the existence of the deep state. And that is causing the general public to move towards anti-censorship and less government intervention. Right to censor by Government is not of it self a undesirable power, in fact it is necessary for the protection of order. The problem is that the censorship is used for the deep state's interest rather than for the interest of the many, the citizens. 

In short, I question whether Cryptocurrency and BTC is FOR the GOOD of the Humanity as a whole, and whether it actually is a tool for us to protect ourselves from the deep state agenda (or to fight it).

You may consider me as a conspiracy theorist, but at this point I don't think it is reasonable for us to dismiss the existence of deep state, the big-government. 

I am not an expert in cryptocurrency, and I have much to learn.

Even it's simply a coincidence, it's interesting to note that the past two times the btc chart üèí hockey sticked upwards after a halving event it came 4-6 months after the actual halving and coincided with a big vote and sizzling political climate. 

The way btc is currently hovering in price but advancing in underlying infrastructure and tech, it feels very much like it's waiting in the wings or champing at the bit to see where we're at closer to sept/oct/November. 

Compared to 2012 and 2016, what is happening now is exponentially crazier from a macro perspective and it feels like whether its up or down, the fuel is being loaded into the ship

In the past weeks, we have seen protests all across the globe demanding justice for George Floyd.

Is there a way this systematic oppression of black lives can end in America?

Some argue that the economics of these western worlds are designed to work against people of color and the way to end their oppressive regime is to no longer operate under there segregated systems.

Using **financial models such as bitcoin** is one of such ways, bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies are designed with the very idea to provide freedom and control to the people and take power away from these authoritarian regimes.

Author Isaiah Jackson, in his book [‚ÄúBitcoin and Black America‚Äù,](https://bitcoinandblackamerica.com/) argues the same point, mentioning how it can be used to fight oppressive regimes and help black-run businesses. 

Do you think Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be one of the answers to fight racism and end these authoritarian and oppressive regimes that have plagued our society for so long?

If they weren't buying, that would mean that the price would be tanking due to a supply / demand imbalance.

Exactly how it sounds restricted shares can not be sold.  My question is once a bitcoin becomes used for criminal activity does the bitcoin become similar to restricted share and removed from the free trading basket?

&amp;#x200B;

Example John buys $100 of bitcoin from a exchange and send them to drug dealer. The drug dealer cashes them out via non-exchange method such as cash by mail or cash in person. These cash transaction would not effect the price on the exchange and would likely be bought by someone who values privacy. In this example $100 of free trading bitcoin would become restricted coins. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr once bitcoins enter the black market economy they are removed from the free trading float and become restricted, right? bullish",1593090129,31,1

hfgx7t,Speedmetal666,South African banking on Bitcoin,"I think many people misunderstand why Bitcoin exists. 

Aside from Venezuela being a prime example, I think looking at it from a South African point of view might give some more context, since our fiat hasnt yet collapsed. 
Directly North of SA is Zimbabwe, where hyperinflation is in full effect. Their economic policies and government corruption has all but decimated the country and it's currency, and poverty is now country wide. The South African government are now adopting similar policies. SA's State is believed to be captured by criminals , there are ongoing court cases in this regard, some spanning over 2 decades, that have no conclusion in sight. In tge meanwhile the corrupt ANC government are looting state coffers into bankruptcy. 
SAs sovereign debt crisis is increasing dramatically due to corruption and ineptitude of SAs government, which, make no mistake, is being pushed onto tax payers.

The likelyhood of ever ousting SAs corrupt ruling party is very slim, and would likely be replaced by an even more corrupt government. 

Unfortunately I see South African economics headed in the same direction as Zimbabwe. Due to these facts over the past few years I have been dis-investing in my SA fiat and moving my wealth into crypto and commodities, and anything linked to a stable fiat currency(of which Ill dis-invest when I see the same signs).

I believe most fiats are eventually going to be decimated due to the nature of human greed. Maybe not in my lifetime, but it's coming.",1593065501,15,1

Just a reminder: I am totally new to this space, and I currently ONLY hold Bitcoin, but I wanted some perspective from this community on WHY holding only or mostly Bitcoin is the best investment.

Thank you for your time!",1593048015,124,1

hfbfa2,DominusVobiscum_,Wallet Recovery Help,"Hello!

I‚Äôm seeking help from the /r/bitcoin community to recover lost funds from a wallet.dat file. Someone I know asked me to help recover their lost funds - but I‚Äôm stumped and now seeking help from the experts.

**Facts**

* A wallet.dat file was created in approximately July 2017
   * Ubuntu Linux (v17.10?)
   * Bitcoin Core QT (v0.16.2?)
   * The original wallet.dat file is backed up and remains accessible
* Purchases were made on Coinbase and sent to an initial receiving address within this wallet
* *A few months pass‚Ä¶*
* Additional purchases are sent from Coinbase to NEWLY GENERATED receiving addresses (presumably same wallet)
* *A few years pass‚Ä¶*
* The person now wants to send their funds back to Coinbase for sale
* They have the original wallet.dat file, but only one receiving address is visible (presumably the initial one)

**Problems**

* The wallet.dat file was backed up ONLY ONCE, and PRIOR to the generation of those new receiving addresses
* The device used to create the new receiving addresses cannot be found!
* Loading the wallet.dat file into current Bitcoin core software does not display the subsequent transactions or receiving addresses!

**Questions**

* Can the funds for all transactions be recovered?
* What about the funds which were sent to the new receiving addresses, which were created POST BACKUP of the wallet.dat file?
* BONUS: If they can be recovered, what‚Äôs the best software to accomplish this, and can it also be done for the Bitcoin Cash which presumably remain associated to this wallet.dat file? Ideally without re-syncing the whole blockchain.

I was under the impression that the wallet.dat file contained a private key which corresponds to any / all newly created receiving addresses, but I must be mistaken. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. The person is at a dead end and I'm fresh out of ideas.

Thank you",1593039415,9,1

hfa3og,saimee1000,Does Bitcoin have any actual inherent value? Why should the price actually go up to a new all time high?,"No one actually uses it, basically 90% of people just hodl, for hopes that it may reach a new all time high. The others just trade it. The amount of actual transactions and vendors that accept bitcoin is abissimal.  

Although its more popular now than in the oast, majority of people attribute it to the 2017 bubble, and don‚Äôt consider it an asset, rather just a speculative token or straight up gambling.

It takes hours for a payment by bitcoin to be accepted, and due to high transaction costs as well as ridiculous price volatility, using it as a method of payment is basically ineffective compared to swiping a card or sending an etransfer/cash app/ paypal, which takes seconds. 

As for considering it an investment, its not like a stock or etf which is based around a business that continues to grow larger and generate more revenue.

Its has not direct use, in and of itself, like a precious metal e.g. gold, silver, which are also considered stores of value, but are actually used for purposes including dental care, jewelry, electronics, etc.

Bitcoin on the other hand has no inherent value and is not backed by anything.

Bitcoin hodlers love to make the point that ‚ÄúUSD is not back by anything either, consumers give it, its value.‚Äù

USD is literally backed by the sole superpower nation in the world. Anything that causes a major impact to the US almost always impacts the entire world. The majority of major international companies are based out of the US. Thus USD has the backing of the entire US economy. Unlike bitcoin, which is backed by a handful of hodlers and people on the darkweb who use it for payment, unfortunately it becoming easier to trace bitcoin as well now so many on the darkweb have switched to monero or other cryptocurrencies, so there isn‚Äôt much use in its illicit properties as well.",1593034795,16,1

Now there is greyscale who own like 3% or more of btc and keep buying.

Then we can assume there might be more huge actors like some bank or funds that owns like 5% too, this is just speculation, but it might well be possible.

**Bitcoin Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (BTCP/IP)**

BTCP/IP provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.

BTCP/IP operates on the Bitcoin Lightning Network due to the increased transaction speed and reduction in transaction fees.

To request a packet from a host, a user must send a lightning payment for a predetermined amount of Satoshis. Information is then organized into packets and transmitted via a series of lightning transactions.

Each packet should relate to the previous packet to ensure the data can be constructed into a legible message.

While data transmissions of this nature are currently not a part of lightning, it could be possible to chain these transactions together fast enough that small amounts of data add up fast. Even several bytes of data could allow for decentralized private conversations and message boards.

One way to accomplish this without creating massive amounts of mempool data is to have the data automatically prune itself. This would allow, one day, for websites and applications to be built in a browser without overfilling bitcoin blocks with data.

Alice sends the host a satoshi, and the host sends a satoshi back in a transaction that contains a short message. When Alice receives the satoshi in return, she automatically sends another satoshi until the end of the message is triggered by the host.

A message contains 2 characters of reference data so the message can be constructed on Alice‚Äôs end. It also contains one or more characters of static data. Once data has been received by Alice, her web browser builds the message and checks that the data is fitting to the right location.

&gt;\[\[1,H,2\], \[2,e,3\], \[3,l,4\], \[4,l,5\], \[5,o,6\], \[6, ,7\], \[7,W,8\], \[8,o,9\], \[9,r,A\], \[A,l,B\], \[B,d,C\] \[#,.,#\]\]

The \[x,0\] and \[x,2\] of the transaction array are an example of location data for the message. \[x,1\] of the transaction array contains the data of the transaction.

If a transaction is received out of order, it can be verified and rebuilt by the browser

This series of transactions would build the phrase ‚ÄúHello World.‚Äù through a series of satoshi sized transactions.

Edit: Crossposted to Bitcoin talk for more discussion opportunity.[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5258620.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5258620.0)

Edit 2: Discussions with MrRGnome have lead into researching opportunities involving Whatsat to create a system of pinging servers and receiving HTML and other web data.

Edit 3: It seems the amount of data that can be sent is much more than 3 digits, ~~but as current Whatsat uses failed transactions on LN to send this data.~~ Edit: Hootsumdaddy pointed out that Whatsat has moved away from failed transactions. For internet 2.0 built on bitcoin it would be ideal to use both free and confirmed transactions on the satoshi level to facilitate information transfer.

Edit 4: For proof of concept, we'll be testing chat bots on Whatsat that deliver basic html pages as text and then have them automatically open in your browser. To accomplish this we must first find out the maximum data that can be sent in a message, then create a system that reads the data to a cached file and opens it.",1593366442,10,10

Does each buyer need a seller to complete a transaction? If yes how does more crypto enter the supply?

As most of you know Lebanon is going through a really rough time with its currency losing already 80% of its purchasing power, and it's only getting worse with food/meds and fuel shortages in many areas.

I strongly believe in Bitcoin, as many of us do here, however in Lebanon people lack Bitcoin awareness and are generally afraid of ""virtual currency"". I am taking on the challenge of educating and helping people to onboard the right way, educate them on how to be safe and avoid all that shitcoin hypes.

&amp;#x200B;

But I need your help, I did my best in creating a logo but really my skills are crap and my web skills aren't better either too  but i guess that is okay for now. Bitcoin Du Liban is a pun intended at our central bank that is called Banque Du Liban (  [https://www.bdl.gov.lb/](https://www.bdl.gov.lb/)  ) so my current logo is derived from that, however i would love to have a bitcoin logo with a lebanese accent just for our project so it can be used as branding tool, banners etc.

Bitcoin needs marketing in Lebanon, I would like to create an educational animated video that explains the benefits of Bitcoin for lebanese people . Currently we are under capital controls, and any USD sent to lebanon using Western Union or Moneygram is automatically converted to local currency at fixed rate instead of true market rate, and using a Bank transfer takes many days in addition that its very difficult to reach banks to withdraw USD and even if you manage to get to the bank you can only withdraw it partially. I would like to create a video explaining how all this can be avoided with simple p2p transaction.

Im more of a, deposit $ on to bitcoin and try and use it as I would my bank account but hoping to get some solid ROI instead of the terrible interest rate a checking account would. As I spend BTC I can simply buy more. Anyways....

Just wanted to say that for those people who haven't tried using the lightning network, give it a shot. Download a mobile wallet, transfer some sats to it and try sending a few transactions out. I recently started using Bluewallet since IOS lightning wallets aren't as common as android but there are some other ones out there as well. 

My next step is to set up a lightning node to have full custody of my keys like I do with my trezor but the custodial LN wallet has been SUPER simple to use. Just don't put more $ on there than you would be willing to loose since at the end of the day you are trusting someone else. 

I think in the future a simple lightning wallet and buying sats directly off-chain should be the recommended route for people new to bitcoin. That way they can get a feel for it before moving on-chain where fees can be MUCH higher and waiting for confirmations etc can be a turn off for some.

If you haven't tried it you should. P.S. [ln.pizza](https://ln.pizza) is amazing and is definitely the kind of transactions that would make bitcoin get more adoption. Also buying gift cards on the Fold app with lightning makes for a decent discount.",1593307397,26,8

hh57ov,enteiwin,Bitcoin Tax Question,"From Investpedia:

&gt;‚ÄúIf bitcoins are received as payment for providing any goods or services, the holding period does not matter. They are taxed and should be reported, as ordinary income.‚Äù


So. Does that mean, if you earn a 1BTC ($1000) payment in 2014 for sales goods and services, you pay your taxes on it for the 2014 tax year. 

But, if you kept that original coin until now, you could cash it out for USD, at ten times the starting price? It was originally income, not an investment. Does that matter?

It shouldn‚Äôt, right? If you earn USD as income and hide it away in a hole in the ground, and the value of the dollar happens to deflate substantially after the point you earned your cash, you don‚Äôt have to pay capital gains on the increased buying power of your USD.


Thank you in advance. I am very confused about how it‚Äôs taxed in these circumstances. If capital gains taxes must be calculated, it would seem like a major hassle for a business that was making hundreds of transactions in bitcoin and holding it all, while it appreciates.",1593305142,7,0

These issues do not respect national borders and will hit particular regions, countries, and continents harder than others. This will invariably create mass migrations of especially low-income people across national borders particularly in regions like Central/South America ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/world/americas/coffee-climate-change-migration.html)), Sub-Saharan Africa ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxZAqswJfL4), [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moO1BkjnslU)), and Southeast Asia ([Source](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/27/india/india-water-crisis-intl-hnk/index.html), [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSwBIstZUs), [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH00bVAMDTs)).

While the wealth of these individuals may be minute relative to their western counterparts, in aggregate, this wealth could amount to billions or trillions of dollars flowing into Bitcoin as a result of these mass migrations. We've already seen western banks discriminate against refugees ([Source](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/exclusive-shameless-hsbc-shuts-syrian-refugees-bank-accounts-in-britain-9655838.html)), which will force these migrants to search for alternatives that provide significant accessibility, portability, and security for their savings.

b) say I only exchange some of my btc into xmr, convert back to btc, and then put it back into my wallet. This would be a waste of time, correct? I would never know whether I am sending out the coins that can't be traced back to me, or the ones that are still connected to me through KYC, If I am understanding right.

    - We don't offer exciting advantages to get you interested. We promise _only_ full information of BTC wallet: login-password, owner, country, ip-address - but all responsibility of how you'll use that information is on the you! It's not easy money, great bargains and a caring relationship.
    2. Do you have proof that you have access to these BTC wallets?
    - Choose BTC wallet/wallets you want to purchase, write us a message and we send your all proof data: full information of owner, his country and ip-address (except login-password) + image of BTC wallet when we logged in his wallet and your e-mail messages near that window.
    Your desire of purchase must be serious! Since after we send you full information about the owner, his country and ip-address, and you do not purchase this account, we will not be able to sell this account anymore anywhere, since the information of the owner is already known.
    3. Why you don't use these BTC wallets by yourself?
    - Why did Pablo Escobar not sell his Cocaine _personally_? He could save a lot of money on couriers and sellers!
    We just do our work perfectly and sell BTC wallets to customers. We don't work with low balance BTC wallets. We don't work for a hire. We value and follow the rules of a Closed Hacker Society (CHS).
    4. I want to write a post, that you're ""SCAM"" somewhere on dark web forums.
    - Post images of your communication with us + information of what exactly BTC wallet/wallets you purchased + transaction info (money you sent to our BTC wallet) + login-password, owner, country, ip-address (full information) that you received from us (or didn't receive).
    If you want to ruin our reputation - post evidence!

hhyn0t,Giacomovico,Bitwala How To recover your funds and Warning,"Good morning everybody,

Let's talk about Bitwala and let's start with the most important topic:

# HOW TO RECOVER YOUR FUNDS.

In case [u/Bitwala](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bitwala/) blocked your funds, please **collect all the emails/documents exchanged with them and upload them on Dropbox.** Then please, **file a CLAIM with the Berlin Polizei** here: [https://www.internetwache-polizei-berlin.de/](https://www.internetwache-polizei-berlin.de/).

FILING THE CLAIM IS FREE AND IT TAKES JUST FIVE MINUTES.

**Add in the claim's description** the Dropbox link, explaining what is inside.

**IMPORTANT:** SEND then the claim's PDF to [u/Bitwala](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bitwala/).

FEW DAYS LATER THE PROBLEM WILL BE **SOLVED.**

&amp;#x200B;

Here you can also finds some useful **contacts:**

&amp;#x200B;

# Let's talk about Bitwala.

Bitwala is a platform that provides you a German IBAN to deposit EUR and then buy BTC. The BTC wallet is a multi-signature type. What does it mean? *Multi signature means that the user* ***does not have 100% control over his wallet.***

**So how works** [u/Bitwala](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bitwala/) ?

**Forget** about Bitwala, in reality you are dealing with a German bank named **SolarisBank** AG. Your bank account opened with [u/Bitwala](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bitwala/), is under their control. Bitwala, as stated by their costumer agents, cannot influence any decision regarding the freezing of your funds.

Below my deposition made with the Berlin Polizei.

&gt;"" Giacomo Vico, myself, on the 15.10.2019, registered on Bitwala and made a **first deposit from PayPal**, for two thousand euro.  
The deposit was credited and everything \*seemed very good.\*  
On the 16.10.2019 other **four thousand and five hundred euro were transferred** from PayPal to Bitwala.  
The same day the **account was blocked.** No warning or explanation.Immediately I tried to stop the second deposit, but it was too late.  
Emailing instantly Bitwala, a support agent named Brianna, told me that they had no responsibility over the bank accounts, and every decision about them was taken by their bank partner, **SolarisBank** AG.*This last part is extremely poor explained on their website.* [*www.bitwala.com*](https://www.bitwala.com/)  
The day after, 17.10.2019, Giacomo Vico **requested a formal explanation** and provided all the documents proving the ownership of the PayPal. \*No answers from Bitwala or SolarisBank.\* So, on the 20.10.2019, after a pile of useless and vague emails, Giacomo Vico **decided to call directly SolarisBank.** He could spoke only with a vague operator, named Jerico and was **denied** speaking with a manager. The operator told Giacomo Vico that he could **only address his concerns,** about SolarisBank, **through** emailing with their partner **Bitwala**. **However**, in response, [u/Bitwala](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bitwala/) repeated that **they could not solve the dispute** because they had **no control over** the bank account.  
Stunned by so evident subtle manners, Giacomo Vico, on the 28.10.2019, was obliged to call in his lawyer.Again, SolarisBank was called, in order **to solve as gentlemen the dispute,** but again we were denied speaking with a manager.  
Therefore, on the 29.10.2019 my lawyer sent an email to SolarisBank formally **requesting the closure of the account** and the remittance of the funds. **Absolutely no answers.** After calling them again they repeated they could not speak with us and we should address our concerns to [u/Bitwala](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bitwala/). ""

Two days, later my lawyer opened a Legal Claim with the Berlin Polizei, against two managers of Solarisbank.

**ONLY after this,** we received an email from SolarisBank asking for an IBAN to remit the funds.

**All Bitwala Cases:** [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kqf0lhcri9i70qq/AAAKLz0B-\_v2MI-3BpH5zQVwa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kqf0lhcri9i70qq/AAAKLz0B-_v2MI-3BpH5zQVwa?dl=0)

&amp;#x200B;

Bitwala is directed by four managers **J√∂rg von Minckwitz, Jan Goslicki, Dylan McFadyen, Ben Johnson.**

**Three** of them previously operated a company called **All4BTC**, which many of you may remember.

# ALL4BTC

All4btc was a service that let you buy anything on the web using Bitcoin.

You copy-pasted in All4Btc the link of what you wanted to buy, enter your shipping details, checkout with bitcoin and lastly wait for All4Btc to buy your product and then ship it to you.

**Indeed** during the brief life of the company a **huge number of users** hardly **complained** that they paid for orders, but no items were ever received.

**Funds recover was impossible** because customer service STOPPED RESPONDING.

Some user may already find some similarity with Bitwala at this point.

I*n the* ***link below*** *you will find all the* ***users*** *that ""lost"" their funds with* ***All4BTC.***

[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b7s7wao82qqt2ry/AADG7U8\_kaTwwhLwvmpHjGT3a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b7s7wao82qqt2ry/AADG7U8_kaTwwhLwvmpHjGT3a?dl=0)

***After increasing claims,*** *the three of them* ***decided was time for fresh air.*** *They interrupted all the activities with All4BTC and continued with Bitwala GmbH.*

&amp;#x200B;

# Bitwala and All4BTC Structure

**Minckwitz, Goslicki and McFadyen** in 2013 funded the *Bits &amp; Coins Consulting UG*. [https://www.dropbox.com/s/pftmh7vdwrcipqe/gruendungsurkunde\_bitcoinsberlin.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pftmh7vdwrcipqe/gruendungsurkunde_bitcoinsberlin.pdf?dl=0)

**All4BTC was a ‚ÄúBits &amp; Coins Consulting UG‚Äù project**, as it is clearly stated here. [https://www.dropbox.com/s/ywd272czj78b7nd/vertrag\_2013\_juli.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ywd272czj78b7nd/vertrag_2013_juli.jpg?dl=0)

Then in 2015, J√∂rg von Minckwitz and Jan Goslicki founded **Bitwala GmbH.**

Taking a closer look, we see that **J√∂rg von Minckwitz,** **while** being **director of Bitwala,** was the **head manager of All4BTC** until 17.08.2016, when Dylan McFadyen took his place.

Then on the 24.11.2017, Martin Mischke became the head manager of All4BTC *replacing* Dylan McFadyed, which *became Senior Manager in Bitwala GmbH.*",1593432336,1,1

 I just started with Bitcoin a few days ago.

I have 0.0014 BTC the lowest currency I saw has 0.0018 BTC as minimum. Is there a way to exchange without these minimums? I hope my low budget BTC question is understandable.

I have heard you can buy i think it is Monero (XMR) and then buy the bitcoin back which will break the link from your purchase at the exchange where they have your identity. 

Couple questions:

1. Is this legal, and if so, is it worth doing or even necessary?

2. Should i create a brand new wallet to send the new Bitcoin to? Is that going to make a difference? Seems like it would since the transactions are still tied to it.

gu21rs,100_Jose_Maria_001,"With Bitcoin, I feel like I am saving, rather than investing","From a friend of mine:

I started buying bitcoin first as an investment, but gradually, as I became more and more comfortable in the environment, and shifted more and more of my savings into bitcoin, I realized something fundamental had changed:

As a millennial, this is the first time in my life that I could have ‚Äúsavings,‚Äù rather than investments.

Most of my friends and family are in debt, either from college, from ‚Äúbuying‚Äù a house, or both. Those who are not in debt, are forced by near zero interests rates to invest in stocks or bonds, or real estate. Many friends and their families lost it all in 08. And the future is more uncertain than ever, as our pension funds are invested in the same risky schemes.

Meanwhile, after hodling through the last bear cycle that took BTC to 3k, you come out of it realizing that in the long run, BTC will most likely always appreciate. Why would you, then, ever take your savings out of it? Of course, BTC is still a risky proposition, but it is the only one that allows you to save.

I guess the distinction I am making about BTC being saving or investment is a bit of a stretch; I mean, BTC is still a gamble by all means, but it feels like less of a gamble, or a more worthwhile gamble, than anything else. And it is the only one, that due to its ability to appreciate over time with a higher degree of certainty (the hard coded diminishing supply), to give me a feeling that I am ‚Äúsaving,‚Äù rather than ‚Äúinvesting.‚Äù",1590942513,34,10

1. A cash-less society is inevitable. (congress announced plans to come out with the digital dollar)
2. You will receive this mark on your hand. (we see evidence of this with the QR code in your smartphone)
3. You may receive the mark in your forehead. (you can memorize your seed and even memorize your private key if you wish. The forehead is referring to memory.)
4. Your head will be chopped off with a guillotine if you don't accept the mark. (just look at all the fiat currency. It has heads on all the bills. We also use machines similar to a guillotines to cut the bills. Cash will be worthless eventually.)
5. The beast spewed fire and people followed the beast. (this is referring the the bullruns and price entrancement.)
6. It gave power to a second beast. (again referring to a fork of some kind)
7. The stars in heaven fell. (Mount GOX hack of Bitcoins)

I use Coinjar to receive payments for graphic design work occasionally.  On Sunday a client paid me around $97.  I was going to withdraw it to my bank account but decided to wait a little as the price had dipped.  On Monday evening I checked it and was still a little less and I figured I'd withdraw it shortly anyway.  Before I went to bed I tried refreshing the Coinjar tab in Chrome and it was unresponsive (not loading the page at all).  I figured I'd restart my PC as it seemed a little sluggish but Windows needed to install and update and I went to bed.

In the morning I logged into Coinjar and it shows that at 10pm the previous night $90 was sent to another BTC address.  I use 2FA on my account so I am at a loss as to how this was done.  I am really upset and feel violated right now.  I use antivirus software and did a full scan and found nothing.

I'm upset about losing the money but more angry and upset about the violation of my privacy.  Obviously I have changed my password now but I would really like to know how this was done so I can prevent it happening again.

gy2xaz,JanPB,A question about something in Antonopoulos' book,"In his great book *Mastering Bitcoin* Andreas talks about Bitcoin addresses and how they are obtained from public keys, scripts, etc. But there is one aspect of it that doesn't seem to make sense to me. 

Let's use the public key (call it *K)* case, where we want to derive BTC address from *K.* The process starts on p. 64 (2nd edition) with evaluating some hash of *K.* That hash is the prefixed with a version number and postfixed with a checksum. The result is then Base58-encoded.

Here is the problem: Andreas writes on p. 68: ""The version prefix in Base58Check encoding is used to create easily distinguishable formats, which when encoded in in Base58 contain specific characters at the beginning [...]""

The implication (and the accompanying Figure 4-6) strongly imply that merely by manipulating the prefix (the version number bytes) the Base58 encoding will result in certain designated  leading characters, like ""1"" for a public-key-based address or ""3"" for a script-based-address.

But this cannot be right, the version prefix simply does not offer that kinf od control. (See an example below.) So what is really happening? My guess is the prefix like ""1"", ""3"", ""xpub"", etc., is simply added¬†at the end by fiat [pun intended]. Is this what's happening?

An example: let's just assume for simplicity that the hash of some public key (20 bytes) PLUS the checksum (4 bytes) is simply 100...0 (i.e., 2^192). Now add the version prefix denoting a public key hash: 0x00 in hexadecimal.

Now encode it in Base58: the highest power of 58 in the above number is 32 (assuming I did my math correctly), so the resulting encoding has 33 Base58 digits. Its leading digit is 23 (decimal), i.e., the character 'Q' in Base58.

So the leading character is 'Q', not '1'.

Last but not least (I should have said it in the beginning) a leading '1' popping out of the Base58 encoding would be weird because the character '1' in Base58 stands for **zero.** So it wouldn't be there to start with (no leading zeros).

OK, back to the studio.",1591491785,7,1

gy0lq7,oto1911,"Which side are you at, Cardano or BTC?","Cardano Monetary Policy - https://docs.cardano.org/cardano/monetary-policy/

There is a difference between the monetary policy of Bitcoin And Cardano.

1 BTC = 10^8 Sats
1 ADA = 10^6 Lovelaces

Interesting point to note is that all that will ever be are Sats and Lovelaces to buy and sell. We just call a dollar to be 100 cents for the sake of simplicity. 

Makes more sense to exchange in day to day life by buying food for $10 than 1000 cents. You won't have to take care of zeros for multiplication etc. 

Not knowing that there are less number of Lovelaces in 1 Ada than the number of Sats in BTC, creates a misconception that the total circulation of Cardano is greater in times than the total circulation of BTC. 

My thought - This misconception will render anyone not choosing Cardano as a better investment than BTC. Cardano is in an early stage where it is heavily undervalued. Anyone would be able to hold more share in the supply switching from BTC,ETH etc. 

Fact - more share you have in a confident supply, the better off you are than the rest. 

If, it solves decentralisation with scalability and security, which it is most likely to do sooner than later then, Cardano will gain more price action relative to bitcoin or even break Bitcoin's dominance because Bitcoin is only a store of value. 

Cardano is a buy for anyone looking for an investment in a revolution. ;) 

I sold 5 BTCs and went all in Cardano today as shelly launch was previously confirmed in July and it seems that Cardano will have Goguen launching sooner too with entering in rest of the Eras following it. 

I'd appreciate logical criticism.

Am hoping to get some advice from you all, or confirmation that this plan will work:


1. Use an offline copy of www.bitaddress.org to generate an Address+PrivateKey combo. Place both into an encrypted file, and store copies of it in multiple physical locations.

2. Slowly buy bitcoin using CoinBase, and periodically send them to the address generated from Step1.

3. Visit www.blockchain.com/btc/address/xxxxxxxxxxxxx to see that transactions from CoinBase completed successfully.

4. After 10+ years, buy whatever the newest Ledger hard wallet is available, and ‚Äúsweep‚Äù the bitcoins from my address into the new hard wallet.


I‚Äôm not looking to be trading/selling/using it anytime within the next 10 years, so the idea is to have the simplest setup that doesn‚Äôt require maintaining any hardware/software wallets for the next 10 years while I slowly accumulate bitcoin. I won‚Äôt have to install any software, or update hard wallet firmware or anything like that.

Is an Address+PrivateKey all that is needed to sweep the coins from my address into a new Ledger or software wallet when the time comes?",1591481514,16,1

gxy9zi,brianddk,What prevents state actors from proxying millions (USD) to mining pools to launch a 51% attack.,"Assuming that there exists some subset of miners that work completely to their own self interests and without any greater good or altruistic motives, how would you foresee the following dystopian fiction play out.

By rough estimates about 80% (proof ^(tbd)) of the bitcoin network mining exists in mining pools. These pools compete in a free market to entice independent miners to join their pool.  The rates are paid in BTC per TH/s.  The current price to ""rent"" the entire bitcoin networks pooled mining resources is about $9 to $10 million / day (proof ^(tbd)).  This is entirely within the budget of state actors, even the $3 billion to rent the bitcoin network for an entire year doesn't sound far fetched when considering government spending.

So if a state actor (government) were to partner with some established mining pool they could subsidize that pool to offer unrealistically high rates to entice more and more miners (in their self interest) to join their pool.

Once they reach majority (51%) they could exclude blocks from other small independent mining pools tilting the tables more in their favor.  These early attacks would create long (25 block) reorgs (proof ^(tbd)), but eventually, as they gained more market, they could make the attacks pretty quick.  Each attack could exclude blocks from a 1% pool, 2% pool, and so-forth till they attack 1/3 (33%) of the miners at which point they control the whole network (proof ^(tbd)).

So assuming miners work in their own self interest, why wouldn't they join this obviously evil mining pool if that pool was offering 50% above market rate for their mining power compared to competitors?",1591474755,57,1

And nobody is prevented from owning bitcoin, running a node, mining it or accepting it.   Bitcoin respects that human beings have free will and are required to make choices and live with the outcomes of those choices.

gx0yu7,Envrin,Bitcoin based debit cards?,"
Got my bank account frozen earlier today due to a Localbitcoins transaction, which really chaps my ass.  Sold off some BTC, and apparently the Interac e-Transfer that hit my account was fraudulent.  

So due to the bank's shitty security protocols and them allowing a fraudlent payment to go through, they decided it was a good idea to penalize me and just freeze my money.  Then I find myself stuck on the phone for a couple hours, talking to some stranger sitting in a call center on the other side of the country, asking for their permission to access my own money, which I was denied.  Sorry, but I shouldn't be penalized because they're security sucks and they dropped the ball.

This is why I like bitcoin.  It's my money, and nobody can touch it except me.  I don't have to ask some stranger's permission if I'm allowed to access my own hard earned money.  Fucken banks, I'm pissed...

Anyway, any advice on good Bitcoin based debit cards?  I know there's AdvCash and I'll grab a couple of them, but if you know of any other reputable debit card providers out there, I'm all ears.  I'm going to distance myself from fiat, as it's total bullshit that people have control over my own money like that.

I wanted to transfer those bitcoins to another wallet, but then blockchain said I had to transfer the coins from my ""trading wallet"" to the regular wallet, I had to do the 12 words security in order to do this. 

Also this message is displayed ""**At this time, Blockchain.com only allows sending from your BTC Trading Wallet to your BTC Wallet""**

so I entered in the full amount that was in my trading wallet and pressed continue. Now all the money is gone, and there is no record of the transfer in the history. Only a record of me buying the bitcoins.

I've made a number of transactions with Paxis, truth be told it gets credited quickly (within 1 business day), but my last transaction took around 3 days, I was worried so I've opened a number of tickets, hit them on Twitter to inquire for the delay. I even contacted my bank to get me a copy of the SWIFT message to send it to Paxos' support to further processing from their end. 

Despite how slow they respond to tickets, my funds were processed and credited. HOURS after I got the funds, they replied to my inquiry claiming that they DID NOT RECIEVE the funds yet! WTF? The guy at Paxos literally saw my ticket and replied without even checking that the funds already arrived. I would have snapped the Fu\*\*\* out of I received such an email while my transaction is not through.

I'm just not sure if I want to use them again. They don't seem to handle clients seriously. It happens quite often that my tickets get ignored until I reach out to their twitter and ask for a look into my ticket, that's how I got the support's attention to process my funds.",1591313091,1,1

gwrrdc,DasChill17,Is it illegal or punishable for a US citizen to trade on a foreign crypto exchange that has prohibited US users from accessing it?," 

Hey all, I couldn't find this specific thread yet. I am based in USA and plan to trade over $10K worth on a foreign (to USA) crypto exchange via VPN - very set on doing so for a few reasons.

If you hold &gt; $10K in a foreign exchange - I know you're required to file your foreign holdings on FBAR. I plan to pay my taxes and file FBAR, but by filing the FBAR I will be notifying FinCEN that I'm trading on a prohibited exchange. I would think that as long as IRS is getting their tax $ then FinCEN won't care, as it was made to prevent tax evasion and other financial crimes. I've heard there's no law stating that it's illegal for a US citizen to simply trade on a foreign exchange that prohibits US users- it's just against that exchanges terms of service. The only illegal action I think that would occur is if I were to not pay my taxes or report the foreign holdings on FBAR - but I will do both of these.

Anyone know if it is illegal or punishable for a US citizen to trade on a prohibited foreign exchange if the citizen pays all taxes to IRS and reports all foreign holdings on FBAR to FinCEN? I have heard of no active cases on this topic. Thanks!""",1591309527,11,1

If quantum processing does come into play and is able to has at a much faster pace, then short term I could see a significant drop in the value of BTC and Cryptoassets in general. But long term demand will eventually overtake the supply and drive the value right back up again.

He also mentioned other stuff regarding quantum processing, such as possible hacking, and crypto and blockchain not being essentially bullet proof from quantum processing.

gw5szx,TheGreatMuffin,Is social upheaval good for bitcoin? I asked Nick Szabo. [by Elaine Ou],"**Is social upheaval good for bitcoin? I asked Nick Szabo.**  

*Note: This is the second in a series of questions. See Also: [Could Cypherpunks have done cool stuff without in-person interactions?](https://elaineou.com/2020/05/31/could-cypherpunks-have-done-cool-stuff-without-in-person-interactions/)*  

A collapse in societal trust will generally increase demand for trust-minimized assets like gold and Bitcoin. People may come to realize that the trusted third parties they were relying on are not as reliable as expected.  

For example, people are learning the hard way that [police have no legal duty to protect you](https://www.barneslawllp.com/blog/police-not-required-protect). Banks, exchanges, and custodial wallets are also security holes. You and your account are just bits to these operators, who will freeze or seize your assets when political winds shift strongly enough against you.  

Bitcoin has what I call ‚Äú[deep safety](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1162743096821469184.html)‚Äù, in that it‚Äôs secure against legal and political threats. As opposed to an asset like Treasury bonds, which avoids volatility risk while being vulnerable to everything else. A situation that creates legal and political instability might be good for Bitcoin, but will be bad for the world in general.  

Personally, I would rather not have societal collapse, even if it is good for Bitcoin. Only a sociopath would be in favor of massive death and destruction for the sole purpose of making a number go up.",1591228290,2,1
gw5sqx,Procrastination72,The future of Bitcoin and its value,"I've been doing a lot of research about Bitcoin and blockchain technology in general. Personally i think its amazing and is going to do a lot for the tech world over the coming years. Bitcoin was supposed to be a replacement for currency that any one with a computer and internet could access.

Sadly Bitcoin isn't widely seen as a currency, its more of an commodity (digital gold) and with the market being what it is, people with money speculating on what they think something is worth, the price will never be stable. It will always be an investment to try and make money but for most people they would not swap their full bank accounts over. There people all over saying BTC will go to the Moon, and when people here that, they think that also means the price can visit the Marianas Trench.

Personally i think investing in crypto is a good idea and can make you a good bit of money, but that's where things like LINK and VET come in, they're closer to a software program than a currency when it comes to purpose and would not need a stable price to achieve large scale adoption. For them its people using the technology that matters and coins linked to them just power the system. 

So my question is what does the community think about this? Do we want it to be used instead of money or do we want to get rich trading on the swings?

Im not sure what i think, on one hand i would love it to become a stable digital currency that i would be happy to hold my saving in and not check on a daily basis to see if im richer or poorer today. On the other hand i think there might be to much of a stigma against bitcoin, and there will always be people buying/selling huge amounts, pushing the price around, and so maybe it should stay the way it is, the crazy drug that drags people into the world of crypto?",1591228266,1,1

Solution: Instant Exchange --&gt; my Lightning Network wallet --&gt; LNMarkets --&gt; Profit!,"What to do with the small amounts of altcoins you might have lying around in various wallets and exchanges?  Convert them to Lighting network [‚ö°](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets), and give them a 10X spin on LNMarkets!

I found that I had a small amount of altcoins leftover on a few [P2P exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8) that I use, and from some small amount of a crapcoin that I received from Brave wallet on my Uphold account, as well as some small balances from a few altcoins on my multi-chain wallet, etc.   But the fees for converting these to bitcoin and then withdrawing might chew up all of (or most of) the value of these bits of loose altcoin change.

So what I did instead was to use [FixedFloat](https://FixedFloat.com), an [instant exchange](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cd1fr8) to convert these altcoin bits into bitcoin on Lightning network.  Doing that conversion to BTC on LN eliminates any BTC network transaction fee, letting me keep most of the value from the altcoin (the instant exchange takes their cut from the conversion).  So I did this, one wallet and exchange account to the next, until they were all clean.

Once I had received the last of the bitcoin in my LN wallet I saw the total, .... 240,000 sats (~0.0024 BTC).

Essentially I gave my wallets and exchange accounts a colon cleanse, but I was still left unsatisfied with just ~$20 worth of bitcoin as the result of having gone through the effort.

Wanting something a little more from my shitcoin purge, ... I took those funds from my LN wallet and created a 10X leveraged long on [LNMarkets](https://lnmarkets.com).

I've no idea if I'll be 0.0024 BTC poorer or if instead this little excursion will pay out nicely. But since the funds came from my various bits of altcoin loose change lying around, I consider it worth taking the risk.  And I'm really pleased that I'm nearly entirely shitcoin-free at this point.",1591207784,11,5

Remember Venezuelan ""living"" here.

This week has been a bit slow. But still, we are around 2000 BTC monthly.

Finally, goverment increased the price of the gasoline. Now one litre is 50 USD cents (one gallon is 1.9 USD).  Old price was: 1 litre of gasoline = 0.0000000003 USD.

As the wages are that low, you have a subsidized amout of 120 litres monthly (120 litres for 3 USD). It is a mess...

They will go for the other public services. Electricity and water....

For instance, if I had a bot, would I be able to give it functions to buy bitcoin when the price drops below a set amount, then sell when it reaches a set percentage higher?
E.g: Buy when below ¬£7200. Sell when over ¬£8000.

If this is possible why don't the mass of people use bots?

Again, this is purely to help my understanding. I find the whole concept of crypto very interesting and I'm not very savvy when it comes to markets and trading. Thanks.",1591200159,11,1

gyy2e0,churgercold,Binance scammed me 1516 USDT with unethical verification requests! Then rejected my real verification with stupid reasons! Stay Away from this Scam Exchance! (Latest Review),"Hello guys,

may be you remember the story I posted here recently about HOW BINANCE is SCAMMING me 1516 USDT  
If not you can review it here:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/g08w53/binance\_scammed\_me\_1516\_usdt\_with\_unethical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/g08w53/binance_scammed_me_1516_usdt_with_unethical/)  


Here is the final update. I'm not here anymore to try to beg r/binance to refund my money, as it's already clear that they scammed. I want just want awareness about the shit exchange.  


In short, r/binance r/BinanceExchange and their manager u/symbiotic_bnb SCAMMED me my 1516 USDT.

They wanted me to send my real documents, provide some video I must record for them. I did all they requested and they replied saying ""no, it's not you, you got documents on darknet"". My godddd, so I went to darknet, I bought docs from people and requested them the videos, how sick are these people? I don't even know where is that darknet ( Smybiotic may be you can teach me).

**When I insited, they told me they are expecting from me UK documents because I was connecting using UK IP wowwww**

**I was using indeed UK private proxy to use my unverified account**, and even if not, whats the relation with my IP when using unverified account?

These guys are simply SCAMMER!!!!!!!!!!!  


Binance, one more time you WON, CONGRATULATIONS. Keep scamming people like you do everyday.",1591617870,16,0

gys5r5,OneMoreJuan,The Paper Network: an option for your grandma to adopt Bitcoin,"Imagine not having to explain what Bitcoin is to your grandma and she still being able to use it. Imagine going to your computer and being able to literally print bills for your grandma: 100,000 Sats / 50,000 Sats / 10,000 Sats / 1,000 Sats or any denomination. Yep, just like Dollars or Euros. And she can go to the store and pay in cash (actually cash backed by Bitcoin). I know what you're thinking: ""that's a paper wallet"". Well... not really. What I'm proposing is a ""Smart Bitcoin Bill"" to avoid fakes and double spending. 

How would it work?
Just like an encrypted paper wallet, this bill will be protected by a passcode (a pin, a password, or even a fingerprint). To create it, you just deposit Bitcoin into the Paper Network just like you would do with the Lightning Network or WBTC. Once you do it, you can divide your BTC into several denominations and then print the bills.
Once you have the bills, you could go to the store and pay using them and you can use your PIN number or fingerprint to change the ownership of the encrypted private key (from your grandma's point of view, she's just paying in cash and scanning her finger, or putting a PIN number).
This way, if you ever had copies of these bills, once you've spent them only the new owner of the passcode recognized by the Paper Network would be able to redeem the Bitcoin and send it to a standard wallet, or spend it again.

The Paper Network is very similar to WBTC, but I think that even though obviously I'm not an expert and I'm just one more Juan on the internet talking about something that I don't 100% understand, I think that if something like this was possible and we made it 100% trustless, it would be huge for third world countries and older individuals to reach massive BTC adoption.

How would you implement it?

Is it even possible to make it 100% trustless? How?

What implications could it have?

What other implementations can you think of?

I'd love to hear your opinions. Thank you!",1591591607,16,1

In this example the Whales(W) where short/long 49/51, instead retails where short/long with a percentage of 35/65 , which is a 14.7% difference . I don't know it this could be useful or anything,  
i'm still studying it.

It works on all USDT currencies of Binance and with 5m,1h,4h timeframe for now.

My idea is to create a FREE(not paid access or anything) telegram channel where this bot will output when there is some kind of big difference between whales/retails. could use it and send me feedback on how to improve it or if there is some kind of other statistics that could be useful.

I'm here just to gather some feedbacks on how to improve an already existing tool or to create other tools that the traders could find useful.

Let me know if you're interested so i'll create the channel! Cheers",1591561322,4,1

h0xnd3,Kinolva,REMINDER: There aren't enough BTC for HALF of today's millionaires to own JUST ONE. Owning ONE bitcoin puts you--at minimum--in the top 0.2% of the human population in terms of total possible Bitcoin wealth distribution.,"Let me remind all you old timers, and inform the newbies: There will only be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins. Ever. Approximately 4 million have been permanently [LOST](https://fortune.com/2017/11/25/lost-bitcoins/), bringing the maximum circulating total to 17 million. This total number won't be reached until 2140 due to Bitcoin's [issuance schedule](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply). This is ""quantitative hardening.""

Total number of millionaires (in USD value) worldwide is around 33 million ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/22/12-million-new-millionaires-will-be-minted-over-the-next-five-years.html)).

The factual math is simple: there is not enough Bitcoin in the world for even HALF of today's millionaires to own just ONE SINGLE BITCOIN. Much less all the future millionaires that will be born as the human population approaches [10bn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population).

Bitcoin is SCARCE. Check out the [S2F model](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25) for a good explanation of why scarcity and value correlate. Recently updated to the [S2FX model](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/bitcoin-stock-to-flow-cross-asset-model-50d260feed12) for a model that incorporates more data, and is more accurate.

Furthermore: If you are able to acquire even one BTC today: Enjoy the feeling. You are an early adopter. And one of a **very** select number of humans. Owning just ONE BTC means that you are--at minimum--in the top 0.2% ([17M / 8Bn \* 100](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=(17,000,000/8,000,000,000)*100&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8)) of the human population in terms of total possible bitcoin wealth distribution. The percentage is much lower than that, of course, given that there are lots of whales out there with 1000+ BTC each.

Edit: And never-mind the idiots that will say something asinine like ""my pubic hairs are limited in number too...does that make them valuable?"" Your pubic hairs have zero network utility, whereas every day Bitcoin proves it has extraordinary utility as (perhaps) the most perfect form of money humans have yet created.

[bitcoin-gcp-k8s](https://github.com/liuhongchao/bitcoin-gcp-k8s) is a set of terraform files that help you to setup and configure your personal Bitcoin full node on GCP  with low cost. 

Some of the benefits are:

* Only \~$20 a month
* Access from anywhere, on any device.
* Super easy to setup and config (standard terraform files). 15 minutes to get a full node up and running.

1. According to what I know, the base layer of the BTC network does support smart contracts in a very basic way and if you talk SCs on base layer you are basically talking about transaction modulation right?
2. I was engaged in a debate over BTC smart contracts and had realized I had very little knowledge about them - In the discussion, I 've heard the argument that smart contracts on BTC are turing complete - is that true?
3. I 've read about second layer solutions for SCs like RSK - What is your opinion on that and is this an SC that is supposed to be turing complete?
4. Ethereum has a virtual Machine as a core for SCs as far as I understand - Is it the same for Bitcoin? And if not, what are the differences?
5. Are there any smart contracts widely used on the BTC network?

Thank you very much for your answers :)Have a great day guys :)

h0u62g,hectorhan,You can now buy Coca-Cola with Bitcoin!,"If you are a Bitcoin trader either in Australia or New Zealand, good news! Coke vending machines now accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.

## What does this mean for Bitcoin?

Although a coke vending machine that accepts Bitcoin may at first seem silly or insignificant, it is actually yet another sign that adoption of the cryptocurrency is progressively increasing. The 1,200 or so machines available between the two countries means more exposure for the project. Even if many will never actually pay for a soda with Bitcoin, the simple awareness that such an option exists is already a positive.

For those who do wish to experience paying for an instantly redeemable physical product with Bitcoin, they will simply need to download the Sylo payment app. With it, they can scan a QR code in a manner reminiscent to China‚Äôs Alipay or Wechat Pay system. The crypto will then be automatically converted into the relevant local currency.

## Other Benefits

With the current health crisis involving COVID-19, any initiative that lowers customers‚Äô physical contact with machines is beneficial. Particularly so when these machines are frequently used by hundreds of people and tourists every day. QR codes limit a user‚Äôs need to interact with both potentially contaminated surfaces and cash.

Fortunately, even bitcoin derivatives traders and spot traders that do not live in these countries can still benefit. As suggested above, the more Bitcoin is adopted as a form of payment, the more relevant and strong the cryptocurrency becomes. Other similar efforts to facilitate the use of Bitcoin for transactions include BitPay. This payment processor already works with large brands such as Shopify and Newegg to help their users pay with Bitcoin.

## Cryptocurrency Is Entering Into Our Everyday Lives

Although cryptocurrencies have been here for a good number of years, most people are still skeptical about the whole idea of what it stands for. With the rate of adoption growth over the years, the majority of the global population still looks to crypto cautiously without a full idea of what it is. Interestingly, cryptocurrencies are one of the most interesting topics to learn about as you can sit in your home and take insights off the internet during this coronavirus pandemic.¬†

However, a vast number of the total population know about cryptocurrencies but adoption is a topic they would rather not talk about. Recent studies have shown that investing in cryptocurrencies can be one of the best things to do in terms of Investment in 2020. Even though with the presence of high risk, the return is usually high which might have covered the whole risk involved. With the movement of the global economy towards a digitally inclined future, cryptocurrencies are one asset that would bridge the gap. From investments to payments to exchange of services and so on. With cryptos already threatening to enter into our everyday life in the coming future, this post would take a quick look at 11 reasons why you should [invest in cryptocurrencies in 2020](https://bit2buzz.com/community/Top-11-Reasons-You-Should-Invest-in-Cryptocurrency-in-2020).

1. **Legitimate investment** 
2. **Secure transactions** 
3. **Vast accessibility** 
4. **Vast profits**
5. **Stock alternative** 
6. **Independent investments** 
7. **Liquidity rate**
8. **Simplicity** 
9. **Favorable forecast** 
10. **Exchange security beefed up**
11. **Profits predicted**",1591769914,3,0
h05494,sparky77734,Looking for Technical Information about Mining Pools,"I'm doing research on how exactly bitcoins are mined, and I'm looking for detailed information about how mining pools work - i.e. what exactly is the pool server telling each participating miner to do.

It's so far my understanding that, when Bitcoins are mined, the following steps take place: 

1. Transactions from the mempool are selected for a new block; this may or may not be all the transactions in said mempool. A coinable transaction - which consists of the miner's wallet's address and other arbitrary data - that will help create new Bitcoin will also be added to the new block.
2. All of said transactions are hashed together into a Merkle Root. The hashing algorithm is Double SHA-256.
3. A block header is formed for the new block. Said block header consists of a Version, the Block Hash of the Previous Block in the Blockchain, said Merkle Root from earlier, a timestamp in UTC, the target, and a nonce - which is 32 bits long and can be any value from 0x00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF (a total of 4,294,967,296 nonce values in total).
4. The nonce value is set to 0x00000000, and said block header is double hashed to get the Block Hash of the current block; and if said Block Hash starts with a certain number of zeroes (depending on the difficulty), the miner sends the block to the Bitcoin Network, the block successfully added to the blockchain and the miner is awarded with newly created bitcoin.
5. But if said Block Hash does not start with the required number of zeroes, said block will not be accepted by the network, and the miner Double Hashes the block again, but with a different nonce value; but if none of the 4,294,967,296 nonce values yields a Block Hash with the required number of zeroes, it will be impossible to add the block to the network - and in that case, the miner will either need to change the timestamp and try all 4,294,967,296 nonce values again, or the miner will need to start all over again and compose a new block with a different set of transactions (either a different coinable transaction, a different set of transactions from the mempool, or both).

Now, what I'm trying to figure out is what exactly each miner is doing differently in a mining pool, and if it is different depending on the pool.

One thing I've read is that a mining pool gives each participating miner a different set of transactions from the mempool.

I've also read that, because the most sophisticated miners can try all 4,294,967,296 nonce values in less than a fraction of a second, and since the timestamp can only be updated every second, the coinbase transaction is used as a ""second nonce"" (although, it is my understanding that, being part of a transaction, if this ""extra nonce"" is changed, all the transactions need to be double hashed into a new Merkle Root); and I may have read someplace that miners could also be given the same set of transactions from the mempool, but are each told to use a different set of ""extra nonce"" values for the coinbase transaction.

Is there anything else that pools tell miners to do differently? Is each pool different in the instructions it gives to the participating miners? Did I get anything wrong?

I want to make sure I have a full technical understanding of what mining pools are doing to mine bitcoin.",1591769818,3,2

h02dzh,isittrue99,Stopping the urge to go all in,"Hi am new to crypto and cold wallet is on its way. I have been resisting the urge to buy crypto with the savings I have, I know is FOMO. But I resisted somehow to only buy $150 worth of crypto. I want to do Dollar cost averaging but the thing is  I never had so much savings before and this time exposed myself to crypto . It is risky but my emotional brain donot understand. I feel like I am in casino where its been red for 10 straight times and this time I want to bet on black. By the way savings I have I can pay towards debt with the debt is within the family so I can delay that. Stocks and crypto might come down again but I might never have that much savings. Somehow I convinced myself to set limit and not go all in but reducing it it to 50%. Thanks in  advance.
Edit : $150 worth of crypto that I own will increase",1591757746,9,3

h0069s,timosno,I investigated a btc-fraudster - what can I do?,"Hey guys,

It‚Äôs my first time on reddit, so please be gentle.

Nearly one year ago a guy stole me 2 Bitcoin by manipulating a paperwallet website. I know now that it‚Äôs stupid to use these websites, but that were coins from my beginnings in crypto and now it has happened - so please don't blame me for that.

Of cource I filed a report at my local law enforcement, it took some time and then they told me that they can‚Äôt determine the thief. It seems they put not much effort in it, because I started to investigate on my own and it took some time, but now I know who‚Äô‚Äôs the guy who stole it.

I got his address, his mail and his phone number, I contacted him multiple times, but he denies it - what a suprise.

There are more than enough evidences, but the law enforcement won‚Äôt/can't do anything more - probably because the thief is in Canada, while I‚Äôm in Germany.

Has anyone out there an Idea what I can do? I thought about contacting his local financial authorities or something‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm very open for suggestions

If I follow my coins on the blockchain it seems that he stole much more than 40 btc and even here on reddit are multiple threads from guys that obviously fall for the same, so maybe it would help much more guys, if we convict these fraudster and get the btc back",1591749355,15,5

Does it just make a new wallet and store the private key(s) on the device? Is there a way to retrieve the private key(s) other than the ""24 words"" thing?

I also see there's an app and the Nano X has bluetooth. Can you send/receive from the Nano X by itself? Do you need to have the Nano X with you and connected to the app to send/receive from there?

It sounds like the S is cold storage and the X is used as or with an active wallet, is that right? Is there other things either/both of these can do to benefit a Bitcoin owner? I see there are other applications you can install to the devices, but they seem to mainly be other currencies, I only hold BTC and don't have any intention of branching out right now.

This BIP will soon be implemented in the ColdCard firmware (pull request merged in master). The principle is to use a derived seed from the master one as randomness to generate new BIP 39 mnemonics on your ColdCard and use them as seed of other wallets.

In practice the implications is less seeds to backup because the mnemonic were derived from the same master key, you don't need to backup the words of your other wallets. This means that you will need to only backup the derivation path used to derive the mnemonics and the master key.

You will basically need to backup only one seed, the one of the (air-gapped) ColdCard you used to derive the mnemonics !

I find this really cool !

The limitation is that you still have to backup the seed of the wallets that don't use BIP32 derivation path like the one of LND.",1591721745,8,5

Then today was updating the node and used bitcoin-qt instead of bitcoind and when was waiting suddendly i see some text in the gui where it says ""recent transactions"", and a lot of transactions where there.

Then was like WTF happened here, someone stole my btc?, or installed a compromised version of electrum(i use archlinux and install from the repos). Why some transactions where there, i neved imported my wallet to bitcoin-gui.

Inmediately deleted the wallet.dat and did the same in electrum, but my question is:

Was something imported into bitcoin-qt?, all my history was redeable from the gui, i never imported into bitcoin-qt, and as far i know the seed never leave the hardware wallet.

This is normal?, at least all my funds are still there but im really worried.

PS: everything happened with my hardwallet unplugged.

TLDR: We, the 99%, do not fairly share in the fruits of our labor, yet we are consistently forced to bear the burden of corporate and institutional shortsightedness, greed, gambling and failure.  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenLetters/comments/h9ofta/dear\_99/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenLetters/comments/h9ofta/dear_99/) 

A light has been shined on the American police problem, but it is just the tip of the iceberg in what are numerous deeply rooted issues concealing entrenched, multifaceted systems of oppression meant to indiscriminately maintain the status quo over the 99% regardless of skin pigment. 

\-End the Fed: The Federal Reserve (The Fed) is America‚Äôs central bank with questionable oversight whose name is derived to invoke and imply authority of the federal government and therefore (at least nominally) accountability to, the American people. On paper, the Fed answers to congress, which in a perfect world would be a representative body, of the people and for the people, this is not the case. Educate yourselves on the Federal Reserve and its role in previous greed driven economic catastrophes. End the Fed, stop feeding the oligarchs and the connected cronies they implant into the systems, corporations, and banks which directly benefit from the money these crooks print out of thin air at our expense. Financial institutions need more oversight, and we should be searching for solutions or alternatives. Perhaps we should gradually #OptOut. 

\-Banks and Lending Practices: The US banking system operates on a fractional reserve system. This requires banks to keep only a tiny fraction of the money they lend on reserve, the rest of which they may loan out and charge interest on. Banks literally make money using our money, and still assess overdraft fees and monthly maintenance fees from those who barely have enough to get by as it is (and who cannot afford maintaining minimum balances as they do not possess regular income, or are busy living paycheck to paycheck). These fees might as well be called ‚Äúpoor taxes‚Äù as it appears being poor is expensive. We should all vote with our money by removing it from these banks and only doing business with less greedy fee free credit unions. Historically, the banking/financing sector has been racist and biased in their distribution of opportunity to the public favoring the rich living in better neighborhoods. This is a problem, how can historically disadvantaged people for example, raise capital to start businesses, obtain reliable transportation, buy houses in better neighborhood so that their children might benefit from better education all when they are caught in the cycle of poverty (or worse yet, also affected by blatant or backdoor racism)? Socioeconomically induced inequitable access to opportunity is a massive problem in the United States and this affects the 99%, including the middle class. The richer the family you are born into, the higher the quality of education you are likely to receive, the more connected you are, the more access to resources and support for stepping into the world ‚Äúon the right foot‚Äù, obtaining stable income, building/maintaining a higher credit scores which translates to lower interest rates, and in general, better opportunities. From a purely business standpoint, it is then quite understandable that banks would want to obtain the business of these less risky, rich desirables while treating others as low priority clientele (likely with algorithms to ‚Äújustify‚Äù doing so). The terms of credit lines and loans extended to those from disadvantaged communities should be examined (e.g. payday loan offices that plague these communities ‚Äì or credit cards with outrageous APRs awarded to those from these communities lacking the education to use them wisely leading to the destruction of their credit scores and therefore justification from banks to deny opportunity to these individuals later in life thereby inhibiting class mobility). Lenders and banks have gamed and weaponized their monetary instruments (e.g. predatory credit cards and loans) against disadvantaged communities by enabling the less financially literate to dig themselves into financial holes from which they may never recover; this is a herding mechanism which relegates and confines the disadvantaged to certain neighborhoods (further perpetuating the cycle of poverty). 

Oligarchs, their cronies, financial institutions and the corporations they control have perverted the once great concept of the ‚Äúinvisible hand‚Äù. They intervene in our democratic processes to further self-interests at the expense of the public benefit. We are living in a system that gives us the illusion ‚Äì or semblance, if we are lucky ‚Äì of justice, opportunity, class mobility, and the ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù. While some of these are achievable through mountainous effort, the struggle in achieving these are unbalanced depending on factors that should be inconsequential such as skin pigment, zip code of birth, and social connectedness. These coercive instruments of oppression propagated throughout our engineered society have kept us busy keeping each other compliant, fighting amongst ourselves over scraps ‚Äì and promotions, grinding for our next paycheck and inhibiting our drive for vindicated civil disobedience ‚Äì lest we go hungry or homeless, and have placated us with bread and games to shroud the connected few who rob us through the camouflaged systems they proliferate. We are attempting to climb an ever-growing cliff where the rich have reached the top, raised the ladders, and continue pouring grease along the slopes. Main street is not wall street. Greed has severed the relationship between market performance, our country‚Äôs production, and the average American‚Äôs plight. The rich get richer by, among other things, their ease of access to newly printed money (debt) before the wider population increasing their purchasing power before inflation takes hold, allowing them to purchase and accumulate stocks and assets at a discount (Cantillon Effect) ‚Äì further increasing their political influence which they use to further self-serving interests. This has resulted in a financial and social bubble that is bound to burst violently without intervention. 

We, the 99%, do not fairly share in the fruits of our labor, yet we are consistently forced to bear the burden of corporate and institutional shortsightedness, greed, gambling and failure. 

The 1% have their perverted hands wrapped around our necks. We can‚Äôt breathe.",1592273615,7,1

Why couldn't there be a lower difficulty block that would only serve to post and confirm transactions?

E.g. what I'm thinking is that there would be a second difficulty rate which would somehow aim to be mined maybe every 30s-1min. It would be awarded 0 btc for mining, but would allow the miner to receive transaction fees.

The idea being that a faster confirmation time would make btc more practical for purchases and this encourage more transactions.

It's been 23 hours at this point and I am not sure what to do. I have read that you could replace the fee or that the ""child pays for the parent"" but I am not sure how to do that since there is no feature in my wallet app. I've also read something about sending the same transaction a second time but that doesn't make the first one unstuck right? Also wouldn't want to spend 500$ just to have 250$ in the end.  
Transaction: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/d3f809b19a45ed626fef09bf3ac281b494e0612c66a018a4f856dd430c9075ae  
Wallet: Blockchain Android Wallet  
  
Is my money lost in space? What is the best thing I could do to either get the money back or make sure it will confirm in the next hours? It makes me paranoid not knowing what will happen to my coins and I really hope they are not lost forever.  
I understand this has been asked numerous times before and I did google but since I am not a daily crypto user I don't really understand the different processes and just want to make sure I don't mess up any further. As I said before, my wallet does not have any features to replace a fee or pay a higher one for the same transaction.",1592378382,0,1

The only machine I've ever seen with ny own eyes has had an ""out of order""-note stuck onto the display for ages, yet the ATM still shows up in a myriad of articles which uses it as an example of a local crytpo ATM. It seems that the machine is more if a token device used for the promotion of crytpo, rather than something people actually use, which has got me wondering if this us true for other bitcoin ATMs too?

So how many users does these machines have on average? How often is there a transaction, and what percentage of BTC funds travel through these machines? I want to see numbers! :)",1592375569,9,1

hajfxf,exuberantsam,Data recovery shop stole my Bitcoins [SUSPICION],"I have this external hard drive that I've been using as a backup for my critical files such as family photos, password combinations etc. It was 2016 when I bought it and last week was literally the first time I took it outside my house and let other hands take over with my drive after I accidentally dropped it and got bricked so I brought it to a data recovery shop about a mile away from my house last week, I told them I want all the files back especially the photos, and they said it will take days since they still have customers in queue, so I left my number and told them to call me when the job gets done.

Yesterday 12 noon I received the call and I went back with my new external drive to retrieve all the recovered files and also the dead drive, I felt so thankful until I opened my Blockchain Wallet app yesterday evening and found out I've got logged out of my wallet, at first I didn't feel nervous or any uncomfortable feeling, I just tried to login again multiple times but it didn't work, that's when I started to panic, so I took my printed backup of the recovery phrase but it didn't work as well, I tried reinstalling the app but to no avail. I also sent an email to blockchain even though I know they cant do something about it.

I was pondering the whole night how I got hacked when nobody has access to my phone and the printed backup was hidden somewhere I'm the only one has access to, also my relatives don't know shit about cryptocurrency and I'm pretty good at computers and well familiar with any kinds of fraud on the internet, therefore I could not find any way how I got hacked until I remembered I've once put my recovery phrase and private key on a plain text file on my external drive and simply deleted it using only windows explorer which is not safe and secure for deleting critical data from a drive.

So here I am, I just lost a three-quarters of bitcoin along with my account and transaction logs.  I'm not planning to go back to the data recovery shop and accuse them of stealing my bitcoins because first off I got no proof that they stole it, and second, it was clearly my fault for not being mindful of my critical files, but hey that doesn't mean I should get robbed as a punishment. I'm so devastated today and would be for some days, I learned a lot from my experience and now I believe i'm not good at computers.",1592365757,3,1

I would say 15% of my assets are in bitcoin (I only have 10k net value but just graduating with a masters I hope that increases). Having ties in Panama, I do trade on paxful quite regularly.. just something to keep in mind when considering storage.

hdedsj,brianddk,Happy Father's Day... don't forget to tell your kids where your bitcoins are.,"Happy Father's Day to all the fellow Dads out there.  Just a quick reminder as you reflect on what it's like to be a Dad, ensure your family knows about bitcoin and how to access your wallet in case of emergency.  Most disaster plans are pretty simple.  Whatever safe or bomb-shelter you keep your seed engraving in, just reminder your family where it is and how to access it.

Also take a bit of time just to give the the barest minimum bit of information at least.  ""This is the seed mnemonic and this is the passphrase, if you tell it to anyone they will get full access to all the funds.  If you loose it all funds are lost.  The piece of paper next to it tells you how to load it into a Trezor to sell it or move it"".

You can go a bit further if you want to.  There are some services by Lopp and Casa that will handle the process automatically.  Also remember that most HW wallets come with pretty solid password managers so you can give your family all your banking account info and exchange logins if needed.

Obviously today is not the day, but if your like me, somber though the subject is, having it handled lets me sleep better at night.

And if you want to ease them into it easily just start paying their allowance in bitcoin through a noncustodial wallet.  Even just a few dollars will be enough for them to get the basics.",1592773061,3,1

hdassp,t4keheart,Unique situation regarding a deceased relative and their bitcoin,"Hi everyone, 

Wondering if anybody here can provide any information (legal, technical, whatever) that may be helpful in our situation. I am a technical person (sys admin), but never got too involved in bitcoin and crypto currency. Believe it or not, I used to own several bitcoin back when mtgox was prevalent, and bitcoin was much much cheaper. I think I spent the 50 or so bitcoin I once owned on something from the silk road when I was 16... Talk about regret. so I understand encryption and technical topics, but not the specifics when it comes to bitcoin these days. 

My fiance's brother (so my brother-in-law) just recently passed away unexpectedly. He used to talk frequently about the amount of bit-coin he had, but nobody really knew for sure if he was telling the truth. Anyways, the family is interested in trying to recover the bitcoin. 

First of all, legally- what happens to crypto currency in this type of situation? I'd assume it goes to whoever the rest of his estate went to- but if that person doesn't know how to access his bitcoin wallet, what then? They're just out of luck and the crypto currency is lost? I'm guessing that bitcoin is non-recoverable, just by design. Is this correct?

So the family has his laptop, and access to his user account, and they're asking me to do what I can to try to recover the lost coin. I have a PGP key- which tells me he encrypted his private keys, which I'm guessing would make this even more difficult. 

My first instinct would be to attempt to get into his email- to determine where his wallet was ""hosted"" (e.g. coinbase, etc.), and if I can find that much out, I would hope it would be as simple as clicking a ""forgot password"" link and following the steps.

So I'm hoping somebody might be able to fill me in on something I may not be aware of when it comes to bitcoin. I know my brother in law was very paranoid when it came to security, and this task might be impossible- but I wanted to ask and see what anybody might be able to add here. 

Thanks for reading",1592760553,6,1

hd9fkw,BitcoinCanSaveUsAll,Individual Sovereignty Narrative Question,"Hi all,

This is a probably a pretty basic question for any of the Bitcoin OGs who are into running their own nodes but I have been hitting my head against the wall here a bit lately and was hoping someone can ELI5 this for me. 

As you can probably tell from some of my prior posts, I'm a huge advocate of people running their own nodes and using them to send and receive bitcoin transactions. That said I admittedly have been relying on outside entities to be able to gather the transition hash for my outbound transactions when moving my BTC from exchanges (i.e. Conbase and CashApp etc). 

&amp;#x200B;

Typically what I do is the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Search blockstream dot info (or any other reputable Bitcoin blockchain explorer) for my address that I sent the BTC to.

&amp;#x200B;

2) pull up the transaction output number on my bitcoin node via CLI with gettxout command and wait for confirmation on my node.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem here is that I'm relying on a third party to get my transaction hash to search in my own node.  That said, what's the best way that I can avoid this step in my verification process.  I'd like to be able to run my own blockchain explorer with my own node but I am not a coder so I'm hoping that there is a pretty straightforward way to go about this for a non coder running a windows node.   Note that i do have the TXindex =1 already enabled.

This service consists of invading a mobile device (cell phone or tablet)  
and take any or all of the data inside of it.  
Our service is done by using the carrier‚Äôs network. When we say ¬´carrier¬ª  
we mean to the company who provides voice and data services. The company  
with which the device‚Äôs owner has its contract.  
Each device has a SIM card, and through this SIM card, the device is in  
constant connection with the carrier that provides its services.  
What we do is to use the carrier‚Äôs network, since this network will always  
be linked to the device, even if the person has no active plan at this  
time, or if the line is cut. As long as the SIM card remains in the  
device, there will be a satellite connection, which we will use as a  
bridge, to attack the carrier and use its network to invade the device.

390 US Dollars ‚Äî Full access to the entire device. Conversations from all  
installed messaging apps, calling logs and audios, SMS sent and received,  
photos and videos taken with the camera, real time GPS location,  
possibility to activate the camera to spy in real time, all the passwords  
stored in the device from emails and social networks(FB, Insta, WhatsApp,  
icloud, etc‚Ä¶), dating apps logs(Tinder, Happn, Badoo, etc.). It will be  
like having the device itself in your hands to see it completely.

All the information for the contracted package can be viewed from a  
private website, to which we will give you access at the end of the  
service. In addition, you can download what you want to your computer or  
phone and schedule automatic sending of reports to your email. Keylogger

The updates will be in real time and you will be able to see and spy  
everything at the same time it is happening.

The service is compatible with all type of devices, mobile phones and

heba36,2poor2die,This is for you. Get ready.,"First of all I want to say a proper hello to you. Hello! :) I've been a member of this community not for a long time, but I've been in the crypto world since 2015. I'm not from US (since 90% of reddit is US) but I'll try my best to explain my thoughts in english in this post. Trust me, you won't regret reading it.

I started studying the crypto world for my own since it's a passion, a hobby. Why? Because the whole concept of crypto fits my ideals, ideas and thoughts when it's about the world. 

But I will be talking about the Bitcoin, since it's the most important part here. We'll exclude any other alt-coin because makes no sense to talk about them here and is a way broader topic. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main statement : Bitcoin is the 8th wonder of the world. Is the chance of every single one of us, to have a free life. I want to explain why, because I'm too enthusiastic and all of my friends do not share the same ideas and have no clue about the crypto world, and you are my friends now :).  


Money. When it was first created, it got completely centralized. GOVs and institutions were controlling the money. Imagine a country with 1000 people and 1000 whatever-currency. Every one would have 1 currency (let's call it banana-coin). So every person would have 1 banana coin. The GOV is controlling all the banana-coins. If something bad happens, they product more banana coins. What happens when more banana coins are produced? Inflation, thats right. So in order to buy 1 bread, you need now 2 banana-coins instead of 1. This everyone can understand, right? But what if the GOV prints even more? Right, 10 banana-coins for a bread. But we have only one country. Let's add 2 more countries. The country with 10 banana-coins/bread is doing worse than the other 2 where they can still buy 1 bread with 1 banana coin. Then the 2 countries can ""destroy"" the first country only with the power of money.  (I'm trying to keep this as simple as possible)  


Now imagine this with USD/EUROS, in a CoronaVirus world with the GOVs. Yup, everything is falling apart, everything is in chaos. The systems are controlled by greedy people.   


The conceptual idea of money, is to be UNCONTROLLABLE. Before the invention of money, the goods used as currencies were much better in term of freedom than the money created after. Then money was created, real gold coins, then data in systems, then recessions every time on a period of time, as example 2008 because THE MONEY WASN'T USED AS IT SHOULD BE. FINITE AND FREE.  


Then Bitcoin appeared. BOOM! Finite, free and sustained only by its users. It's a wonder. I'm sorry I can't explain this as I have everything in my mind, but I'm trying... The bitcoin creator is not known, but he gave us something he knew we would need. It's like someone came from future to give us this in order to evolve as a society. He knew that the currency in a modern world cannot be used forever if its not gonna change to something that NOBODY CAN CONTROL it. Very few people really understands the quality of this, the chance that we have.   


If 21 mil btc were mined, no more producing, the price lets say was at 100k. And the corona virus hits, WE DONT NEED TO PRODUCE MORE. The value will just go up, the bitcoin would help us. We don't need to MAKE more. The whole concept behind the Bitcoin is that HE WOULD WORK for us, we dont need to do anything else just to USE IT. Behind the scenes, it is the 8th wonder of the world. I'm so sad I can't explain exactly how I can in english because I know you would understand me.. I think I need better friends IRL lol  


Money = inflation, the GOV is controlling it, they produce it legally (if we produce it we go to jail), ITS NOT FREEDOM. People are not understanding this. You work 20 years of your life for 2.000$ a month and then boom everything crushes because of some greed people and you are ruined.   


Bitcoin = if we use it, we are saved. The price can go only up. Even in a Corona Virus situation, when businesses are closing, the bitcoin price would go up and it would sustain us on the timeframe we need. There is no need to do anything else JUST TO USE IT. Globally.   


It will be slowly implemented into the word more and more by different companies, BECAUSE WE DICTATE IT. The use of this, will make big financial companies TO USE IT FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR PROFITS. This is our chance.

heau73,Raisingaquestion,How to get access to a specific address with my private keys,"Hi guys,

I was wondering if this is something which we can still do. Nowadays we are all using HD wallets, but I believe this is something that didn't exist back then.

Is there a software/platform that would allow a user to access a specific address (say for some reason this address is not automatically retrieved in an HD wallet when he uses his seed) with his private keys?

A simiilar case would be these Bitcoin games where if you solve a puzzle, you get a private and public key which allows you to get some BTC reward. How exactly do you get access to those (you can't just enter your private public keys in wallets like Coinomi etc...)

hearhu,nick-bravo,German Enron - Wirecard,"I'm sure that many of you have heard about Wirecard's balance sheet fraud by now. Wirecard is a payment service. The stock fell from 120‚Ç¨ to 15‚Ç¨ in just a few days after it was revealed that about $2 billion worth of assets on the books didn't actually exist.

Apparently, an important indicator to detect balance sheet fraud didn't trigger on Wirecard's books and therefore nobody knew.

I don't pretend to understand how quantum computing works or even fully understand how the blockchain works. My counter arguments to the threat of quantum computing are as follows:  
1.  Quantum computing means quantum security - Hacking and security is a constant cat and mouse game. One side doesn't make all the advancements, they build off each other.  
2. Even if security doesn't keep up with quantum computers ability to decrypt, then wouldn't banks and businesses be even more vulnerable to attack than bitcoin? If the computer is so powerful as to take over the Bitcoin network, couldn't it brute force itself into anything?  
3. Is this built on the assumption that there will be just one quantum computer? If all miners start using quantum technology then it becomes impossible for a single user to take over the network right? The threat only exists if the first quantum computer is built and for whatever reason they want to use that power to destroy Bitcoin?

His story is that in 2011 or 2012 him and his father bought some long shot investments through a paper company (99 shares him, 1 share his father) and he chose bitcoin. His dad passed away a couple years after that and his sister was granted power of attorney to liquidate the fathers investments. Anyway, she has been very cagey about where the bitcoin are. The regular bank they dealt with said they didnt offer bitcoin as an investment so they forwarded him off to a broker in Calgary Alberta. I cant find any record of anyone who dealt with bitcoin way back then. Its my understanding you had to have an actual wallet file on your harddrive, or you went through an online wallet company. Many of those are defunct and the money gone forever. Given his sisters reluctance to provide any information as to what happened to the investment account from this broker, and her many changing answers to the same question, he's under the impression she either has the coins/wallet file or she sold them upon the death of the father.  Apparently hes convinced he has 30-40 million dollars sitting somewhere in a bitcoin wallet. 

My question is basically what original web wallets existed back in 2012ish and which ones if any are still active. Also, if anyone knows of a broker who dealt with bitcoin in Canada way back then. I already know the answer is likely that the coins are gone forever, but thought i'd post here.  I suggested he get a lawyer to write a stern letter to the sister trying to get more information as to what happened to the fathers accounts/bitcoin but he's broke and owes back taxes to the CRA as well. The CRA was told about the bitcoin back then as they suggested to sell them to pay the back taxes, but the sister wouldnt provide the information my friend wanted. Any thoughts?",1592867747,11,1

PlanB the creator of said model has made it clear that if the price where to ever hit those projections, they would go dark. 

    The state of the world that they outline along with the infamous BTC time traveller post suggests something quite bleak.

    Not to say that this will ever actually come to be. Although,  I can‚Äôt help but think with the current state of our world we could be heading right towards this. The FED printing trillions of dollars, unemployment at an all time high, a stock market that defies all logic, mass protests and riots, a corrupt administration fighting for reelection, and not to mention a pandemic and the potential for a second wave. This has the perfect storm written all over it, and seems likely that the US dollar will not fare well over the coming years. 

      So my question is what does it mean to go ‚Äúdark‚Äù. How can we secure our stash when/if we become targets of our own government and ordered to hand over our bitcoins? Assume the damage has already been done and the gov knows who holds BTC and exactly how much. It happened with gold and it could happen again. What steps should we be taking today to remain as secure as possible for all worst case outcomes?

I was looking for a way to give to a friend of mine some bitcoin to try it out and to introduce him to this crypto-world. I ended up finding paper wallets, vouchers, opendime, and sent-by-email gifts.

But nothing felt like I'm giving something that will surprise and/or have a decent ""unpacking experience"". And most importantly, nothing that would have a physical value to my friend.

Fast forward two months...I ended up creating my own gift. And I would like to share it with you guys. Not sure if it ends up being my long-term business.

I've designed a luxury package that includes a physical coin, and two metal gift cards that contain a recipient's private key and address. And hopefully will have a great luxury feel to it in the eyes of a recipient.

I had to order a larger number of hand-made boxes for the manufacturer to make them for me at all. Oh, by the way, hand-made premium boxes are expensive as hell xD

If you happened to be interested, I created [coinee.store](https://coinee.store) to help me sell those quantities of boxes :-)

I would be more than happy to get some feedback. What do you think of this, guys?

&gt;As if on cue, from 2009 to 2012, 2013 to 2016, and 2017 to 2020, bitcoin rose to its peak, falls down hard, recovered roughly to the mid-point of the previous peak before the next halving event and then rose to its next peak.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here is a quantitative summary of the key figures:  
&gt;  
&gt;Peak 1 at $32 and halving (2012) at $12.5, or 39% of prior peak.  
&gt;  
&gt;Peak 2 at $1,179 and halving (2016) at $665, or 56.5% of prior peak.  
&gt;  
&gt;Peak 3 at $19,764 and halving (2020) at $8,977, or 45.5% of prior peak.  
&gt;  
&gt;Taking a closer look at these figures highlights another trend few others have noticed.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ratio of Peak 1 to Peak 0 (50 cents in 2010) is 32/0.5 = 64.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ratio of Peak 2 to Peak 1 is 1,178/32 = 36.81.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ratio of Peak 3 to Peak 2 is 19,764/1,178 = 16.77.  
&gt;  
&gt;Each new ratio is roughly one half of the previous one. This implies  the next peak for bitcoin could be 19,764 times 8, or $158,112.",1592512713,90,3

Then of course because Bitcoin is increasing in value, it creates a situation where your money makes money by simply doing nothing, which is a recipe for large scale halts on investment and for rich people getting even more rich by doing no economic activity.

So I guess my question is, since everybody I‚Äôve ever had a discussion with understands these points to be fact, why do people see bitcoin as the future of currency?

""Most research suggests that QE helped to keep economic growth stronger, wages higher, and unemployment lower than they would otherwise have been.

As well as bonds, it increases the prices of things like shares and property.

Here is an example: A project for a bitcoin city, where if you hold at least 1 bitcoin, you get citizenship. If your net worth drops below 1 btc, you lose citizenship and get evicted from the citadel. Its a dumb example, but it illustrates the different approach. In our citadel project, we are adding direct utility to bitcoin that is beyond its immediate tangible value as money. 

What are your thoughts on this? Instead of creating an ecosystem of shitcoins like ethereum has done, this approach unified all additional value and functionality into one single coin. the bitcoin. I would love to hear your thoughts and brainstorms.",1592588832,2,0

&gt;No advanced math or computation is involved. You may have heard that miners are solving difficult mathematical problems‚Äîthat's not exactly true. What they're actually doing is trying to be the first miner to come up with a 64-digit hexadecimal number (a ""hash"") that is less than or equal to the target hash.

What I don't understand is, who sets the target hash that is to be mined? Is it generated automatically?

I've looked at many different articles but none of them actually describe what mining actually is. They just gloss over the whole process and leave large chunks of knowledge to the imagination.

Even this [article](http://www.righto.com/2014/02/bitcoin-mining-hard-way-algorithms.html) that goes into a little bit of depth, never mentions the origin of the target hash. Where does it come from?

But if KYC is not required for transactions under $10k and AML is required for all transactions how do they get away with not having to do this under the $500? Also if they do not initially get your license and verification how can they know if you ever spend more than $500 with them? Couldn't you technically just keep buying $499.99 dollars worth over and over and over? There was a guy who made a post earlier about how he had been buying over and over from an ATM over time and finally reached the $10k mark to require KYC.

hf3q2g,Saylaz,Just finished setting up my RaspiBlitz lightning node,"Hi everyone,

I just recently put together my BTC lightning node on Raspiblitz. I followed [this guide](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz) to set it up.

I got all the same parts, except for the Rpi4 case. I'm using [this case](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07WZXPR2W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) which acts as a heat sink and I added some additional [thermal pads](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00UYTTDO6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). While keeping it on the desk it was running at around 40-45*¬∞*C (the case gets pretty warm). After I mounted it onto an aluminum shoe cabinet its now running at a cool 36-38*¬∞*C.

I copied the blockchain from another PC via LAN cable, which took around half a day. Everything seems to be working fine so far, now I just have to play around a bit and open a few channels. Can anyone give me any tips on channel opening? How to find good nodes to connect to and how many funds should I be putting in there? Also, what‚Äôs the risk of losing funds in case of an unexpected power loss/hardware failure?

hf34tg,i_can_guess_your_age,BTC induced cognitive dissonance,"The first time I heard about bitcoin I didn‚Äôt think much of it; I probably thought it was PayPal‚Äôs latest competitor. This was around 2015 when I was still in college. I stumbled on bitcoin again in mid-2019 and decided to look into it a little more. I‚Äôve been hooked since. From coinbase to cashapp to kraken to a hardware wallet and weekly buys, I think I‚Äôm officially a hodler. I think BTC‚Äôs value will increase in the near and distant futures, as technologies facilitate the use of BTC and more companies accept BTC as a form of payment.

I‚Äôm not all happy about being a hodler though. From what I‚Äôve researched and understand about BTC, inflation, and market crashes, I‚Äôve gotten some weird ideas of what might happen in X number of years. Best way I can explain it:

Entire world: \*relying on USD in some way while understanding that inflation is bad\*

USA: \*printing money as fast as they can make new printing money machines\*

USD: \*crashes\*

Entire world: \*surprised pikachu face\*

Something tells me the partial or complete transition of economies, in other countries and in the US, away from the USD won‚Äôt be pretty. I‚Äôm afraid of what non-BTC owning Americans and non-Americans who rely heavily on the USD will have to go through during this change. Ideally, I hope for a somewhat smooth transition from USD to BTC around the world. I hope the USD doesn‚Äôt crash because it is obvious middle and lower-class people will be the ones stuck paying the price when their USDs can‚Äôt afford them necessities.

I don‚Äôt know how politicians do it knowing they‚Äôre messing with the livelihoods and ability of people to feed their families. Maybe because they think they‚Äôre taking a little bit from a lot of people it makes them feel less bad about themselves (They probably wish they could take a lot from everyone).

TL;DR: hodler happy while hoping (waiting) for BTC to moon but sad thinking people around world and in US will face hardship during a possible transition away from the USD.",1593012924,6,2

hfo4ms,economicsdesign,Bitcoin and International Monetary System,"Why Bitcoin will never be an international currency?

Short answer: because its automated monetary policy does not have a nominal anchor and thus does not strive for price nor financial stability.

Long answer: looking at the various International Monetary Order that the world has experienced since 1897, there were lots of failures. But the key lesson is that we need a nominal anchor (1 country or asset like gold to do that) as a way to stabilise financial markets.

We did that with gold and then with USD. Worked well, but it wasn't all rainbow and butterflies. It failed somewhere down the line.

In today's world, we have BTC, or call it Digital Gold. Could it help us to teleport back to 1897 and use Bitcoin to back our money? No.

Why? (1) issue with monetary base expansion, (2) lack of price stability

Conclusion: it will always exist as a p2p currency, as it was designed to do. But at an international trade level, not a chance

In any of those completely normal circumstances you are allowed to register to vote, you have access to unlimited 4G internet, you can even buy a car. Yet you cannot open a fucking bank account.

The most fundamental and important thing of all and you are not allowed to do it, all because banks have decided that to have the luxury of opening a bank account you need to rent a home on yearly contracts or have a mortgage.

You can show them your passport, give them your phone number, tell them where your staying, tell them where all your money is coming from, and even make a fucking movie of yourself saying some stupid words they asked you to say. Yet they will deny you a bank account just because you don't have a permanent address where you pay rent and utility bills. That is the definition of discrimination and it should be fucking illegal.

Go to a website. Fill in a simple form. Pay in BTC for some fees plus top-up the pre-paid balance. Get an email with the virtual card details (number, expiry date, CVV2, etc). Shop online as I desire as if I am using a ""real"" card.

Here is what I don't want to do:

Use an app (I might be OK with this). Provide identification. Have a card posted to me.

gvwk4p,Pantamis,How-to: setup your multisignature Cold wallet in Bitcoin Core 0.20 (highest security setup),"Last release of Core is amazing !

The main new feature is `sortedmulti` descriptor. This allows you to import your multisig setup in Core almost as if it was Electrum when combine to the new PSBT export in GUI !

As it needs command line and some weird checksum, you also need to input very long command in the console and if you made a mistake, you cannot copy the last command you made. So take your time when the commands are long to check everything and don't miss anything, use copy paste before validating the long command. You only have to do this once fortunately :)

I detail here how you do it with a `k` of `n` setup, good luck:

* Use [HWI](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI) to get the `n` xpub and fingerprint of all your hardware wallets signers (basically, you will do some command like `./hwi enumerate` to get the fingerprint `fffffff` and `./hwi -f fffffff getxpub derivation_path`  for each of the hardware wallets used in the multisig setup, for air-gapped ones you normally have native way to get xpub). If you use other tools, remember it must be xpub formated, not Zpub or Ypub (which may represent the same key but very differently, use [https://jlopp.github.io/xpub-converter/](https://jlopp.github.io/xpub-converter/) at your own risk if you don't want to use HWI).
* Create a blank wallet in Core console (or cli) with `createwallet ""Name_wallet"" true true`, the private key are also disabled. Load this wallet in command line of QT (you must select `Name_wallet` in Qt at the top of command line, or load it with `loadwallet`). All command must be run with this wallet loaded (don't load another one in between ....)
* Let details the descriptors we can use. For a P2SH (legacy) multisig setup it looks like `sh(sortedmulti(k,...))`, for a P2WSH (native segwit) setup `wsh(sortedmulti(k,...))`, and for a P2SH-P2WSH (segwit) `sh(wsh(sortedmulti(k,...)))` because we all want to spare fees, I will take P2WSH for what happens next but you know how to get other addresses type. Our descriptors will look like `wsh(sortedmulti(k,[path1]xpub1.../0/*,[path2]xpub2.../0/*,...,[pathn]xpubn/0/*))` for receiving addresses and `wsh(sortedmulti(k,[path1]xpub1.../1/*,[path2]xpub2.../1/*,...,[pathn]xpubn/1/*))` for change. `pathm` is the derivation path of the `m`th xpub of our setup (order of xpub doesn't matter). But be careful: for a derivation path like `m/44'/0'/0'/312` you must write `path` as `fffffff/44h/0h/0h/312` where `fffffff` is the fingerpring of the xpub `k` given by HWI and `h` replace `'` (else it is harder to input in command-line, you need to input `\'` instead of `'` each time)
* We need to get the checksum of the descriptors we use. We call `getdescriptorinfo ""wsh(sortedmulti(k,[path1]xpub1.../0/*,[path2]xpub2.../0/*,...,[pathn]xpubn/0/*))""` and `getdescriptorinfo ""wsh(sortedmulti(k,[path1]xpub1.../1/*,[path2]xpub2.../1/*,...,[pathn]xpubn/1/*))""`. In the two cases, the result is a JSON with a new descriptor (we don't care of it) and a field like so  `""checksum"": ""nefdbkdf""`. This second string is what we want, we name `checksum0` and `checksum1` the checksum results of the two calls.
* We import the 2000 first receiving addresses with `importmulti '[{""desc"": ""wsh(sortedmulti(k,[path1]xpub1.../0/*,[path2]xpub2.../0/*,...,[pathn]xpubn/0/*))#check_sum0"", ""timestamp"": birth_timestamp, ""range"": [0,2000], ""watchonly"": true, ""keypool"": true}]'` . You recognize the same first descriptor and we append `checksum0` to it with a `#` . If you didn't use this wallet setup before (in Electrum ...), set `birth_timestamp` to `""now""` else input a timestamp close to the first time you used the wallet to avoid a full rescan (if you don't remember, delete it from the call and enjoy a coffee during full rescans)
* We import the 2000 first change addresses with `importmulti '[{""desc"": ""wsh(sortedmulti(k,[path1]xpub1.../1/*,[path2]xpub2.../1/*,...,[pathn]xpubn/1/*))#check_sum1"", ""timestamp"": birth_timestamp, ""range"": [0,2000], ""watchonly"": true, ""internal"": true}]'`. Notice that `keypool` is not set, so it is set to false: the keypool is needed to show you receiving addresses one by one to avoid addresses reuse. For change addresses, we need to set `internal` to true so that they are added to the outputs as change automatically.

And you are DONE ! You should get the exact same addresses than Electrum and you can created receiving addresses in Qt ! To send money, just go to the send section, use the new coin control feature and export a partially signed transaction. You can use HWI or Electrum to sign it with your hardware wallets !

Notice: You can import more or less than 2000 addresses of each type. If less, blockchain rescan is faster but you may need to redo what we have done here later when all addresses will have been used once. If more, it is the contrary.

&amp;#x200B;

You now have the most possibly secure setup in one software: multisig with hardware on the full node wallet. When Bitcoin Core 0.21.0 will be out, we will also have native descriptor wallet so maybe we will have HD version of this. But for now, this is the best you can do ! Enjoy :)",1591199890,21,5

h0kh8e,Reinmaker,How to Explain Bitcoin: 3 Tips to Have Better Bitcoin Conversations,"  

BTC Friends,

Let‚Äôs be honest, Bitcoin is confusing. Not to you (you are on this /r/ after all), but to the people who have no idea what it is. Trying to explain Bitcoin is even harder. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve all had those long, complicated, drawn-out conversations which leave people more confused than when it started. 

To aid its adoption **WE HAVE TO GET BETTER AT EXPLAINING WHAT BITCOIN IS.** 

Here are a few tips that should, hopefully, help you manage a simple and easy to understand discussion about Bitcoin. 

Before we get to that, a few things to remember:

**Bitcoin is a** ***fundamental*** **change from what most people believe.** An explanation about Bitcoin shouldn‚Äôt be about ‚Äúbeing right‚Äù or ‚Äúwinning the argument.‚Äù Instead, it should be about helping someone explore a new idea and begin to understand that there are actually different alternatives to the only ‚Äúmoney‚Äù they‚Äôve ever known.

**Bitcoin is complicated.** It‚Äôs important to remember that this is as much of an emotion transformation for someone as it is a logical one. A CONFUSED MIND ALWAYS SAYS NO. If you leave a person confused or frustrated about what Bitcoin is, they are more likely to build up a resistance to it and become close-minded because ‚Äúit‚Äôs just too complicated.‚Äù

**Adoption is a marathon, not a sprint.** Don‚Äôt feel the need to word vomit all of your intense 1337 cypto-knowledge in a single conversation. Slow and steady. Like a good story-teller, keep them wanting more. 

Now, some tips to consider:

**1. Start with ‚ÄòWHAT is Bitcoin?,‚Äô not ‚ÄòWHY is Bitcoin?‚Äô**

A fundamental mistake that people make is to try to justify WHY something exists before even explaining WHAT something is. Your explanations need to act as a building blocks of knowledge which means you have to have a very clear, very easily understood, fundamental premise:

*Bitcoin is‚Ä¶:*

*Digital coins that exist on the internet that you can spend and save just like the paper money in your wallet.* 

*An alternative form of money than what you are given by your local government.* 

That's it. That's Bitcoin. While I‚Äôm sure we can, and probably will, argue about what that base, fundamental definition is, it‚Äôs important to start with WHAT, not WHY. 

While hyperinflation, store of value, scarcity, the Federal Reserve, and how the printing of fiat devalues currency are all important, it does not answer the question of WHAT is Bitcoin. If you start with WHY, you are skipping a major building block in the mind of the listener and are on your way to creating confusion. And remember, a confused mind always says no!

Here is an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7l4A5DSYas). (Now, don‚Äôt go full-internet on me. I‚Äôm not degrading this person or this video THANK YOU PERSON FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO. This video is awesome! I only bring it up because it is a recent video that got some attention. It also demonstrates this point.)

When asked to explain Bitcoin, here is the opening line:

‚ÄúThe FED‚Ä¶is out of control with printing money‚Ä¶‚Äù

This is a ‚ÄòWHY is Bitcoin‚Äô response. Already, the listener is probably thinking, ‚Äòwhat the heck does the FED have to do with anything? I just wanted to know what Bitcoin was‚Ä¶‚Äô and you may just lose your listener right there. 

Furthermore, this video never actually says ‚ÄúBitcoin IS‚Ä¶‚Äù While there is an implied comparison to gold, there is never a fundamental definition of WHAT Bitcoin is. 

Start with a clear, concise definition of WHAT Bitcoin is before moving on to WHY Bitcoin is. 

**2. Let Them Lead / Gauge Their Interest / Know When To Stop**

When explaining any topic to someone who doesn‚Äôt understand it, there is a very strong temptation to TELL everything you know. This is human nature. We are proud of what we know. We want to display knowledge and proficiency. We must, however, understand that it is counter-productive to the learning process. Imagine that certain math teacher going over that certain math problem. They explain it. They are enthusiastic about it. They write it on the chalkboard. Yet your eyes glaze over. It‚Äôs too much too fast. You are just waiting until the end when they finally tell you the answer. All logic and reasoning and understanding is gone. This is similar. 

Instead of telling them everything you know, **LET THEM ASK!** Allowing your listener to ASK demonstrates two things: an *understanding* of the last thing you said and, more importantly, *interest!* Ultimately, that‚Äôs what we want and need; their interest.

Believe me, just like that little kid asking, ‚Äòwhy, why, why‚Ä¶?‚Äô They will give you every opportunity to share a little bit more, and a little bit more.

For example:

Bitcoiner ‚Äì ‚Äú*Bitcoin are digital coins that exist on the internet that you can spend and save just like the paper money in your wallet.‚Äù* 

(STOP TALKING AND LEAVE SPACE FOR THEM TO ASK!!!)

Noob ‚Äì *‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ok‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶why do we need that? What's wrong with the money I have now?‚Äù*

Bitcoiner ‚Äì *‚ÄúWell, there is a risk that, over time, the money that you keep in your wallet or bank account will actually be worth less and be able to buy less stuff.‚Äù*

(STOP TALKING AND LEAVE SPACE FOR THEM TO ASK!!!)

Noob ‚Äì *‚ÄúWait, what do you mean?‚Äù*

And we are now on our way to a discussion about these messy and intense concepts of inflation vs deflation, printing of fiat currency, fractional reserve lending, etc. And through it all, **LET THEM LEAD**. 

Now this is the tough part. If their eyes glaze over, **YOU HAVE TO STOP!** When the questions stop, **YOU HAVE TO STOP!** The last thing you want to do is ramble on once they‚Äôve stopped listening. Instead, ASK them a question:

‚Äú*I‚Äôm sorry, did you not understand something I said?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDid I answer your question?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúIs this interesting to you?‚Äù*

By doing this, you will give them an opportunity to ASK you another question: *‚Äú‚Ä¶back up‚Ä¶what did you mean when you said ‚Äòstore of value‚Äô?‚Äù*

Or maybe even make a comment: *‚Äú‚Ä¶wow‚Ä¶this stuff is pretty complicated‚Ä¶‚Äù*

In either case, this actually helps keep the conversation going. Just back up, explain it again, keeping in mind your base concepts and definitions, and see if you can talk them past where they got stuck. 

Maybe they shut you down entirely: *‚Äúyou know what, this is crazy, it can‚Äôt be true, let‚Äôs change the subject‚Ä¶‚Äù* To which the ONLY correct response is, *‚ÄúOk!‚Äù* (we‚Äôll get to this later). 

Keep in mind that letting your listener lead will allow you to carry the conversation much further than you trying to push it along on your own. 

**3. Know Your Role / A Little at a Time / Don‚Äôt Overcorrect** 

So, what‚Äôs the end goal? Is it to have them whip out their phone, download an exchange, and make their first Bitcoin purchase right then and there?! No, of course not. 

The role of these conversations is to **LEAVE THEM WANTING MORE.** Your goal should be to spark *interest* and *curiosity*. If after talking with you they end up on The Google or The YouTube looking for more information, then *you‚Äôve done your part!* 

Movies and TV condition us to want the big payoff at the end: the parade, the teary embrace, the triumphant symphony. That is not real life. Really, the best ending to a Bitcoin conversation might just be your listener making an audible, but clearly deeply contemplative, ‚Äú‚Ä¶huh‚Ä¶‚Äù. You‚Äôve done your job. You‚Äôve got them noodling something they have never noodled before. 

Even once you understand Bitcoin, there is still an entirely different conversation about what the technology is, how it works, and how people interact with it. And let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs complex and confusing. Exchanges, blockchain, forks, difficulty adjustments, miners, cold storage‚Ä¶ More complicated ideas. More jargon. Make sure you throttle yourself back and explain just **A LITTLE AT A TIME.** It‚Äôs ok to have one conversation about the fundamentals of Bitcoin and then an entirely different conversation about blockchain technology or how people acquire BTC or the difference between storing Bitcoin on an exchange versus a cold wallet. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of thinking you have to tackle all of this at once.

While all this is happening, **BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERCORRECT.** People know what they know, right? And what people know is always correct, right?? Be sensitive. If your listener makes a comment that isn‚Äôt true or is off track, don‚Äôt scold them or forcefully correct them. **If your listener feels attacked or threatened, conflict will arise, and once that happens, their minds will be completely shut off.** No one listens during an argument. Don‚Äôt attack. Explain.

For example:

Noob ‚Äì *‚ÄúWell, the USD is backed by gold, so that will prevent it from ever devaluing!‚Äù*

Bitcoiner ‚Äì *‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs pretty interesting, a lot of people think the same thing. The truth is that while the USD was backed by gold for a long period of time, it isn‚Äôt anymore. You see, back in 1971‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Keep it simple, factual, and non-confrontational.

Going back to our example from before, even if your listener shuts you down entirely, **THAT‚ÄôS OK!** They have now experienced a Bitcoin conversation that will percolate around in their brain. And perhaps next time they hear the word Bitcoin, whether on the news or on the internet, they‚Äôll think back to your conversation and what you shared with them. Hopefully you didn‚Äôt over-press and their memory of your conversation isn't a negative one which leaves them feeling negative about Bitcoin: *‚ÄúBitcoin is stupid and people who believe in Bitcoin are arrogant and rude.‚Äù*

Finally, **ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO THEIR OWN RESEARCH.** The journey doesn‚Äôt start and end with you. You are simply a stepping stone along their path. Know that you are playing a part in their story; you are not the main character. 

Adoption of Bitcoin will occur over a long period of time. The conversations we have with our friends and family will create the buzz, attention, and understanding that is needed, but please be mindful that you are doing it in a helpful and productive way that leaves people wanting to know more.

Found out today that the real reason is that someone with a sledgehammer broke into 14 different machines in the vape shops after smashing the windows.  Apparently it was successful for the thieves.  But now I have to wait until new ones get out in to convert cash.  Not a big deal but I prefer that method.  

All machines were owned by Coinflip.  Which has the best fees it seems.  Tried going to ‚ÄúLiberty‚Äù locations but those ATMs only allow you to buy BTC by card at god awful rates.",1591715607,16,0

h9kv5x,JARV-PT,Getting into Bitcoin,"Good afternoon people of reddit.

After being interested in Bitcoin for a few months and making my research around I have found a lot of good stuff about Bitcoin and I would love to get started.
The one thing that I can‚Äôt  is exactly what prevents me from starting.

What are the best wallets and why are there different ones? 
Where do I buy bitcoin? 
Is mining even viable right now? 
How do I get started?",1592242517,12,0
h9ks8d,Renegade_Mormon,Bitcoin Trust for Parents Retirement?,"Hey Gang,

I did some googling and I cant seem to find the best answer, if there is a better subreddit for this please let me know.

Im looking to create a ""trust fund"" of sorts with bitcoin for my parents and my fiancee's parents as well. Both are not the best savers and we figured handing over some bitcoin when they turn 65 in ten years or so would be a big benefit. The contributions are not going to be large. Maybe 100$ maximum per sibling a month.

We would like to invite the siblings of each family to contribute to the fund by purchasing Bitcoin each month and sending it to an Bitcoin Address.  I was thinking a hardware wallet and a metal seed in separate safety deposit boxes but I have a couple of questions.

How do I ensure that if bitcoin moons a substantial amount that non of the siblings will attempt to lay claim to their bitcoin they added to the address? 

If I control the fund/keys to the deposit box how do I reassure them that I wont take the bitcoin for myself?

Is there some sort of legal document that needs to be written up to provide assurances? What would that document be if it exists? Is there a wallet trust method that I don't know about? Some sort of smart contract?",1592242261,10,3

h9kh37,RandomUserBob,Finally my offline BTC tx signing platform is complete,"ok, it's over-engineered (like everything i do) but it's fully air-gapped and has everything i need for signing tx's between electrum (on this and networked PC), including 2 trezor 's' (same seeds, just incase one fails) and a dedicated usb drive for tx transfer (which i refer to as the ""red drive"").

&amp;#x200B;

yes, i know if i'm using just the HW wallet i dont really need air-gapped working, but i always learn on the side of paranoia, so dedicated air-gapped PC with hardware wallets was the only way to go for me. thought i'd share the eye-porn as imho the end result came out pretty good.

The only entity that can allow you to print dollars is the FED, so stop talking and looking for solutions to get more dollars, while the government is looking for solutions try to get this as a solution they can start mining Bitcoin and slowly opt-out from the current system with fewer casualties.

Hopefully, this post reach many Lebanese as possible, the situation is critical and the government is freaking out without any solution either they let people die by hyperinflation or they beg for mercy from the US.

A couple of changes you need to know about

Hey,

Just letting you know about two changes to our cryptocurrency terms and conditions ‚Äì here‚Äôs the scoop.

**What‚Äôs changed?**

* From the 27th of July 2020, you will no longer be able to make card payments using cryptocurrency. So if you only have cryptocurrency in your Revolut account, we won‚Äôt automatically convert it and make a payment. Instead, the transaction will be declined.
* Currently, Revolut is the legal owner of the cryptocurrency you purchase, and we provide you ‚Äòexposure‚Äô to the price movements. However, from 27th of July 2020, you will own the rights to the financial value of the cryptocurrency. This essentially means that you will now own any cryptocurrency you buy using Revolut!
* Revolut will act as an appointed agent, and will hold your cryptocurrencies and transact on your behalf.

**Will this change how I buy cryptocurrency?**

Nope! These changes won‚Äôt affect your experience - buying and selling cryptocurrency will still be as easy as ever on Revolut. In fact, this change means we can start adding some cool new features... watch this space!

You can find all the details of our new T&amp;Cs here.

Thanks for choosing Revolut to handle your cryptocurrencies. We‚Äôll be back in touch soon!

h9it58,ggabriel8,Stonks Only Go Up," In a dark room, deep in the bowels of the White House, a man wearing a worn and stained gray robe hefts his body against an enormous crank. Attached to the crank is a huge printer and with each rotation, sheets of uncut dollar bills spew onto the hard concrete floor. Sweat glistens on his face as a low brr fills the room.

The only light in the room emanates from a large flat screen. A dark silhouette of a man standing in front of it staring intently at the flashing headlines reading ‚ÄúRecord Unemployment‚Äù and ‚ÄúStock Market Collapse‚Äù. The red Fox News logo appears in the corner of the screen.

The man on the crank stops for a moment and wipes his brow. With his back hunches and eyes glued to the floor, he shuffles over to the shrouded individual.

The hunched servant stands behind the figure and stammers ‚ÄúMy lord‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, my loyal J Pow.‚Äù says the silhouette, still watching the images flash on the screen.

‚ÄúShall we increase the printing?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy dear J Pow, we will increase the levels but we must wait until the perfect moment.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut my lord‚Ä¶ the congressional tenides are suffering. They will be furious in the senate.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt question my foresight! I alerted the chiefs months ago about the situation at hand. Their tendies are secure.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut my lord‚Ä¶ My personal account is obliterated‚Ä¶ How will I be able to feed my family?‚Äù

‚ÄúSilence J Pow! You must trust my generosity. You will receive max tendies for your loyal service.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes my lord‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sharp knock on the door is heard.

J Pow shuffles to the door and opens it a sliver. The yellow light from the hall spills into the dark basement.

‚ÄúGeneral Mnuchin here to to see you, my lord.‚Äù

‚ÄúSend him in.‚Äù

General Mnuchin marches into the room. His uniform is decorated with many medals and a red cape flows behind him. He kneels behind The Lord, who‚Äôs back is still turned towards the screen.

‚ÄúWhat do you have to report General?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe rebels are growing stronger my lord. Our attempts to quell them are backfiring. Their forces are growing stronger with each passing da-‚Äù

Suddenly, the shrouded man turns around from the tv screen and flicks out his hand. The general grabs his neck as he is slowly lifted into the air by an invisible chokehold.

‚ÄúGeneral, might I remind you that it is your duty to keep the population in check.‚Äù

‚Äúeee.. I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶. breath..‚Äù says the General tugging at the invisible hand around his neck.

The screen changes to a clip of a masked protester giving a speech to a rabble crowd.

‚ÄúExit the system. Buy Bitcoin.‚Äù says the masked man into a megaphone

Although he is shrouded, a deep anger is felt engulfing The Darklord‚Äôs aura. He squeezes his hand further, tightening the grip on Mnuchin‚Äôs neck.

‚ÄúThat reminds me. What do you have to report about Dr. Satoshi whereabouts?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶. is‚Ä¶. anonymous..‚Äù says Mnuchin struggling to breath

The Lord releases his hand and the general falls into a heap on the floor.

‚ÄúBitcoin is a threat to our sovereignty, General. We must shut it down. Inform your colleagues at Goldman to trash the coin publicly but continue to accumulate via dark pools. Flood the market with shitcoins to confuse the retail investors. As long as Bitcoin‚Äôs true potential is hidden from the population, we can proceed with our plans‚Ä¶ There can only be one true money Mnuchin and that is the money we brrr right here in this very basement.‚Äù

The general lies motionless on the floor and does not respond.

‚ÄúI believed we could pacify the masses with $1,200 and a note signed by your truly but clearly we need more. J Pow, The moment is nigh! 100x the power! Flood Wall St. Bets with unlimited tendies. We need their DD to encourage the population to FOMO into the market.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy liege‚Ä¶. you will lay waste to this great empire. It‚Äôs best to incrementally increase the supply to remain undetected! Unlimited QE will cause more unrest!‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need your opinion and I don‚Äôt need you!‚Äù

The dark lord stretches out his hand and a blue energy pulse from his fingertips. The crank of the printer starts to turn slowly at first but within seconds, it starts to spin violently, threatening to detach from the printer itself. The brr turns from a low purr into a load roar. Dollar bills fly out at frighting speeds.

A green message flashes on the TV screen ‚Äúbest day in stock market history since 1984.‚Äù

With his hand outstretched, a cracked smile on his face, and dollar bills flying around the room like confetti, the dark lord mutters to himself ‚Äústonks only go up.‚Äù",1592235911,7,0
