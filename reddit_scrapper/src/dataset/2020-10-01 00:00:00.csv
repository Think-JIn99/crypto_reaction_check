j6b5y8,mabezard,Most popular phone wallets,"I'm a 2011 btc veteran. As such, I find myself using tools that become outdated and don't keep up with what's new anymore. You get set in your ways. I've used mycelium as a phone wallet for what seems like forever. It used to be simple and sleek. There were development plans for some interesting tools that never came to be. I just looked in the app for the first time in a while and it's become bloated with spammy media feeds and other sponsors that reek of desperation. If i were to recommend something that looks like a malware infected early 2000s webpage to a friend, it's got all the bells and whistles to drive them away. It's finally the sad time to dump mycelium and take my spending keys elsewhere. (RIP crowdfunding coins donated long ago)

j6b3ix,Geekinaction,Help - Mom was Scammed,"My mom called me this morning in a panic. Her phone was stolen a few days back and the thief called her pretending to be the SSA (we have already reported this to the SSA). The thief asked her to withdraw her checking account funds and to deposit it at a nearby Bitcoin of America ATM. They didn't provide any information for her to enter so it was all her personal info.  After she deposited the money they asked her to send a picture of the receipts and the QR codes. At that point she finally realized something was fishy, refused to send the pictures and decided to go to the police to file a report. We have a fraud case number and we've contacted banks, bills, etc to ensure nothing else happens moving forward. The issue is that neither myself nor my mother know a single thing about bitcoin. I've already tried calling and emailing Bitcoin of America but haven't heard back. Is any way to get the money back or to recover a portion of it?

As we get closer to this, the price of Bitcoin will continue ever upward to new highs. Bitcoin to infinity.","I think it's a matter of time before Bitcoin is worth millions and then billions of dollars per BTC. I'm probably calling it 40-100 years ahead of time.

Weak hands will lose the long game in Bitcoin. Every time a weak seller sells, a deep holder will buy it up. Eventually Bitcoin winds up in the titanium hands of true Bitcoiners who will never sell. 

I think this is what Michael Saylor CEO of Microstrategy was thinking. Bitcoin is the perfect system for usurping value from all other forms of money. It's a financial virus in a way. 

Bitcoin rewards you based on how soon you figure this out. The sooner you buy the better. And Bitcoin will always be the best long term investment no matter when you buy it. Just be patient and never sell. 

Bitcoin is money. Just buy stuff with it when you want to take profit. You never need to sell Bitcoin.

  Is the price stabilization of Bitcoin something that most people want or are most people still looking for volatility.

j68a2a,samdane7777,Regulatory Dialogue (and complaints/protests),"Every once in a while I subject myself to reddit and try to post something on here. I think namely that one of the major issues is that reddit just doesn't have an advanced community. The lawyers and finance people are all on crypto twitter. But for the small handful of people who are business savvy here I will at least try to make a point in the interest of overall views and exposure.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically everything I chicken littled about on reddit last summer has come true. I made a lot of claims and told people that the Banking Secrecy Act and FATFA would be incredibly terrible. And the reality is I wasn't chicken littling. 

I understand the laws and am good at legal research. And all the crypto lawyers will say what I have said. We are largely fucked. Unless we really mass protest and complain at the CFTC and SEC and members of congress, we are going to get bent over a barrel. Wallstreet likes excluding retail, they don't want competition from 'the poors' let's be fucking real, they don't want retail involved because they are making too much money backdoor. It is they who are allowing this, and allowing the US citizen to be excluded from 95% of the crypto ecosystem and subjected to .5% fees on coinbase.

&amp;#x200B;

They are already laying the groundwork to go after DEFI developers all over the world extrajudicially and will. There is virtually nothing anyone can do to stop FATF and the DoJ persecuting anyone with an admin key to any smart contract ANY where in the world. They do not fucking care about borders or sovereignty. This is america, we drone strike weddings.

If you have a  business, if you are a trader, or any person educated and trained enough in legal and finance to have skin in the game and you aren;t just a reddit 12 year old person hurling insults because you don't have a penny to your name, you need, we need, to heavily heavily involve ourselves in regulator dialouge with the CFTC and SEC.

If non institutional entrepreneur and citizen in America do not start actively pressuring and speaking with the CFTC and SEC we are potentially going to be persona non grata in much of the world for crypto. Especially the CFTC. The obsession that retail has with the SEC is deeply misleading. It is the CFTC that has pushed most of the exclusion. Even if you do not trade derivatives, it will be cited as a reason for why you are being denied services, that is just the reality of the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

 Moreover, I still believe that they are going to create a parrallel system of white listed and black listed bitcoins, and backdoor wallets and hardware wallets with KYC in the 39 FATF member country. I believe that at least 50 to 70% of the BTC supply is going to be taken out of these FATF countries through blacklisting. They will simply stop letting you cash out non white listed coin with chain analysis proof of history on FATF/G20 countries. Monero won't work, your mixers won't work. If you don't have a chain of custody you will be flagged, and they won't let you withdraw to a ""wild"" wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

They'll find a way to make sure that if you live in those 40 to 50 countries that you will not be able to spend a fucking penny of anonymous crypto, unless it is all under the table between merchants, who of course will be thrown in pentitentiary for violating the BSA as a VASP.

Grown ass adults want to do business, this lowest common denominator shit on reddit and hodl and Defi pie in the sky catch me if you can john mcafee arthur hayes shit is coming to an end-- so either get with the program and get congress to pass things like the Security Clarity Act and Digital Commodity Exchange Act, or get left out and banned from everything. 

The rich in america get want they want. They will force this on the world and trade bitcoin on hedgefunds like treasury notes and default credit swaps between the rich without it ever seeing the light of day beyond coinbase, and it'll essentially be a speculative hedge for the mega wealthy, unless the public puts an extreme amount of pressure on US regulators. And frankly everyone outside of the US should put the pressure on US regulators, let's be fucking real people, US regulations on finance are GLOBAL regulations.",1602001958,0,1

hello dear people,

I am asking you for advice and would like to hear your honest opinion.

I have fallen for one of the bitcoin giveaway scam's that have been going on this year on twitter. To be specific, it was from a tweet by a fake Elon Musk account around march (not later where his original account got hacked)

**I sent the scammers 1 full bitcoin.**

I know I will most probably never see that bitcoin again and have found peace with that.

However, I am aware that there is a tiny tiny possibility that I get it back, in case the original scammers should get caught.

I would appreciate to hear what you think is the best I can do to increase the likelihood of me ever seeing my bitcoin again.

  
Thanks a lot.",1601997139,31,1

* Saves all keys locally (and therefore allows importing and exporting keys)
* No server-side signature as found on Edge, Copay, GreenAddress, or Blockstream Green
* Allows creation of multi-sig wallets, similar to what Copay iOS wallet does
* Open source and well maintained, with segwit support
* Good reputation (so no Bitpay/Copay)

j4i1q5,BussyFart1022,Why I think the Bitcoin boom will never happen,"I've recently been investing some of my spare cash and have about $1,200 left over. I want to invest in something medium-long term (don't sell for 2-6 years) and  all of my heart says Bitcoin. I love Bitcoin. It truly is an ingenious technology that would have the potential to change the world... if more people understood how it works.

I don't see Bitcoin skyrocketing in value within the near future, not because of the technology, but society's inability to grasp and trust said technology. The average citizen will never be able to wrap their head around the technology (which is fair, it's complicated), meaning they won't grow confident enough to invest in/use it over their native currency. Whenever I ask my friends and co workers (I'm an engineer) what they think bout Bitcoin, they always reply ""Well it's not real"", or ""You can't own it if you can't hold it"". They don't have confidence because it is not backed by anything AND its digital. At least our digital bank accounts are, in theory, backed by paper dollars. 

To me, it seems like Bitcoin has attracted the majority of users who are interested in investing. Yes newcomers will always come in and invest, but I don't think the huge anticipated Bitcoin boom of it being used by the masses will happen. Society is not ready to accept the technology, and by the time society is ready, the government will have their hands all over it with regulations, ruining our investments.

j4dyqw,financeoptimum,The Fed's Losing Battle with Technological Deflation,"**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**

First off, let's set the scene.

The stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.

Economic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.

The correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&amp;P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.

Why?

Well, it is the Central¬†Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.

In doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion in US history.

However, this is not a particularly¬†meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:

*‚ÄúThe central issue is we‚Äôre developing into a plutocracy. We‚Äôve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they‚Äôre rich because they‚Äôre smart and constructive.""*

The reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.

Now, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.

*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.

We are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.

In fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.

Inflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.

Deflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.

That's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.

Well, no.

If you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.

As the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt.¬†

This is why central banks fear deflation so much.

However, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...

**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**

The increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.

[Throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. This is *not* a new phenomenon.

All technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create ""supply side shocks"", meaning that they allow for more intensive¬†use of resources¬†and thus higher production. With more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall.¬†

In the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.

It is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: AI

According to Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder and CEO of The Blackstone Group who has a net worth of $17.6BN:

*""This is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology""*

Moreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [Zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idUKKBN21K1C7) of exactly this.

Old legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it.¬†

As an example, if you folded a piece of paper 51 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 51 times, it would reach the Sun!

**PART 3/4 - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY:**

The question is: how does this play out?

In the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, not¬†who is President for 4 to 8 years.

In reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. We have seen [what happens when a President doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91RZko5Gw)...

One could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:

1. Divide and Conquer and
2. [Order from Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx7PnMtCeY)

As we have seen many times in the past, herd psychology is [worryingly easy to manipulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M26-B44qQIs)...

Speaking of the censorship, in his book Antifragile, Nassim Taleb discusses the anti fragility of information.¬†

Information feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.

A fantastic example of this process is what has happened with London Real: they were banned on LinkedIn and David Icke's interview was censored. Now, regardless of what you think of this particular channel or your thoughts on David Icke and the theories provided, censoring information in this way *actually spreads it more virally*.

It's fascinating to observe how many views the videos regarding the bans and censorship have relative to the others. And the [impact this has had on subscribers](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/londonrealtv).

It is always easier to blame a bigger enemy (or create a new one) rather than to admit it's a structural problem.

Therefore, you avoid short term pain...whatever the cost.

The real question is [if and when this situation will lead to social unrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4GMUamUjT8)...

**PART 4/4 - INTELLECTUAL CAPITALISM:**

The depth and width of jobs impacted by AI will continue to increase in the future.

Now this will not necessarily happen straight away.

However, our transition from commodity capitalism to intellectual capitalism is inevitable and the people and nations who fight against this trend will be on the wrong side of history.

From a practical investment perspective, and disclaimer this is not investment advice, network effects are a crucial aspect to consider moving forwards.

Essentially, this means that the value of the network¬†increases with each additional user - all of the tech monopolies have exhibited this property.

An asset which could in time demonstrate very strong network effects is Bitcoin.

[Looking at the market cap relative to other asset classes](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/), Bitcoin provides an asymmetric investment opportunity.

Only time will tell...

The reason is that this person cannot hope to buy a glass of soda at a retail price and easily resell it later on at a similar price.

If a product has the characteristic of easy resale, regardless of what exactly it is, you will generally not be allowed to freely trade in it.

In that case, you must store a verified copy of the buyer or seller's identity and legal address. You must also thoroughly interrogate that person about the origin of his money.

Even if you do that, and meticulously archive the documentation, you will sooner or later still have to deal with accusations of money laundering. If you do not enjoy enough political protection, you will probably also end up incarcerated in prison for long periods of time.

It does not matter what exactly the product is.

The only thing that matters, is that it can easily resold. If a glass of soda had that characteristic, you would inevitably face criminal prosecution for trading in it.

During the war in Bosnia, a Marlboro cigarette was such product.

Bitcoin also happens to be such product.",1601703929,4,1
j49ryr,alive_consequence,Bitcoin has more intrinsic value than stocks,"A common argument thrown by traditional investors is that cryptocurrencies don't have an intrinsic value. The classical example is saying that Bitcoin is not as good as gold because you can build stuff with gold, while Bitcoin's only use is speculation, but I don't find this true at all.

First of all, you can use Bitcoin to pay fees to write into the most decentralized and robust database in history. That by itself has instrinsic value. And second but not less important, you can actually own Bitcoin easily. A lot of investors don't actually possess gold. They posses contracts that say that they own gold ‚Äúsomewhere‚Äù with no easy way or no way at all to redeem it. So you usually couldn't due anything with the gold you ‚Äúown‚Äù. You cannot melt it, forge it, or anything.

Same for stocks. They often are not under your name. Heck, sometimes there are not even stocks involved at all. You only have a contract that tracks that tracks the price of them. So, a lot of people can't do anything with their stocks other than trading them through intermediaries and during trading hours/days. You usually don't receive a dividend or have a way to vote on the company's direction. Unlike some cryptocurrencies that actually provide you with that and you can actually own by yourself, unlike the gold, stocks, or forex, you probably would never be able to withdrawn (only your balance in a specific asset, not in any other of the assets you allegedly possess).

Yesterday I tried to discuss this on investing, and I got a lot of backlash, with a lot of people missing the point, thinking that I was suggesting buying stocks based on the dividends they offer or something similar, with is far from what I'm saying. So I thought about starting the same discussion in this community to see if the argument lands better or I'm really missing something here.

Surprising that ordeal, we are here now. It seem as though BTC is being controlled by the FED &amp; other central banking. Thus, finally allowing people to hold BTC &amp; not allowing BTC to grow at all. Though I‚Äôm BULLISH on BTC.. it seems to me that BTC won‚Äôt be able to surpass $20k again. 

I hope that I‚Äôm really wrong about my BEARISH perception BC it seems as if the economy (DUE TO QE) is creating a good foundation for the growth of BTC.

Came across this list that displays the percentage of wallet addresses with different ranges of BTC.

I was surprised to see that only \~2% of addresses contain 1-10 BTC. Really puts it into perspective how early and ahead of the curve we are. 

This obviously doesn't account for BTC held on exchanges, but I would imagine majority of people with more than 1 BTC wouldn't be holding it on an exchange.

In other words, insolvency. A situation not seen since the Great Depression.","[Link to source articles screenshots this post elaborates on](https://imgur.com/gallery/9Ly5jwo)

The last time this happened where the US owed more than it was worth, people, companies, and governments moved their wealth into gold(bought gold) to protect themselves from hyper inflation since it was the best finite asset(limited in its amount) in that time. For those who don‚Äôt know what inflation is, it‚Äôs when there is a faster loss of value to the dollar, and what it can buy. Why everything is more expensive now than it was when you were a kid. 

That last time this happened was the Great Depression that most of us read about in school. This time around, the people and companies with the wealth are choosing to adopt the new gold it appears: ‚Çøitcoin.  Billions of Dollar$ are already pouring into Bitcoin, from companies with Trillions$ in managed assets that they need to protect. And with that now starting to move into Bitcoin, Bitcoin‚Äôs math limiting it to 21 million coins puts Bitcoin at well over 100k a coin by the time this momentum matures, and the trillions these companies manage move more into Bitcoin. Zoom in, and read the articles in this collage. They show companies managing Trillions of dollars already Buying Bitcoin. To hold for their clients, and customers, and even as treasury reserve asset for their own companies. 
That will only continue to grow. Eventually, we‚Äôll be hearing of Countries, Nations, State, and Cities beginning to buy Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. When that happens, the road map for millions of dollars per Bitcoin will begin to come to form.

If you haven‚Äôt been buying whatever you can this whole time, make sure you do before this next price run. Because after this one, you‚Äôll never see Bitcoin as low as the 10k‚Äôs $ per ‚Çøitcoin again. 

There is a digital change happening to the financial world, much like when the internet met the world of media and information. Better to hop on early now, than when the government starts buying Bitcoin for you much later for your 401ks. Because by then, the price will likely be Millions, to tens of millions per Bitcoin that they‚Äôll be buying it for you at.",1602274196,10,1

2nd Payment goes through after a 16~ hour delay

called my bank and they can't help me because 'OH WE CAN'T HELP YOU WITH INVESTMENT CLAIMS' which is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard but whatever

ja2hwt,OkCheerio,HELP: How can we get Bitcoin into Libya?,"TL;DR Libya is a cash-only society, where every merchant only deals in cash. There is no electronic banking system of debit cards, credit cards, or Interac machines -- just cash. But the banks ran out of cash. So, people can't buy anything because they can't access their funds because, remember, banks ran out of cash. Bitcoin would seem to solve every problem. How do we get Bitcoin into Libya?

Hey everyone,

First of all, full disclosure, I know very little about Bitcoin, or cryptocurrency in general, so as I make this post, please forgive any ignorance.

As a Libyan, we're seeing numerous challenges in our banking system in Libya (which, in all fairness, is just one of, many other, larger political issues if you happen to have been following Middle Eastern/Libyan news for the last decade).

The Central Bank of Libya has not had cash for an exceedingly long period of time, post 2011, which is problematic because Libya is a cash-only society. Every transaction, be it a house, or a loaf of bread, has always ever been transacted in cash only. While people do have bank accounts, with your account balance merely printed on paper, there has never been debit or credit cards in Libya. The only way one can access their funds from their bank account is by physically going to the bank and withdrawing cash. This is still the case today and, as you might have imagined, people have already long flooded the banks, and have depleted them of their reserves.

Consequently, the majority of Libyans have no access to their money in their accounts, and have only been at the mercy of when banks re-supply their reserves. In an attempt at maximizing the opportunity at every Libyan getting \*some\* cash, of course the bank imposes a depressingly low withdraw limit per person, who are all waiting in line-ups that are literally days long. Naturally, the bank's small reserve is instantaneously depleted, again and again, and if you were not of the lucky few to retrieve cash, then you go home with your tail between your legs and hope for a better next time.

The obvious solution to this would have been for the ""government"" to simply deploy an electronic system wherein Libya catches up to 21st century's earth-shattering technology: debit and credit cards, and Interac machines! Needless to say, this has not been done, yet, and we can very strongly assume that the ""government"" has no interest in doing this. I will not get into politics, or conspiracy here, but much of it leans in that direction. (Note: I put ""government"" in quotes because what I really mean is Libya doesn't exactly have a government, and the decision-makers are, essentially, foreign intelligence via domestic militia groups).

With all of that said, enter Bitcoin and my questions to the problems I wish to ask and wonder if Bitcoin solves:

(1) The first problem we have, of course, is that people are limited to cash to purchase food. However, if every merchant simply accepted Bitcoin, people can simply pay with their phones, without the need for cash. Everybody, and their grandmother, has a smartphone or two. Am I missing something here, or am I correct with the ease of use?

(2) The second problem we have is that nobody in Libya can be transferred money, from outside of Libya, even if Libyans had international friends and family willing to help them with money. But, with Bitcoin, you can simply transfer funds online with relative ease. Am I correct here, as well?

(3) I have no idea whether or not Bitcoin is currently available in Libya; furthermore, I have no idea whether or not Bitcoin is legal in Libya (and, frankly, if the aforementioned problems can be solved, nobody will care about its ""legality""). So, can Bitcoin be adopted in Libya, with relative ease, without necessitating the banking system or government? Or would this undertaking be a major project?

If possible, I would be very interested in working with anyone who can help make this a reality in all of Libya. I'm willing to do what's needed to be done (within my capabilities, of course), be it aggressive marketing/advertising, or otherwise. Thoughts, suggestions, help!

Thank you everyone for your help and for putting up with my rant. Cheers.",1602546950,50,1

j9zy6k,facepalm5000,"Don't trust, verify: Wrote a BTC transaction validation program to facilitate safe withdrawal protocol","I've created a transaction validation program to sanity check btc transactions before and after signing. Below is the description of the overall protocol for doing a btc withdrawal from a wallet. The program does validation for steps #2 and #4.  Step #2 is designed to validate that Electrum is not compromised and is not generating malicious transactions. #Step 4 is designed to validate that the HW wallet is not compromised and is not generating malicious transactions.

Part of what it does is to identify whether addresses involved in the transactions are yours or not yours, and whether they are receive or change addresses, based on a set of named xpub keys that you put into a local config file, to prevent change address attacks and other attacks, and to just ensure you didn't accidentally choose the wrong address.

The program does not touch any private keys, only hd wallet master pub keys (xpub, zpub)

Trust minimized withdrawal protocol:

\#1. Generate candidate transaction in Electrum watch-only wallet, save as PSBT.

**#2. Validator, unsigned tx. - load PSBT into Validator. Verify Tx details (inputs, outputs, addresses, fee, amounts). Identify wallet ownership of any addresses involved in the tx (e.g. to validate that the change address actually belongs to your wallet). Display sha256 of PSBT File contents. If all looks good, Validator will copy the PSBT to the SD for signing. This step protects against a compromised version of Electrum generating a malicious transaction, and ensures only validated transactions come in contact with signing device.**

\#3. HW wallet. Verify sha256 hashes of PSBT file from Validator and as generated on HW device to ensure this PSBT is the same as the PSBT validated in step #2. Verify tx details. If good, sign PSBT.  Take note of signed tx file sha256 hash.

**#4. Validator, signed tx. Verify signed tx file sha256 hash matches HW device to ensure data integrity in transit. Re-verify tx details (inputs, outputs, addresses, fee, amounts), to protect against a compromised HW wallet firmware generating malicious transactions. If validation looks ok, Validator will send tx bytes to full node for broadcasting.**

""What if this whole process were automated with cryoptographically-enforced trust, \[...\]. If the flight is on time, the smart contract pays itself.""

How will ""cryptographically-enforced trust"" be any different from what we currently have? Is not this problem more about to be able to automatically identify that in fact a flight delay occurred, rather than being able to trust that it occurred? I mean, if the flight is delayed, that is an undeniable fact that it is possible to handle with non-blockchain technology.

How would you see this problem being solved with blockchain?

Thanks in advance for your answer!

Recently they've launched phase 3 Krypton: proof-of-transfer (PoX) implementation on the Stacks 2.0 testnet which is huge thing because it makes possible to Stack Stacks (yeah, i know) STX tokens thus securing the Stacks blockchain (acting as a validator) and get BTC reward for that.

Most important is the new consensus mechanism [Proof-of-Transfer (PoX](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e7b1a27d160ce49af1c24e1/5f1596b12bcc0800f3dcadcd_pox.pdf)) leverages Bitcoin‚Äôs security to secure the Stacks blockchain, and combined with Clarity Smart contracts, PoX eliminates the choice between flexibility and security.

For those who interested more in project is suggest you to read this [article](https://blog.blockstack.org/krypton-launch-proof-of-transfer-now-implemented-on-the-stacks-2-0-testnet/) for better understanding.

All in all i am really excited about this mutually beneficial link between BTC and STX which leads to a whole new level of DeFi. Their testnet is on last stages and mainnet will soon be live (in a month as i recall), id really sugest you to follow this.",1602518001,0,1

Rule #2: You must live in one of these countries: Australia, New Zealand, UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Ireland, Malesia, or South Africa.

Exchanges these days should be called what they are: shitcoin casinos. Gemini, Coinbase, Binance, Bittrex, and all the others that sell pump and dump shitcoins, are our enemies. There‚Äôs no two ways around it. Coinbase is running Public Relations in full force to make it seem like they support bitcoin development when they want to provide grants for core developers. In reality, they could care less about the development as long as they get their bottom line, which is to pull in suckers.

Have you heard the phrase, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt know who the sucker in the room is, it‚Äôs you‚Äù? 

Well you are the sucker every single time if you are trying to trade bitcoin and shitcoins.

It‚Äôs time to support bitcoin only companies. That means buying ColdCard hardware wallets that have bitcoin only firmware. That means buying from River Financial (will be largest brokerage in the future), Swan Bitcoin (auto DCA with withdrawals only), CashApp, and Fold (bitcoin back on gift card purchases). Anything less is you not supporting bitcoin adoption. 

I‚Äôd like to circle back to the point of this post: what Jack Maller‚Äôs Strike App has done is make exchanges completely irrelevant. Gone are the insane and wack percentage fees that cause you to miss out on hodling even more precious sats.

Your bank checking account now literally speaks bitcoin. It‚Äôs not just a lightning network based app that allows you to pay only lightning network invoices.

You can also just pay for the on-chain transaction fee to your legacy address (1), segwit address (3), or native segwit bech 32 address (bc1). 

So when you plan to stack sats in the United States, I highly recommend you skip the outrageous fees and send bitcoin instantaneously to your ColdCard or whatever hardware wallet you own with ease. 

Simply deposit the money within the Strike App from your bank checking account, and paste or scan your bitcoin address. Clarify the amount to you want to send and tap confirm. I can‚Äôt stress this enough - the ONLY fee associated with the purchase is the on-chain transaction fee.

I hope this post gets more traction and that word spreads to keep people from getting suckered.",1603069848,13,1

jdri1c,facepalm5000,How to perform strong verification of multisig receive addresses and limit trust in software wallets?,"Example scenario: you've set up a 2-of-3 multisig watch only wallet in Electrum or some other desktop wallet, and you use it to generate receive addresses.  How do you protect yourself from maliciously generated receive addresses for this wallet, in the case that the desktop software is compromised? How do you validate that the receive addresses are correct and not an attacker's receive address? how do you limit trust of the desktop software wallet?

With typical single-sig P2PKH and P2WPKH the receive addresses can be independently verified to belong to a known xpub key using any bitcoin software library and a small script. Hardware wallets can also be used to generate or verify receive addresses so the software wallet doesn't not need to be trusted. Some hardware wallets also verify the change address for a given transaction also belongs to the xpub key in question.

So how do you do this kind of verification for multisig wallets? Or are people not verifying and instead just trusting that their software wallet of choice is not compromised? I haven't found examples online to do this. It appears that in the Coldcard multisig set up process for a 2-of-3 setup, each device is aware of the other 2 xpubs, so presumably it has the information to perform this kind of verification, but I don't know if it actually does that verification.",1603066570,7,1

we are a number of crypto community groups ($TRAC, $VI, $PLT, $AKRO and many more...) that have been waiting for our frozen tokens and co for several weeks. We are waiting since Kucoin has lost most of our tokens due to the recent hack, as you probably got wind of. I was stupid enough to believe that because the token price of my token is so low and it was not named eth, btc or trx, it would not be of interest to hackers if Kucoin could be hacked... I was a fool!

Meanwhile we know that Kucoin consciously attempts to pressure the teams to save some money by performing a swap! For them getting hacked ! It's their fault, the projects can't be blamed and now they have to pay for the resulting damage. There are projects that have sworn to decentralization... that would be a stab in the heart of Satoshi and all members of the community who believe in decentralization! 

We users of several communities united because we had questions and demanded transparency. Support tickets are answered automatically and this has been going on for weeks and in the Kucoin telegram chat you are directly blocked for the first critical question. We are users who entrust our money to them and they can't even take the time to be critical and transparent  rather they ban us immediately!

Kucoin has still not given a time frame because as play with the teams a tom  and jerry roleplay. If you expect a compensation of kucoin, you won't be rejected well no, you will not get any answer for weeks... if you want to do a swap, they are willing and open to help you. How long should we wait until there is a solution for these kind of projects that got badly damaged due the incident/hack? until the next bull run? Well I hope no guys!

I hope that I was able to wake up one or the other of you and to warn you what could also happen to you guys  Luckily the frozen/lost amount is still small in percentage terms from what I invested, but it is still a lesson.

**The record of sending BTC in Bakkt exchange shows the interest of organizations in these cryptocurrencies**

The Bakkt exchange broke its historic bitcoin record in October, marking a significant leap in corporate demand for BTC.

Following the significant increase in the demand for bitcoin by state-owned companies in recent months, Bakkt Exchange has experienced another record from September 20 to October 20.

Bakkt's digital asset payment and exchange platform is designed for corporate investors in the United States and is operated by the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Intercontinental Exchange. The increase in the futures market of the Bakkt bitcoin market, which physically settles bitcoin contracts, signals an increase in organizations' demand for cryptocurrency assets. CME, LMAX Digital and Bakkt trading volumes indicate that the institutional Bitcoin market is growing rapidly

There is a significant increase in the volume of futures transactions in several exchanges in October.

In October 400 BTC contracts in Bakkt expire. Monthly data show a 14% jump compared to September. The volume of outstanding Bakkt contracts is important in measuring organizational activities because this exchange is one of the three platforms along with LMAX Digital and CME.

A significant increase in the delivery of futures contracts in Bakkt means an increase in the demand of organizations.

Another BTC record for Bakkt this month. More than 400 BTC futures contracts expired in October, up 14 percent from September. With another record breaking in Bakkt, the demand of organizations for bitcoin is increasing.

Bakkt, LMAX Digital and CME platforms, at the forefront of trading activities, are constantly receiving high demand. Skew data show that LMAX Digital is the largest spot exchange service in the global market by volume. According to LMAX Digital, Skew has processed $ 135.6 million in BTC over the past 24 hours. This is more than the daily volume of Coinbase, Kraken and other retail-focused exchanges.

Because LMAX Digital facilitates corporate trading in the first place, this exchange reflects the corporate image of Bitcoin beyond Coinbase. There is a lot of demand from institutions, especially after the recent investments of Square and MicroStrategy. Similar to Bakkt, the CME bitcoin futures market has seen an increase in the volume of outstanding contracts. As of October 2, after the expiration of the September contracts, the unsettled bitcoin contracts in CME increased from $ 345 million to $ 561 million.

Industry managers view this institutional growth positively

jdflzy,AfshinNoorozi,Bitcoin upward breakout possible despite OKEx exchange scandal," 

**Bitcoin upward breakout possible despite OKEx exchange scandal**

The price of Bitcoin lost its uptrend, which reached $ 11.7 thousand earlier this week, but the current range may provide good opportunities for traders.

Earlier this week, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) rose to $ 11,725 after last week's news that Square had bought 4,709 Bitcoins, but since then the price has fallen again. Several falls in the $ 11,500 range and the recent negative news from OKEx that the exchange's withdrawal service was suspended due to ""interrogation"" of the company's CEO by Chinese judicial authorities affected investor sentiment and the price of bitcoin.

A wave of negative news pushed most altcoins into the red zone and halted the uptrend of bitcoins. Bitcoin's daily time frame indicates that a loss of the $ 11,200 area could pave the way for a re-test of $ 11,100, a level that is in the VPVR gap and is likely to cause a re-drop to $ 10,900.

The $ 11,000 support level is now essential to resume the uptrend, and BTC may find it difficult to maintain this level as the re-quarantine situation caused by the Corona virus has frightened investors.

If Bitcoin loses $ 11,000 support, it is likely to fall below $ 10,000 (200-MA and $ 9,750), which is close to the CME gap. While the current price action is frustrating for Bullrun who want to retest the $ 12,000 level, a big look shows that there are a number of factors that favor Bitcoin. Given the economic uncertainty that results from the COVID-19 epidemic, the recent acquisition of BTC by MicroStrategy, Square and Stone Ridge is a positive signal.

In addition, trading volume at several BTC futures exchanges is rising again

Bakkt Exchange has reached a new record in sending BTC. Bitcoin has also largely ignored negative news over the past two months, above $ 10, and buyers have shown great interest in buying close to that level.

Wait for the support area to be re-tested  
It should also be noted that only about 1.5 weeks have passed since Bitcoin withdrew from a 24-day intensive phase, followed by an upward breakout to $ 11,750.

Since breaking the uptrend, the $ 11,200 level has been tested as support again, but a deeper pullback to 20-MA to test the $ 11,000 is not surprising. Even a fall to the $ 10.650 level near the 100-MA could test the downtrend line from the $ 12.467 ceiling that started in 2020. In the short term, the price of Bitcoin seems to be trading in the range of $ 11,400-9,700 (ideal range for¬† traders).",1603024612,0,1

jdeop2,BitcoinCanSaveUsAll,Why To Believe in Bitcoin,"Because you become one who understands that the entire core of the power structure of our society today is rotten through and through.  You understand this corruption stems from the fact that since the 70s it's been based on a debt based fiat currency which gives the hands of a few absolute power to create infinite supply of this currency that we sell our time, labor and goods for every second of every day. You also realize that if we can change that core to one where it's based on a non governmental /non corporate controlled hard asset that is the world's first truly finite asset that the people of the world get to decide on the value (supply) that we can take the next step in human evolution and create a world that rather than the current fiat masters, that we all collectively decide what our time is worth and not the other way around.

You realize that it is truly possible to achieve this but that the only way to do so is to take physical possession of your private keys away from any custodial solution as you understand that possession is 10/ 10ths of the law with bitcoin and every Satoshi counts. You then become one of us. One who regardless of what the current fiat currency value stamped on these banker backed exchanges is that you dollar cost average every time you get any extra money. You do it because you want a better future not only for yourself, but also your family and friends. You see it can happen as more and more people do just what you've done and you have your faith in humanity restored even in the darkest days.

jdcg4q,facepalm5000,VHS : DVD :: Existing social contracts : BTC,"Analogy: VHS is to DVD as existing social contracts are to BTC. (And more specifically, with regard to the sudden perceptual flip that happened when DVDs became available, as explained below)

If you're old enough, maybe you can remember when VHS (or even Betamax) was the standard. VHS quality seemed fine, since that's what everyone was used to. Needing to wait several minutes to rewind and fast-forward was normal. It was really only bad if the tracking was off, which could be fixed.

Then DVDs came out, and \*instantly\* VHS seemed super shitty, suddenly by comparison. We didn't realize how terrible VHS was until a better option was available. 

Well I think I'm noticing that dynamic, except instead it's between existing social contracts and Btc. Previous social contracts like fiat, entitlement programs, insurance, stocks of companies that can issue more shares at will (e.g. TSLA), etc, seemed good enough before. That was just how the world worked, and it worked well enough, until...

Now there's BTC. And more specific to my experience, now that I've set up my own node and can verify transactions without trusting 3rd parties, the feeling of minimized counterparty risk is something you can get used to. Having gotten used to that, now suddenly many other facets of the world suddenly seem much more shitty/scammy than before. Euro and USD suddenly start to seem to have a lot in common with scammy altcoins, especially with so much uncertainty about the future monetary policy of any given fiat currency. Politicians suddenly seem to not need to be taken as seriously. Banks are suddenly that much less of gate keepers to the world of finance.

I have a certain amount of BTC stored on my Hardware wallet at home. I then have the recovery phrases stored at alternative locations (in the event my house burns down etc.)

BTC is now at a value where if I convert the value to dollars I would not be comfortable storing that amount of cash at home. I think this way because if someone has access to my wallet they have my cash (assuming they can breach my password).

I've looked into storing it at a bank in a safety deposit box, then the paper at another bank and another paper at another location. The cost to do this is actually really reasonable. However, there is a down-side; I can't access it on weekends. I have no reasons to need to access BTC quickly from the PoV of my finances. But, still this isn't something I'm comfortable with.

I wanted to get the opinions of people on here to help me think this through. So overall:

jbshaf,samdane7777,The Ulterior Motive of Americans Who Advocate for US Regulations," There are certain overall demographic trends in regards to crypto investing and trading. The overseas Asian and European market is extremely developed and has all the exchanges and is heavily geared towards leveraged trading. It is a more advanced accessible sophisticated market with more legal listings for a greater number of people globally.  


The American laws regarding Dodd Frank act treating crypto like an unregulated non centrally cleared over the counter swap instead of a centrally cleared commodity is a risk to the overall system. The unwillingness of the SEC and CFTC to make it easy for exchanges to work in the united states and to clarify things and fast track things is a risk to the system.  


Americans in general are toxic maximalist and much less sophisticated in their investing and trading of crypto than the global community. This is because traditional finance in America is very inaccessible and politically and class bifurcated with people from traditionally upper middle class northern conservative families that do not like crypto or understand crypto, where high leverage traders in america tend to be well over the age of 50 and totally uninterested in trading crypto vs oil and gas and s&amp;p. Everything in America is for the old and the younger have nothing.  


The problem is apparent with the Bitmex Indictment. The Department of Justice has laid out an agenda where it is going to do it's best in the coming 4 years to force American regulations on the world. They have avowed to do this, to go after all of Defi and all exchanges in the world except for Huobi, OKex, and Bitthumb which are fully regulated and mandatory KYC.  


American institutions and retail have an ulterior motive of toxic maximalism and custodianship and largely introducing intermediaries and treating bitcoin as a custodian held long term investment largely held in funds and banks. What people do not understand about the people who make regulations in America for bitcoin is that they largely want to trap the supply inside banks and funds. They do not like product diversity or DeFi or accessibility. That's why they engage in such protectionism and deliberately allow the CFTC and SEC to not give clarity on other areas of crypto.  


Because the US will enforce it's laws globally, the only way to fully protect the ecosystem is to put a tremendous amount of pressure on the CFTC and SEC to make fully regulated derivative exchanges that are exactly like Huobi and Okex with all the coins and all the leverage, and to put the pressure on them to get Huobi and Okex to become Us regulated Future Commission Merchants and to function as centrally clearing exchanges so that the Asian and American market isn't bifurcated.",1602784067,9,1

Unless you own more than a fair amount of bitcoin and have purchased that bitcoin at a low price, is there any substantial benefit to not pulling out your profit?","Maybe I'm doing improper calculations, but as long as you account for spread, didn't buy bitcoin when it was very cheap therefore likely having either nearly a full bitcoin or more, there's very little benefit to not pulling profit (aside from tax issues of course). Of course at what percentage to pull profit would be the big question.

Let me know if I'm totally out to lunch. But owning less than a bitcoin and having only relatively recently bought in, it would seem to be that the percentages are so small relative to the price of bitcoin that the gains you will receive from keeping your profit in is so small, ( maybe 20-30$ per $1000 increase in the price of bitcoin) that the benefit of pulling profit when bitcoin goes back to the price you originally purchased your bitcoin at you are still at a small profit overall.

When the block reward reduces to a point where miners need to profit from transaction fees, will this be enough incentive to keep operations running, considering the costs involved to maintain the current hash rate? 7tps is also a constraint on income.

If we assume the above concern works out for the first layer functioning in standalone, the question regarding the LN arises:

If the LN becomes the main layer for performing transactions in the future, won't this reduce the income for miners? I know node operators settle the difference in balance on the first layer, but how often will this theoretically happen?

I apologise if this is a basic question already discussed, but I'm curious if someone has done some calculations before, or can refer me to a good resource discussing this topic.

I'm advising everyone to **run Bitcoin Core** if they've got some hard disk space - even if it's in pruned mode.

Why?

Because every node out there adds robustness to the network, validates each transaction, validates each block, relays blocks and transactions and makes any attack on bitcoin's network less feasible.  

So if you've got value stored in bitcoin, increase the strength and value of the network in a cheap way by running Bitcoin Core.

NB: This is not to say you need to hold or even monitor your coins using bitcoin core, although it's very good for that too.  It's just to say that you running bitcoin core is good for bitcoin and so is it's in your interest to do so.",1602766153,76,1

What will the Whales do? We like that they get onboard because they soak up coins and bring publicity. But it's a double-sided blowhole because they might squash breakouts in order to accumulate at lower prices. On the other hand, they don't want to spoil the reputation of Bitcoin by manpulating too conspicuously. So my guess is that they will squash breakouts, but not created extreme 1,000 point dumps. Consequently, breakouts like yesterday will be followed by 500 point falls, followed by long extended sideways ranges until the next breakout. Of course, the would like bad macro news too, because all markets could fall, leading to accumulation at even lower prices. That's my suspicion. What do you think the Whales will do?",1603352632,4,1

Then ultimately the goal from the start which was having a universal currency will be achieved, at least in most if not every developed country.

jjdtja,markpaul00,Warning - Buying Bitcoin through TrustWallet - misleading quotes - high fees,"Hi all, 

Usually I use Cashapp to buy my Bitcoin (weekly, I DCA) and then I store in in Trustwallet, which is a mobile wallet owned by Binance. 

I noticed they added a ""buy BTC"" option directly in the TrustWallet app, so I gave it a shot. 

Unfortunately, they outsource the actual crypto buying process to a sketchy company, which uses misleading tactics.

As you can see from this screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/eknji0Z.png

US$5000 was to purchase 0.41635 BTC, an amount that I'm happy with.

However, at checkout, they change the deal to this: https://i.imgur.com/oSQoNPd.png

In simple terms, they wanted to sell me 0.43092 BTC for $5000, and then added a $175 ""processing"" fee. That's more Bitcoin than I wanted to buy, more fiat than I wanted to spend, and it brings the base price of the bitcoin from $11,603, to $12,009, a far larger number. 

I would have no problem with this if they were upfront about the fees and what they are doing, but now I have sour taste in my mouth. I've been into crypto for a little while. Can you imagine how predatory this would seem to a new user who's going through their first buy?",1603845579,30,1

My love for Interior Designer has been my source of joy for a long time. I first began my career at a very young age, following my father‚Äôs steps. I specialize in construction, doing many repairs, and making things like stairways, frameworks, partitions, and rafters.

I love my job, but financial stability can be a struggle sometimes. I decided to look for a good investment that I could get into to have at least another stable income coming in. After much research and numerous unhelpful YouTube videos, I discovered[ crypto trading](http://cryptotribesmen.net/) and found out about [Crypto Tribesmen](http://cryptotribesmen.net/).

A firm belief in providing the users with the best crypto trading experience and successful strategies will increase your returns. I tried this out, and I must say it‚Äôs not disappointing.

jhqevz,ArmchairCryptologist,Warning: Very professional-looking Ledger phishing emails,"Just wanted to give people a heads-up that there is an ongoing phishing attack of very legit-looking emails against Ledger customers that are using the data compromised from the July 2020 data breach to both target and personalize the emails. The only real tells are that the emails have an excessively urgent tone, that they are timed to the middle of the weekend, and that they link to a suspicious domain that was registered yesterday (ledger support dot io) instead of the official ledger.com homepage.

[Information about the original data breach](https://www.ledger.com/addressing-the-july-2020-e-commerce-and-marketing-data-breach)

Body of the email:

&gt;Dear (ACTUAL FIRST NAME),

&gt;We regret to inform you that Ledger has experienced a security breach affecting approximately 85,000 of our customers and that the wallet associated with your e-mail address (ACTUAL EMAIL ADDRESS) is within those affected by the breach. 

&gt;Namely, on Saturday, October 24th 2020, our forensics team has found several of the Ledger Live administrative servers to be infected with malware. 

&gt;At this moment, it's technically impossible to conclusively assess the severity and the scope of the data breach. Due to these circumstances, we must assume that your cryptocurrency assets are at risk of being stolen. 

&gt;If you're receiving this e-mail, it's because you've been affected by the breach. In order to protect your assets, please download the latest version of Ledger Live and follow the instructions to set up a new PIN for your wallet. 

&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;Ledger

(Followed by a button to download the presumably malware-riddled ""latest version"")

Of course, you should only ever download Ledger Live from the official website.",1603616680,62,1

He couldn't deploy an onchain BTC solution to his Point of Sale unit due to confirmation times, but he could deploy a LN solution.

Im planning to dive into investing into cryptocurrency, mostly into stablecoins, and I would like to transfer them into Celsius Network to make profit.

What is the best place to buy crypto currency, which is safe and reliable, but offers the minium fees overall. So far [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) seems the best, there you can transfer fiat money for free, but after exchaning transferring USDT or any other coin costs 3USD / transfer.

Are there any other sites, that offer better values? Im based in Europe

Hi all!

I haven't been in the crypto space for that long but I'm at the stage where portfolio is spread across multiple wallets and exchanges. As such I'm looking into using something like Coin Tracker to keep pace with my portfolios performance rather than constantly checking in and out of various accounts to see what's what. I noticed that this platform doesn't allow me to import API's that only allow specified IP addresses to sync with it. Rather, I need to select the 'allow access to any IP address' option when creating each API, otherwise it doesn't sync.

Can anyone tell me what the risks are of going down this path?

Thanks!

Apologies as this is not strictly about Bitcoin itself. As BTC enthusiasts, we're trying to accelerate the shift from fiat to BTC by offering a high-end service with BTC as the only payment method accepted.  

I (American) have a good friend who is Brazilian and lives in Rio De Janeiro. He teaches Portuguese to foreigners and has also been working in tourism for the past ten years.

We're putting together an (almost) all-inclusive experience for first-time visitors to the city. Here is a brief description of the trip:

\* Monday, January 18, 2021 through Sunday, January 24, 2021.

\* 7 days, 6 nights in a high-end apartment in Copacabana Beach. Each person will have their own private suite.

\* Breakfast included each day, cooked in-house. Lunch and dinner at local restaurants, also included.

\* Excursions with English-speaking guide to see all the major sites, including Corcovado, Sugar Loaf, and the famous beaches. All entrance fees included.

\* Transportation provided with private van and driver.

\* Two Portuguese lessons via Skype prior to arrival and daily one-hour Portuguese lessons in person during the stay.

\* Additional classes to learn more about Brazilian culture, music, food, etc.

Here is an interesting bit. My friend has a ton of female Brazilian friends who are always asking to be introduced to his ""rich"" foreigner friends for socializing, practicing their English, and maybe more. He is happy to make introductions. ;)

This is a new service and we would like to find three or four adventurous souls to try out the experience and give us feedback on how we can refine the service for future full-price clients. For this first group, we're asking **0.32 BTC** from each person, which should allow us to pay for all our out-of-pocket costs. Not included in the package is airfare to and from Rio (we hope to include that in the future) as well as  drinks and any incidental purchases.

NOTE: Brazil took the worst of the pandemic but the numbers have been stable or declining for awhile, especially in the Rio area.  The city is open for flights and everything is returning to normal. Citizens of most countries, including the USA, Canada, and most of western Europe do not need a visa in advance to visit Brazil.

That's the spiel. If this interests you, please send me a DM for more details. If all sounds good, we can set up a time to talk via Skype.",1604147961,4,1

I've always been a saver, and ever since becoming involved in bitcoin for a few years back, I've been appealed to the self-sovereign, store of value, philosophy. I've always just put my leftovers of my paycheck in bitcoin. Every time I contemplate spending money for something I don't really need (outside of food, rent, transport etc.) I've always asked myself, ""Do I really need xyz, or can I put that extra money toward bitcoin?""

Basically every month, 3 things happen on payday: 1. I pay off my monthly credit card in full (since all my expenses are on a cc), 2. I pay my monthly rent (since it cannot be paid on credit), and 3. I put all the leftovers in a savings account and/or in bitcoin. Then I repeat this every month at payday. I have 2 numbers to review each month, how much I spent on my cc, and how much I saved/put in bitcoin as leftovers. 

I've been doing this since 2017, since the last bullrun, and I've had no desires to ever sell since then. I don't care about trading, I want to be self-sovereign, without relying on government policy/spending, I don't want to see my money rot away in a savings account as I hold my wealth for the many years to come.",1604141568,53,1

jldmnh,iamnobodysfriend,"Central bank coins and ""coin contracts""","Don't get too excited about central banks issuing their own cryptocurrencies. There are some obvious reasons why banks and nations want to have state-backed cryptocurrencies, and it's not ""financial inclusion"". 

For one, central bank coins won't be coins like Bitcoin, nor tokens like on Ethereum. They'll be contracts. So, for example, you own 1 digital Euro-coin, but it's really a contract for 1 digi-Euro. Meaning, the issuer of the contract (the central bank) can stipulate that you must pay an arbitrary amount of interest on your contract. The issuer can withdraw this interest from your wallet without you being able to do anything about it. I mean to say that such central bank coins automatically lose a % per year by sending it back to the central issuer.

This, to me, is a terrifying dystopian outlook. Sure, banks won't be able to do this with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is solid. But coin-contracts, where a coin is a contract, open up a whole new world of state crimes against the people. Your funds can be seized or frozen with great ease. 

Such a bank-coin obviously has to run on some kind of platform, and currently, the sort of platforms that may support his type of contract-with-interest-coin schemes are for example Ripple or Ethereum. I suspect Ripple may be the platform of choice for banks and governments.

Secondly, once all people's savings have been moved to such a digital coin platform, nations and banks can stop issuing paper/physical currency. We shall have the cashless society. And you know what will happen next? You must obey, you must work for your slavery, you must echo the right opinions, or you will be excluded from the financial system. 

This has already happened to some far-right extremists like Laura Towler, Martin Sellner etc. They lost all of their bank accounts + funds without notice. See 'How corporations can delete your existence'

j5vq6y,Lemons81,Another person got scammed....,"I just met with an old friend, i remember she told me she invested 3 million Colombian peso in April, 2017 in Bitcoin.

That was +/- $1,060 USD that time or +/- $9,400 today.

When i told her how much it was worth today she was excited because today that's 36 million peso where i live.

And she has a debt to pay to the bank on a loan for an apartment, especially now during the crisis that would put her out of debt instantly.

So obviously i asked her if she still had the ""seed"" or wallet in a secure place, she didn't understand what i was asking.

A bit deeper into the conversation she told me her son knew a guy to invest bitcoin, he told her that there was a flat fee of 1 million peso to open up a wallet and the other 2 million would be invested.

I told her she got scammed, because she did not have the private key of her wallet and when she asked to get money from her investment this person again lied to her and told her that whats left of today is only 250,000 Colombian pesos or $65 USD.

There was no contract or anything written on paper, the only thing as evidence she had was a mail on how much money they agreed to invest.

I'm thinking now of offering some free/paid advice now trough online marketplaces in my city and country, people need to know they can open a wallet for free and how to purchase Bitcoins themselves and how they can secure their investments with a hardware wallet and how to sell their Bitcoin.

I see daily stories on Reddit/Twitter/Facebook of people getting scammed, ive also been selling hardware wallets trough my online store in my country ( i'm not an authorized distributor but i've prevented some scams where other online sellers sold opened/tampered wallets )",1601945809,10,1

j5v2vw,ak3459,Help Understanding Mining Fees,"So some background I just bought some bitcoin at a bitcoin ATM to try it out. I put $40 in the machine and received $34.80ish worth of bitcoin. 

The fee at the machine was 15%. $34.80\*1.15 = $40 (which I put in the machine)

The machine gives you a link to blockchain explorer where you can see when your transaction becomes confirmed. 

Looking through the transaction, the total fee for the transaction (which I assume is the mining fee) is $6.22

So I put $40 in the machine, received $34.80 and the transaction cost $6.22 to process. 

$34.80+6.22= $41.02, so the machine in fact losing money on the transaction? $41.02&gt;$40

&amp;#x200B;

My question is the ""Fees"" in blockchain explorer in fact ""mining fees""? I know this price changes throughout the day, but $6.22 seems high? and would the company running the machine be actually dumb enough to lose money on the transaction? Or can they not control what price the mining fee will be?

j5tu3u,asdfredditusername,Profitability Calculations with regard to increasing difficulty.,"Hello.  I've been looking for profitability calculator that takes into account increasing difficulty.  I've found one that takes into account a daily increase in hashrate.  I've also found one that takes into account a daily (or bi-monthly) increase in difficulty. Quick question before I continue -- Does an increase in difficulty correspond linearly with an increase in hashrate?  Which one of those calculators (if correctly coded) would be more accurate?

As I am a big fan of trust, but verify, I would like to build my own calculator to make sure that the online version I choose is correct.  This may be overkill, but I have been tasked by my boss to complete a feasibility study of building a huge mining farm.  Most calculators will only give a right now kind of answer to profitability.  I need to be able to get year over year numbers that include the daily declining profitability.

Thanks in advance.

After setting my girlfriend up with a wallet and then doing the same with my father, I noticed they began reading more about bitcoin. Paying attention to its price leads to paying attention to its news. They speak to friends about it and their genuine curiosity leads them to read more, and ultimately become more bullish, as the fundamentals are so sound.  


# Give Bitcoin For Birthdays

So I started **gifting it to friends for their birthdays.** Just a nominal amount, but enough that they have to download a wallet. They transition from saying ""That seems complicated"" to ""This isn't so bad."" The generosity of a gift is something that is rude to deny, so they make the initial time investment to accept it.  


From here, I expect their curiosity and the surprising ease of purchasing to encourage them to purchase and hold more. I expect the gift to grow in value, and their investment to grow in value too. So in this way, I really think I'm doing them a big favor.  


# Mass Adoption

&amp;#x200B;

The longer i have had exposure to Bitcoin, the more i want to implement Bitcoin payments into every day life. You might be in the camp of die hard hodler who would never spend their coins on something as dumb as a utility bill, but just hear me out... 

I like to keep 2 years+ worth (Traditionally Fiat) that sit in an account used only to cover my utilities and other monthly services and would be used in case i was made redundant/ emergency situation. Recently i have been toying with the idea to start converting that savings stack into Bitcoin and use a service such as Piixpay to cover all my bills.

The value prop for me here is simple. 

1. With NgU technology, my 'utilities' Stack could last a lot longer than the 2 years it would sat in fiat. 
2. Because the funds are not being accessed in full at any given moment the 2 year flex is a comfortable amount of time for me to now freak out in any given price action. 
3. With topping the account up ever 6 months the potential for ending up with a 'eat free forever' stack would be pretty useful. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main trade offs are obviously KYC to whatever service provides this kind of invoice settlement. 

Service provider knowing the change output. (Pretty easily worked around with coin control)

Doxxing myself to the service provider with unknown complications further down the line.

j5lieb,very_452001,What is considered a Small Balance for Altcoins holdings left on the Big Exchanges &amp; Question on DEX's?,"I have altcoins on the big exchanges but each altcoin I have on each each exchange are not in the thousands but small balance like for example under 50 balance for each altcoin. Do holders holding such small balances get email notifications from exchanges of upcoming delisting's or coin swaps or only big bag holders entitled to these emails notifications?

Problem is when I click on hide small/0 balances to see my alt holdings on these centralised exchanges it also hides my small alt balances that have values greater than 0 so I see nothing in my wallet overview.

Can you hold alts on Decentralised Exchanges and if so do you get the same email notifications from DEX's?

Finally why doesn't this happen with Bitcoin holdings on centralised exchanges? Lets say I had 90 Bitcoins on a exchange and click on hide small/0 balances it will still show? How is this fair or what kind of exchange system algorithms are they running?",1601911927,1,1

j3y5cb,Ghostcarapace3,A film idea,"So, I have an idea for a film. It's a comedy. It's called no taxation without representation. In this film, there are a couple of buddies who are trading crypto, making exchanges and just living their lives. Until taxes. 

So, we have our young entrepeneur played by jonah hill, and he gets in the crosshairs of a crooked IRS agent, who is working in cahoots with a criminal tax filing attourney from HR block to overcharge people for their crypto transactions. 

Jonah hasn't kept good records. The IRS agent knows this, and does an audit on purpose. And then Jonah's crypto wallet comes out. Jonah talks to his tax accountant, and meets with the IRS agent, and his life is going downhill. Until... Jonah's phone gets lost, and he ends up driving to the office of his tax accountant, and finds the IRS guy and his tax accountant talking without him AFTER he had paid. And they are saying some pretty incriminating things. The IRS guy, is splitting the overcharged tax profits 50/50 with the tax accountant. Now, Jonah paid what he made fair and square. But the catch, is that the IRS agent and tax attorney are putting together a scheme to make it seem like his crypto is worth more than it really was. 

Now, the crazy part starts, and Jonah enlists the help of some of his more shady friends from the monero community to help him investigate the crooked accountant. Well, they break in, and find that there was way more fraud in the IRS than they expected, and that the IRS was cooking the books. Then, the IRS catches on, and enlist the fbi and our poor guys are chased by the FBI trying to silence them before they can get their story to the news. 

In the end, the IRS wins, and poor jonah is left dead. So I guess its a tragedy and a comedy. Anyone wanna flesh this story out into a full movie script to pitch to some hollywood directors? I want to make the laws that make people report each crypto transaction, and not just report the dollar value at the start and end of the year look like it is a shady government scheme designed to defraud hardworking Americans who are just trying to save their money from inflation. I want to make the IRS look like a criminal organization, that supports a war machine that murders millions of people every decade. I want to start a conversation in the mainstream that maybe we should not have taxation without representation. If the only people who are being represented are the people who pay the lobbyists, then only the people who pay lobbyists should be taxed.",1601657362,3,1

As I received more benefits from this platform, I saw an opportunity to convert a lot of dollars I had earned over the last few decades (mostly in property) into bitcoin and stablecoins like DAI and TUSD and earn 12% APY interest + 2% interest in CRO. These are better returns than I have on most rental properties I‚Äôve owned, without the headache of shitty tenants, asshole city council members, and constant maintenance and taxes. So when i had the cash at my disposal, i quickly and with velocity started purchasing large amounts of bitcoin ethereum DAI paxos tusd through the crypto.com app and began making deposits. They upgraded my debit card. It‚Äôs cool. Rose gold. I deposit tusd onto the card and it converts it to fiat and I go spend it and I get crypto back which earns 18% APY!! It‚Äôs great. All of a sudden, the bots and auto responders are asking for proof of source of my funds and that if I don‚Äôt provide the documents, that it will impact my account. They won‚Äôt even give me a phone call. They tell me and my tax attorney to email their support@crypto.com email. I talk to bots and auto responders. I get one of them on the chat and they say they need the documents for their report so they can stay compliant. I tell them that their report is of no concern to me. I report to the irs, I followed every agreement to purchase the crypto and use the platform. No brokerage account I have traded on has ever requested this information or documents as proof. If they needed the proof of my source Of income or wealth, they should have asked before selling me the crypto.
This whole exchange wouldn‚Äôt bother me so much if I could just move my funds to my cold wallet. The worrisome thing is that they have control of everything that‚Äôs still locked up in a 3 month deposit period. Obviously I can‚Äôt take those funds out until the term expired. 
I could dig up some of the documents they‚Äôre requesting, but i don‚Äôt want to. Like seriously, fuck them.",1601609462,29,1

**Frances Coppola**: A large part of the reason why cryptocurrencies are now popular with the mainstream is that the cryptocurrency ecosystem has firmly Tethered itself to the legacy system. Cryptocurrency investors mostly measure their wealth in US dollars, not in Bitcoin. Getting rich in US dollars is what they want to do. Replacing the US dollar with cryptocurrency would seriously damage their wealth. It is not what they want to do.

The original vision of the early Bitcoin adopters was that cryptocurrency would replace the legacy financial system. But instead, the cryptocurrency ecosystem is being absorbed into it. A decade from now, cryptocurrencies will be a normal part of the investment landscape. And when central banks start issuing cryptocurrencies, they'll become a normal part of the payments infrastructure too.

But replacing the US dollar, and the banks &amp; central banks that depend on it? No, that will still be a pipe dream.",1601836967,14,1

Monthly    minimum wage is 800,000 Bs. one USD is around 440,000 Bs. So that is    where the 2 USD monthly comes. These 800,000 Bs. already include a  cash   food bonus.

Moons, tips and work by reddits have helped me so much!

Some    people insist that minimum monthly wage is not real, but it is. I  have   relatives that are public workers and earn that. Some with  studies and   time working could reach 20 minimum wages according to the  tables,  that  would be anyway under 50 USD monthly.

Private companies, well a little more. A cashier in a supermarket could earn around 50 USD monthly.

The    Venezuela College of Engineers, has a table for the recomended wages.    The minimum wage they propose for a engineer without any experiencie  is   90,000,000 Bs. / monthly, which is around 200 USD. And... good luck    finding a place that pays that

**""Inflation makes you pay 50 dollars for the 20 dollar haircut you used to get for 5 dollars when you had hair!""**

Let's embark on a journey that made the United States the number 1 economy of the world.

#### 1.  Despite the British Empire's claim that it would for ever remain the  leading empire,history can serve as a harbinger for what's to come...

At  the peak of its power, in 1913, ""the empire on which the sun never  sets"", controlled 25% of the planet's land mass and about the same  percentage of the world's population. Britain was both the naval an  imperial power of the 19th century, and between 1812-1914, its dominance  resulted in relative peace in Europe and the rest of the world. The  industrial revolution transformed Britain into the workshop of the  world.

By the start of the 20th century things changed as both  Germany and the United States started to challenge Britain's economic  and influential leadership. As often happened during human history such  challenging lead to war and although Britain achieved its largest  territorial influence after WW1, the war had destroyed much of its  economic strength, with losses in industrial and military power marking  the begin of its demise.

During WW2, Japan occupied Britain's  colonies, and after WW2, India, Britain's most valuable and populous  possession, achieved independence. Much of the British Empire's  influence is now enshrined in the Commonwealth Charter, stating shared  values like democracy, human rights and the rule of law.

The  United Kingdom's pound sterling was its world's reserve currency during  its reign and by controlling the supply of money, Britain was able to  influence its global power.

**""Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws!""** *Mayer Amschel Rothschild*  


#### 2. The US Empire repeats this blueprint by claiming the U.S. Dollar's reserve currency status as its birthright!

**The Federal Reserve Act.**

The  Panic of 1907 triggered many American's belief that The Federal Reserve  Act, passed by the 63rd United States Congress and signed into law by  President Woodrow Wilson on December 23, 1913, was necessary for  financial and economic stability. The law created the Federal Reserve  System, the central banking system of the United States.

**The Bretton Woods System.**

The  FED ended immobile reserve issues and the inelastic currency problems  and successfully internationalized the U.S Dollar as the global reserve  currency. The usage of the prior nationally used U.S. Dollar expanded a  first time when the Allies agreed to the terms of the Bretton Woods  System, establishing the rules for commercial as well as financial  regulations among the United States and its allies. Canada, Western  Europe, Australia and Japan accepted the U.S. Dollar, which was backed  by a gold exchange standard, making the U.S. Dollar ""as good as gold"".  This was only possible because the United States controlled two thirds  of the world's gold reserves.

Soviet representatives, who claimed  that institutions like the IMF and the International Bank for  Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) were Wall Street branches, didn't  participate in Bretton Woods and later proved to be right, as the United  States printed too much money (not backed by its gold reserves) to wage  war on Vietnam, destroying a big part of the value of the U.S. Dollars  held by its allies, due to the inflation of the U.S. Dollar money  supply.

Yet, the initial demand for U.S. dollars created the  American way of life: a consumer driven economy fueled by products made  outside the U.S. in return for U.S. Dollars. As the Allied countries  couldn't really buy any ""Made in America""-products, due to the fact that  the United States' elites rather outsourced their manufacturing, they  instead invested their hard labor into U.S. Treasuries.

On August  1971, President Richard Nixon announced the unilateral cancellation of  the direct international convertibility of the United States dollar to  gold, in a response to halt the Allied countries' continuous attempts to  exchange their U.S. Dollars for Gold. By 1973, the Bretton Woods system  was replaced by the current freely floating fiat currency system.

**The petro dollar system.**

The  second wave of U.S. Dollar adoption was the result of the petro dollar,  making the global trade of oil U.S. Dollar denominated. Every country  on this planet needed and still needs oil to operate and grow its  economy, creating an enormous growth in U.S. Dollar demand and like  mentioned before, those dollars had to be earned. Especially China  served the United States consumer model by producing almost everything  Americans can buy in Wall Mart and other stores. By relying on the U.S.  Dollar reserve currency status, the American elites have made the  mistake of outsourcing manufacturing to China, as often predicted by  Donald Trump in the 1980's. The y figured it was easier to just print  wealth.

**The tradewar.**

President Donald  Trump, decided it was time to bring jobs back to the U.S. and started an  ongoing trade war with China, the country that supplied the U.S.  consumer driven economy, and proud owner of $1.07 trillion in Treasury  holdings. The trade war has negatively impacted the economies of both  the United States and China and will most likely result in the  decoupling of both economies.

**What is to come? My personal insights.**

I  see huge problems for the U.S. and the rest of the western liberal  democracies. But especially the United States, who's currency amounts to  no less than 60% of all the world's reserve assets, is vulnerable if  and when China who only accounts for 1 or 2 %, says it is time for  change. Most likely we will experience another banking crisis, with or  without Covid-19, and unfortunately a bigger one when compared to the  2008 dissaster. Did you know that the global debt tripled since then?  Many economists and politicians advocate the end of the U.S. Dollar  reserve currency system and predict a reset. Every financial system has a  limited lifespan similar to a human live: it is created, it grows, it  matures, and unfortunately, it ages, weakens and dies. It happened to  the Brittish Pound Sterling, and I am afraid that the days of this  financial hegemony are numbered as well.

**And I did write ""afraid"", why?**

History  tells us that these transition periods are particularly dangerous and  have often led to full-blown military conflicts if not world wars. The  current wealth transfer, the result of manufacturing outsourcing to  mainland China, impoverished the United States and destroyed its middle  class. President Donald Trump's analysis that the U.S. needs a strong  manufacturing base is correct, yet without its allies the United States  will not be able to turn the tide.

It took China decades to build  its manufacturing base, and President Trump doesn't have the privilege  of having the political luxury to design five year plans, as the United  States capitalistic and political model specializes more on presidential  campaigning and less on economic planning, which is exactly China's  strength.

#### 3. The Chinese 'digital' empire.

China  is ideally positioned to become the new global power: it produces many  of our products and dominates most supply chains. It has been hoarding  gold and mines most of the Bitcoin. It might just have the right reserve  assets to back its DCEP, the digital Yuan, which will be pilot tested  during the 2022 Winter Olympics hosted by China. Despite the fact that  the United States and other western nations might not want to adopt the  Yuan or allow it to be part of the world's reserve assets, China can  demand payment in Yuan for its products. It's that simple! This is why  outsourcing is such as stupid economic voluntarily yet fatal policy. If  you only print money and don't produce goods, how long will the world  play ball?

One of the results of Trump's trade war is that China  and other countries such as Russia and Iran no longer want to be  vulnerable to U.S. sanctions that come in the shape of being denied  access to the financial system through Swift. The United States can  indeed destroy a big part of Iran's economy, but Iran is now becoming a  big cryptocurrency player. In other words, bullying those countries  might work in the short-term, but in the long-term they will simply  adopt a new standard: and I believe that the Yuan will likely play a  major role in the financial system they will adopt.

This trend  means that the expansion of the demand in U.S. Dollars will stop and  reverse, when countries no longer want to use the currency whose issuer  can economically destroy them through sanctions. The alternatives for  such countires are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and many  others, national CBDC's (Central Bank Digital Currencies), and the  adoption of the digital Yuan.

This digital Yuan will be attached  to the One Belt, One road initiative, finding adoption whilst developing  huge infrastructure projects that will lead to a Eurasian trading zone.  If the U.S. Military leaves the Middle East, as Trump brings home  troops, this will create the right conditions for China to emerge as the  victor.

#### 4. Surveillance Capitalism - Insights on the DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment, DC/EP):

1.  This centralized digital financial system works on blockchain and  cryptographic principles and aims to increase the circulation of the  RMB, in the hope it can become a reserve currency like the U.S. Dollar.

2. Created and sanctioned by the Chinese Government, it is the only legal digital currency in China.

3.  The system offers Chinese regulators better monitoring abilities and  will be an efficient tool against anonymous counterfeiting, money  laundering and illegal financing. At the same time it reduces costs  involved in maintaining and recycling bank notes and coins.

4. As  mentioned above, China aims to bypass Swift, which it regards to be a  U.S. entity, and will be able to collect real-time data related to money  creation, bookkeeping, essential information for the implementation of  monetary policies.

5. The pilot institutions for DCEP, China  Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China and  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, will serve as a production test  for China's new currency system, after which the DCEP will be  distributed to large fintech companies such as Tencent and Alibaba to be  used in WeChat Pay and AliPay. Transfers will not go through bank  accounts, but through electronic wallets.

6. By mandating that  all merchants who accept digital payments must accept DCEP, the DECP  will become the most accepted digital currency in the world.

#### 5. Sings of hope.

If  the United States adopts blockchain and issues a CBDC (Central Bank  Digital Currency) backed by Bitcoin, they will have a reasonable chance  to offer the western democracies a new type of dollar standard that can  be an anchor versus the coming RMB. If not, I fear the worst is yet to  come for the U.S. Dollar and its economy.

Many smart American  economists and Wall Street goeroe's have finally figured out the  remarkable strength of Bitcoin, the world's first and most favorite  digital form of gold.

Some of the smartest investment capitalists  like Ray Dalio and Warren Buffet have allocated more money into gold, a  clear sign of trouble. Bitcoin might be a step too far for Warren  Buffet, but rest assure that Wall Street investment management companies  have figured it out by now, have you?

You can expect more  institutions to allocate a % of their portfolio's wealth into Bitcoin  and other cryptocurrencies, as a hedge against the systemic risk in our  global financial system, which will inevitable start feeling the effects  of the trillions that have been printed.

j4vxvf,habitualpotatoes,Beware CGT!!! UK tax on BTC even when you think it doesn't apply to you!!!,"UK specific post - although the essence might be relevant for other markets. 

I recently became aware that HMRC views cryptocurrencies as a taxable item, that mainly attracts Capital Gains Tax. This may be commonly known on here, but I had done some prior research before starting to stack and was fairly confident in my mind that it was treated similarly to a currency &amp; therefore that, when it's your personal money, you wouldn't get taxed on it. So a slight bummer and better research needed - but glad I'm still trying to learn and read.

With this new found knowledge, I was still fairly satisfied with the impact on me - as I would only be liable for CGT when I disposed of the coins. My plan is to hold until it becomes a currency - so this is not really an issue. At worse it's a 20% tax on something that avoids holding a mass inflation of GBP in this time.

Reading into the HMRC paper though, they are counting a disposal of BTC (for example) not only when you sell for FIAT and 'realise the gains', but also if you buy another cryptocurrency with your BTC.

I hold an equal amount of another coin and have grown these on a 50/50 basis (I view that it is likely to  be the $ to BTC's gold position in the market and so both sides could end up being good calls (or both bad :shrug:)). The second coin I can't buy in GBP using the platform I purchase through, so have merrily been buying BTC and immediately using the BTC/Othercoin market to trade it across. Slightly more fees, than buying direct, but for my own sanity, I was happy with this.

Now in the normal world, this shouldn't be an issue as '1' BTC held for a short time then used to purchase another coin of the same FIAT value hasn't gained any value - so no CGT would be recognised.

BUT... HMRC are pooling the value of BTC you hold. So the outcome from dollar averaging. This means that although I buy '1' BTC at a cost of ¬£8k to swap it for '1' other coin, if my dollar cost average position is ¬£6k, then I am realising ¬£2k of profit from this trade - meaning that it attracts ¬£400 worth of tax liability. 

This is obviously a huge impact on something that was a simple 'lazy' step around having to use two exchanges to buy the two different coins, but I am sure that I am not the only one - especially when the exchange I use has ABSOLUTELY NO INFORMATION on the BTC/other currency markets to suggest that it attracts on this basis.  


Am I the only one who has fallen into this hole? Am I reading this wrong?

j4tsuj,iamnobodysfriend,Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong is a hero for not making Bitcoin about race,"&gt;It started back in June, amid the nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd, when Brian Armstrong, the company‚Äôs extremely introverted cofounder and CEO,  was asked a question at an employee town hall about why Coinbase had  not shown public support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Armstrong  declined to give a clear answer, according to crypto news site The Block, and his avoidance resulted in a virtual walkout by ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of Coinbase‚Äôs 1,100 employees on June 3. 

In response, Armstrong has made Coinbase's mission clear: it's not political. He has given severance packages to employees who disagree. And this, I believe, is how any business ought to be run. If you want to make \*everything\* political, you should join a political party. Corporations and businesses are not political. It's no different from the separation of Church and State. You ought to separate business from political, especially the feverish social-justice-warrior kind.

I think Armstrong deserves some goddamn respect for having a spine.

FYI- Bitcoin isn't about race. It isn't a ""white supremacist"" technology. Most Bitcoin miners are living in China. It's a global asset. Inventor Satoshi Nakamoto specifically designed Bitcoin to be able to process transactions on slow third-world internet connections (and it does work in Africa, and India, too). Bitcoin was always, first and foremost, a \*human\* technology, for everyone to use to avoid financial censorship.

j4to1e,SMOEY,Why DeFi will give birth to killer applications in the banking industry?," The financial system is on the verge of collapse, and there are no superheroes who can turn the tide in the real world.¬†Therefore, we must learn how to rely on our own hands to protect the money we have earned.¬†Currently, the best way is to store funds outside the traditional financial system.¬†Decentralized finance, or DeFi for short, may become a killer application in the banking industry.

**What exactly is DeFi?**

This is an ecosystem of financial applications built on the blockchain (especially Ethereum), which can operate independently without the intervention of third parties or intermediaries.¬†In 2020, the DeFi economy has grown by US$4 billion and is currently one of the fastest growing sectors in the financial sector.

**The main problem with DeFi**

Currently the only truly decentralized financial application is Bitcoin.¬†Anyone with access to the Internet can store and transfer funds in a decentralized manner.¬†But DeFi has made a further commitment: to introduce decentralization into the mainstream public view.¬†This will provide a global and open alternative to all financial services including savings, loans, investment and insurance.¬†Next, we will introduce three DeFi use cases that are sufficient to disrupt the traditional banking industry:

**1. Stablecoins**

Stablecoin is the first DeFi use case to achieve a blowout development.¬†The idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äùa cryptocurrency free from the long-term instability of Bitcoin‚Äù is very attractive to many people.¬†On the one hand, it has price stability similar to the US dollar or the euro; on the other hand, it also has the speed and convenience of cryptocurrency.¬†The stablecoin perfectly combines the advantages of the two.¬†Currently, about 80% of encrypted transactions are conducted through Tether stablecoin.¬†At the same time, other companies, such as USDC, TruUSD, Dai or PAX, have also experienced explosive growth in the past year.¬†Therefore, the stable currency market definitely deserves our continued attention and expectation.¬†After all, most bank customers are tired of inefficient and expensive services and increasing government supervision.

**2. Decentralized Exchanges**

Decentralized exchange (DEX) is one of the most breakthrough innovations derived from DeFi.¬†In recent years, the number of DEX has also shown explosive growth.¬†According to data from Dune Analytics, monthly transaction volume in 2020 has grown to nearly $12 billion.¬†So, what is DEX?¬†The essence of DEX is a cryptocurrency platform, users‚Äô assets can be traded without going through an exchange.¬†Therefore, the risk of being stolen and attacked by hackers can be greatly reduced.¬†Currently, the most popular DEX platforms are Curve, Balancer, 0x, Dydx, Kyber, Bancor, IDEX, Oasis and Gnosis Protocol.¬†But in fact, the ultimate reason for attracting people to join DEX is the growing and more complex ‚Äúknow your-client process (KYC)‚Äù demand.¬†It stripped the anonymity of customers and caused financial exclusion of more than 2.4 billion people.¬†They are like cancer, engulfing the entire banking system alive.

**3. Borrowing and Lending Applications**

To say the most compelling development in the DeFi field, one has to mention decentralized lending platforms.¬†The DeFi lending platform can provide loans to users or companies without any intermediaries.¬†Anyone can deposit their available assets into the shared loan pool, and those who want to borrow can withdraw assets from the pool.¬†Currently, the most popular DeFi loan platforms are Compound, Maker, Aave and dYdX.¬†At the same time, companies such as Blockfi, Celsius, CRED, Nexo and Crypto.com also provide annual interest rates of up to 10%.¬†The lending platform enhances the flexibility of banking business and removes strict threshold restrictions on the location, identity, and assets of customers.¬†This use case is expected to lead DeFi into the mainstream market.

**4. Insurance**

The form of DeFi insurance is still relatively conservative.¬†It mainly acts as a safety net in the DeFi ecosystem.¬†Users no longer need traditional banks or institutions to ensure the safety of their deposits.¬†Although decentralized insurance is not popular in the entire DeFi community at present, it is likely to disrupt the entire insurance industry in the future.¬†If you want to learn about insurance products other than traditional insurance companies, you can check out Nexus Mutual, Opyn, Etherisc and CDx.

**Next, where are we going?**

DeFi is an interesting idea with trillions of dollars in potential.¬†If we compare DeFi with the traditional financial system, it is not difficult to find the fatal attraction in DeFi.¬†As you can see, some DeFi projects have replaced part of the business in the centralized encryption economy, and it will not be long before it will begin to replace the traditional banking and insurance industries.¬†Now, the financial system needs to be repaired-to make it more transparent, open and efficient.¬†Otherwise, if we don‚Äôt properly wrap up this broken financial system, 20 years later, we will eventually pay for our stupidity at this moment.

But one particular friend I was explaining it to and he set up a wallet and I sent him some coin so he could see how it works.  Years later when the price had exploded I know exactly what my friend is sitting on but don't say anything.  Come to find out he had erased the wallet almost immediately.  He didn't say it but I feel that  his opinion of bitcoin was a reflection of his opinion of me. He got a wallet to humor me. Rolling  his eyes when he deleted it. 
Shortly after the boom he sheepishly reached out and starts asking about how he might acquire some bitcoin but he lives in New York and apparently it's not easy to buy there? I'm not sure

Pywallet, Hex, and where to go next.","I have 2 hard drives I am currently searching for a bitcoin wallet from when a friend introduced me to btc and we mined for fun a long time ago. Estimated timeframe would have been 2010-2013 but most likely toward the earlier side. I do not recall any encryption. 

Using regular recovery software I managed to find a handful of wallets however they turned out to be dogecoin wallets that I was able to recover some loose change out of, but not after having opened it in bitcoin core and giving myself a good boost of false hope -_- . The wallet.dat files I have recovered so far were created in 2013 and 2015, which I think must be all dogecoin as I had btc before I had any doge.

I have been hesitant to post requesting help as I am sure it gets posted often enough, however, I feel out of options. Here is what I have done so far:

Created forensic images of both drives so don't worry about that

Downloaded the whole bitcoin core and doge blockchains and tested the wallets I had recovered.

Recovered some doge

Tried to salvage the recovered wallets  that didn't open in both btc and doge wallets

Searching the wallets I have found for hex data for BTC hex data

Searched the images for '30 81 D3 02 01 01 04 20' and '30 82 01 13 02 01 01 04 20'

If these hex strings are not present, is it safe to say the wallet no longer exists and should I not bother with Pywallet? I was going to try pywallet anyway but all the forums I have been reading have dead links and am unsure if there is an official github anymore.

Using the Hex format (0-9,A-F,a-f) you can enter 32 - 128 characters, 2 digits at a time and derive addresses. You can type in 128 zeros and I can also type in 128 zeros and we get the same address and key.

32  zeros  
34  zeros  
36  zeros  
38  zeros  
40  zeros

j2xl4n,c0tt0nc4ndyTA,Future Of Trading course now free! From c0tt0nc4ndyta.,"Hello everyone, I'm a high level daytrader who works all over the world with fortune 500 companies, exchanges, high level trading teams, ceo's awith their boards, large private investors, some family offices, and various tier 1 holding co's. For the past few years I've been developing educational series, and courses that cost between $8,000.00 and $50,000.00 as I'm considered one of the best in my field and a top level trader by reputation for many years now.

I've recently decided to release one of my major paid courses, which is the corner stone to beginning trading at an advanced level **for free**. The price of this course was $8700.00 and is regarded as one of the best courses available anywhere in the world.

You can find it here on my youtube channel here:  [https://www.youtube.com/c0tt0nc4ndyTA](https://www.youtube.com/c0tt0nc4ndyTA) , which is now being released as of this week, or on my training website [gatex.io](https://www.gatex.io) which also has fully interactive quizzes that I develop for every single lesson, again this is free and not a paid feature. The course on [gatex.io](https://gatex.io) is not released as free yet will be released along side of the youtube course to allow people to take the insanely challenging quizzes. Again, free no add-ons or sign up fees. Purely free unless you're looking at my other courses by choice.

&amp;#x200B;

My loyal community who purchased this course, enjoyed it, and used it to make careers for themselves over the past two years was given twice the cost of the course towards the next course as a thank you from me personally. (I went above and beyond for my community on this as it felt like the right thing to do for my legacy supporters)

&amp;#x200B;

I do have a patreon as well if anyone wants to join my discord channel, just google patreon c0tt0nc4ndyta.

j2uq9i,Soggy_Patience,quantum computers ... soft fork...,"\&gt; In light of the emerging threat of powerful quantum computers appearing in the near future, we investigate the potential attacks on Bitcoin available to a quantum-capable adversary. In particular, we illustrate how Shor‚Äôs quantum algorithm can be used to forge ECDSA based signatures, allowing attackers to hijack transactions. We then propose a simple commit‚Äìdelay‚Äìreveal protocol, which allows users to securely move their funds from non-quantum-resistant outputs to those adhering to a quantum-resistant digital signature scheme. In a previous paper¬†(Stewart et al. R. Soc. Open Sci. 5(6), 180410 (2018)) \[[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-37110-4_9#CR1)\] we presented a similar scheme with a long fixed delay. Here we improve on our previous work, by allowing each user to choose their preferred delay‚Äìlong for a low risk of attack, or short if a higher risk is acceptable to that user. As before, our scheme requires modifications to the Bitcoin protocol, but once again these can be implemented as a soft fork.

Unsurprisingly, I've had no takers (since 2013!) I'm thinking maybe it'd be a good idea to include a QR code on each invoice, a payment QR code to a wallet, in the amount of 10% less than the invoice. The QR code would provide visibility (no one reads fine print) and if someone scans it it would take them to the edge of the crypto rabbit hole.

Is there a good tool for doing this? I imagine the wallet for the code would have to be a BTC wallet, but if they called me and wanted to pay in some other currency, I could set it up. The tool would need to run on PC, since I create my invoices in Excel.",1601495457,15,1

Miners obtain a fixed fee when a block is mined (from the coinbase transaction), plus all the transaction fees of transactions included in the block.

Why do miners not always fill their blocks completely to the brim with transactions?

Many blocks I see before segwit was introduced are not of size 1Mb, while the mempool of available transactions was not empty at that time. Why would miners send out a block filled only partially with transactions?

Definitions from [glassnode.com](https://glassnode.com) 

UTXO in Profit - The number of unspent transaction outputs whose price at creation time was lower than the current price.

Total Supply in Profit - The circulating supply in profit, i.e. the amount of coins whose price  at the time they last moved was lower than the current price

&amp;#x200B;

The UTXO metric makes sense to me. The timestamp of creation for each UTXO is available. You can get the price at that timestamp and compare to the current price...above (loss) or below (profit). 

&amp;#x200B;

The total supply metric is hanging me up in two areas...I don't know exactly what the mean by ""move"". Does that mean when the UTXO was transacted and subsequently destroyed, a UTXO can only be spent once to prevent double spend right? When you ""move"" a BTC you really create a new UTXO for the receiver and a second UTXO if the sender is due change. I don't understand describing that as ""move"". 

And ""supply"" in this context of comparing to UTXO is unclear to me. I get that total supply is \~18.5m BTC mined and circulating. But how are you tracking whether a BTC is in profit or not when BTC are often carved up by the UTXO processing? If I mined a BTC and spent .1% of it over 10 transactions...that BTC doesn't really exist anymore...because it's UTXO doesn't exist. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that is clear. Any help would be appreciated.",1602376577,3,1

""Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment and provides a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system, which aligns with the company‚Äôs purpose,"" the company¬†said in a statement.

""We believe that bitcoin has the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future,‚Äù said Square CFO Amrita Ahuja. ""For a company that is building products based on a more inclusive future, this investment is a step on that journey.""

Characterized by Square as a mission-driven investment, Dorsey's $50 million buy comes amid his¬†very public spat¬†over corporate responsibility with another crypto-friendly CEO: Coinbase's Brian Armstrong.

Dorsey chided Armstrong last week for discouraging his employees from engaging in activism in the workplace. Armstrong said it was a corporate imperative; Dorsey framed it as a hypocritical botch.

""Bitcoin (aka ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù) is direct activism against an unverifiable and exclusionary financial system which negatively affects so much of our society,"" Dorsey tweeted in response to Armstrong's blog post.

Square is also now the second technology firm to go long on bitcoin in recent months, after MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm, crowned the crypto its treasury reserve asset of choice.

MicroStrategy invested $425 million bitcoin over a series of disclosures that pumped the stock's value and revealed its CEO, Michael Saylor, to be an unexpectedly vocal bitcoin maximalist.

But Square's bitcoin investment is far more in line with its corporate identity and business services than was the case for MicroStrategy.

The firm's Cash app is a critical bitcoin entry point for many retail investors. It has become a major¬†revenue driver¬†for the publicly traded fintech.",1602183593,3,1

I am currently working with bitcoin data from the blockchain. From mid-2017, I observe that block sizes are exceeding the 1MB mark.
To the best of my knowledge, this is due to a new protocol called Segwit, but when measuring blocksizes in a different unit, for example ‚Äúweight units‚Äù or ‚Äúvbytes‚Äù, blocks are still capped at 4M weight units or 1M vbytes. 

I am very interested in a data file that contains the size of blocks in weight units or vbytes. Is there a method that translates the data of a block to its size in weight units  / vbytes? 

Thank you!",1602170010,4,1

I know that Hargreaves Lansdown uk users had access to some of the Europe bitcoin ETNs? But I guess that won't be happening anymore after the FCA in the uk has banned everything like that.

What other options are there for uk pension holders?

For clarity: I'm talking about fiat that is locked into a (uk) pension.  If I could I would obviously remove funds and buy bitcoin directly into addresses I hold private keys for.  But the constraint here is it has to be done from within a uk pension using existing funds.",1602169785,26,1

The problem is that I recently just became aware and realized that one of the Minecraft servers that I was obsessed with back in about 6th grade (around 2010 I believe) used Bitcoin as a way to make purchases on the server. This was my favorite server, so for my birthday, my mom gave me $200 dollars to spend however I wanted, and I spent it all on bitcoin so I could get armor, costumes, and stuff like that in the game. A few weeks went by, and just like every other 6th grader on the planet, my interests and hobbies would change quite rapidly, and I stopped playing Minecraft. I believe that I spent about $50 worth of bitcoin and the rest is sitting in a virtual wallet waiting for me to access it. 

Now me and my brother have researched everything we could about this in the last few weeks, but as of now, we are not pros and simply know the basics of what we can possibly do. I know I need a 6 digit code to access my wallet, and I specifically remember having the number written on a paper stuck in my room, but I have no clue what that number is and have moved several times since then so there is zero chance of finding that paper. 

There is a lot of money on the line and if any of you guys have information that could help me get access to my digital wallet I will probably tattoo your reddit name on my body I‚Äôd be so happy.

Any help you guys could give me I would love but I understand that things like this are highly complex. I appreciate any suggestions or anyone that takes time to help me out.",1602465119,12,1

j9fqd5,ChuckBevitt,Coin Caf√© endorsement and small warning,"I got hit with ransomware back in 2015. Used Coin Caf√© to buy $500 (yes I paid - wearing a paper bag over my head) in bitcoin. Of course, I bought a few dollars over because bitcoin value fluctuated somewhat. After the pain of this, I didn't want to have anything to do with it anymore and abandoned the account.

Well, a few months ago, I started getting emails from Coin Caf√© saying that I had to log in at least once a year to keep the account open. I ignored the first couple, then said what the heck - I knew the email address because of which of my email addresses it was sent to. Did Forgot Password bit and got into my account. Those couple of dollars over were now about $1400!

I had to go through an extensive account validation process before I could do any more that just look at the account - email front and back of my driver's license, email photo of me holding the license, email recent bank statement and utility bill, etc. Finally, I was able to sell the bitcoin and transfer the balance to my bank account:)

Coin Caf√© really went the second mile holding my account for so long and pestering me to log in to keep it open. These are really honest people - a less scrupulous outfit could have just done nothing and kept the money. Big endorsement of them.

The small warning is this - they required extensive documentation to validate the account, as they should have. However, that means that they have all this extensive documentation which, in the wrong hands, could let a hacker open accounts in my name or even take over an existing account. I believe that they have top flight security, but so did {insert company of your choice} when they got hacked. So always be mindful of security - freezing credit bureaus, two factor authentication, complex passwords, etc., and always monitor your accounts.

Once again, thanks Coin Caf√©.",1602458251,3,1

If not, what prevents it from not going down? I know it is the reserve currency of the world but printing more USD doesn't automatically mean there will be high numbers of inflation (or perhaps hyperinflation)?

What is the difference in regards to the recent tragic events in Turkey, Libanon, Argentine, Venezuela, etc.? Is it all because of money printing that these currencies lost all of their purchasing power? It looks as if other countries will follow? 

I find this very interesting but I still can't see the full big picture. Any good sources to keep learning about all this?

Do you guys believe the Euro and Dollar one day will completely dissapear? If they go to a digital Euro/Dollar .. How will that be different from the cash we are using right now?

Do you think the Euro will get the same faith as the USD? I keep reading about money printing in the USA but I hardly read anything about Europe (I live in Europe btw). 

I invested a lot of my money into Bitcoin. It's actually the only asset I currently bought as an investment. I am thinking about buying stocks (particularly index funds) since every money book I read recommends this and i also want to diversify a little for if BTC would fail. Now I'm wondering in which index fund I should invest .. I particularly wonder if America will remain the most powerful capitalist country or if China will take over in the next 50 years ..

COMPUTER

I use Linux (Debian) as my primary host system, a VPN that runs 24/7 in the background and a virtual machine that runs  the latest version of tails (Without using persistent storage).

NOTE: My computer was wiped before installing Linux, it is setup with luks encryption and the BIOS is locked down.

ACCOUNTS

I use 5 temp protonmail accounts,
I use all 5 for separate Bitcoin wallets,
1 account I use to buy the Bitcoin,
3 accounts for mixing, e.g: mix&gt;move&gt;mix&gt;move&gt;mix&gt;move.
And the last account for buying.

*I will not be using any personal information during the process*

BUYING THE BITCOIN

I will extract cash from my credit card at a bank, use the cash to buy non-refillable pre-paid debit cards, buy Bitcoin from a exchange *definitely not coin base* and lastly dispose the pre-paid cards.


*After I use the Bitcoin I will delete all accounts and restart the process when I'm going to buy something*

I hope you‚Äôre all having a great night. 

I‚Äôve been an avid follower of Cathie Wood and her Ark funds for the past several years. As a result, I‚Äôve had very solid gains in the stock market following her advice. She recently said a well rounded portfolio should contain at least 5% of Bitcoin. Here‚Äôs my problem, I have none at the moment. I‚Äôm heavily invested in Fintech companies, and ARKF. Essentially I‚Äôm investing in companies that will benefit from the rise of Bitcoin. Seems silly not to invest in actual Bitcoin. 

I currently have about 100k in stock market, and roughly 20k in cash. I can‚Äôt help but think my cash is just losing value sitting in the bank. I‚Äôve downloaded cash app and have yet to pull the trigger on purchasing some bitcoin. This is not something I would actively trade. I‚Äôd buy and hold. I‚Äôd love to here some of your thoughts on how to approach this. Buy now? Wait until after the election? My risk tolerance in fairly high. I was considering just dropping 5k into bitcoin and seeing what happens... Have a missed the boat? Is it worth it?

jcbxb3,Curious-Breakfast597,There has to be a cheaper method.,"So I usually use cash app, and then transfer to my cold wallet. But for whatever reason I can no longer keep using this method and I have to use a method that requires no verification.

So, I‚Äôve decided that the only method possible for this is to use a bitcoin atm. The only problem is that freaking ATM isthe ONLY brand of ATM in my entire area, and I‚Äôm talking 50 miles out, and it charges 25-30% on the dollar in fees. It‚Äôs CRAZY. 

So my 1300 will turn into like 1050 or something. Boooo.

There has to be a cheaper way for me to go about buying bitcoin. Verification doesn‚Äôt really scare me necessarily, the problem is I don‚Äôt want to go be dumping cash in my bank account and then buying bitcoin every single week. It‚Äôs sketchy. 

I don‚Äôt know what else to do. So I turn here for advice.

Generally these fall under three types of traders/mindsets; a trader, gamber or a spectator. A trader is a person who generally takes risk and reward deeply into consideration and trades on a daily to weekly basis. While a gambler is a person who acknowledges the risks and rewards but is far more inclined to taking higher chances on trades to result in ‚Äúhopefully‚Äù much higher rewards. Finally, a spectator is generally someone who might or might not know what or how cryptocurrency works, and chooses to observe while gathering knowledge. They generally are brought in by the hype of cryptocurrency and are watching to see how or when it rises and falls. This type is often too cautious to buy into a cryptocurrency as it is usually considered a volatile market and their lack of knowledge on the subject.¬†

jc79wb,iamnobodysfriend,"If you leave your coins on a Chinese exchange, the Chinese state may seize them","I know OKEX is incorporated in Malta/Europe, but the exchange's execs are in China. Even the one(!) guy apparently holding the key to sign withdrawals is in China, and under investigation there. Has he been forced to disclose his key to state actors by now? Consider OKEX compromised. That means: get everything you own off there, now.

Though the majority of miners in Chinese, mind you that most buyers of crypto assets are--obviously--rich Westerners. An exchange like OKEX is worth many, many billions of USD$. In a financial war between the US and China, China could easily seize Binance/Huobi/OKEX and other exchanges under their territorial control, even ones incorporated in Malta if the execs are in Beijing.

Get a real wallet, like Wasabi or even Bitcoin core or even Coinbase's dedicated wallet app, but ffs, get your coins off the exchanges. Exchanges can be seized by state powers, execs can be imprisoned, HQ's can be robbed, key holders can be abducted by terrorists, etc. etc.

jd6mx7,RobbWhite_,My Vision on Events and the Future of Bitcoin.,"Everyone‚Äôs debt relies on the fact that everyone else pays their debt. Government is in debt, billionaires, millionaires, people with 6 figures, the average worker, even the students. Our god is debt, and that‚Äôs why many refuse to look at the world in a different way.

So at the moment you have a big subsection of the entire population of the world that can‚Äôt pay their debt and they will be given options to help pay that and hold it off. But that relies on jobs, mental health, consistency and public order in overall compliancy with the system

it‚Äôs hit a level where to many holes are in the wall from to many different dimensions and the only thing that creates value in currencies drowned in debt is the fact that people are oblivious to the situation, paralysed by the fear and willing to continue for normalcy.

Fear is always overstated in hindsight and the western world has detached people from their ability to communicate with this process by hijacking people‚Äôs amygdala‚Äôs with 24/7 news with problems derived from the curations of a debt driven society.

Then people join a group to fight the system by using the system to elevate their cause. We start arguing about who‚Äôs the biggest victim, all stimulated by people who make money off this to pay off debt and benefit from the lower classes not self organising.

The magic about systems is most people don‚Äôt understand how interwoven they are into every fabric of society and the minds of how people see reality. World economies are the top dog in system hierarchy and when they‚Äôre dying it creates the vision that the world is too.

The only answer I see out of this mess, and why I don‚Äôt worry as much because humans are instinctual to evolutionary survival is gradual or sudden change to a new system that is better.

Some will hang onto the system as long as they can, mostly those benefiting from it and so heavily dependent on its survival. Others will form socialist societies and fall to the flaws of humans as they always do. Others will take the most profitable route for their own selfishness.

And that would be bitcoin and cryptocurrencies I presume as they will offer value and riches, but security, incentivised debt free money making economies that provide growth, and they extend a hand for everyone of all classes to pull themselves out of the current system and start fresh.

And people see that as bad but when you don‚Äôt have system that‚Äôs heavily indebted you actually can move and make changes in the world. You can organise people in magical ways and you can create wealth and jobs in sectors that people haven‚Äôt realised are there yet.

It‚Äôs the top dog system, it just needs to be healthy it doesn‚Äôt need to solve the worlds problems, people can do that, and they‚Äôll do it very quickly if the body of the world is in the right health to accompany you.

The check mate scenario crypto has is pretty amazing and an undervalued talking point is that it will self organise the most intelligent people in the world at the top of wealth which people aren‚Äôt used to. We have one, that‚Äôs Elon musk, imagine 100's of Elon‚Äôs organising society.

The world will realise that they have no reason for their allegiance to the god of debt when given a path to the new god of wealth and prosperity.",1602981580,1,1

At this point, I'm just trying to expand my portfolio to include crypto. So my plan is, when I add investment funds, I take 5% of the total and throw it into crypto.

The problem with leaving my crypto in coinbase is obvious. And since it's a buy-and-hold situation, I really don't need my key to ever touch a network until I want to sell. So I set up my FDE offline debian box with the bitaddress git repository, generated a paper wallet, and printed it to an offline printer.

Then I start reading more, and it's all ""DANGER! PAPER WALLETS ARE INSECURE!""

One of the big ones they hammer on is address reuse. Am I supposed to hold every btc purchase in a separate wallet? I'll have 80 different wallets to keep track of in 5 years time.

There's also been some concern expressed with regards to the algorithm itself, and I can see this. I don't particularly trust anything that hinges on javascript. So what can I use for offline generation of key/address pairs? I'm not looking for advanced mnemonics or anything else between me and the key (notwithstanding the AES on my backups.)

No, I haven't bought that many back then, even though it was so incredibly cheap, and I could have. I was into the tech and ignorant of economics. Now I've spent a few years down the rabbit hole. Deep. Down. The. Rabbit. Hole.

I won't disclose how much I have. It's not that much I guess, but for me it's about 35% of my net worth in Bitcoin. I'm 45 years old and earn in the top 2%.

I do have this pension fund, which I honestly believe I'll never get to enjoy. If I sell it, I pay a ""penalty"" of about 33% in taxes. And if I sell it I can enlarge my holdings by 40%. 

Currently, I can retire comfortably if Bitcoin gets to $100k. If I liquidate the pension fund, I can retire when Bitcoin hits $60k (give or take).

Right now the only reasons I even keep paying into this Pension fund is because:

1. My country mandates it. I have to.
2. It's a hedge again Bitcoin. Essentially a hedge against me being wrong about everything and being an idiot.

Should I go all in?

jcwy14,AfshinNoorozi,What factors affect the bitcoin trend this week?," 

**I wrote a short and useful article about Bitcoin this week, I hope it is useful**

**Bitcoin continued its uptrend, starting last week above $ 11,000. Is $ 12,000 the next target or will the bears dominate the market?**

**US elections could bring the dollar back to 2018 levels**

*In the fourth quarter of 2020, Bitcoin remains sensitive to macro phenomena, and the US election process could cause significant market turmoil.*

*The dangers of weakening the dollar lie in wait*

*Expect a price of $ 4,000 for gold. It could be possible*

*In addition, the introduction of the corona vaccine instead of helping the strength of the dollar, Make Prevents it.*

*The good news about the Corona vaccine schedule could bring the dollar and the DXY index back to their 2018 low.*

**Europe's battle with Brexit and the Corona**

*In the case of the coronavirus, new restrictions imposed across Europe raise further economic concerns. With the ""second wave of the corona virus"" apparently underway, various countries are trying to impose curfews this week. Amid the turmoil, the Brexit talks have added to Britain's troubles, and the country has only a few days to reach an agreement to leave the EU. In the United States, politicians have not yet been able to agree on a new stimulus package that Americans considered possible after the approval of the second stimulus check for $ 1,200 by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Despite the unfavorable situation, US stocks rose 0.25% in the S&amp;P 500 before trading on Monday.*

**High bitcoin hash rate**

*The Bitcoin network is in a favorable position this week in terms of fundamental factors. The hash rate of this network reached its highest level over the weekend, and this shows that more than ever, computing power is allocated to extraction. According to data from regulatory sources Bitinfocharts and Blockchain, the hash rate has reached 155 exa / s (EH / s), which has increased tenfold during the historic ceiling of $ 20,000 in December 2017. It is difficult to accurately measure the amount of hashes, and different tools produce different results, but the message is clear: miners are superior to bitcoin.*

*They show that increasing the hash rate and increasing the difficulty of the network will increase the price of bitcoin. ""The real price of Bitcoin based on the current hash rate is about $ 32,000.""*

*The difficulty of the network has not yet shown signs that the hash rate is reaching a new record in the short term. Monday's assessments showed that the next adjustment will be neither up nor down, just like in the past*

**Integration of desires**

*According to the Index of Fear and Greed, investors tend to move slowly towards Bitcoin. Market data show that after August and saturation warnings, the market is now balancing with a downward slope. The index was 52 on Monday and crossed 50 for the first time since the weekend of September 21. These tendencies put investors in a ""neutral"" position compared to August's intense greed and subsequent fear. The purpose of this index is to show when a global sale is made in the range of zero to 100. Fluctuations, movements and market volume are half of the factors that determine the score of this index.*

**Higher goals**

*Finally, while few expect a sudden sell-off above $ 11,000, Bitcoin experts are betting on higher targets.*

*The $ 11,000 area was previously an important area for failure, and the $ 10,800 is known as a ""pivot"" point that could push the market higher after the correction. Bitcoin retreated to the $ 10,800 level and the key $ 11,150 level, closing its daily and weekly candle at around $ 11,400.*",1602947913,2,1

I would pay something like 5¬¢ or less per transaction. I remember buying a $2.50 can of coke once with bitcoins and it was no problem.

Now it looks like transaction fees are like $3? Can somebody catch me up on what happened? How did we get to this point? Is there any work in progress for a mechanism by which to lower these fees? I understand that these fees grow as a function of how many transactions need to be handled (just supply and demand) but I had assumed there would some scaling mechanism in place.

A fee that high makes it impractical to use Bitcoin for anything less than $100+ (Stripe charges 2.9% for credit cards). The average citizen no longer has any use case in any practical day to day use unless they're making bigger purchases. I would be blown away if there aren't smart minds working on a way to reduce that cost.

I recall some project called the Lightening network was being made to reduce transaction time. IIRC, some decentralization was exchanged for faster confirmations ‚Äî¬†but that wasn't a big deal because small transactions are highly unlikely to be tampered with. Is there not something similar that does the same for fees?

Unlike many others that post here, asking for donations, I am **not** in ""dire need""... What I am is tired of watching the rich get richer while the poor get poorer. It bothers me to no end that so many people are starving and struggling to get by in these hard times. While I do not have the means to help those people, I would love to be able to.

If there happens to be someone out there that has the means to help those in need, ***please do so!***

If you *do* have the means to help people, but don't know how to or are too shy to do so, send some BTC to the following address.

If you don't have any BTC, don't worry. There are other ways to help people in need. It may not be financial help, but even talking with someone and letting them vent can help. Reach out and lend that helping hand. With the current state of the world and the troubles that we all face, there are plenty of people that can use the help.",1602630028,0,1

My first post to the forum and something that has been bugging me a bit. This may sound a bit conspiratorial but i think it's a valid concern.

In light of Covid-19, the ongoing devastation to the economy and continued lockdowns looking to continue this trend, the outlook for our financial systems looks bleak. 

You may say, but this is great for crypto and Bitcoin? But given the World Economic Forum have floated their plans for an economic reset ([https://www.weforum.org/great-reset](https://www.weforum.org/great-reset)) right at the start of the pandemic, where does this leave bitcoin and digital currencies once they plan to move us into a different financial system? Perhaps a financial system that could be based on earning cryptocurrency through body activity data ([https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2020060606&amp;tab=PCTBIBLIO](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2020060606&amp;tab=PCTBIBLIO)).

jag76x,samdane7777,What the Department of Justices Recent Obession with Cryptography and Crypto is About,"I often post things here that really come across as fud, but what we have seen these last couple months is an explosion in regulator activity. The way the US federal government works, is it sits on cases for years at a time in secrecy, and then it attacks.

There are many obscure laws that people are all unaware of which entirely relate to the war on terror and 9/11 and the Patriot Act. The truth is that most of these banking laws that changed are a result of their pretense to behave like a police state under the guise of fighting terrorism. Well What does that have to do with bitcoin?

&amp;#x200B;

They want to set the precedence of those anti terrorism laws and banking laws onto end to end encryption and bitcoin. These people have a clear motive they are trying to keep hid, that crypto lawyer are beginning to speculate isn't off the table. They certainly implied in the DoJ 83 page report that those options are on the table. But the truth is, they \*already\* want to do it anyways.

Before I make the case for what I am alleging you need to know about the key regulatory bodies and some of these laws, which I'm just gonna list for you to research in case you doubt me:

1) OFAC 2)FATF 3)BIS 4)Interpol 5)Banking Secrecy Act 6)Treasury Department 7)Federal Reserve

Namely, What can the US do under OFAC in the guise of anti terrorism. Well the short answer is ANYTHING. And that is what this 83 page guide by Barr is claiming, that is what the Bitmex Indictment by the Department of Justice is claiming, that is what they have been doing in Afghanistan and Iraq for 20 years. It's been like this since 9/11 and now they are squaring in on crypto.

***It is clear that the Department of Justice and AG Barr do not want Bitcoin to function as Bitcoin, much like end to end encryption they want a back door***

But let's talk about what that ***looks*** like.

1) Forcing every country in the world to enforce mandatory KYC on all decentralized smart contracts and all centralized exchanges with the threat of extrajudicial indictment and OFAC black listing for Banking Secrecy Act violations and Terrorism funding.

2) Forcing every country to prohibit withdrawls to any non preregistered white listed address that has been vetted by CipherTrace and Chain Analysis with the threat as stated in 1)

3) Forcing every country to prohibit US customers from making an account without extremely profoundly high regulatory costs, thus trapping capital in the united states and prohibiting US citizen from investing overseas, as most modern Banks today will no longer take Americans as customers overseas, due to the same regulatory threats.

4) Forcing every merchant in America, and as many outside of America to use Chain Analysis and Cipher Trace on all transactions to vet the source of the funds, ***and if those funds do not have a chain of custody on a public blockchain linking back to a white listed kyced account, then rejecting those transactions (no more monero)***

5) Forcing every exchange in the world to do the same chain of custody verification on every customer just as above.

6) Disallowing any deposits in a US financial exchange to cash out without said chain of custody.

7) Disallowing any cash out of funds that have not been declared as owned assets in a perpetually pervasively monitored public address that the US regulatory bodies know about.

8) ***The constant threat of censorship and forced confiscation.***

9) ***The backdooring of all hardware wallets and software wallets, prosecution of developers. Indictments against Trezor and Ledgernano.***

10) ***Perpetual Surveilance***

My brother was murdered, and his mac laptop has been seized by the cops. 

Not sure when/if we'll get his laptop back but we have his Apple ID login so we can access a lot of his computer stuff and texts...etc. 

He was a big investor in blockchain, soemtimes with a friend, and we see him talking about owning some. 

But none of the texts show his magic wallet ID, and not sure we're ever going to be allowed access to his laptop again...

Any tips for where we should look? Certain applications or folders or popular services to check? Maybe a file extension, or even a flash drive?  Just not sure i'll know how to recognize it when i find it.

jb8rbx,we-coach-crypto,6 Things To Think About Before Investing In Cryptocurrencies Like Bitcoin," 

**1. Is it affordable?**  
This is an important thing to think about, don‚Äôt get caught in the hype of current prices. Only invest what you can afford to lose, re-mortgaging your house to invest is not a smart move!

**2. Research the marketplace thoroughly**  
If you don‚Äôt know anything about the project you are investing into or the market itself, you are creating more risk. Education is paramount, if you don‚Äôt know anything about the market, find someone that does.

**3. Time Horizon**  
Equally important to understand that once you invest, it may be some time before you can access your funds. Markets do not travel in a straight line, so some days you could be up and others you could be down. Timing is key, if you invest during a bear market you could be waiting a while to get your money back.

**4. Pulling Profits**  
You need to execute a plan for reaching goals, this should include targets that you monitor and act upon to pull regular profits during times where the market goes up. This will not only start to cover your initial investment but also help educate you on when to take action to ensure you have a good return on your investment.

**5. Create an emergency fund for unforeseen circumstances**  
There could not be a more uncertain time in people‚Äôs lives than right now. Jobs are at risk with lots of business closures as a result of Covid-19 and lockdown. We cannot look into the future but we can prepare for it. Try and get completely debt free and at least 3 months ahead for living expenses before choosing to invest. This gives you a cushion for some time if you lose your job and need to search for a new one.

**6. Risk vs Reward**  
The [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) market is extremely volatile, this means that the risk vs reward is extremely high. There are over 5500 [coins/tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies) you can choose to invest into. Some are established projects that are changing the world and could become the new major players in town further down the line. Many of them are not, history teaches us that sometimes a fantastic idea can also be destroyed in seconds by a slightly better idea. This happens a great deal in this market, without educating yourself and following industry news, you can easily get caught out and lose money. Research and understand the projects, look into the team behind them, their activity and engagement online, their whitepaper and see what partnerships they have.

So when you are setting a transaction in your wallet, you are basically informing Bitcoin network participants (miners) to put a lock on a specific amount of Bitcoin with a given Public-key or address.

So I was hoping it would get back to that or crack 12 which it did so I got out hoping to get back in at a lower price for the final ride up the ladder. Maybe it will just keep going but I‚Äôm hoping it will slide back down around or after election time so I can buy in at a better price and then stay there forever.

jfkngp,brianddk,Spending an OP_HODL (CheckLockTimeVerify) address with Electrum.,"I've been playing around with `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` (op_hodl) for the last few weeks since I haven't found it easy to do in many wallets.  Eariler [I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/jehmtn/more_fun_with_op_hodl_checklocktimeverify/) on using the CoinBin wallet interface (locally) to do it, and before that [I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/jawpsk/fun_with_op_hodl_checklocktimeverify/) a P2WSH [bitcoinlib script](https://github.com/brianddk/reddit/blob/f8e6798d80d60181715fa6babcfd4a1637a7190e/python/spend-p2sh-txout-tz.py) to do it.

Today I finally sat down and wrote a script using only Electrum's API.  You can run it as any Python script by having Electrum installed from source.  Or if your cavalier (and crazy) you can run it directly from the electrum console with the following command, assuming you put the script in `C:\temp`.

```
with open(r""C:\temp\elec-p2sh-hodl.py"", 'r') as s: exec(s.read())
```

You should be noted, that one should ***NEVER*** do this, since is effectively giving me control of your Electrum wallet (bad).  It is coded to testnet if that is any consolation.

The script is designed to recreate [TXN a8110...adc93](https://live.blockcypher.com/btc-testnet/tx/a8110bbdd40d65351f615897d98c33cbe33e4ebedb4ba2fc9e8c644423dadc93/), but with Electrum 4.0.4, the [R-value grinding](https://new.reddit.com/r/Electrum/comments/jf97pc/weird_behavior_when_scripting_electrums/) causes the signature size to differ, causing signature malleability.  Apparently CoinBin and bitcoinlib haven't followed Core when they made this change in 0.17.0.  TXN is still valid, just with a different hash.

If you want to spend a different OP_HODL address, you can hopefully see the simple fields required to change.",1603311144,8,1

What if you woke up tomorrow and bitcoin was at 25k? 50k? Would you sell all or some of your bitcoins?

For me, I think at the psychological barrier of $100,000 USD, I would sell half my bitcoins. I might sell 25% of my BTC at $50k, but only with the hope that it would crash and I could buy back more later.

At $250,000 per bitcoins I would sell everything I have.

In all the years I've been following BTC, this news ranks, IMO, as among the most powerful.

It may severely limit the ability for whales and traders to manipulate BTC.

It may finally ""decouple"" BTC from the stock market.

jfi11l,Troflecopter,Sorry folks.,"Sorry guys and gals.

I am new here.

Been watching Bitcoin since like 2013 and never ever bought in.

Always seemed like it would just never really ""take off"", because it's so damn hard to actually buy things with it. And since bitcoin wasn't being used as a currency, but rather a speculative bet, it just seemed like a big bubble that I didn't want to be part of. 

The March dip didn't feel right. The August surge didn't feel right. Just shied away all the time.

Anyways, I just wanted to apologize because as soon as I saw the PayPal announcement (4 hours late to the party), I dumped about $10k in.

And I have to say sorry because have like the worst luck in investing ever.

Since I bought in, she seems to have tapered out.

It seems I have jinxed you all and I am sorry.

Sincerely,

Mr. Bad Luck Bets.",1603303236,5,1

jfhzby,qualitycannabisnw,Is this a viable route for my btc?,"I want to anonymize my btc and reduce my UTXO‚Äôs. After some research this is my plan:

1) Move btc from hardware wallet UTXO‚Äôs in decent sized chunks (20% of total holdings at a time) to Wasabi wallet. 

2) Perform coinjoin on each 20% chunk of my (small) btc holdings.

3) Perform second coinjoin on the same 20% chunk of holdings after the first. 

4) Move mixed coin chunk to LN wallet UTXO. 

5) Move from LN wallet to final, brand new hardware wallet UTXO. 

My goal is to anonymize my holdings by mixing twice and then sending from a LN wallet to brand new secure UTXO‚Äôs. I also want to reduce the number of UTXO‚Äôs from all my smaller buys so I can send more efficiently later.

The quest to adapt to a new system and breaking the habit of always converting to/from my/your native currency, is quite daunting at first until it eventually becomes natural.

jidomd,plast_sked,Capital reservation - underestimated impact of Bitcoin?," 

An unappreciated philosophical and economic impact of Bitcoin from my perspective influenced by Adam Smith.

At least for me. Maybe you guys thought about this before, but this came as a light bulb eureka kind of moment for me the other day. Sorry for eventual typos, not native English-speaker. Also a warning for the Wall of text :) 

Bitcoin is not only the censorship resistant, immutable, transparently scarce, store of value, transactional vehicle to name a few of the unique characteristics. All these characteristics make Bitcoin unique, not by themselves but the fact that it is bundled together in this perfectly balanced code. It is not only capital preservation, but actually **capital transactional reservation**. This type of characteristic is in my opinion revolutionary. Why is it? Let's have a quick overview of the current situation and division of labor, capital and ownership. In my interpretation of Smiths ‚ÄúAn inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations‚Äù each member of society that is not dependent on the welfare and good will of others is part of the following three categories, often a little bit in each. Namely;

**The providers of time (Labourer)**

Most people find themselves in this category most of their lifetime, and almost everybody does at some point in life. This category gives up their time in exchange for value (money) which in turn can be exchanged for whatever needs might arise. A few advantages of being in this category is;

* It creates relatively predictable value flows. (x amount of time = x amount of current value) 
* It is in many cases low thresholds. (you can physically sell your time directly)
* It can be fulfilling if you exercise a craft you are passionate about.
* Can accumulate knowledge and competence which allows to move in the economy and direct these skills in other areas as the economy evolves.

A few disadvantages with this category is;

* Limited value exchanged (only so many hours, days and weeks in a year) The potential is limited both in time and in value (no infinite salary to date).
* Not creating recurring income, i.e. you have to sell your time over and over again in order to keep your buying power.
* Less freedom - Your time and buying power is dictated by your employer.

**The providers of capital (Investors)**

Most people do also find themselves in this category to some extent through pension plans. However most people do also buy capital equipment in order to consume themselves. But a great portion of the economy is represented by this group. Instead of being paid for their time, they are being paid for the risk of off-putting consumption of their capital goods (or sometimes represented by currency) to the future and letting someone else use this capital in order to create value in the present. 

Advantages are;

* Recurring income - one time investment could create wealth over long periods of time.
* No time-boundaries. The investor can direct attention in other places while his capital is working for him.
* No limits. Theoretically speaking the potential is unlimited. 
* Predictable over long time-frames.

Disadvantages on the other hand;

* Risk - the risk of value being destroyed or lost is apparent and in some cases even likely.
* Unpredictable income in the short to medium term - unlike labour.
* High threshold - it is capital-intensive to be a successful investor. A high amount of wealth must be accumulated before this can entirely replace labour for consumption to appease immediate needs..

**Real estate (Landlord)**

The final of the three parts of economy is the landlord. The landlord gets paid for letting his land be used for different purposes both for the investor and the labourer. For example, would an agricultural company sometimes rent the land of a great landowner to generate value for the general population and create labour-opportunities. 

Advantages of being a landlord;

* In many ways the same as for the investor.
* It acts as a kind of hybrid between investor and labourer, because owning land sometimes requires your time and attention to make sure it meets the chosen purpose of value creation. This type of work can definitely vary in intensity and can also be let out to other labourers, but nevertheless it often requires actual labour.
* Predictable incomes of value in a recurring manner.
* Scalable - Often there is not double the administration in letting one property over two.

Disadvantages

* It is also capital-intensive and requires a bit of wealth to overcome the initial threshold. 
* I might as mentioned above require some labour from time to time.
* It often comes with capital cost and maintenance of certain parts of the land and/or its functionality.

These are the three principal value-categories which get a share of each transaction in an economy. Often all three get paid, but at the very least one of these categories have a share in each transaction that is made. Governments are to be considered a sort of landlord in this example. When you buy a burger from McDonalds, the **labourer** is paid to tend your meal, the **landowner (**McDonalds real estate) is paid a portion for rent and the franchise-owner (**investor**) is paid through profit. And of course the government shall have their share one way or the other. 

So, how does this wall of text apply to Bitcoin? Well, up until recently the three categories above was the only way to place the transactions occurring in an economy since just holding cash would erode your buying power over periods of time. The incentives of the economy is spurring the three categories above since that would uphold all three of them and keep everybody happy. But Bitcoin introduced a fourth alternative: **Capital reservation.**

The further elaboration is made with the presumption that Bitcoin is the main transactional peg/vehicle for the global economy.

I, as either a labourer, investor or landowner because of Bitcoin, have the opportunity to reserve my capital from the transactional economy for however long I wish. This has a few wonderful impacts. 

For one, when my capital is withheld the remaining Bitcoins get more valuable since there are fewer of them to transact with, creating more incentives to invest and work to obtain more. But, what if the value keeps rising? Would not that lower productivity and stop incentives for both investing, working or owning land? In the short term, perhaps. But this will also slow production making Bitcoin, as representing the whole transactional economy less valuable. Because there are fewer products to go around so each bitcoin gets you less food, drinks and other consumptions since people are raising the bar of what they are willing to pay and as soon as the wheels are slowing down in the economy the entrepreneurs, landowners and career-hungry labourers will see other peoples slacking and stacking as an competitive advantage. They will take advantage of the fact that companies, investors and workers are growing fat and happy with capital appreciation and start driving innovation, production and efficiency again to get their piece of the pie. 

In a sense this will keep the already coming and going of ‚Äúnatural‚Äù business cycles but will likely smoothen them out and keep the state of the economy transparent for each to take advantage of in which manner they see fit. So by withholding your consumption you are actually contributing to the economy and **reserving** your capital at the same time. And since most people fall in and out of each category in different stages in their lifetimes the volatility of these cycles is likely to be less than with current inflationary fiat-systems. It is sort of a democratic way to force everyone in each category to take part in the economy. Even by opting out.

It will make preserving and parking your capital reasonable, accessible and transparent for yourself and the rest of the economy which is freedom in a whole new sense.

That's it, thanks for bearing with the wall of text.",1603715576,0,1

jiczlk,bitcoin--world,BTC short-term selling pressure increases and pays attention to adjustment expectations,"With BTC's sideways volatility continuing to the fifth trading day, the selling pressure faced by BTC's price increase increases, and a breakthrough is needed as a prerequisite for the emergence of trading opportunities. At present, the buying opportunity of typical pressure level has not appeared. In terms of mainstream currency, most of them stay put when BTC goes with its efforts.

From the performance of the number of active addresses, the number of active addresses rebounded to a short-term peak of 1.08 million on October 24, indicating that more investors participated in short-term traders, indicating that the recent market has reached the top stage. At the same time, the peak value of the number of coins destroyed on October 23rd is close to the performance in February, which means that more investors who hold coins for a long time have sold BTC in short-term, and the recent adjustment rhythm of BTC may also be affected by this, which continues in the near future.

BTC is facing a breakthrough, but this breakthrough was delayed again on October 25th. On October 25th, when BTC short line retreated by 2.6% within 10 minutes, the volume effect during the decline period was obviously higher than that on October 22nd, indicating that the selling pressure of BTC increased slightly. On October 25th, the number of active addresses retreated to a short-term low of 790,000, indicating that the BTC price correction is affecting the enthusiasm of long-term trading, and the adjustment signs below USD 13,488 are increasing.

In terms of mainstream currency, most of them are arranged sideways, waiting for BTC to give a breakthrough direction. In terms of hot currency, the Big bounce intensity of FIL short-term in 3 trading days reached 94%, and the price performance was very eye-catching. On October 23rd, Filecoin activated the FIP-004 proposal at the block height of 170000. Miners who have installed the upgrade program will immediately receive a 25% block reward. Molly, an official member of Filecoin, said that Lotus v1.1.2 has been released.

There's a pretty high price spread for these listed PayPalUSD-BTC transactions -- like 15 to 20% and higher.

I'm a HODLer myself, have no interest in selling my own personal stash, but receiving additional income as a bitcoin middleman is pretty attractive. 

Does anyone have experience trading on this platform? 

If I were to spot purchase BTC on-demand from Coinbase or Gemini, trade for USD via Paxful/PayPal at a premium, then as long as I used LIFO tax ordering I don't see how tax impact would be much of an issue. With such quick turnaround the capital gains would be negligible (or they'd be losses) and wouldn't really eat much into my profits from selling at a premium.

Been a few months since I saw some news about Ripple CEO talking about the possibility of China altering BTC blockchain in some ways in order to get privileged control of it, blocking or reversing transactions, etc. China's mining power and centralization is referred as an argument for that theory. Today I saw something similar in the news.  


China/XRP interests aside, my question is: I always heard people say BTC code and blockchain, as its network updates by devs, are built with that possibility in mind and protected against it. The majority of people seems to consider it almost entirely safe. I'm not sure if what the guy refers is the same of what is called 51% attack, and I also know it's a common debate.

jjcq9o,Mekilekon,Dont worry if you FOMO. You are not going to be millionaires anyway.,"BTC is heading to new ATH. Many new people are stepping up the train, and many of them are posting questions such as ""how to acquire most bitcoin ?"", or ""Is it still possible to have 1 BTC"", or ""what should I do to secure my BTC ?"", and the worst: ""Should I put all my savings in BTC"" ? ...

Those are some legit questions, but if you are asking yourself those questions, you are probably about to burn yourself and becoming a future millionaire has maybe struck your head. Let's just do some quick math to show you that you will NOT become a millionaire.   
 

Following the BTC pattern, I saw many youtubers predicting that BTC price is heading toward 200k USD in one or two years. This is a very optimistic prediction. But let's take it to have the most favorable scenario. 

So if you are a broke ass newcomer like most of the people here, you can barely afford 1BTC right now. If you can, your net profit in 1-2 years will be roughly 180k USD. This is a very good income in only two years. But still, you are not a millionaire. 

If you want to be a millionaire, you would need to buy at least 5-6 BTC right now, which you cannot afford (even with all your savings) if you are part of the people I mentioned above, and like more than 90% of the population. There are only a few dudes in the world who became multi-millionaire with BTC because they bought a lot when it was below 1K USD. Since then, most of the people are just securing a good retirement plan (even if some of them burned everything in a Lambo...). 

SO what should you do ? Is investing in BTC really worth it, even if you will not buy a Lambo? I still believe yes. 

If the price of BTC is multiplied by 15 in the next two years, your investment, even as small as it, will also be multiplied by 15. This is still a good income.

So, don‚Äôt' burn all your savings, BTC can still only go to 20K then dump again. And take your time to only invest what you can afford to lose.

&amp;#x200B;

He also got 1 person through a referral under him and he manages to get a 8% return in 24h (every day). So he managed to return almost all of his investment in 10 days, and also get it at an exchange office back (legit, he wouldn't lie to me and he showed me the paperwork).

Some people believe that their cryptocurrency is much safer in exchange than their crypto wallet, this concept is a big no for me, well, in fact, I always read some articles about a hacked exchange every week or months. It is much safer to store our money in our crypto wallet but the problem with it is that it is also vulnerable to being stolen by hackers.  


We can prevent this thing from storing our private and public keys.  
Just key terms to remember:  
**Transferring of funds**  
Public key - allows you to transfer funds into it  
Private key - allows you to transfer funds out to it.  


**Exclusively**  
Public key - publicly known and important for identification  
Private key - this should be secret, excluded only for two parties which are the receiver and the sender.  


**If you lose your public key, you can still access it using your private key and if you lose your private key you cannot access your fund anymore.** Storing your private key is a really important thing to do whenever you want to secure your wallet. Do not store it on your device because any device ate prone to hackers. Use any strategies except online.",1603826556,10,1

I use Bitbargain but sure enough they're closing shop in the UK after this ban. I'm sorry I've not been able to find any reliable information. I have account like Binance and Cake (for Monero converting). But yeah it's just a bit of a headache, I can't believe that it will be impost to get bitcoin in the UK but that's definitely the way the authorities are enjoying portraying it, Muppets they are! 
Thank you kindly in advance for any information you might have with regards to life after 6th Jan 2021",1603533353,22,1

jh5r56,facepalm5000,Learned about Lightning Network today. Mind blown.,"I finally looked into how the Lightning Network works, and holy shit it's a game changer (on top the already existing game changer, btc). Zero fee transactions or extremely low fee transactions (depending on the number of hops in the payment path). Even 1 or 10 sat tx for 0 fee, if you have a payment channel open with that server. 

If you're interested in learning about Lightning, these videos are pretty good: 402 Payment Required: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmoQ11MXEmajsUw95Fq6fHzXnVmoMPIeV](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmoQ11MXEmajsUw95Fq6fHzXnVmoMPIeV)

We know Btc is going to dominate as a store of value, but Lightning is going dominate as a scalable payment network

This will put so much pressure on Visa, Cirrus, Paypal, Venmo, etc after it gets more adoption. In the very near future, electronic payment companies &amp; banks will need to ""pivot to a business model of creating value"", instead of just living off rents from their legacy banking infrastructure.",1603529756,44,1

Before you guys call me stupid, I am investing as much as I can afford to lose. It did not take me very long to save this money and my earning potential is growing rapidly.

This article covers what bitcoin is, how to buy it, what crypto interest platforms are, how to use them, how to mitigate your risk intelligently, and has a bunch of extra sources for diving down the rabbit hole.

Please keep in mind, this article is specifically written for early majority types‚Äîfinancially well off people who are not looking to change the world (like most of us) but instead just to protect their money in the face of infinite QE and zero interest rates savings.

There is an infinite amount of stuff written for people like us, and if the early majority cared, they would already be reading it.

Thus, diving deep in to things like mining, or ""ending the fed"", or hammering ad infinitium ""not your keys not your coin"" is not what I'm going for.

She already reported the fraud through Coinbase, which locked her account (unfortunately, it sounds like this was after the funds had already moved) and contacted the police, who told her she needs access to her account in order to provide them the address(es) of the attackers.  I'm wondering if anyone here has been in the same situation, and if so, what you did, and if you were able to get your money back.  I assume at this point, the only way to recover the funds would be to find the attackers.

I decided to create a little dashboard that tracks the top 100 coins (according to CMC) and how many times they're mentioned on Twitter.

They told everyone the dollar was backed 1 to 1 by gold, which lead to the world using the dollar as a reserve store of value asset many many years ago. After we got them to use our dollar as a reserve asset, we detached from the 1 to 1 change for gold and began to take control of most of the oil-producing nations, forcing them into treaties with us to only trading their oil for US Dollars. This forced other countries to hold onto their dollars they had already been using as a store of value because it was once backed 1 to 1 by gold. So many countries still hold it till today as a reserve asset because it inflates slower than their currency, and because they also need it to buy oil. This is why we've been Globally going to shit for almost the last Century. The US has tricked the world into use their dollars as a reserve asset, something that should have been stopped as soon as it stopped being backed 1 to 1 by gold, and this has lead to most of the Countries of the world's financial instability, now using a fiat currency as a large part of their countries federal treasury reserves. Bitcoin will fix this, and reset the world to the ways of the old days.

The man and his wife were sentenced to two years for illegal money transmission and the court claims the couple‚Äôs bitcoin stash was used on the deep web.**

Dutch officials recently arrested and charged a man and his wife for illegal money transmission and money laundering. According to the Dutch Public Prosecution Service from the Rotterdam District Court, the two suspects laundered close to $19 million using bitcoin during the last two years. Most of the couple‚Äôs illegal earnings were stored in bitcoin and the Rotterdam police confiscated the stash.

The man and woman were residents of North Holland‚Äôs Hilversum and the couple will face two and a half years in prison for their crimes. Dutch prosecutors noted during the trial that the traders did not leverage proper KYC/AML guidelines while operating the business.

‚ÄúTraders did not ask customers for identity papers, while large amounts were often exchanged,‚Äù the Rotterdam [court filing notes](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/tech/artikel/5192533/rechter-neemt-25-miljoen-euro-aan-bitcoins-beslag-van-witwassers). ‚ÄúThe suspects, a man, and his wife, came into contact with customers through advertisements on the Internet and a marketplace on the dark web. Much of the bitcoins traded bore traces of the dark web. The court has established that the suspects laundered more than 16 million euros in two and a half years.‚Äù

Court documents show that the police confiscated two different bitcoin stashes with one cache holding 1,488 [BTC](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC) and the other wallet held 1,044 [BTC](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC). In addition to the $33 million worth of bitcoins seized, Dutch police also took $295,256 in cash reserves. Court prosecutors said that the couple purchased bitcoins in order to exchange for cash. Police said that the couple leveraged methods to keep their customers unknown.

On a regular basis, the couple met people and businesses at fast food restaurant chains in order to execute the cash for bitcoin exchanges. Prosecutors believe a great number of these coins sold by the Hilversum made it to the deep web and were used on darknet marketplaces (DNM).

The Dutch police are well known for many bitcoin seizures and crackdowns against DNM operators. Four years ago, Dutch police [arrested 10 individuals](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/20/bitcoin-netherlands-arrests-cars-cash-ecstasy) from the Netherlands for laundering large sums of bitcoins. The Netherlands law enforcement officials are also responsible for the great [Hansa takedown,](https://news.bitcoin.com/the-curious-cases-of-the-alphabay-kingpin-and-hansa-takedowns/) where undercover agents operated the DNM for over a month without customers knowing.

In addition to the $33 million in bitcoins seized and the two and a half year prison sentence, the couple must also pay fines individually. The couple will pay $53,137 for one levy and $162,955 for the forfeiture operations.

I bought a ledger and was able to sign up and set the whole thing up without any identity. So I guess the only way I can see having anonymous crypto is paying someone cash to send it to me.  But that's so sketchy in itself and almost certainly will end up with a negative result.

I have on my PC a wallet backup file made with the Bitcoin Wallet android app ([https://bitcoin.org/en/wallets/mobile/android/bitcoinwallet/](https://bitcoin.org/en/wallets/mobile/android/bitcoinwallet/)). I know the password of the backup file. I don't know (have forgotten) the spending PIN for the wallet.

(I already know that it was stupid to lose the PIN and that by design I am not supposed to be able to recover any coins in the wallet now; no need to inform me of that.)

I am willing to throw some computer time at this to try and brute-force the PIN, but I don't know anything about the format of this backup file. Are there any existing tools for doing what I'm trying to do? Failing that, is there a decent specification somewhere of exactly what is stored in this file, that I can use to write such tools on my own? I'm aware the app is open-source so in principle I could just dive into the source code and figure it out that way (I am a somewhat competent coder), but if some of that work is done for me I'd much prefer to use it.",1603997591,5,1

My company currently has our 401k set up through Merril Lynch. I called Merril to see if they offered cryptocurrencies as an option for investments in our 401k. To which I found out that my company is the entity that chooses the list of potential investments for the employees to choose from. Has anyone here attempted to get their company to open up the possibility to invest in crypto in their 401k? If so, how did you convince them? 

I want to reach out to whoever handles our benefits and see if that would be a possibility. Does something like this cause the company too many problems than it may be worth?",1603997078,9,1

jkev3j,Luckynumba2,And here we go again.. France in confinnement for 1 month minimum,"Whats up Bitcoin reddit, so last night, I got to watch my French President tell its nation that we are going threw another confinnement. To be honest, I find this really funny. I have been warning everyone around me that this was going to happen around Nov 1st. I cannot understand for the life of me why we cannot take the same measures as China did. People tell me ""because the economy is as important !"" ""if we take the same measures as China, everyone will be ruined"" ""oh ! so you are for communism ?"" ""they are the ones that gave us this problem and you want us to take a lesson frol them ?"" and so on... My honest opinion is that countries like France are banking too much on the famous vaccine ! They want to make everyone stay home for a month in the hopes that we will have 5k contaminations per day instead of 40k to 50k currently. All that so we can MAYBE have a christmas... Am I the only one that thinks this is insane ? Am I the only one to think most countries are taking this pandamic a little too lightly ? Why put the economy before the health of others when we can print to oblivion like we have been ? 7.5 trillion dollars in the USA, 2.5 trillion in the EU, and I'm not sure about the asian countries.. But its got to be up there. 

With that said, the USA is in no better spot right now. We will again print to oblivion for stimulus round #2. So here is my question to you all:

Will we see another market wide dump soon ? Will investors world wide panic ? The VIX panic index is already looking worrysome. The CAC40 (equivalent Of SP500) is looking oh so bearish.

Anyways, everyone, take care of yourselfs, your families and your health and get ready for round #2 of confinnement..",1603993744,7,1

So imagine that you are moving because the country you live in is a mess, or it's about to become a mess, and you decide to move abroad.

How do you take your seeds with you in the safest way?

You cannot take your seedplate with you in a bag. I thought about different options:

1) You travel to your new destination, and create a new wallet, seedplate and an address there, return to your previous destination, send your bitcoin there, and move to your new destination. The problem is that you need to travel twice. 

2) You write your seed in the different pages of a book, or underline words of the book you carry with you. The problem is that you can always lose the book.

Even touting the money that large companies have made by investing in bitcoin is flawed when realistically they would have made much more by investing in numerous other companies.

Is there no solution to bitcoin's rise in fees every time its price rises?

Anyhow if your transaction is stuck in the mempool, you can check the status using a block explorer that also gives you an *estimate* of confirmation time. 

* [Mempool](https://mempool.space/)
* [Blockonomics](https://www.blockonomics.co/)

Before sending a bitcoin transaction it is always advised to send the appropriate fees if you want to have it confirmed quickly, wallets now usually give you an estimate of the fees along with the corresponding confirmation time. 

You can still check for an estimate of the fees here: 

* [Bitcoin Fees](https://bitcoinfees.net/)
* [Bitcoin Congestion Manager](https://fee.cryp.ee/#/btc)
* [Bitcoiner](https://bitcoiner.live/)

&amp;#x200B;

The price of bitcoin has pulled back after printing a fresh 52-week high earlier in the week. 

&amp;#x200B;

The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization has dropped towards the $13,000 level after approaching the $14,000 mark on Wednesday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Trader Tone Vays shared his views on this correction in his most recent episode of the Trading Bitcoin show:

&amp;#x200B;

""This pullback from the $14,000 area is very healthy. And the deeper the pullback without getting to $10,000, the more healthy it is for the bull market.""

&amp;#x200B;

As a potential scenario where the price could go lower, Tone pointed out:

&amp;#x200B;

""$11,500 is ideal, $11,000 is OK. Below $11,000 gets us into a little bit of a pickle. But the closer this pullback gets to $11,000 without breaking this level, the healthier it is for bitcoin to challenge $20,000 sooner rather than later.""

Besides the common ""cold storage"" and ""not your keys, not your coins"" security advice, I would love to see what other tidbits do you do, or have thought of that could be potential security weaknesses. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few that come to mind: 

1) Is it safe to keep your funds in the address provided at time of withdrawal to your exchange?   
Asking because if an exchange employee were to access unauthorized data, you could potentially know how much coins each person has, by just scanning the withdraw addresses. This could make you a real life target. 

2) Is it smart to use a separate email (non-hotmail,google,yahoo) for exchange related work. 

2) Is it safe to combine multiple addresses into one? Would this not give away your identity and also potentially show someone a larger balance (to the people you spend to in the future) 

3) How do we know cold storage like Trezor and Ledger are safe? We essentially are relying on the fact that they haven't been hacked before, and that their code is 'open source'.

jkac4i,ztsmart,Revenge of the Austrians,"People often speak of Bitcoin having its roots in the cypher punk community, but I view Bitcoin has having multiple roots that only became a viable currency when these roots merged.  The technical contributions of the cypher punks are tremendous, but perhaps even more significant is Bitcoin's roots in Austrian monetary economics.


Throughout the history of humanity, there has been tremendous struggle over money with government consistently growing to take control of the money supply--and it's creation.  This happens today in the form of Keynesian central banks expanding the money supply to finance the endless desire of government to spend and consume beyond what it would be able to without the ability to create new currency units at negligible cost.  But this Keynesian practice was common throughout history as well, of course it was known by a [different names then](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_coin_debasement), but it was Keynesianism all the same.

Wherever productive and free people managed to save any significant wealth for the future, government would soon show up to start eating it away with Keynesian debasement, like rats showing up to help themselves to some cheese someone else labored to create.

There was of course people who rejected the Keynesian theft-apologist ideology.  The Austrians called out the Keynesian governmental theft and exposed the harm a society suffers from allowing these intrusive government rats to consume whatever stored wealth they please, but things did not play out well for the Austrians.  Any time there was an attempt by the Austrians to create a money that was immune from Keynesian appropriation government would [promptly stamp out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102) this monetary competitor and [often the lives of whatever Austrians were associated with it's enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_dollar_(private_currency)).  Keynesian money does not fair well in the marketplace with competitions so governments that rely on Keynesian money for for their existence cannot allow such competition.

And so whenever Austrians attempted to challenge Keynesian monetary supremacy they were completely and utterly annihilated.  Keynesian money had allowed government to grow in size and power into something analogous to a Death Star--a monstrosity of war and death with limitless capacity for destruction.  Any attempt at a direct head-on assault or open challenge is doomed to certain failure.  But just as a Death Star is designed around and completely dependent on a core, so to is government designed around completely dependent on a Keynesian money core from which it draws all of its power to fund and sustain itself.  There is no Death Star without the Keynesian core.  And all of the Austrians efforts to take out the core had failed.  But then someone wrote and released a tiny piece of code--an imperceptible threat at first, but a threat in the form of a tiny new money that challenges the Keynesian monopoly.  An Austrian money that cannot be killed.

This Austrian money has been steadily and consistently growing for the past 11 years and yet the Keynesians seem to be woefully unaware of their coming demise.  I recall the arrogant Keynesian claim that [We're all Keynesians now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_are_all_Keynesians_now) after the Austrians were wiped out in the realm of mainstream economic thought, and it is true we were all Keynesians because we had no choice but to use Keynesian money.

But now that monetary monopoly has a challenger to its global supremacy, and it is one that is immune to the massive government power to target single points of failure.  You Keynesians are *finished*; you were finished in 2009, you just haven't realized it yet.  The Austrians will have their revenge and the world will have a money that is free from surreptitious Keynesian theft.",1603979288,25,1

The people I bought from has provided the ID to confirm on blockchain that it truly has been sent back, but its not showing in my transactions or in my balance.

Also, I sent a few other payments, separate from the purchases above, and they're all stuck on zero confirmations. I think about 7 or 8 payments. I have the HD bitcoin account and inside that are 3 separate wallets, and the transactions were sent from 2 of the 3 wallets. I sent using the cheapest way, i think either 1 sat/byte or 18 sat/byte.

I understand that transactions can't get lost or stolen or anything, so what exactly is happening here? How long will these transactions take to send? Once these transactions go through will the refunds I'm waiting on appear in my transactions? Is the reason the refunds are not showing is because of all these pending transactions stuck at zero confirmations?

I've tried ""bumping transaction"", ""rebroadcasting"", and even ""deleting transaction"" but they dont really do anything. If I rebroadcast it just says ""transaction sent"". If I ""delete"", it just deletes it from the list but when I refresh it brings it back up.  And when I ""bump transaction"" it says ""Unable to build transaction"".

Do I just need to keep waiting? One transaction has been at zero confirmations for 3 days now, since the 26th. This is taking unusually long. I need some help from some professionals here. Thank you.",1603965815,11,1

j5go1e,PositiveJo3,Bitcoin 2008 White Paper-2009-2010 Price Inception,"No doubt that these years were the years of Glory!   
Most important Years of the Technological Evolution, Revolutionizing the Payment System by eliminating third parties and banks' control upon one's capital of money.  
Everyone who read the White Paper when published in 2008, and afterwards researched it and understood what Bitcoin was while creating a capital waiting to be invested heavily in Bitcoin in long term means when it would be launched in 2009 on first price of 0.008, today are filthy rich in terms of US Dollars since Bitcoin is an Anti-Fiat asset class.  
However, not everyone might have understood Bitcoin and seen it just as another market to be traded and make money, especially seeing that Bitcoin's ROI which rose up 900% in price just 5 days after it's price lunch on various markets of exchanges.  
Just imagine back in the day, when with 1$ you could've literally purchased a shitload bag with Bitcoins, approx 1.200BTC's or even more.Or imagine when Bitcoin was gifted or given away on reddit and other platforms.. And look where we are now, when with 1$ U barely buy some satoshis, let alone a whole fraction or a whole Bitcoin. Look where we are now, when Bitcoin has become more of a greed game than being generous.  
To me, it is mindblowing what opportunities were presented for everyone who stumbled across Bitcoin back then. A time that WILL NEVER come back again, EVER.  
I can not comprehend the pain and regrets one might have today who knew about this at the time and did not took action.   
Or, the one's who just traded it due to Bitcoin's ROI in such a short term and nowadays have not what they had when first bought.  
Arghhh, Destiny ... I wish I were not a 7 years old kiddo when Bitcoin launched, and especially coming from a third world country when finding internet access was a luxury and impossible for poor-middle classes.   
Let alone mentioning the educational systems that never did any subject upon PC's education.  
I've been having restless and sleepless nights since I stumbled upon Bitcoin early 2020 after Covid plunged the markets, and I found Bitcoin at it's first price at around 6-7k or something. Finding me with not more than 1k in lifesaving to invest, when nearly 20% of my capital went just to get a cold storage wallet.  
Today, I find my self just looking on the web-world Bitcoin topics, documentaries behind it's technology, it's revolution etc etc.   
I feel unlucky and cursed stumbling upon Bitcoin 'so late' in terms of price and accumulation.   
I can never see my self owning a whole Bitcoin before 2025-2026 if what I have will be traded succesfully on the next peak to buy in lower after the next ATH deep's correction and bear market which is yet to come.   
And thanks to the Covid sh\*t which left me unemployed from having a 250$ salary off taxes to have an income that I can invest monthly, that dream becomes even more far-fetched.  
I failed pursuing college to get a PHD/Diploma, or better said, I couldn't due to not having money to begin with. Now I'm stuck!  
I see my future being so gloomy, filled with hardships and thorns not having means of income to go on in life, creating a family or whatever.  
But hey, to whom am I talking to.. most of Bitcoin investors see Bitcoin to buy them a lambo, or lavish life access, while I'm standing and seeing Bitcoin as an asset that can free me from selling my time for worthless paychecks.. while I'm seeing Bitcoin as an asset which can be passed on to upcoming generations.  
I wonder why God didn't will for me to know about Bitcoin back than, and have an unimaginable portfolio today, when 100Bitcoin's at current price is equal to 1Million U$Dollars. An amount which could've settled all my blood relatives from the struggles of fiat money working as slaves, buying some real estate to create passive income and all this with only 50 Bitcoins, and the other 50 to be held for long term and be traded twice a year to accumulate more.  
I wish I was a person when with 1$ could've purchased around 1.000 Bitcoins, I have no doubt in my mind that I would've created an webpage for new Bitcoin incomers and share with them from my abundance.   
If anyone who read this till the end and it's an early investor up to 10$ per Bitcoin, consider sharing your wealth with your loved ones, friends who understand and want to HODL Bitcoin and to strangers the likes of me who didn't had the opportunity to do so.  
Afterall, when we die, we won't get any of wealth possession we might have.  
Cheer up for whatever U have. I have realized life's a b!tch and destiny it's a maze we will never understand from the logical point of view human beings have the ability to think of.  
I wish you all the best!

j5dsin,brianddk,"Power of the Command Line (bitcoin-cli, hwi, electrum, trezorctl)","I think some of the console tools available with HW wallets today are greatly under utilized.  Here's a quick write-up on how to create and sign a TXN very similar to [43d27...1fc06](https://tbtc1.trezor.io/tx/43d273d3caf41759ad843474f960fbf80ff2ec961135d018b61e9fab3ad1fc06) found on the [SLIP-14](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0014.md) wallet.  I'll be using TrezorCTL, Electrum, and HWI for the signing.  I won't go much into the setup or install, but feel free to ask if you have questions about it.  Note, you don't have to use all three of these.  Any one will produce a valid signed TXN for broadcast.  I just showed how to do it three ways.  Whats more some of the Electrum and HWI steps are interchangeable.

ColdCard also has a utility called `ckcc` that will do the sign operation instead of HWI, but in many ways they are interchangeable.  KeepKey and Ledger both have libraries for scripted signing but no one-shot, one-line console apps that I know of.

***

## TrezorCTL

This is the what most would think of to use to craft and sign TXNs, and is definitely very simple.  The signing uses a script called [build_tx.py](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/python/v0.12.0/python/tools/build_tx.py) to create a JSON file that is then used by the `btc sign-tx` command.  The whole process is basically:

1. `tools/build_tx.py | trezorctl btc sign-tx -`

This just means, take the output of `build_tx` and sign it.  To copy `43d27...1fc06`, I wrote a small script to feed `build_tx`, so my process looks like:

1. `~/input.sh | tools/build_tx.py | trezorctl btc sign-tx -`

But it's all very simple.  Note... I used FW 2.3.0 (1.9.0) on this since there are some minor incompatibilities in later FW ^(1).

## Electrum

Electrum is one of the better GUI wallets available, but it also has a pretty good console interface.  Like before you need your Trezor with the SLIP-14 wallet loaded and paired to Electrum.  I'll assume Electrum is up and running with the Trezor wallet loaded to make things simple.

Like with TrezorCTL, Electrum feeds on a JSON file, but unlike TrezorCTL it needs that JSON squished into the command line.  This is a simple `sed` command, but I won't bore you with the details, but just assume that's done.  So the process in Electrum (v4.0.3) looks like:

1. `electrum serialize &lt;smushed_json&gt;` (create psbt to sign)
2. `electrum --wallet &lt;file&gt; signtransaction &lt;prev_pbst&gt;` (sign said psbt)

Still pretty simple right!  Below is the JSON I smushed for \#1

#### [txn.json](https://github.com/brianddk/reddit/blob/68f773cbf588a23a4e8b585d73bd87a712f2d29e/python/ele_cli/txn.json)

## HWI

HWI is an unsung hero in my book.  It's a very small clean and simple interface between HW wallets and Bitcoin Core.  It currently supports a good range of HW wallets.  It keeps itself narrowly focused on TXN signing and offloads most everything else to Bitcoin Core.  Again, I'll assume you've imported your Trezor keypool into Core and done the requisite IBD and rescan.  And if you don't have the RPC enabled, you can always clone these commands into the QT-console.

To sign our TXN in HWI (v1.1.2), we will first need to craft (and finalize) it in Bitcoin Core (0.21.1).  Like in Electrum, we will have to use simple `sed` to smush some JSON into command arguments, but I'll assume you have that covered.  It will take an `inputs.json` and an `outputs.json` named separately.

1. `bitcoin-cli createpsbt &lt;smushed_inputs&gt; &lt;smushed_outputs&gt;` (create psbt)
2. `bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=&lt;wallet&gt; walletprocesspsbt &lt;prev_pbst&gt;` (process psbt)
3. `hwi -f &lt;keypool_fingerprint&gt; signtx &lt;prev_pbst&gt;` (sign psbt)
4. `bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=&lt;wallet&gt; finalizepsbt &lt;prev_pbst&gt;` (get a signed TXN from psbt)

A little more involved, but still nothing too bad.  Plus this gives you the full power of Bitcoin Core including integrations with LND (lightning).

#### [inputs.json](https://github.com/brianddk/reddit/blob/68f773cbf588a23a4e8b585d73bd87a712f2d29e/python/hwi_cli/inputs.json)

## Conclusion

This may all seem like very low level coding, but is surprisingly simple once you get a knack for it.  Whats more, all these platforms support ***testnet*** which allows you to practice with valueless coins until you get the hang of it.  And, like many things in bitcoin, this is all (mostly) python, which is one of the easier languages to learn.

Enjoy

j594zf,MisterMaury,I'm looking for fantastic facts about Bitcoin,"I'm going on a financial podcast for Boomers and they are looking for me to make the case that Boomers should allocate at least some funds to Bitcoin.

Safety is a primary concern, so I'm thinking social proof is the way to go. I'm looking for examples of how big Bitcoin is (it's the X largest currency in the world) and how liquid it is (transacts X per day).  Perhaps examples of large investors that have invested in Bitcoin (Paul Tudor Jones, Bill Miller, University endowments?) Companies that are in on BTC (Overstock, MicroStrategy) Countries that have adopted Bitcoin, (you can pay your taxes in Switzerland), etc.  
If there's a way to explain the massive computing power behind Bitcoin that makes sense to a Boomer, that would be good too...

j3dqaz,ohbaiko,Help!! I got scammed by a Bitcoin company,"I was looking into a trading platform called AlpinumCG. I signed up through Bitcoin Revolution and immediately after signing up, I received an email and a phone call from the UK. The lady on the phone told me to click the link on the email where it would lead me to put in my personal information (name, address) and my credit card information because I needed an initial 250 USD in order to open my account and start trading. I was sceptical at first but she reassured me and was rushing me into it because she said there was a ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù going on. My stupid self put my credit card information and it automatically charged my card. After that, she hung up not telling me what to expect. 

I get another email a couple hours later with login details to my trading account with AlpinumCG. Right when I logged into AlpinumCG, I get another phone call from a financial advisor from AlpinumCG and he told me the basics of the trading platform. 

I checked it out and saw that my funds were increasing and I thought it was working. But I went online to see reviews about this company and many people were saying it was a scam. I called them back and asked for a refund/withdrawal as well as to close my account and they said the financial team would call me back and do it for me. 

However a couple days passed and they never got back to me. So I tried to withdraw my deposit but it wouldn‚Äôt let me. I called and emailed them multiple times with no response. ***I realize they just took my money and completely cut all communications with me.*** I even tried closing the account but it wouldn‚Äôt let me do so because only the company had control over that. 
I‚Äôm planning to contact my bank to file a dispute and a chargeback as well as change my credit card but I‚Äôm scared that I can‚Äôt close my account and they will charge me fees (like tax or hidden fees) as the funds keep increasing (even though I can‚Äôt even withdraw it) or mail a bill to my house because they have my address.


Please help! I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm scared this will come back in the future to bite me.",1601575222,31,0

Merchants and customers alike around the world enjoy bitcoin‚Äôs borderless and control-free transactions.

Just like bitcoin, the landscape of merchants using bitcoin has changed over the years.

A study was recently conducted to analyze the bitcoin merchant data and see how the market has evolved in the past years \[2017‚Äì2020\], leading to some interesting finds.

\#1 **Web Hosting**, **Pharma/Health**, and **Cannabis** take almost 75% of the entire bitcoin merchant ecosystem in 2020.

\#2 Industries that have embraced bitcoin are not just selling digital products but also physical goods.

Industries such as **Cannabis**, **Pharma/Health**, **Vaping** have seen a rise in adoption since 2017, and the trend is only going up.

\#3 Interestingly enough, **Mining** is the one and only industry that sees a ***drop*** in adoption.

\#4 The 3 industries that saw the highest growth rate in the year 2020 compared to 2019 were **Cannabis, Vaping, and VPN**.

*VPN* saw the highest increase of 80%, followed by *Vaping* with 64% and finally by *Cannabis* with 54%.

j8b6ke,Good-Exercise,Help recovering from old wallet.dat for an old friend.,"&amp;#x200B;

Hey all,

I've been in the Bitcoin space since early 2012. 

I have a situation that I would love to get some assistance with, I will explain the situation momentarily. Please do not message me and ask me for the wallet.dat file it's not going to happen.

**TL;DR**

**I have an old wallet.dat file from late 2012 or early 2013 from a coin I sold to a friend. Tried to recover the coins in 2018 and failed, later found out that someone had access to the computer and could have easily stole them. Would the current Bitcoin Core be able to read an old wallet.dat file, and is there any way to easily view the balance of a 2012 wallet.dat file without having to load the entire blockchain?**

In the early days of Bitcoin as many of you OG's know, the only option to securely store your coins was to use the default Bitcoin wallet in a wallet.dat file. A friend of mine was really wanted to invest in Bitcoin but didn't know how, so I sold one to him because I didn't want him to get screwed. I installed Bitcoin QT on their home laptop, had him write down the password on a piece of paper and had him put a backup of the wallet.dat file onto a USB.

Fast forward to when the price went to $20k plus, he calls me up super excited and said he wanted to sell his coin because he could use the money and I encouraged it because from my prior experience I knew the momentum was unsustainable and I had sold a few coins of my own. 

Anyway, I go over to his house and we huddle around his computer. He tells me that he upgraded the hard drive in his computer and gave me his old one and I went back to my house to get an external hard drive reader. I came back, booted up his old drive and remembered that we would have to let it sync up in order to get the coins out, and on his internet that wasn't going to happen anytime soon. He gave me the hard drive and I went home and left on Bitcoin QT overnight and in the morning I was shocked to see that there were no transactions on the wallet. Quick note, he had the wallet password in a file on his documents titled ""Bitcoin Wallet Password.txt"". smh.

I started to panic, and I realized how bad this looked on me. I called him and told him that there were no coins on there and asked if he had his USB stick and he told me he had lost it years ago. I frantically looked through all of my old wallet files to find any transaction that could link to his address, to show that his coins were still in there. After a while I realized I had sent the coins from the now defunct [btc-e.com](https://btc-e.com), and had no way to check up on the coins.

I did everything in my ability to try to recover lost data from the hard drive to no avail. I asked him if anyone else has had access to his computer, and then asked him how he replaced his hard drive because I know him well enough to know he wouldn't pull apart a laptop to replace the hard drive. He told me he took it to a shop to have it replaced a few months earlier. I suspect that I'm either trying to view the wallet incorrectly or whoever replaced his hard drive snooped on his hard drive, stole the coins and replaced the wallet.dat file and generated a new one. I have to admit, I was relieved a little bit to have an explanation to coins not being there but I could imagine he thinks I may have had something to do with it. I made a few more attempts over the years whenever I was reminded of the situation to no avail. 

We kind of fell out after that and haven't spoken in a while. Recently, I saw a post on his Facebook that his wife is pregnant they are having a baby, and that's why I'm here. I would love nothing more than to be able to message him and let him know that I have 11 grand waiting for him, because I'm certain the money would mean the world to him during such a stressful time.

Any help or insights would be incredibly helpful and appreciated.",1602291250,21,1

j7dci7,BigCapitalist,Upcoming Fed Coin/Crypto Dollar,"While I like the fact that decentralized crypto currency gives people the power over their own money, I think the upcoming Fed Coin/digital dollar is going to be complete tyranny. 

The Federal Reserve and other private banks will issue this crypto currency soon, remove cash from society and make it to where you have to use it. If you are considered a dissenter you will just have your Fed Coin zapped from your account, won't be able to get loans, they will have complete control over your money. If you give your child $100 for his/her birthday BAM it's taxed at 20%, your kid spends that $80 BAM taxed again at 20% and over and over until it's all eaten up through taxation. Under the table transactions will be impossible.

I think crypto currency is about to be used for control over people and world governments are likely to shut down crypto exchanges and make it illegal to use alternate money. Look at china and their social credit score system, we're moving more and more towards a surveillance state and the last key is the crypto dollar.

Anyone that says this is all conspiracy can just look back at the first stimulus bill of this year, the US congress already tried passing it, it's just a matter of time until they succeed.

Contrary to blue-pilled belief, the bank does *not* use other people's deposited money to loan you money.

***It creates money out of thin air - credit creation.***

97% of the money supply is created by banks.

Only 3% of the money supply is physical cash, and that number is certain to decrease as [cash is dangerous now](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/24/uk-cash-usage-halves-in-few-days) remember...

Therefore, banks are the control centre of the entire economy, since they create money and decide who gets money *for what purpose*.

Do the banks create money for productive purposes, boosting GDP and job creation, reducing inequality?

***Nope, for the last few decades, banks have created money for unproductive purposes, for asset transactions that play no role in GDP (i.e. real estate, stocks, lending to private equity funds and hedge funds).***

Therefore, asset bubbles form.

It is inevitable, as long as banks create new money for asset transactions, people will continue to chase the lucrative capital gains on offer in these asset classes.

This has a crucial impact on many people's lives.

Think about this: Private Equity giant Blackstone buys up real estate, financed by this credit creation at the banks.

Blackstone has a real estate portfolio of $325 billion, including over 300,000 residential units worldwide.

***Many people struggling with their rent would be angered to find that Blackstone has financed these mammoth deals via credit creation at the banks.***

Credit creation which could be used for productive purposes, but instead is used to move [Schwarzman yet further up the Forbes List](https://www.forbes.com/profile/stephen-schwarzman/#5fd655f7234a).

A List which ranks and celebrates humans based on net worth, regardless of their contribution to the technological advancement of the human race (and omits those with true power and obscene wealth).

So if banks are creating credit for asset transactions, then you will have asset bubbles, banking crises and soaring wealth inequality.

The Banks are under NO obligation from regulators to create credit for productive purposes.

Create credit for business development, technological innovation, etc?

Nah, let's lend to Blackstone so they can increase their carry.

This is why there *is* some valid criticism for the Baby Boomer generation - they have traded the technological progression of the human race for an increase in their already significant carry.

If and when banks slow down credit creation for asset transactions, some speculators (i.e. those who've borrowed money to invest in financial instruments) go bankrupt.

Then, banks suddenly have nonperforming loans, so they become more risk averse, reducing lending as asset prices fall.

***This leads to more bankruptcies, and this vicious cycle then leads to a BANKING CRISIS.***

I'm just wondering, with over USD10billion locked in DeFi protocols, I'm wondering would DeFi built on Bitcoin Network be a more feasible prospect? Where Stacks protocol brings smart contract capabilities(Clarity language) to Bitcoin network, which allows developers to build applications ontop of Bitcoin network.

Given the Bitcoin Network is the most secure blockchain protocol out there, that have [stood the test of time](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4971039.0), with [no security compromises](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/privacy-and-security/other/is-bitcoin-secure-has-the-bitcoin-network-ever-been-hacked) on the Bitcoin network itself. Thus I'm wondering if the industry have considered building DeFi secured by bitcoin network? Would like to hear everyone's thoughts !

The above link is someone, somehow getting into the ""wallet"" I had on Blockchain, and taking the coin for themselves.

I had it sat there for 3 years, so it's my own fault for leaving it there. It's not the money, I bought it for around $250 in 2017, and it would be worth around $750 so in reality, it's peanuts. 

I have no idea how they got the login, how they managed to bypass the ""not your normal device"" email.

No I didn't have 2FA (that will teach me) and no I never moved it to a cold/hard wallet (again, that will teach me).

It just really angers me that people think it's okay to do these things.

Who knows what I might have used it for. I have a very young daughter. Perhaps I would have bought her something nice, but no, not anymore. Bastards!

I've always been an avid support of Bitcoin, but honestly, I really can't be bothered now.

So, the bottom line is this:

* To whoever transferred the coin out of the wallet: I hope you choke on that pizza, get run over or get gutted one day because karma will come for you.
* DO NOT keep any Bitcoin on any exchange, whatsoever, no matter how little because you'll think, it'll never happen to me. It can, and it will. Hell before you even purchase any, get a proper actual wallet. Don't be stupid like me. 
* Don't use Blockchain, they are useless and are of no help to anyone, except themselves.
* Protect yourselves at all times, even more so than when you're about to get down and dirty with someone.",1602836994,8,1

jcps7m,Forsage_io,Decentralization: What is it?," 

https://preview.redd.it/rx2p6ptfflt51.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c89d4ec8f517b7eda30a329a0fbfa891a97f8fbc

Decentralization is the key feature of all blockchain projects. In many respects it is thanks to decentralization that these projects are gaining popularity and the trust of users.

But what is decentralization? What project can be called decentralized, and how can this feature be implemented?

A decentralized project is a project in which there is no third party, be it an administrator or manager who has the ability to single-handedly make decisions and influence the future of the project. Also, in a decentralized project there is no single server where all the information is stored and, by disabling such a server, you can terminate the project, depriving users of the ability to access it.

So what is decentralization? In a nutshell, it is distribution. In decentralized projects, information is split into small parts and stored on the computers of all network users. This means that in order to damage such a network, more than 51% of devices need to be hacked, which is almost impossible. In other words, decentralization is a special process of distribution of authority, funds, or efforts. The global governing body does not interfere in these actions. This means that the management of the network is carried out jointly by many network nodes that share equal responsibilities, and run the same software. The data stored in such a network cannot be distorted or corrected, because it is based on many computers at once. The performance of the system cannot be influenced by a single person.

The word ‚Äòdecentralization‚Äô is often associated with the word ‚Äòblockchain‚Äô, and for good reason. Blockchain is a decentralized ledger that contains an ever-growing list of entries, or blocks. These records are organized in a strict sequence, with each subsequent record storing part of the information about the previous record. Such a database is stored on users‚Äô computers, and it does not have a single server. Everyone who stores the database has its full copy, and new records are constantly added to all existing copies.

Still not very clear? Let‚Äôs explain with a simple example with apples:

*Alex has bought 6 apples. We write this fact down into a blockchain (a kind of diary), and get block number 1. We are sending block number 1 to Nick, Victor, Sally, Sam, and Margo, who are network users. Now these folks all know that Alex has 6 apples.*

*Alex gives Nick 5 apples to share with his friends. We also write this fact down into block number 2. In this case, block # 2 contains a unique identifier for block # 1. We are sending this block to Victor, Sally, Sam, and Margo.*

*Nick gives Victor 1 apple. We write this down into block number 3, and add the unique identifier of block # 2 to the ledger. We send the block to the entire network.*

*Nick gives Sally 3 apples so that she can share them with her friends. We write this to block number 4, and add block ID # 3. We send the block to everyone in the network.*

*Sally, instead of treating her friends with apples, eats all 3 apples by herself. And when Sam and Margo come to her for the promised apples (after all, they received a message that Nick gave Sally three apples), Sally tries to blame Nick. Allegedly, he gave her only 1 apple, and kept the rest for himself. But the entry on the network says something else, and both Sally and Margo know perfectly well that it was Sally who ate the fruit intended for them.*

This is how decentralization protects us from fraud within the network, making transactions extremely simple and transparent. It also protects the network from being hacked, and from failures that occur due to human factors.",1602913560,3,1

Such investments will not only help increase bitcoin's market cap but also increase its adoption and legitimacy.

This might be a great time to buy some bitcoin as we might see a bull run coming soon.

Here are some quick ways to buy bitcoin based on region:

**USA:**

* Coinbase: One of the most popular choices to buy bitcoin in the USA. It offers an easy-to-use platform along with a crypto wallet, stablecoin support, payment gateway.

**Bitcoin ATM:** *Select regions*

Bitcoin ATM provides the convenience to purchase bitcoin using Cash. The best part about these is that there is no need for KYC verification and the transactions are anonymous.

jawpsk,brianddk,Fun with OP_HODL (CheckLockTimeVerify),"Finally got around to messing around with [python-bitcoinlib](https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib), and I'm very impressed.  Great work by Peter Todd.  I went ahead and cooked up a sample based off of the ones provided to test OP_HODL.  This is bitcoin contract that can lock funds in a UTXO until a specified time has arrived.

* [spend-p2wsh-hodl.py](https://github.com/brianddk/reddit/blob/f90765f0d30f92398b240ff04d24268b3da7d338/python/spend-p2wsh-hodl.py)

This script will lock funds in a UTXO until ""10/13/2020 @ 6:55am (UTC)"".  Though realistically you really need to wait about an hour past your expiry time since the `nLockTime` logic uses that average of the last 11 blocks as a clock, not the last block.

Here's a breakdown:
***
* Funding TXN: [ef3fad0...51c8def](https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/test3/txs/ef3fad03b7fd4fe42956e41fccb10ef1a95d98083d3b9246b6c17a88e51c8def)
* Spending TXN: [3a461e6...78de2b6](https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/test3/txs/3a461e6de82cb2365e9105b127e7e2976da998aeaf7284333304bd3ff78de2b6)

First look at the witness program on the spending txn.

```
&lt;sig&gt; &lt;witnessScript&gt;
```

If we add the deserialize the witnessScript this is what we get:

```
&lt;sig&gt; &lt;&lt;expiry&gt; OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP &lt;pubkey&gt; OP_CHECKSIG&gt;
```

Looking at the 2nd output of the funding txn, you should see the `ScriptPubKey` is simply `OP_0` to signal segwit and the hash of the witness script.

```
OP_0 &lt;witnessScript_hash&gt;
```

And of course, our `nLockTime` in our spending TXN matches our `expiry`, and our sequence in our spending txn is encoded to allow nLockTime processing.

***

One thing that was interesting with `nLockTime` txns is that they are completely invalid before they ""ripen"".  You can't even store them in your wallet.  You just have to wait to broadcast until the right time transpires.  Broadcasting early will fail with a `non-final` error.

The CoinBin wallet is the only one I know of that allows you to create `OP_HODL` addresses, but I'm not certain they provide a way to spend them.",1602663690,8,1

jawnot,BannedOnMyMain17,Thank F!@#$% God I found LocalCoinSwap,"Many years ago, as a young lad, I mined some bitcoin. I also do a little sports forecasting with bovada ;) Because of this i've always had BTC hanging around and never felt like there was any good or safe way to actually f!@##%$ sell the stuff. 

Last week I was scammed out of $500 worth of BTC. I was devastated. I had actually been going through other terrible personal troubles in my life (probably why i was dumb enough to get scammed) and in one of the lowest moments of my life, some guy out there somewhere MAYBE EVEN ONE OF YOU, stole from me. It was awful. I've just been so desperate for a safe way to sell my BTC without getting raped by uncle sam or rekt by service fees or other bullshit. 

What i really wanted was exactly what Local Coin Swap offers. Simply put, it's a pier to pier escrow system that lets you safely sell your BTC. That's it. You recieve payouts from all sorts of methods that i could see (i just used paypal). Tonight I used their system to sell what according to google is 159 dollars worth of BTC to a super cool dude who was patient with me for my first trade and actually sent me $220 dollars, all while I had the safety and protection of this escrow platform. 

A lot of you say why not use coinbase? well their shit was intrusive signing up for an account, they wanted the last 4 of my social and to know the source of my BTC? Fuck off, the source is bovada and that's none of your fucking business specifically. Decentralized currency shouldn't be tracked harder than paper currency that's half the point so they can F!@#$ right off. 

Anyways. I finally did it boys, I sold some BTC and i couldn't be happier

TLDR, I found the glory of pier to pier escrow without the government or exchanges bending me over the barrel.",1602663370,11,1

Can the specific lanes and connections between bitcoin nodes be selectively shut down?  I understand the whack-a-mole game theory of it, where another node pops up to pick up where others got cut out, but could this be a long term threat to the greatest invention of this generation?

""Sometimes I find it hard to explain to friends what drives bitcoin...many have no understanding of it at all. I explain the difference between crypto, blockchain, and smart contracts, which then goes into tokenization. Ultimately, I refer them to Tom Lee (Fundstrat), Tim Draper (Draper &amp; Assoc. Hedge Fund), etc. However, I recently came across another source while exploring exchange traded funds. ARK ETFs is a very aggressive family of ETFs that specialize in disruptive technologies (NOT PUSHING THEM). And, on their website they actually have written a couple of really good papers on why BTC is disruptive and will survive and grow down the road. For what it's worth for those who want to look.

jeztle,Spartan3123,could mining pools be charged for violating sanctions?,"If those running a bitcoin mixer can be charged for violating AML, can a centralized mining pool charged for mining a transaction violating sanctions?

Mining pools are relatively large organizations that control what transactions get into the block as they create the block template using the bitcoin protocol. Thus they have 'ownership' of what transactions are processed. They outsource some of the POW hashing to 'ASIC' operators ( that are not responsible for selecting transactions ) 

large organizations generate allot of revenue and hire multiple people and present a large target for law enforcement vs a random solo miner that mines a block every now then. They are more likely to be  compliant with requests to censor transactions to protect their 'reputation/business' 

This is, why protocols like better-hash needs to be widely adopted because, with better hash the pool is \_NOT\_ responsible for selecting transactions - all it will do is pool the rewards. Individual miners in the pool can create their own block templates.  Thus they are no longer ASIC operators as they need to run a full node to create the block template. 

  
I think betterhash will decentralize legal liabilities  of the mining pool. Any point of centralization in bitcoin like a custodian mixing service is vulnerable to legal action.",1603231591,11,1

Not sure who here has a legal background or is in Texas's 11th congressional district, but if you're capable of nagging a representative -- conaway needs to hear comments and letters and calls over his Digital Commodity Exchange Act bill proposal that hes working on with several other in congress.

And actually since it's being led by the Congressional BlockChain Caucus, those specific representatives on the panel are the ones who need to be lobbyied the hardest and heavily appealed to by the public.

The main issue with the CFTC and US commodity laws, is that normies and us crypto people don't really have any idea about the area and don't think it affects them.

In reality the CFTC is almost soley to blame for how extremely limited options are for US citizens in crypto and extremely to blame for the high fees. The approval of exchanges and services is determined by the SEC AND the CFTC. Well the CFTC is the reason we are banned off almost every exchange outside Kraken/Gemini/Coinbase.

The DCEA bill is the only way they will ever let Binance.us or other similar US exchanges offer the type of leveraged products , ***products in general and various new listings in general*** ,and fees the rest of the world gets to enjoy. It's a huge huge problem and it isn't going to get better until the average exchange can easily register with the National Futures Association easily.

Bitmex never complied with the CFTC because it is nearly impossible to comply with and they will not let retail participate. There needs to be extreme pressure on the CFTC and Heath Tarbert by the US crypto community.

All of the heat I have gotten on reddit from this community is relate to **YOUR INABILITY TO UNDERSTAND US COMMODITY AND FINANCIAL LAW AND REGULATIONS.  If you do not understand why these regulations are strangling the market, maybe you need to be quiet and go study US financial law and learn about how it actually works and pertains to commodities and securities.** 

**I get it, we don't like regulations, but you are never ever going to be allowed as a US citizen to trade or invest or purchase or sell any meaningful size in an anonymous fashion, you will get caught, the IRS will catch up, and they will ban whatever exchange you used, and they are most certainly coming for your DeFi.**

Dear Community,

we are not sure if this the right forum to purpose this one. We are working on a development for a new chain for African people to get more adaption within Africa Content. We're also working on a new coin for payment for people and help organization in Africa.

Since we are not looking for raising founds through ICO or selling coins. we came with the idea (DONATE YOUR HASHRATE FOR A DAY). Since we had a good reference from many users that nice hash would be the easiest way. We made an account for testing purpose.

The website will be coming up soon with all details. but for now if you are interested to share/donate your Hash rate and helping to raise Founds for a good purpose you are most welcome to use our mining Wallet into nice hash for 1 day (or more) every contribution is welcome. Also willing to hear from the community in here, if you have a proposed, ideas or assistance to share. They are more than welcome.

Kind Regards.

For Donation, you hash rate:

1. install Nice hash miner on your System :[https://www.nicehash.com/cpu-gpu-mining](https://www.nicehash.com/cpu-gpu-mining)
2. Allow it on Firewall
3. Add our mining wallet address: 3N6XnMdXyF7SijfQeG7po7U5yRDqwKBuDf
4. Benchmark and then mine and donate!

P.S. We will post a continuous update within this forum

I'm a US citizen - I live in France - and want to invest $25K in BTC.

The money is being sent to me from a family member in the US. But it is extremley difficult finding a solution. 

I'd like to have the money wired **directly** to an account like Kraken, (for several reasons) but they won't accept **third party deposits**.

I currently use Skrill, but I'm limited to small transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have to questions:

\-**Do you know of a crypto exchange that accepts third party deposits?**

**-Which (if any) are ex-pat friendly for large transations (with reasonable fees)?**

While BTC is close to its weekly close of around $13,000, a key win for the bulls, the downside from here is cautious.There are signs that the cryptocurrency may be overbought in the short term, rising more than $1,500 in a week or so.So there is a good chance of an extreme rebound from the fall.It is recommended to hold the position and wait",1603694288,14,1

I was around in the Silk Road days, but the only way to buy bitcoin back then was by going into the bank and doing a direct deposit into an exchanges account, so I never bothered. It was hovering around $63 AUD back then. 

Fast forward to this year and I finally got involved in crypto. Bought about $200 worth at $11,000 AUD roughly, and was stacking it every pay day. 

Had about 0.25 bitcoin stacked and had to liquidate it all for a loss because of a financial emergency involving my two young kids. Now I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll ever have enough money to get back in. 

Just was crazy pondering that if I had of gotten in at $63 when I was younger, that today I would be literally debt free and not contemplating suicide on a daily basis.

If person B tries to buy it on-chain using markets the price will probably increase as person B buys.

However if person B tells person A ""I will buy your address with $500m for $500m"" then it has no effect on price on-chain.

It seems to me that these transactions could be happening without affecting BTC price. 

Of course, I see that the same is in reverse and it makes it possible for person A to dispose of $500m BTC, without affecting the price.

Is it a wash then? 

It seems to me that whales have two markets: other whales and the rest of us.

In my teens and early twenties I knew all about gadgets the latest craze etc....

Every time I read about bitcoin even when it was being talked about on the good old bodybuilding.com forums I couldn‚Äôt make heads or tails of it.

As I‚Äôm getting older I have begun to think more about retirement, god willing I see that old age. In about 12 years if I leave early or 22 if my investments don‚Äôt pay off.

I pay into an ok private pension. I have paid into regular 10 year saving plans with  the first to mature in three years with about ¬£3k every year thereafter.

My question is this and please forgive for sounding outdated and left behind. I want to invest in bitcoin for the long term. I have no desire to make payments with it as I prefer the old way of cash. I believe that it will hold me in good stead in 12-22 years. 

I am not switched on enough with terminology and the like with bitcoin. I can do stocks and shares that is easy. I don‚Äôt trade I invest. I put my money into solid company‚Äôs and forget about it for a few years unless I hear something detrimental.

I just want to invest in a single bitcoin and forget about it... whether it goes up or down today tomorrow next month or next year makes no difference to me really just that hopefully when I do need it it‚Äôll have matured nicely.

There would be some kind of record of the property connected with my identity (in a limited sense, more of my issued ID and some other identificators, not my person) and some form of local municipality or other authority would easily resolve it to my benefit.

If I owned a car, it would be pretty similar situation in practice. A car can be taken from me easier than a house, because a house is harder to move. But there are authorities to help me. 

If I owned a computer, I would assume it's mine because I paid for it. It is not connected to my identity, and my ownership in a dispute is provable by owning an invoice/receipt, in best case with matching serial number.

This is not the same kind of ownership as my imaginary house or a car. Let's call this ownership by proxy. Proxy in this instance being an assumption, that it would be very unprobable for someone else than me to be even aware about my dispute, not even think about how weird it would be if multiple people presented a valid receipt/invoice. But we could think of a scenario that if they did, I could lose the dispute.

***I do not own any bitcoin.***

*I may or may not know about some privkeys that may or may not control a couple of sats.*

If I had a legal dispute over those few imaginary sats, I have nothing to present to make my case favorable to me. Nobody will insure it for me, while my computer can be insured for physical damage. There is no authority to help me. 

*If I really controled those few sats, I would think of them as mine because I didn't steal them.*

***I wouldn't need any help.***

But even in a dispute over my house or my car, my body and my thoughts likely won't be enough to fight for them. I'd still likely had to present some kind of plastic card, possibly also stacks of papers. Perhaps even say words and go places.

*If you store your bitcoin on an exchange, or with services such as robinhood, paypal soon enough, or countless of others custodians, let me congratulate you.*

***You own bitcoin.***

You own it almost like you own your house, almost like you own your car, maybe somewhat like you own your computer. If it wasn't at your house.

**You own bitcoin, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.**

But it's not yours like your thoughts and your body is yours. 

I would gladly pay taxes for the house, car and a computer. My happiness with these taxes could likely be proportionate to my expectation of relevant authorities helping me in a dispute. There is no difference in which currency did I pay for these things.

**I am not paying taxes for my thoughts, that would ruin me financially in a month.**

jhvg65,SpockSays,This is it.,"I don't plan to sell ANY bitcoin for USD in the future. Instead, I will take bank loans against my bitcoin, using the btc as collateral and purchase more rental properties. Then, mortgage/refinance the property, and use that cash to pay back the bank for my bitcoin loan. Rinse and repeat, etc. Get more renters and properties, and with the cash flow, pay off the mortgages and buy more bitcoin. 

Remember kids, you pay capital gains tax when you sell your bitcoin. Take a low interest loan instead and use the loan to buy cash flow generating assets. Use your money to make more money, pay as few taxes as possible, and buy more bitcoin.

I don't feel confident holding fiat cash, especially considering the USD money supply increased by 22% in year 2020 alone. I don't feel confident investing in the stock market with the state of the current economy, the aftermath and ongoing problems related to covid, and the incompetence of government handling stimulus.

Now that macro investors like Paul Tudor Jones and companies like MicroStrategy and Square are making heavy moves into bitcoin, it makes sense to me now more than ever. I was feeling these kinds of investors and institutions were gonna come in eventually, and now it's finally happening. Obviously, its still early, more companies need to join in too. I have a feeling they will.

I‚Äôve been in for a long time. Im not a newbie in the space. I don't see a better monetary instrument to bet on in this moment.

I buy BTC using Cash App. Can I just send BTC from my Cash App to the public address I imported into Coin Stats? Would that transfer only be confirmed once I sync my ledger sometime in the future?

Normally I would plug the Ledger into my computer and generate a new public address and confirm it on my ledger and have my Cash App BTC sent there. I ‚Äòsign‚Äô the transaction during this but I do not know what this means. 

Another question, if one pro of the hardware wallet is it generates a new public address for each transaction. But how was I able to import just one public address into Coin Stats and watch the whole balance of the wallet?

Paypal offers soon the ability to buy / sell and store btc and also to pay with bitcoin in ~ 25 Million Shops that are using paypal. (first USA Residents only, but soon other countries probably aswell)

Couldn't this possible lead to a huge amount of new daily transaction and has a significant effect on the mempool?
Because you could suddenly pay in alot of shops with Bitcoin that didn't offered it before.

What happens if the amount of transaction increases rapidly? 
This will lead to alot of new unconfirmed transactions on the mempool and therefore to huge transactions fees probably. 
We already have right now transaction fees of 4,27$ for a Medium Priority.

jga1tm,gushani,Btc set to 28k USD,"While the bitcoin bull does not give a timeframe when this is likely to happen, i believes that, thanks to relentless government money printing, the benchmark cryptocurrency will eventually test $100,000. But not before some correction.

‚Äú$28,000 is in play before we see a pullback ‚Äì and then we‚Äôre heading to 6-figures,‚Äù Keiser forecast, in the course of several tweets.

Bitcoin (BTC) soared more than 20% to hit $11,300 on July 28, its highest level since August 2019. The top crypto has struggled to break above the key $10,000 point since the May 11 halving, but made easy of the resistance level in the last 48 hours.

The rally comes as the U.S. government this week announced another round of stimulus spending, a $1 trillion package, that will also finance Covid-19 cushioning allowances paid out to American families at the rate of $1,200.

The last time Bitcoin rose above $10,000 was in May, and it only fell by 15%. It‚Äôs above $13.000  today. How big will the next drop be?

Schiff is puking his brains out right now, regretting his gold purchase.


Regarding the relative accessibility of bitcoin over gold, I have been saying for over a year that silver and gold will be difficult to source and the market will shift to Bitcoin as hard money substitutes, and those who never thought of buying BTC will be forced to.

Gold and Bitcoin are usually paired as safe investment havens. Bitcoin‚Äôs finite money compares favorably to fiat currency. With the U.S dollar weakening, as the government doles out free money, the distinction comes into focus.",1603405255,5,1

1.Match on Tinder with a very pretty Chinese girl however after a few short messages they will ask for a phone number to talk more privetly. They might then 'unmatch' you on Tinder.
2.They play the long game - weeks, a month or even a few months to lure the mark in.
3. They always say they will be visiting or heading back to the country of origin of the mark.
4. They tend to be from Hong Kong
5. They invest in cryptocurrency
6.They always have insider information about said currency.

jj1q6n,Bitcoin1776,There are signs that a major Bitcoin miner (who was liquidating stored Bitcoins to keep power going) has officially gone busto.,"Here you see major hash decline:

https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate

Here you can see '1st spends' of Bitcoin

https://terminal.bytetree.com/bitcoin

(I can't verify the accuracy of this).

I've been watching 1st spends a while, averaging like 15,000 more Bitcoins spent than mined for the last year. That's like $180 Mil.

First spends can only be done by miners. Spending more than mined basically means they are spending from old blocks (like blocks that paid out 50 BTC, 25 BTC, 12.5 BTC etc).

There is some bonus value to first spend coins that I don't quite understand, but basically you get 10% or 20% more than the Bitcoin value when you spend them, because they are completely untraceable or something like that. You can *sort of* trace Bitcoins, but it's very, very hard to trace newly mined Bitcoins until they are spent and linked up with other assets of said individual.

So over the last year, someone has been liquidating these reserve Bitcoins, while hash power of Bitcoin has gone up like double from where it was and payouts have fallen in half, so mining is paying like 25% of what it was this time last year, when BTC was $10k (presuming you stay on old equipment, etc.).

I could imagine a situation where a BTC bull holds these first spend coins for a long time, planning on a rapid price jump which takes a long time to materialize. And then combine that with he $3.5k Corona / Oil dip, which basically forced liquidated everyone on margin position (which Bitcoin bulls tend to do), and I could see a scenario where someone had a wonderfully huge Bitcoin position, and mining op, and then got all their free coins liquidated by margin call, and spent their '1st spend' coins to keep ops going, hoping for rapid price acceleration.

This is all conjecture but I've been expecting something like this to happen. Maybe it's just a blip, and I'm totally wrong, and hash climbs back up, but if it stays down and the BTC price goes up, then I'm thinking a miner went busto, who had be applying $10's of Millions of sell pressure monthly onto the system.",1603807531,12,1

Hello, I have tried posting this on the¬†r/binance, my post was deleted in seconds. My group in the app telegram, containing more than 130 individuals and myself, have suffered from deception by BULL BEAR tokens in March 2020 on the Binance exchange. This is exclusively on deception, not on improper trading! You can read in detail about deception on my website [Binancescam.me](http://binancescam.me).
At the moment, my group and I have exhausted all options to return our money, we were blocked everywhere by representatives of Binance, blocked in social networks. Aswell as for sorting it out in court, binance does not negotiate with us, they ignore our demands to start a lawsuit with us and to provide Binance's data for the lawsuit. They won't even make their adress public.

Since March, we have seen token deception, attempts at forgery, false promises, and again deception! We saw an attempt at phishing and all possible sabotage of our group. Many people have suffered, many do not even know that they have suffered from these tokens. Below and on my website I will post a list of victims from our group only. Binance exchange is a scam exchange that is not taking responsibility for anything. I lost my wife and my two children at this exchange. There were big plans for this money, they were intended for an operation this year. If you have any type of information or would like to help us, we will be very appreciative and grateful.

**Investors and market watchers focus on Bitcoin price predictions; there is a widespread expectation that the price can increase, and many investors search for news and information on trends. A recent Bloomberg news article noted that Bitcoin(BTC) rose from $1,000 to $10,000 in less than four years.**  


The writing projects the trend line and estimates that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by 2025. According to the article, Bitcoin will reach $100,000 in 2025 if it can add a zero to its price twice the time it took to add the zero from $1,000 to $10,000.

The discussion point is that Bitcoin may have slowed in its price expansion but still can continue climbing into the foreseeable future. Bitcoin has had sharp rises and falls; the overall trend line is one of remarkable growth. A Koinal account can start a path to Bitcoin investment or expand an existing plan. Our portal is convenient and straightforward; Koinal uses bank-issued cards to make cryptocurrency purchases. 

## Long-Term Projections

The well-informed cryptocurrency community has seen bolder predictions. For example, a widely distributed Stock-to-Flow Model forecasts a $100,000 price by late 2020. The Bloomberg article suggests that both historical trends and the current supply and demand direction favor Bitcoin growth. Institutional demand is rising, and it will likely increase while the supply approaches the production limits. The limited supply will drive prices higher. 

At Koinal.io, we work with you to carry out your investment and financial plans. Our program works with small or large volume purchases. Koinal works with the leading cryptocurrency exchanges that offer a wide variety of leading currencies.

## Short-Term Projections

While the long-term price point gets the attention, the article notes that the short-term prediction is that BTC will once again reach the $14,000 price point in 2020. The year 2019 was the last time Bitcoin sold at that level. 

A Koinal account can set you on a path to participate in cryptocurrency. The Koinal purchasing process is easy to understand and convenient; it does not require bank wires or other special arrangements. We are here to help you open an account and start trading today.",1603791771,3,1

We are looking to expand this number because the small amount of cross pollination of ideas that we have had so far has been very beneficial and we would like to increase this benefit. 

As long as you have a basic understanding of trading and technical analysis I would encourage you to apply. The main thing you will need is a desire to become a full time profitable trader. 

We are not experts at trading or technical analysis and currently we are not profitable. That is one of the main goals of this group, to produce profitable traders. We have only traded with a few hundred dollars so far, we plan to increase this amount over time. We are beginners but want to improve quickly. Ideally you would have the same aspirations.

Some of the things we do in the slack are: 

* Video Calls
* Group back testing.
* Group market analysis.
* Discussions about fundamentals.
* Deep dive into record keeping systems.
* Group trade analysis.
* Group learning.
* Group strategy troubleshooting.
* Strategy sharing.
* Risk management analysis.
* Occasional social / fun events.

So if yall thinking that crypto can replace cash im gonna say ur wrong, if ur scared to even keep crypto on ur phone bc it may randomly dissaphear bc some hacker do whatever his things are then it wont replace cash for me or anyone 

Yeah it may good for investment to like buy crypto as safe as possible and do the process of storing them in ur usb which will never go online to be safe and come back 10 years later to withdraw those btcs , Yes thats cool

If PayPal decides to let users actually use Bitcoin for it's purpose and not as some speculative gamble, we're going to see the beginning of the beginning.

i have read even in places like reddit that bit2me is trustworthy, i have also read that i does not matter if it is only the the front of the card.

Should i do it ?  or is it too suspicious ?

Good evening blockchain community!!:))  
I'm working on a uni assignment currently which I need to adjust a centralized business model for. The idea is to turn it into a decentralized business model (including Blockchain, social contract, distributed servers etc.) that the company, the creatives (DJ), and preferably all the other stakeholders benefit from.  
I already set up a plan but according to our tutor, we need to add feedback from experts.

Hence, if there is an expert here in this group that is willing to have a glimpse at my business model I would be very grateful!!

Reach out to me and I'll send the PDF document to you!! :)) It seems that one can't attach files here...",1603471053,7,1

Now that the node is back up and running, it began resyncing with the blockchain, starting about an hour back in time. Once it synced the latest block, the mempool began to fill again from empty. Within minutes, it's over 50mb and climbing.

The tx in mobile wallet seems fine (still unconfirmed). Since 50mb of new tx certainly didn't occur within the last few minutes, am I correct in assuming that nodes do indeed gossip unconfirmed tx back and forth such that I don't necessarily need to rebroadcast my tx?

If that is the case, then what is different in situations (like now) where the backlog is larger than the default 300mb allocation? My personal node is configured for several GB of mempool and so wouldn't my node (among others configured similarly) take on the task of rebroadcasting all of the low priority tx's as mempool clears?

Are all of my assumptions wrong and my node simply saved the mempool state before restarting? (It was a clean shutdown.)  Thanks for any clarification, just trying to learn how it works under the hood.",1604067347,0,1

jku2qs,zimmon375,I am NEW here and have some questions," Well hello there,

i need to make an presentation for my graduation process (i dont know how that is named in English i gave it my best try) and my theme is cryptocurrencies.

and want to start mining altcoin and with my limited budget i think (correct me if im wrong) usd coin (UDSC) would be one of the ""cheaper"" but more reliable options, right?

how would i strat mining?

perhaps it would be better if i clarify straight from the beginning that i do not have a good Internet Connection (yet)  and just a crappy laptop (ryzen 5 vega graphics with 8 gb RAM)

also i dont have much money to spend sooo ? any tipps?

some further questions:  


1.  because i dont have much money i am limited with my wallet options  what is the cheapest and safest way to store my keys? (paper in a metal case is not safe enough i feel)

2.  is mining just as easy as installing a programm and running it 24/7

3. do i have to download the blockchain because on here  --- &gt; [https://bitcoin.org/de/download](https://bitcoin.org/de/download) ...

well i don understand a thiing and more than 350 gb dowload takes waaaaaaayyyyyyy to long 

&amp;#x200B;

sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes.

to make it easier for me and hopefully a couple others that reply 

i am German and speak it fluently so i would be happy if you CAN  reply in german.

# THANK YOU

A $10 lunch would cost  ‚Çø 0.00002

A $4 coffee = ‚Çø 0.000008

Any zeros intentionally (or unintentionally) added or subtracted and the cost is considerably different.

Obviously automation will be more streamlined for ‚Çø. 

And $ price will almost certainly be shown alongside ‚Çø price.

However, **how fungible** will BTC be for the average consumer, making the average pruchase, if there are 6 zeros in front of every number? 

Will we even be reading numbers on reciepts?

jkqaxl,dotBombAU,Help with BTC wallet incorrect balance.,"Hey all, 

I'm having some problems with an old wallet not showing the correct balance in both bitcoind.exe and the QT client. Reads fine on the blockchain and my old node which was running 16.3.

When I import the wallet to the newer bitcoind.exe version the balance shows as very low/and incorrect and can return random as well. For example the client will show 0.2 BTC when there might be 0.5btc

I have read 'getbalance' has been deprecated and there is a new label system in place also which I am trying to get my head around. so for the meantime I'm using a version of bitcoind.exe that supports deprecation using the old accounts system.

I've tried re-scanning, re-indexing, trying various versions of BTC, downloading a fresh new chain, exporting the wallet/keys and importing them into a new wallet running the latest BTC version and nothing works. When I check it on the old node the balance comes back just fine. Stumped. 

As I've said the wallet is old but according to documentation it's still supported. Anyone come across this before or have an idea that I might just have missed?",1604032295,2,1

If you care about bitcoin you should be able to talk about the political issues that affect it most greatly, including the politics of bitcoin itself. Maximalism should not be the default position of the largest reddit group for the coin. There are severe political consequences to maximalism and severe concerns about censorship and the recreation of censorial governmental type behavior.

Maximalism is a real thing, and it is a bad thing. It is not something that describes pro bitcoin people, it is a doctrinaire political commitment to protectionist prevailing imperial dictatorial behavior to enrich whoever could push a central theme that enriches their holdings, this is especially true for the rich in America, and in fact it helps extend american exceptionalism and supremacy.",1604027100,57,1

I have been dealing with Coinbase pro for nearly two months, I sent them everything I have about my business and yet they still ask for more and more documents.

Being a bit pissed, I decided to move to bit2me to whom I sent all the required documents. The issue, they ask for the origin of funds.

Which funds? I only want to accept BTC as a payment in our business. They replied that that's fine but that I had to ask my customers for the origin of funds ?? I found that to be ridiculous and intrusive.

Funny thing is, I do not even have any funds yet so there is nothing to be proven, their response is that if I can't justify the origin of funds I can't open an account with them.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried coinmama and everything seems to be OK, I got verified real quick but did read some bad stuff like funds getting locked after they track certain wallets from gambling sites or some short, can anybody clarify if this is true?

(I think he meant my phone but we talked bitcoin right before) uncomfortable silence for a few moments. After several seconds I responded: ‚Äúbitcoin will and has set me free from the slavery you endorsed your whole life‚Äù. (Hour long discussion afterwards)

Apparently he was still under the impression bitcoin was a project that might fail any second which was highly volatile, speculative and even criminal.

My grandfather is pretty up to date with technology and appreciates learning from each conversation he has especially with the younger generations. He eventually agreed this was a revolutionary technology and embraced my enthusiasm. He also noted how our current governance is defect and this might solve it.

What really touched me he said he was excited for the future we are heading to which was very promising considering everything that‚Äôs happening and bitcoin is a positive thing to focus on. But he and his generation aren‚Äôt a part of it. He will be dead or uninterested by the team it brings true change to our daily lives.

It made me realize more than ever older people like warren buffet or old politicians have no ambition to see bitcoin or blockchain succeed in their terms of spotlight because it sounds like future technology they won‚Äôt be a part of. I gave him around 0.05 BTC and told him he‚Äôs a part of it now. He sends me weekly messages now üòÑ

‚ñ™ Marathon [said](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/26/2114277/0/en/Marathon-Patent-Group-Announces-Purchase-of-Additional-10-000-S-19-Pro-Miners-from-Bitmain.html) the deal would boost the company‚Äôs operations to 23,560 next-generation miners, ‚Äúmaking it the largest self-miner in North America‚Äù.

‚ñ™ When fully installed, the new machines will bring the firm‚Äôs total hashrate to 2.56 exahash per second (EH/s) ‚Äì one of the world‚Äôs top 15 bitcoin miners.

‚ñ™ In August, Marathon [bought](https://news.bitcoin.com/nasdaq-listed-firm-marathon-buys-10500-next-gen-bitcoin-miners-for-23m/) another 10,500 miners of the same make for $23 million. Bitmain will deliver all the miners in batches starting in January through June.

‚ñ™ Marathon CEO Merrick Okamoto said the company‚Äôs mining operations had continued to grow ‚Äúagainst the backdrop of recently increasing bitcoin prices.‚Äù

‚ñ™ The latest purchase comes just two weeks after Marathon, an $81.6 million-valued company, [announced](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-miner-marathon-agrees-to-deal-that-cuts-electricity-costs-by-38-with-us-power-company/) a joint venture agreement that reduces its electricity costs for extracting bitcoin by 38%.

jjvg04,FaBLee1,How I lost all my BTC savings being greedy with futures trading.,"I hope this post will be a big lesson for those who are in the same situation as i was, as well as I am seeking for any advice that could help me through this tough times.

So back in 2014 I first learned about Bitcoin and I loved the idea of cryptocurrency so much, that in 3-4 years from learning about it when I became 18, I started investing and trading.

As time went by I was investing small amounts, trading, and apparently slowly losing my money, but at that time it was ok because that were small amounts which I could afford to lose. 
In 2019 i moved from a poor country in Europe, for a better life to London. I was working in London and by the end of 2019 I got almost 3k¬£ in Btc, that were my savings.

But then the worse started to happen, I loved trading, have read many books, got through tutorials, and was slowly trading my way up, and then I discovered the futures with up too 100x.

At first I used low leverages, up to 10, then being greedy and not taking profits I always ended with losses, it started by losing small amounts, I was thinking let me put some more money in so I could trade what I lost back, I was getting emotional losing more and more, increasing leverages up to 75 rarely even 100. I was very upset with myself, at one moment  when I already lost 500 I said no stop, but one-two weeks passed and I again was depositing to trade, and this snowball was getting bigger as I was losing even more hoping I will get everything back and hodl.

And right know I got a big life lesson, don‚Äôt trade unless you can afford to lose that money, and never let your emotions in trading, I lost all my savings totalling about 5000¬£, I go almost a 1000¬£ debt. Because I even used a credit card to load it up.
I hate myself, because I could just hodl. And know not having a proper job due to COVID, I have to survive somehow. This is how you learn a lesson the hard way, don‚Äôt repeat my mistakes, just hodl and you will be fine.

Knowing that this community is huge, I would like to ask for some advice or tips, how should I deal with this in the future, how to forget this loss and move on(these 5000 were huge money for me).
I m right now totally devastated, depressed and in kind of a dead end. 

I am teaching myself programming, and already pretty good at some languages, my little dream is to become a developer, or to open a successful business, but being In thus situation, it‚Äôs hard to find a job in it sphere, without having a degree or experience, so I would appreciate any help and advice to go the right path. There are definitely people here that make good money and have been through tough situations, I want to know what‚Äôs your mindset and what was your journey.

Thank you for reading to the end! HODL and be smart.",1603916128,66,1

I'm hoping on some confirmation on whether I'm understanding things correctly. Please, go ahead and let me know if I state something stupid below.

John signs up in Coinbase Pro, goes through the KYC process and buys some BTC from time to time. He sends the BTC to an Electrum Wallet. 

Because his BTC where bought through Coinbase, Coinbase can identify John's wallet and potentially track all transactions following the initial removal of the BTC from the exchange. Also, Coinbase can share that information with third parties, increasing the list of who could identify John's wallet and coin movements.

Now John sets up a bisq client and buys some BTC from other peers in the bisq network. The BTC is initially held in John's bisq wallet, but he proceeds to send them to the same Electrum wallet where he previously sent the Coinbase BTC.

Questions: 

* Could Coinbase/third parties now also identify the BTC bought through bisq as John's, and track further transactions?
* If so, what approaches are available to John to keep his bisq-acquired BTC anonymous?

jjt8bo,_zkao,Bitcoin fees: congestion manager,"The bitcoin mempool transaction queue is messy and too many people are jumping the line, congesting whoever is behind. Let‚Äôs organize that mess. No randomly jumping in front of the line no more! Rather squeeze in and dance with the queue. Forget about physical distancing! Squeeze, and don't let that range of fees grow out of control!

Please meet our traffic controller officer at [Bitcoin congestion manager](https://fee.cryp.ee/)

## The following is for geeks

The aim is to organize the queue by spoting non-uniformity on the mempool fee distribution and suggest fees for new transactions that would fill that gap. Over time that produces a somewhat smooth fee distribution and a much more predictable fee market where parties can trully prioritize transactions, and thus have liveness on Bitcoin.

It is mempool depth-based (i.e., queue position), it is reactive. It uses recent past incoming transaction flows, and mined transcation outflows, to estimate velocities parametric on mempool queue position. Based on block poisson statistics it then estimates when on average a transaction paying a given fee will be mined. Error is multiplicative, so if you rely on these for liveness, please stay right at the surface.

We don't have logs. The backend was commitioned by a client over 2 years ago, and it is open-source. We are serving it at our own costs, but it would be nice to eventually receive donations to cover the costs of running the full node server. Rest and websocket api provided.

\- But he predicts in 5-10 years, digital currencies will moon.

\- Previous generations had metals, then real estate, then oil, then stock (for our parents), and now it‚Äôs digital currency for us.

\- PayPal and Square (big digital payment platforms) just invested millions and billions into Bitcoin. Square invested 50M. PayPal is investing 50 billion. PayPals stock went up 95% and Square is up 188%. PayPal has 346 million users, and they will allow people to buy, sell, and hold BTC. All traditional stocks are down 2-50% this year.

\- A company called Microstrategy invested $425M into BTC.

\- Gov is printing money, and fiat is losing value. So, Paypal and Square are buying digital currencies.

\- Fidelity has launched Bitcoin Fund for wealthy investors.

\- After an expected 2020 halving on BTC, some people expect value to go up 20x (current ATH is $13.7k).

My question is would it make more sense now that bitcoin is in it's uptrend again to get a $10k 36-month loan at 9% to buy bitcoin since I could get more total bitcoin now than investing over time as it's price goes up?

I figure I will pay less every month for the loan than I would just putting my extra money into savings. I could actually pay this loan AND put the additional into savings, or pay off the loan faster. And then come 2022-2023 after bitcoin has it's run up, I could just pay off the loan with whatever profit I made.

I invite you to do the same with the amount you can afford to give. The most important is the intention of involving them.

My plan is to ask them to download a bitcoin wallet during the family dinner we‚Äôll have on the 24th, even the kids, actually they are my biggest target, because they are the future.

Then I will give everyone 0.01 bitcoin and also tell them to write their paraphrase on a piece of paper and preciously keep it. 

The app will show them the value so they might get surprised but it‚Äôs fine. 

I know the kids won‚Äôt be able to cash out as they are between 9 and 15 years old, but the rest might ask me how so I‚Äôll tell them of course but I prefer if they hodl for a while. At least they will set up a Kraken account and be ready for later.

Which app would you recommend to download? I would go with trustwallet but if there‚Äôs better I don‚Äôt mind. I will tell them about hardwallet but I want to make this moment fun and not a crazy amount of infos. 

I‚Äôm sure they will research on their own after that to understand how it works. Maybe ask me questions but I‚Äôm ready to answer anything. Tell me what you think!",1603954665,91,1

I am Praveen and I am the inventor and founder of CoinVault, a second layer technology and service that makes Bitcoin and other similar altcoins unstealable and unlosable for all practical purposes. Tall claim :-) But we believe we have nailed it.

In short, we use Multisig in conjunction with cleverly disributed Pre-signed Transactions that use CSV based clawback mechanisms to recover your Bitcoin even when your private-keys are lost or stolen. It is miles ahead of simple Multisig and non-custodial too. 

You can learn more about CoinVault and how this technology works on our Website - [www.coinvault.tech](https://www.coinvault.tech?utm_campaign=reddit_post1). 

With Bitcoin all set to take on new heights, the incentive to consipre and steal our coins will also grow exponentially. We believe it is time we take the coming wave of threats seriously and brace for them.

Any and every feedback is absolutely welcome. Happy HODLing :-)",1603951471,23,1
jk4rcr,manmate2020,Exodus wallet Integrated Exchange Coinswitch stole my money. Welcome any advice to get the funds back.," I have been using the Exodus wallet  for 2 years with the back up of a Trevor hardware wallet. This wallet  was recommended by many sources such as Coin bureau and Digital Asset  Dave

Yes I know that Exodus  integrated exchange has a high fee but I don't use it often and is  usually of small amounts. However this time I went big (BIG MISTAKE)  thinking the platform was super decentralized the swap didn't go as  expected D:

This is the address I  control sent to via Exodus integrated exchange to either Coin switch or  Exodus address :  0x0df20ff15ae7e8aa20ac29d7dcc231cff9b94a6fc116d0c474c13ca2ee05fd93

This is when it dawned on me that my   funds were stolen. I started feeling this overwhelming dread, something   I've never felt before. I became super sweaty, my body felt it was   heating up, sat very still and I couldn't control my shaken body. I do   not wish this feeling upon anyone.

I   immediately went to the Exodus support page but they said that there  is  nothing they can do about it but directed me to Coinswitch support.

[ Exodus passing the buck? ](https://preview.redd.it/a8r892n05zv51.png?width=1442&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=692cca16c714fc2f698b921ee2c3c53b5c88799e)

I am currently waiting on Coinswitch support is currently processing.

Links to a person who encountered the same problem ( I WISHED I STUMBLED ACROSS THIS EARLIER!)  https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ei0h8m/coinswitch\_exodus\_scammed\_6500\_euro\_coinswitch/

Background:   I'm a retail worker who saved up for years in hopes to purchase a home   for me and my mum. I was a reddit lurker compelled to get out of my   comfort zone to create a new account and engage with other crypto   enthusiast to  spread awareness and seek advice for a solution to my   problem. English is my second language and apologize for the errors. I   also made a number of similar posts but was much  less informative in   different sub reddits when I was not in the best state of mind so I do   apologize for that.

I know this   post maybe a bit premature due to the pending Coinswitch support but I   do not want anyone to feel the way I felt when I lost 14+ Eth. I Thought   I was up to date with crypto security, not your key not your coins,   don't share your  mnemonic phrase. or store it digitally, avoid cameras   over those words etc etc. Always reading scam topics to learn from   other's mistakes. But for some reason I missed the similar posts linked   above.

Just some questions: Do   these integrated exchange withhold your funds often from users? and are   they selectively scamming at a small scale to the point where they hope   this will never be overblown or forgotten?

Thanks in advance.

I will update this in the near future.",1603951354,8,1

Well, the answer is simple: I buy bitcoin then immediately withdraw it from exchanges, without giving it much thought, to my cold wallet. I'm sure tons of other people do the same as well.                  

One thing I have noticed, however, is that exchange wallets typically have a different length to them and when purchasing from them, they charge an additional 5 USD or so, fee.                 

So questions:               
1. Let's say I make a purchase from kucoin of 100 USD with a bank wire. They charge their fee. Was there ever an actual transaction on the blockchain when this took place?

I didn‚Äôt have the time back them to really get behind the technology (I can thankfully) so I decided to leave the coins there and not move any in/out from the HW until I figure it out.

Another users noted that even $1.11 is quite large for a dusting attack but maybe the amounts are increasing, etc. I stopped moving any coins in or out since that date just as a precaution and I started checking every transaction since I bought my HW and started noticing several larger deposits, some very recent, some older, small and not-so-small amounts. Is there a way to know if my HW has some sort of public address published somewhere I could look up and find out about some of those transactions?  To try to figure out why im getting the deposits (not complaining at all but still)? What another type of information I can find out?

I know for a fact I haven‚Äôt make any of the deposits below into my HW since July 28th, 2020 when I made the above post thinking one of the deposits was a dusting attack

I also noticed smaller ones, along with some deposits I do recognize as mine, could the transfer be getting distributed and showing as 2 separate deposits? Would it take several days? I wouldn‚Äôt think so.

I do recognize this one:

1. How about the Ledger hack, are HW no longer safe? 

2. Which brand of HW do you recommend to store long-term? 

3. Which hot wallets do you recommend and why? 

4. What would an ideal setup look like, both hardware and software in order to safely be part of this community as well as contribute to the network.

5. Any links on how to run a secure node?

6. How to make money staking or forwarding transactions to nodes? 

7. Any experience investing in companies like blockfi (not advertising)or similar to earn interests, which one is better?",1603936701,2,1

jk0mfc,Raptorel,Technical question on BTC mining mechanism,"Hello, I have a question on the Bitcoin mining mechanism. Suppose I have a bunch of mining equipment that is an important percentage of the overall mining hash rate in Bitcoin: say, 30%. The Bitcoin mining difficulty is 1 (to keep things simple). 

I come in with my super duper mining equipment and start mining. The Bitcoin difficulty adjusts in a max of 2016 blocks (depending on when in the cycle I started mining) to also include my added hash rate. 

But now, once the difficulty increases, suppose I turn off my mining rig and let the other people mine on this higher difficulty. I have my equipment turned off, not consuming any power, waiting for the difficulty to drop as the network adjusts after another 2016 blocks. Then, once that happens, I start mining again. That way I only mine, having to pay for the power that my mining equipment consumes, on lower mining difficulty. Sure, I have that 2 week period when I don't mine but I'm not consuming power during that time, either. 

Is there anything that I'm missing in this strategy to cheat the network?",1603933690,8,1

While I understand the ‚Äònot your keys, not your crypto‚Äô rallying cry, it seems like the threat models for exchange vs hardware wallet are different. 

At an exchange there is a team of security experts who are looking to safeguard your crypto. While you are exposed to risk of fraud, or bad actors at the exchange (mitigated by multi-person authorization), you also get the benefits of their security focus and insurance policies. The other risk to an exchange is that they are typically more attractive targets than an individual for hackers. 

Storing in a hardware wallet means you need to trust the hardware manufacturer (and that it hasn‚Äôt been tampered on the way to you), you computer (and that it hasn‚Äôt been tampered), OS and all applications, as well as your own security awareness and practices. Not to mention the risk of losing the keys or getting wallet stolen. Your own the keys, and you‚Äôre less of an attractive target for hackers or nation states.

jg257f,LJizzle,Cold Storage - New Wallet,"Hey BTC. I started stacking sats a wee while ago, read up a bit and got myself a cold storage wallet on bitaddress, so I could start calling myself a real HODLer.

Not entirely sure why but it has taken until now for me to realise, I don't know the best way to transfer funds out of my cold storage to another wallet, e.g to transfer to a friend's wallet. 

I looked on the FAQs here to find out, and saw a few things I'd like clarification on:

- Under ""why does my bitcoin address keep changing"", it mentions it may be bad practice to use the same wallet for more than one transaction and that a wallet's address may change after each transaction. Why?

- What's the best way for me to transfer money from my cold storage?

jg0an1,W944,PayPal Bitcoin - Mass Adoption or Illision,"This is yet one more opinion on the news.

I'll start by prefacing that when I first heard of bitcoin many years ago, my first thought was ""I already have a PayPal account to buy stuff online, why do I need that Bitcoin account""

I failed to understand then that Bitcoin was a currency, not just a transfer protocol. I failed to understand you can store bitcoin long-term.

And this lack of knowledge will now be repeated by all new Bitcoin users that PayPal onboards. By keeping users locked down to their platform and not allowing them to withdraw the coins, PayPal will give the illusion that this is how it works. That this is normal, and the correct way. Whereas it's the opposite.

Some users will research more and hopefully realize on their own that there are alternatives, that you need to have the ability to take possession of your bitcoin, as opposed to a gold ETF or an oil ETF. Bitcoin is fully digital; taking possession of your coins and ensuring that the big players are not running a fractional reserve bitcoin game is of the utmost importance - and magnitudes easier then storing a barrel of oil.

The majority will however remain content with the way PayPal operates due to their inherent trust in the platform and that PayPal must know what's best for them.

Overall this news should help shake off those nocoiner claims that Bitcoin is just Beanie Babies. So the perception in the general population will gain some legitimacy, but we must remain vigilant and we must explain to the newcomers that there's ""real"" Bitcoin (that you can take possession) and ""paper"" Bitcoin (that's just some number in a centralized database)

PayPal needs to add btc withdrawals in order to be a legitimate player. This should be a fundamental requirement for any platform claiming to be a cryptocurrency hub.",1603375703,5,1

jfw4rt,OkCheerio,CAUTION: Canadians be careful buying QBTC.U as a Bitcoin alternative!,"TL;DR QBTC.U does not move in 1:1 correlation with Bitcoin; volume of QBTC.U is terribly low, and its price has actually moved counter to Bitcoin; you are charged using QBTC.U through ""decay""; it's worth being suspicious enough of QBTC.U to just buy real Bitcoin.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have held QBTC.U for nearly 2 months, at my own mistake of failing to do my due diligence, and have learned a few things I'd like to share:

1) Do not expect price action to move in exact correlation to real Bitcoin. For example, if Bitcoin goes up 5% in a day, do not expect QBTC.U to go up 5%, as well. More often than not, it will usually go up a fraction of what Bitcoin goes up.

2) Volume on QBTC.U is terribly low. Many a time, when Bitcoin has gone up, QBTC.U has actually gone down, or remained the same.

3) Most importantly, you should know there is a significant cost associated with buying QBTC.U which is charged to you through ""decay"". This is not disclosed by them. So, the longer you hold QBTC.U, the longer you are paying their fund through decay.

To illustrate an example of how ""decay"" affects you, it would be as follows; let us say that on a day where Bitcoin costs $10,000 CAD, you purchase QBTC.U at a share price of $10 CAD/share. Then, say that the price of Bitcoin falls to $5,000 CAD, which should \*loosely\* mean QBTC.U falls to a share price of $5 CAD/share. So, you end up deciding to hold QBTC.U until Bitcoin goes back up to $10,000 CAD, to break even. Well, when Bitcoin goes back up to $10,000 CAD, QBTC.U should go back up to $10 CAD/share, too, right? Wrong. Your QBTC.U shares will only go up to $8 or $9 CAD/share, which means you now have to wait until Bitcoin goes to $11,000 or $12,000 CAD, just so that you can break even at $10 CAD/share.

4) Lastly, it's worth being skeptical of QBTC.U, as I'm personally not inspired with any confidence in its integrity. As far as I'm concerned, they can just disappear from the market any day and all your money would be gone.

Long story short, if you're interested in investing/trading Bitcoin, then just buy real Bitcoin. I hope this helps some people. Cheers!",1603357207,1,1

jiup39,brianddk,PSA: Reminder that Github is not the only Bitcoin Source Repo,"Github (@Microsoft) is a great site, and they have, for the most part, been pretty lassie fair about repos that the ""powers that be"" might object to.  But any skeptical mind should always ""what if"" anything as important as the Bitcoin-Core codebase.  Assuming you've done all the basic stuff like build-from-source and run your own node, now might be a good time to add some mirrors to your list of git remotes.

The best mirror I can think of is probably the [onion mirror](https://laanwj.github.io/2018/06/08/tor-repository.html) maintained by `@laanwj` (github).  If there are some others that are replicated regularly, please help me collect the list.

If we ""start from scratch"" I'll add the github-git as the default remote named ""origin"" and add the onion-git as the remote named ""onion"".  Of course you can change the names if they are too close for your liking.

#### Initially clone the repo from github (github-git -&gt; ""origin"")

```
# This will create ""origin"" and checkout ""master""
git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git
cd bitcoin
```

#### Add the Onion-Git as one of our remotes

```
o_host=nxshomzlgqmwfwhcnyvbznyrybh3gotlfgis7wkv7iur2yj2rarlhiad.onion
git remote add onion http://$o_host/git/bitcoin.git
git config --local --add remote.onion.proxy ""socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050""
```

#### Create a branch ""onion-master"" that tracks our new remote

```
git fetch onion
git checkout -b onion-master onion/master
```

#### Go back to ""origin/master"" and compare

```
git checkout master
git branch -vv
# Should see origin/master and onion/master at the same commit
```

Now if Github does any shenanigans with the Github repo, you can pull from the onion repo.  It should be noted that the onion repo is read-only, but I'm sure if anything goes wierd there will be about a half dozen new repos pop up.  But at least this one is an authoritative source.",1603773227,9,1

I'm buying a significant amount on behalf of myself and my children, due to considerable tax implications. What platform do you recommend that allows managing multiple Bitcoin accounts with ease? What is the best way of buying Bitcoin, given my scenario?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey everyone! I hope all you guys are doing well.

I'm relatively newer to Bitcoin, so please forgive the ignorance of my question, if it is silly. I believe I have done enough research and due diligence on Bitcoin, that I am very compelled in buying Bitcoin, and I am now at the stage of researching what platform to use and how to use it.

I'm retiring soon and I'm investing a significant portion of my fund into Bitcoin (approx. $500,000 USD).

While I'm in the unfavourable position of being in the highest tax bracket (where I am, I pay more than 50% tax), I was advised that I minimize taxes on my Bitcoin profits by investing on behalf of my four college children. Because they have no income, they are in a considerably lower tax bracket.

So, I would gift each of them $125,000 USD, and they would each buy Bitcoin with it. Needless to say, I would be the ""account manager"" of each of my childrens' accounts. With that said, I would like to know how this would work, and what platform would be best for ease-of-use and ease-of-management of multiple (i.e., 4 or 5) Bitcoin accounts.

My questions are:

(1) Is there a recommended platform that allows managing multiple Bitcoin accounts with ease? Or is this even a necessary criteria?

(2) What is the best way of buying Bitcoin, given my scenario?

Thank you for your help everyone! Cheers!",1603741024,8,1

It was pretty obvious that the pandemic was the main culprit behind Bitcoin price drop, as well as stock market plunge.  
But going forward, there was a turbulent summer, which increased the number of infected and did not show signs of stopping.  
Bitcoin was unaffected by it.  


Now we have the newest pandemic wave and yet again, Bitcoin is not only holding its ground, but it is slowly pumping.  


 If Bitcoin can pull through this wave unaffected, we are in for a pretty sweet 2021.

What is a better, more trusted custodial option?

And it can‚Äôt be something like Keys.Casa that‚Äôs multi-sig and still makes him keep track of private keys.

jkgxol,samdane7777,Maxis Are To Blame For Agressive US Regulations &amp; OverSeas Extrajudicial Enforcement,"When it really gets down to it this is class warfare. Transnational international non custodial cross border freemarket non protectionist pro-poor pro southern hemisphere DEX oriented ideas that are open to all crypto in a very anti institutional sense: -&gt; this stance is the opposite of a maxi stance.

&amp;#x200B;

The Maxi stance benefit whales, institutions, first comers, founders, us regulators, banks, custodians, in a high fee hyper exclusionary hyper doxxed hyper regulatory regime. Bitcoin's transaction fees make it suited to a treasury asset and corporate settlement tool. IT is consistently American whales in the bitcoin space pushing for these maxi stances and deep invovlement with hyper protectionist regulators. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of opening up approval and licensing for start ups and nuevo riches, the repeated ulterior motive of american whales is to hand over exclusive rights to existing legacy institutions as was the case with derivative approval for the CME and Bakkt with ICE. They made the contracts require a 32 thousand dollar collateral to ensure it would be a huge fuck you to anyone on mainstreet or any medium sized enterprise. They gave a non leveraged license to LedgerX and have treated the company like dirt since its inception. It has no liquidity to speak of and no one uses it, the founders were ousted. The leader of Bakkt is just a adbominable human, who was already caught doing insider trading on the Covid crisis prior to the public knowing about it.

&amp;#x200B;

American Maxis are bad for the emancipatory potential of crypto. You're not the good guy in this. Your ideas are bad and you should feel bad. The What Bitcoin Did Podcast Host literally verbally admitted that when he was in Venuzeuala none of the people there could or did transact in bitcoin on a daily basis or even commonly due to the expenses
