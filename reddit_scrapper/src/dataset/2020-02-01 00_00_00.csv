Big problem, even by bypassin the 2fa and get the code to access your kraken account, they will not sent it to you by email or they will, but 1-2 weeks later. Wtf.

Then you talk with customer services and they could not give a sh\*t about it.

Please do yourself a favor and to avoid at all cost this sh\*tty exchange. Also since they don't care about their clients login, I honestly think in the near future they will do an exit scam and suddenly close the exchange, just like so many have already done and steal all of our coins/money.

The Super Bowl is here!


Super Bowl 2020, or Super Bowl LIV, pits two upstart teams with dynamic offenses in the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers against each other. The 49ers are a well-rounded team, with a dominant defense, while the Chiefs are explosive on offense and have come around on defense toward the end of the season. They're riding an eight-game win streak coming into this game.

Vegas doesn't seem to have much of a clue as to who might win this game. At the time of this writing, the Chiefs are just 1.5-point favorites.

The Sports Insider team is here to give your picks on who we think wins the game and takes home MVP in what could be a thriller.

Cork Gaines


If these two teams faced each other ten times on a neutral field, the Chiefs would win seven times. The 49ers do have the speed on defense to keep up with the Chiefs' offense. However, that's not going to be enough with Patrick Mahomes healthy and peaking, and Andy Reid having two weeks to prepare. On the other side of the ball, the 49ers are not going to be able to keep pace. This game could get ugly early.

Chiefs 34, 49ers 18

MVP: Patrick Mahomes

Scott Davis


The 49ers are more well-rounded and better at molding their team week to week, New England Patriots-style. I think that could have a huge impact on this game. The Chiefs' weak run defense could be a problem against a Niners team that just shredded the Packers for 285 yards on the ground. If the Chiefs' run defense does hold up, I believe in Kyle Shanahan's ability to poke holes elsewhere in Kansas City's defense. The Chiefs will still score, but I worry that they are too reliant on Patrick Mahomes to make magic happen, especially when the 49ers' pass rush inevitably breaks through.  The 49ers will ultimately be able to get a timely stop on Mahomes and the Chiefs.

49ers 34, Chiefs 31

MVP: Nick Bosa

Whichever way this game goes, we're all in for a treat. The league's top defense is set to square off against one of the most prolific offenses the game has ever seen. I'm reluctant to bet against Nick Bosa, Richard Sherman, and the rest of the San Francisco 49ers' stacked defense, but I don't think anyone is capable of stopping Patrick Mahomes once he gets hot. With weapons like Tyreek Hill, Travis Kelce, and Sammy Watkins at his disposal, Mahomes is primed to have a field day on the sport's biggest stage, so I'll take Mahomes magic to outmaneuver the tried-and-true 49ers' defense in this one. Don't let me down, Andy Reid.

Chiefs 31, 49ers 24

MVP: Patrick Mahomes

Tyler Lauletta


After last year's dud of a Super Bowl, it feels like we're in for a shootout this Sunday, and no team in the NFL is better suited for a shootout than the Kansas City Chiefs. Patrick Mahomes and company have staved off early deficits in two straight contests, and have the means to do it again should the 49ers jump out to a lead. San Francisco's rushing attack will be a problem for the Chiefs defense, but if they can get one or two timely stops, Mahomes can handle the rest.

These volumes are only measured using Localbitcoin (LBTC) using their API (Coindance). Big part of that exchange come from Venezuelans that live abroad and send money to their families, miners, people that get paid in cryptos (freelancing) and even the own government. It is around 2000 BTC per month.+

Other exchanges and other trades were done, but no way of measure them.

Today exchange rate is around 1 USD = 75,000 Bs. (Official rate is almost the same)

Minimum wage (which is earned by a big chuck of the population, not like other countries) is 250,000 Bs. wage (less than 3 USD) + 200,000 Bs. food bonus (less than 3 USD) PER MONTH. 

Biggest bank note is 50,000 Bs. which is around 0.75 USD. You need to use debit and credit, bank transfer, cryptos and USD to pay anything.

Here in Venezuela situation is really hard, some people dont believe that amount is the minimum MONTHLY wage. I work and earn more than that (anyway, the amount is really low, I'm sure with that amount I would be living homeless in Colombia, Peru or Panama for example), usually get some donations from redditors and do some freelancing work (translating mostly) and it is really hard to keep up daily.

exz1md,bearCatBird,My DFI (Dumbass Friends Indicator) is starting to pick up.,"All my cautious, skeptical friends who were open to Bitcoin as a technology - they invested years ago. They are now hodlers, in for the long haul, and buy every week.

But my other friends...the ones that wouldn't buy no matter what, who think Bitcoin is a scam, who think the technology will get replaced by something better so it's smarter to wait, who &lt;insert whatever excuse, refusing to listen to reason&gt;...now they are investing. And they aren't investing because they had a change of heart. They don't buy into bitcoin's philosophy or care about the unbanked or think it's the future of money. 

No, they are buying ONLY because they think other idiots will buy and the price will go up. They are purely speculating and want to sell it as soon as they make a profit.

Whether they actually sell or not, who knows. Or they sell, the price climbs higher, they buy back in. Regardless, it's an interesting indicator I've been watching for a while and seems to be starting to tick upwards.",1580693304,35,1

Are there any projects allowing the merchant to receive bitcoin when customers checkout using a regular fiat credit/debit card in a checkout? My understanding is that KYC/AML and Payment Gateway regulation would limit such a system. 

Alternatively we could simply keep the same checkout process and buy bitcoin through existing channels.",1580692219,7,1

Is it worth the effort to move bitcoin to multisig 2/2 addresses to further secure the cold-storage funds? I understand the chances of someone randomly guessing a private key that would unlock my hypothetical funds are next to zero, but it's hard to wrap my mind around that fact. However, it is easier to wrap my mind around the idea that it is essentially impossible for someone to randomly find the 2 private keys necessary to unlock my hypothetical funds.

I have not seen the bitcoin transferred to my Monero wallet not has it bounced and been returned back to my FOG account. All my bitcoin is simply missing.

ezjqs5,MuscleNMind,A genuine question about the long term viability of Bitcoin.,"I am a Bitcoin bull who wants to fully understand the economics and technology and I have been stumped by a question regarding the protocols long term viability.

Is a deflationary currency sustainable long term? Once inflation reaches zero and the loss rate of Bitcoin through user error makes the currency deflationary, isn't it then destined to eventually all become lost?  

In this scenario one of two things would need to happen to sustain the currency.
1) add an inflationary quality to Bitcoin to match the loss rate
2) find a way to reduce the loss rate to zero as well 

Deflation is fine for a store of value, but Bitcoin as a currency is so hard that it will never be the choice for spending in its current state.

Any feedback or answers to this question are appreciated.  Maybe Andreas has a talk on the subject somewhere?  

Thanks in advance",1580949545,25,1

Bitcoin reaches $122,889.90 USD on March 21, 2022.

On March 22, 2022, the US government passes a ban on cryptocurrencies because of increasing ""nefarious"" activity by suspicious parties on on US soil (at least that's what Pres Biden's administration said). 

A grace period of five years is given to commercial and private investors before they are required to declare themselves as ""unaffiliated with crypto."" Otherwise they face federal fines/prison depending on level of involvement.

Despite the grace period, it only takes three days for Bitcoin to hit $1,559. 

Online community outraged that the government does not acknowledge over 2000 suicid3s in April linked to the Bitcoin crash.

Protests happen, but then the protestors get board.

US introduces a centralized digital currency. Central bank monitors every transaction. Value of the dollar plummets. 

China's digital currencies destroy US.

At 9pm I tried to log in into my Coinbase to look my balance and my password was not right, I went to my trash emails and looked for password changes on Coinbase, there was a purchase of $22k on BTC from my bank account.

f13e2y,katierose0324,A fun story about losing $5.00 worth of 2008/2009 bitcoin 🤦🏻‍♀️,"In 2008/2009 I was flat. broke. Riding home from my shitty $27,000 per year job and listening to an NPR report about a new form of currency called bitcoin I decided to spare five precious dollars to try it out one night. I didn’t tell my then-fiancé because he’d have been mad I was wasting $5 when we couldn’t afford to eat. I didn’t tell my dad because he would have thought it was too bizarre to take a chance on. I remember it being complicated to buy and relatively over my head. It was only worth $5 and I couldn’t understand how to utilize it so I forgot about it. Sold the computer a year later and wiped the hard drive before I sold it. 

Sometimes my dad, who eventually came around to the idea of cryptocurrency, harasses me about how I have $200,000 or whatever just floating somewhere in the ether with my name on it. “Maybe you emailed it to yourself?” “Would you have emailed it to yourself back then? Remember dad, it was a relatively obscure form of digital currency worth FIVE DOLLARS.” “Maybe you printed it out and saved it?” “Yeah, and maybe I also saved all my $5 McDonald’s receipts from 2008 too” 

I try to remain philosophical. I might as well get mad that I can’t travel to Jupiter, or get mad that unicorns aren’t real, or that I can’t travel back in time and buy apple stock. Still, sometimes it stings thinking of my 24 year old self innocently buying enough bitcoin to pay off my mortgage and then casually tossing it in a folder on my iMac probably named something cute like “random desktop shit.” 

What can you do? Life’s definitely not fair. 🤷🏻‍♀️",1581221444,16,1

For the last week or two I found myself spending a decent amount of time on websites such as keys.lol and privatekeys.pw

The concept of being just a combination of keystrokes away from millions it’s just fascinating to me. 

I’m also no stranger to beating the odds. My luck is absolutely crazy. It tends to go in hot streak some cold spells, and the last three years specifically have really been proof of that.

(I have literally hit four jackpot on the slot machines in the past 3 years $1500 - $1600 - $800 &amp; $750 (kinda jackpots I guess lol) 

But recently my luck has been absolutely horrible basically in the last six months I’ve lost absolutely everything. My wife for five years left with the kids, my mom went into a coma, a number of things happened and I now have to change professions, amongst several other things. Where I sit right now is my phone is about to be shut off, I’m late on my rent and I’m sure soon to be Evicted. My Electric is way past due, as is my gas. I know that all sounds horrible, (wow, I literally just walked out my door and there was a notice to quit on my door.) 

But you really can’t judge without knowing several aspects of this story. I have busted my ass my entire life, my wife didn’t have to work from the day that she met me, and I supported two children as well as her for the last five years. I’ve given us a really good lifestyle. Everything became super stressed this last year.... never mind. That’s not why am here.

So, if you’re not familiar with those websites I mentioned earlier, you can basically open random wallets and hope that you find some bitcoin. I was actually interested in the puzzles they have going on in which somebody had previously deposited bitcoin in quite a few wallets to show just how fast the potential is.

Well, I found puzzle 111, which is worth 1.1 bitcoin, amongst other things. In the terms and conditions of the website it does say that they’ve the host of the website, would take a 30% finders fee. Well it just so happened that I found that combination today, however something happened.

I’m not quite sure what it is, but when I’m looking at the source code it shows where it’s discovered and it goes to take a commission out and send it when something happens and it gives me a message to contact the admin‘s.

So unfortunately, I have no bitcoin, and I Have tried to contact the admin’s on both discord and email. 


Well I know I’m really not entitled to a free sum of money this large, God would help out right now. I’m also a little bit worried that I won’t get it. Just to start with, I was paranoid as is that if I hit that one and however many million chance that it wouldn’t get taken from me without even knowing. I was actually suspicious that these websites let you do all the work and then rip the reward out from underneath you and you not even know it. So I was actually really surprised when I hit this.

However, I’ve got a couple things working against me kind of. I was in the Java developer Consol the whole time just getting an understanding of how everything works. Are used to be a computer technician back in the day, but I know no programming
 
Basically I was just looking for major red flags if I were to see something. I don’t know why that would affect it, but I have noticed that a lot of people don’t like it when you pick around in their software.

The next Dane, is that I did have an extension installed to my chrome browser as well. It basically turns a multiple page forum into one long scrolling page. I don’t know if that’s considered cheating, but I did have that and was using it at that moment. However they do have their own search function as well which performs tens of thousands of these calculations her minute whereas I might have done 50 or 60 or something like that. 


So what do you do? I would genuinely like to understand what happened, and I also feel that with just a small bit of manipulation I would probably have that secret key. I mostly say that because I did notice a character that was not supposed to be in the string if I’m not mistaken.

Last time I looked I the BTC is still in the wallet. I have no idea if the people to host the website are trustworthy or if I’ll ever see anything from this, but boy would sure help and like I said it’s almost something that could probably be solved I think.

Obviously Grayscale is a trust and passes its expenses through to shareholders.  Their website has a \[Tax Information 2018\]([https://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GBTC-Tax-Info-Letter-2018.pdf](https://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GBTC-Tax-Info-Letter-2018.pdf)) PDF that reports daily expenses (in bitcoin) for each day of 2018 and gives an example showing how to adjust your cost basis.  Presumably they will post a PDF for 2019 sometime soon.

That's a pain in the ass to do by hand/Excel if you've traded even a few times.  On the other hand, GBTC annual expenses are around 2% so we're not talking about peanuts.  Typically if expenses are passed to shareholders, you get a K-1 form.  I can't find anything online indicating Grayscale sends a K-1 or doesn't .  People repeatedly ask.

&amp;#x200B;

1.)  Does Grayscale send a K-1 for GBTC?  If so, problem solved.

2.) If not, do you calculate the adjustment to the cost basis by hand as shown in their pdf, and make this adjustment on Form 8949 (supplement to Schedule D on Federal taxes), just like if you had a wash sale?  If so, what code do you mark in column (f) of that form?

3.)  If you're holding and/or trading GBTC in a tax-deferred retirement account, how do you adjust the cost basis?  Hold onto the tax information sheet (or calculate the adjustment now) and then deal with it a few decades down the road?  That seems messed up.",1581193662,2,1

f2eqjj,lifeaser,Anti-money laundry or black money tools and practices as a way to promote Bitcoin?,"^(To moderators: if you remove this, please, just let me know why, so that I can learn.) 

One of the constant criticism from regulators / agencies towards Bitcoin is the difficulties to prevent money laundry or black money to be within the bitcoin network.

It's easy to understand that this is one of the fallacies against the adoption of a new standard that has potential to rival with the current financial system. It's equally easy to understand that people from the network want to have privacy on financials, nevertheless, privacy must not be confused with secrecy.

As such, instead of just positioning ourselves against the system, why don't we start breaking these arguments by promoting/developing/launching tools that help preventing black money &amp; laundry?

Big investors always think to put money into something and then, eventually, taking it out. And by increasing cleanliness of the network it could unblock a considerable flow of money into Bitcoin, as real people and big investors would find it safer that the regulators would not forbid it.",1581454090,11,1

During the course of this suspension customers will be unable to transfer, deal, withdraw or deposit funds and will be unable to use their ePayments cards.

Following a review by the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') of ePayments Systems Limited's ('ePayments') anti-money laundering systems and controls, a number of weaknesses have been identified which require urgent remediation to ensure that our customers can enjoy a safe and secure platform.

Following discussions with the FCA, ePayments has agreed to suspend activity on customer accounts until remedial action has been undertaken to the satisfaction of the FCA.

We know this will be a very frustrating time for our customers. We apologise for any inconvenience caused and are working tirelessly with the FCA to ensure improvements are made and accounts can be reactivated as soon as possible.

During this improvement process, we want to assure customers that their funds are being safeguarded as normal.

**This survey will take \~3 mins of your time.**

*Why do we publish this survey?*

Lending services on Ethereum have become more and more popular. It shows that rather being a hodler, people want to lend out their crypto to earn extra interest. Meanwhile, BTC remains its dominance in the crypto market over 60%. We believe in Bitcoin’s potential and HODL it tight. What if there is a way to lend out the BTC while HODLing it? We would like to know how likely you will use this kind of service. We highly appreciate it if you can help us out!

I'm an average tech-savy 20 something.  I know a little about a lot, but not a lot about a little when it comes to technology.  I'm, also, someone who's been trying to understand Bitcoin for the past couple months.  I have a decent grasp on the major points, but it's still hard to wrap my head around everything.  That being said, I feel like if I tried to explain Bitcoin to my parents or even some of my friends, their heads would explode.     

My point being, with the halving upcoming and people thinking a strong bull-market is on the horizon, if a lot of people come on board, the average person may struggle to understand all the intricacies of Bitcoin, which will lead people to being taken advantage or frustrated with the process.  Bitcoin (it's community and accompanying platforms) needs to do a better job explaining and simplifying the process to make everything more user-friendly.  I understand that this is/has been happening gradually overtime.  I guess my fear is, if too many people jump on-board tomorrow, it won't end well for a lot of people, leaving people bitter about Bitcoin.  And that will make it harder for a real broad adoption once everything is more streamlined for average users.",1581705772,49,1

f3vlkp,CBJ_TechGov,"Bitcoin, Deflation and Paychecks","For those of us who know that the days of fiat currencies are numbered and that some blockchain-based crypto(s) will be the dominant store of value, we must begin recalibrating our minds to a deflationary economy.  This is no easy task.

Assume for a moment that Bitcoin has been adopted as the primary, worldwide store of value.  Given that the number of Bitcoins is finite, elasticity for an expanding economy is achieved not through adding more and more Bitcoins (as mentioned, the number of Bitcoin is finite), but rather through fractional expansion, which is infinite.

The rub becomes conducting financial transactions where a given Bitcoin increases in value whenever someone transfers their value from some other store of value to Bitcoin.  So if you are an employee with a salary designated in Bitcoin, say 20 Bitcoins a year, as Bitcoin reaches maturity the amount of value that your 20 Bitcoins salary represents goes up, up, up.  As does the expense your employer incurs, as they they are now required to hand over more value to obtain Bitcoins.

The oblivious solution to this problem is to base the payment of salaries (and other things) on the transfer of value instead of the transfer of Bitcoins (but still using Bitcoin as the medium).  But this creates a new problem... how to effectively measure value.   This is no easy task.

The concept of reducing the quantity of a store of value (e.g., Bitcoin) transferred in exchange for the exact same product or service is called deflation.  And this will be the biggest obstacle to the general adoption of Bitcoin.

Imagine your an employee doing a spectacular job.  But instead of getting regular raises you get regular decreases in your salary.  Conceptually, you may still be receiving an increase in value transferred from your employer, but most people do not think in conceptual terms and would struggle to understand if they are really getting a fair deal.

This problem is solvable, but it will have to be effectively addressed.

Note:  the severity of this particular issue dissipates as Bitcoin reaches maturity.",1581701735,6,1

This is not the case. I will make that clear to him, but regardless he has tasked me with finding a way to profitably mine Monero. I thought this was odd as I figured that mining using an algorithm to switch us between blocks would be more profitable. Not just mining monero over and over.

So anyways, my boss hires a professional to setup mining and discuss with him and they decided that it would be best if we mined monero. (Yes I know hiring a professional is stupid as we probably lost more money hiring this guy then we will make mining). I downloaded and tested the hash rate on our work super computers and found that we would probably be receiving a rate of about 3000 H/s on 4 computers. Then we would have about 10 more computers with a rate of 1400 H/s. This ""expert"" recommended that we mine in a private pool and put all of our PC's towards mining the same block. Is this profitable for us? We have 0 electricity costs so yes we would make some money, but what do you guys think, is it worth it to mine only monero? Even if we join a public mining pool? 

Last thought: Would it be better to mine on our GPU's? Our 4 super computers have 4 RTX 2080 ti's in them (so 16 GPUS) and then the other 10 computers have anywhere from 1060's to to 1080 ti's in them.

Looking to get a hold of my keys.  

I understand I may have to take a hit on some commissions but hoping to minimize whatever that may be.

So, I am looking for advice on which exchange to use, and advice on which wallet is best.  I’ve heard good things about the Ledger and Trezor.  

Also, one address or multiple?  I have more than 1 dollar and less than 20k in bitcoin derivatives, all of which I could stand to lose (but I’d rather buy a Lamborghini in 2030)",1582220344,25,2

f6qtgf,fittes7,“Bitcoin is backed by nothing”,"In a democratic world with a free market, “money” is whatever the public decides it to be.

Money was adopted for the simple reason, back in the days when people were producing and trading each other’s goods, trading was way more difficult as Person B might not want Person A potatoes, while Person A wanted Person B milk, so a trade couldn’t be established. To solve this problem people started using rare precious metals and other things that considered rare and later failed, to have a medium of exchange so people would be able to trade which are not direct trades.

Later on they understood that gold wasn’t easy to move, and banks came into place with an offer to centralize the gold and give receipts in return that confirms that you own X gold in their reserves, so you can use those receipts to trade without having to carry kilograms of gold for big trades.

Later on bankers made their way to politics, and instead of being in the role of “money keeper”, they now became the money keeper and the money lender. But how can you lend of you have to hold gold reserves for each receipt you print? Good question. Let’s just low the reserve rate for banks, so we can inflate the currency on the back of others, no one really cares about it nor knows / interested in how economic rules work, so people wouldn’t notice.

Later one in 1971 they completely untie this paper bill that supposed to be receipt for gold reserves to ease peoples trade, they untie the asset that was used for 5000 between people, and impose their paper bills that can be inflated without us even knowing, for us to use.

It’s 1 week prior to elections in my country, I hear people arguing regarding the elections 4-5 times a day at least for the past 2 weeks, and no one seemed to be happy with what’s going on in our country.

So people are seeking for change and being unhappy with the current systems, but from the other side neglecting and trying to demolish the thing that gives them their power and rights back?

I am middle aged and happily married with 4 wonderful children, a good job and relatively good health.  This should be enough to feel happy and content, but for the last few years, my thoughts have been consumed with the fact that I threw away bitcoin.  I am not overly technical but read an article about bitcoin in my morning paper back in 2011.  It seemed interesting and I had a good year at work, so I decided to splurge and buy 30 coins, I think it cost me under $400 at the time.  I followed the price for a while but life got busy and I forgot all about it.  

As my family grew, I moved houses in 2012 and had many of my old hard drives and a laptop disposed of as we tried to de-clutter.   Life was good and I was optimistic about the future.  My attention was always on my children and making life better for them.  My career was stable and while we didn't have much savings, I  still provided all the essentials and even went on a family trip every other year.  It wasn't until I saw Bitcoin's price skyrocketing in 2017 that I realized what a tremendous mistake it was to throw away my old laptop. The option of getting back into bitcoin does not exist for me because what little extra money I earn goes towards everyday things like braces, saving for college, etc..

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since 2017 I became a different person, anxious, short with my children, uninterested in anything but internally consumed by my financial mistake.  I constantly think about what that money could do for me and my family, but worse, I think about how I am not even ""present"" in the most important and wonderful time of my life and the lives of my loved ones.  I am just going through the motions everyday.   

&amp;#x200B;

Hi reddit im sorry if this is somewhere else or posted already. I’ve been a hodler since 2016. I still have so many questions though. What’s a good resource to learn more about BTC that someone who isn’t very technically inclined can learn about fundamentals? 
I’d love to know:
-How btc derives it’s value? Is it speculation or a result of mining/transactions?
-Do halving events decrease your holdings? Like if I have 1 btc will I have .5btc after halving or does it just affect mining returns? 
-how are value projections considered so accurate? No other currency/investment has that level of accuracy. Is it something in the code or just speculation based on history?",1581955695,11,1

He explained to me that he has a limit on a bitcoin betting site and that he will send me BTC, that i should transfer to my wallet, and then send him 75% of the crypto.  
I thought that it is just another one of those ""GET YOUR FREE BITCOIN NOW, ONLY LASTS FOR 15 MINUTES"" scams, but it actually wasn't at all.  
I sent him a transfer request address and he **REALLY** sent me **2.722 BTC**! Although i am a cracker and i use cracked Spotify accounts, i am not a thief (by that, some of you are gonna call me stupid, but that is just who i am).  
Now, when i wanted to withdraw that bitcoin to my BTC wallet, i couldn't do that because the system detected that the limit has been reached and that i can't transfer that money until next month.  
So, that dude and i made a deal that i should just send him back the bitcoin to his wallet on that betting site (but i don't know if the address that he sent me is the same one that i received the BTC in the first place) and keep 0.3 BTC (little less than 15% that was promised to me at the beginning). I made the transaction and that was it.  
Now my concern is: Did this guy somehow launder BTC?   
And if he did, can it somehow affect me?  
I know that BTC is untraceable, but i am just asking, to be 100% sure.   
If there is nothing that i should worry about, well, in the next month i will be chilling with $3k worth of BTC",1581953659,41,1

Special shout-out to the beta testers, amazing developers and people in this space! I sent this message in the last beta build prior to release, but in case you didn't see it: Thank you for the amazing encouragement, support and critical feedback you have provided throughout the development of Moonshine. I'm constantly surprised how wonderfully supportive and helpful this community is. I have learned so much from everyones sheer willingness to share their knowledge and support. Thank you for helping me learn. Thank you for making Moonshine a joy to develop. Thank you for being awesome.

Now that Moonshine is released I'm looking forward to implementing new features, continue working on bug fixes and ramping up development of it's Bitcoin Lightning-enabled variant, Moonshine Lightning. There's no better way to learn than to build.

f594fx,nudecoloredmansion,Bitcoin and the law of attraction,"I’m not seeking conflict. Or implying a bearish case. But I believe the universe has a way of contradicting you. When there is a new easy way to make money, there will be an algorithm created from the process making it no longer easy. So what I’m getting at is, a lot of people became instant millionaires off bitcoin. We all know this. It happened unexpectedly. But now that we are all seeking to be next. Now that we ALL want a turn. And that it’s “gonna be easy.” Will our expectations be outweighed by reality? Or because we all hold hands and hope that we see such valuable coin, that it actually happens? There’s many variables. Such as all the people investing with the “get rich quick” mindset, getting completely removed from the equation due to their own impatience. Or the people who sold too soon and won’t be able to get back in if demand outweighs supply. Ultimately bitcoin relies on outside factors such as people and their money. And money has a way of controlling you and making you ask yourself why you didn’t stick to the plan. Will you be shaken by volatility? Are you trying to time the next market top? Will you fall victim to a new algorithm/obstacle? I personally don’t have an exit strategy or identify as a hodler. I have one bitcoin. May I chip away at it someday never to run out? Dunno! It’s not where my strategy lies. Please correct me or add your two cents ✌️",1581948051,10,1

To criminalize the use of bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies like it they would need to ban the use and development of open source blockchain technology and ban the use and development of digital scarcity as a technological concept. To accomplish that would require a tyrannical dictatorship with no way to contest its criminalization.

Any country with an ounce of justice and due process of law especially one with a constitutional right to freedom of speech (as code is speech) would find it impossible to criminalize the entire technological concept of digital scarcity and its use in trade and commerce. They would need to essentially criminalize open source code and any country that even contemplated that would see an immediate mass exodus of business, finance, technology companies and entrepreneurial talent from their shores.

The most bullish thing in the world for bitcoin would be for an attempt to be made at criminalizing it then that attempt being contested and overturned in the supreme court setting undeniable precedent for its legal use in commerce.

f57nko,Thanatos_1,"Ian Coleman's BIP39 tool, security of splits","I noticed, that the BIP39 tool available at https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ recently started showing a crude splitting option for a seed. For example the 24 word seed:

`comic giraffe honey midnight trim state`

`oppose glove lunch steel bright bless`

`soap garage mandate air lava board`

`voyage traffic feed stem mandate noble`

can be split into 3 ""cards"" that are:

**Card 1:**

`XXXX giraffe honey midnight trim XXXX oppose XXXX`

`lunch steel bright bless XXXX garage mandate XXXX`

`lava board XXXX traffic XXXX XXXX mandate noble`


**Card 2:**

`comic XXXX honey midnight trim state XXXX glove`

`XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX soap XXXX mandate air`

`XXXX board voyage traffic feed stem mandate noble`


**Card 3:**

`comic giraffe XXXX XXXX XXXX state oppose glove`

`lunch steel bright bless soap garage XXXX air`

`lava XXXX voyage XXXX feed stem XXXX XXXX`

The site then claims, that cracking the seed, if the attacker is in possession of only one of these cards is 3830854 years. Unfortunately there's no explanation on how Ian Coleman arrived at this conclusion. 

My understanding is, that such a 24 word seed represents 256 bits of entropy. Any 8 words wold thus be equivalent to *256/3 = 85* bits of entropy. Now 85 bits of entropy isn't particularly much. So how can the time to crack a seed with only one card, which is then missing only 8 words to be completed, take 3830854 years?

Notice: this is *not* the Shamirs Secret Sharing Scheme using BIP39 words, developed by the company that also develops the Trezor hardware wallet. This here is simply splitting the seed into 3 chunks.",1581940172,14,1

Say you had a larger amount of money you wanted to put into BTC, beyond the random $100 here or £250 there or whatever, how would you go about it?

From scouring the posts, I’ve seen a lot of people warning against having big single transactions - either way for that matter - due to risks of accounts getting frozen on exchanges, delays, etc.

So if you had a bonus or insurance or something that you wanted to lump into BTC, what’s the best method?

These  volumes are only measured using Localbitcoin (LBTC) using their API  (Coindance). Big part of that exchange come from Venezuelans that live  abroad and send money to their families, miners, people that get paid in  cryptos (freelancing) and even the own government. It is around 2000  BTC per month.

Other exchanges and other trades were done, but no way of measure them.

Today exchange rate is around 1 USD = 73,000 Bs. (Official rate is almost the same)

Minimum  wage (which is earned by a big chuck of the population, not like other  countries) is 250,000 Bs. wage (less than 3 USD) + 200,000 Bs. food  bonus (less than 3 USD) PER MONTH.

Biggest  bank note is 50,000 Bs. which is around 0.75 USD. You need to use debit  and credit, bank transfer, cryptos and USD to pay anything.

Here  in Venezuela situation is really hard, some people dont believe that  amount is the minimum MONTHLY wage. I work and earn more than that  (anyway, the amount is really low, I'm sure with that amount I would be  living homeless in Colombia, Peru or Panama for example), usually get  some donations from redditors and do some freelancing work (translating  mostly) and it is really hard to keep up daily.

f881qy,Rattlesnake_Mullet,Dude describes how bitcoin helped him to financial independence and retiring early,"Found on /r/financialindependence:

&gt;""I was an automotive engineer working for OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers in the Metro Detroit area. In the 2008 downturn I lost my job and was unemployed for 2 years and ended up getting my house foreclosed in 2010. By the time i got a job in March of 2010 I was basically at $0. I had a tiny amount in an 401k, had about $20,000 in credit card debt from being unemployed.

&gt;But then I got a very well paying engineering job ($108k annual and eligible for time-and-half overtime). I kept living like I was unemployed, spent as little as possible and saved as much as possible. Through my parents I secured a mortgage on a nice 1 Bed / 1 Bath 900 sq ft condo. I paid off my CC debt in less than a year and kept banking cash and maxing my 401k every year.

&gt;I heard about bitcoin in early 2013 (from a guildmate in World of Warcraft, believe it or not) and jumped on board. All time bitcoin price chart (log scale) for those unfamiliar with the history. I got in before the first spike to $1000 in December of 2013, and kept buying throughout the downswing in 2014 / 2015. In 2017 I sold 5.6 BTC for a total of $6000 and paid off the last of my student loans and my car, then a few months later I sold 4.25 BTC for $6700 and paid off the last of my condo mortgage. So in May of 2017 I was officially debt free and had a net worth of about $200,000.

&gt;Then in the fall of 2017 was when bitcoin exploded. I knew I had to take profits here. Every time the price went up 10% I sold another bitcoin. $7500, $9000, $10700, $13000, $15500, $18600. I sold all the way up. I ended up selling about $100,000 in bitcoin that year and I pushed most of it into my Roth IRA and Brokerage accounts.

&gt;Then I really started thinking about FIRE in early 2018. Started doing the math, tried to see what my expenses would be, and thought I'd give it ago. I've told myself from day 1 that I'd give this trial a solid 2 years. If I don't feel good about it, or the money doesn't seem right, then I'll still only be 40 years old and could (IMO) easily jump right back into an engineering gig. So I targeted early 2019 so I could frontload my 401k for two months, grab the annual bonus, then peace out.

&gt;TL:DR: 38, FIREd, Money's looking right, Life is feeling right, everything is fine.""

As you know, an escrow dealer on localbitcoin need to submit the email, phone number, ID, everything related to personal information, right? So, first step, my personal information is known by the owners of the site.   

Second step, I actually don't have many Bitcoin addresses, because to be honest, it is super inconvenient to remember all the private keys. So, when I do a lot of buyings and sellings on localbitcoin, all the guys who do the buyings and sellings have my BTC address and they can mark it as bookmark. So, it seems like all my personal information and my financial information are known by the public, right? It is actually a problem that I've been thinking about but have not found a proper answer yet.

Or does it vary from shop to shop? I don't mind paying for a t-shirt upfront, but if I am going to buy something more expensive, I feel like I give away my bitcoin without any chance to claim them back, should my purchase, for whatever reason, not arrive.

2022 new bitcoin industry and company will start emerging rapidly.
Libra coin as u all know will officially start being used in the year 2023 in our timeline.
2027 70% of the world economy will be integrated with blockchain
2030 privacy coin will be high in demand. privacy will also be granted to everyone.
2053 is the year where privacy will be no longer be an option, at this time drones will be everywhere and every technology will be linked to company's. all our information will be used to track our daily life.

the wolrd be goven by company not government.
government will still be involved.

Ripple and Electroneum will be one of the world leading crypto currency that will be used globally.
whereas it is centralize. alot of ngo will soon be funded by Electroneum, this makes the ngo to become a stable company that control certain organisation in my timeline. this will also makes Electroneum at the top of the foodchain.

to be honest in my timeline 80% of the world leaders are women. especially President.

an advise for the readers, yes you can bitcoin because we know that the future cannot be changed as the power is not in our hand. but please diverse you investment into gold, these gold we be valuable once the time of the technology and internet will be shut down. protect your grandchild and please have a longterm investment.",1582977162,8,1

I was using the android wallet ""Bitcoin Wallet"" by ""Bitcoin Wallet developers"" which was not listed, so I just selected bitcoin core. The payment processor then showed a guide on how to pay, which included disabling ""replace by fee"". I couldn't find the option in my wallet so I just made the payment, and the processor instantly accepted my payment.

I was somewhat confused by this experience. In the past, payment processors would wait for at least 1 confirmation before accepting payments. I also hadn't realized rbf was a transaction option, I thought it was a node option.

I've been accepting 0-conf transactions (mainly because I don't want to wait and I don't want to make my customer wait, and the transactions are only $10-50 anyway), assuming the likelihood of double spends is really low. That being said I haven't actually had any double spends so far, but is there anything actually stopping them from double spending? If rbf is indeed a transaction option, is there any way to check if a transaction has it enabled?

I've wasted countless hours waiting for exchanges to put a transaction on the blockchain, and I've wasted as least as much time waiting for a certain number of confirmations, so I can trade on another exchange where I sent the crypto.

This app simply sends a push notification when the transaction receives one confirmation and then another push notification after a certain number of confirmations that the user specifies. I have lots of ideas for additional types of notifications, but I'd like to hear thoughts from the community on this first version.

I talked to my brother about his friend David and my brother told me he invested a lot of his savings in gold. So he has just enough money for this holiday. I asked:"" why not Bitcoin"".  David thinks it is to risky. 
Now during this 2 week holiday the coronavirus is spreading really fast. David is scared to go home because they will check you and if you just have a little bit of high temperature or cough you will be forced in quarantaine which is logical. But you can not acces the internet and they take your smartphone.
My brother and dave are being advised by the school where they teach not to go home. The school is closed anyway because of the virus. The school want them to teach online now. So David now can not acces his own gold. And probably have to borrow money from my brother. Hey wouldn't have to do that if he bought bitcoin.

ewxi16,MakeTotalDestr0i,"I replaced the word ""crime"" and ""criminal"" with ""Freedom"" and ""Freedom lovers"" in this hit piece against privacy by Chainanalysis. it is now a guide to reclaiming some privacy","#What comes next for crypto Freedom?

Crypto Freedom will likely continue to evolve in both scope and technological sophistication,
just like cryptocurrency itself. As law enforcement, regulators, and cryptocurrency
professionals improve their ability to prevent and respond to various forms of crypto Freedom,
the Freedom lovers themselves will also grow more sophisticated — that’s the one constant we’ve
seen as blockchain investigators.

Here are some thoughts on for how crypto Freedom might evolve in the near term.

1. More non-custodial mixers.
Following the closure of Bestmixer, we believe users — Freedom lovers and not — will search
for alternatives to third party custodial mixers such as wallets that offer native mixing
functionality similar to CoinJoin wallets like Wasabi. It’s likely that more currencies
besides Bitcoin will get analogs to CoinJoin, as we’ve seen with CoinShuffle for Bitcoin
Cash and mixing via smart contracts for Ethereum.

2. Chain hopping as another alternative to custodial mixing services.
In addition to native in-wallet mixing, we also think some Freedom lovers may begin to favor
chain-hopping as an alternative to third-party mixing. Chain hopping is the process of
swapping one type of cryptocurrency for another, often several times in quick succession,
typically at low-KYC exchanges so as to further obfuscate the path of funds.

3. Privacy coins.
As we mentioned in the darknet markets section, privacy coins like **Monero** are gaining
popularity and could become the cryptocurrency of choice for more Freedom lovers in 2020.
Privacy coins increase user anonymity by using an obfuscated public ledger rather than
a fully public one like Bitcoin’s. As more exchanges begin accepting privacy coins, they
should also collaborate with regulators, law enforcement, and one another to establish
frameworks for investigations of Freedom lovers who use privacy coins.

4. More anonymous P2P exchange options.
We believe that non-custodial, decentralized exchanges like Bisq network will continue
to gain popularity with Freedom lovers in 2020. Decentralized exchanges allow peer-to-peer
transactions without the exchange acting as a mediating third-party. We may also see
Freedom lovers using P2P exchanges benefit from upcoming Bitcoin protocol changes like
Taproot and Schnorr Signatures, which make the complicated smart contract-based
transactions carried out on P2P exchanges look identical to standard transactions on
the blockchain.

Many charge customers more for Taker trades than Maker trades. Others, like LVL (which is recommended by guys like Willie Woo and Jimmy Song) charge a flat monthly rate (currently $9, paid in BTC) which is deducted from your account each month -- but they also assess a 20BPS (0.0020) fee on withdrawals exceeding $1K ($2.00 under $1K).  eToro appears to charge a premium on the price you pay for bitcoin.

I'm a hodler, and only plan to move funds  onto and off of an exchange when it's time to purchase more Bitcoin or (and I haven't done this yet) ... sell Bitcoin for fiat. So for me, the best exchange is one that's liquid, secure, legal in U.S. and low(est) cost.

Do people even realize that it would take an enormous amount of capital for Bitcoin to reach these highs? 

I like Bitcoin because of its technology and ideological message but people who still think that they can still get rich because of it are so delusional. 

At $100,000, it would more than double the market cap of Alphabet and Amazon. Do you think that it could be the case for the cryptocurrency that no one uses just because it was a new (and worthless) asset class that broke into the mainstream a decade ago? Satoshi, whoever that person is, would be the richest person on the planet? Do you even understand how UTOPIAN this actually is?   

You would have a hard time persuading governments to hoard BTC instead of gold. BTC is not going to replace credit cards anytime soon (if ever).  You can't even pay for practically anything with BTC in the real world without using third-party apps that convert it into cash.     

Sure, the network is growing (along with BTC's intrinsic value) but it's only because mining farms buy more expensive hardware. Mining is actually getting more decentralized. 

Personally, I don't think that BTC is going to die but even reaching $20,000 would be something insane. I feel like it will mirror Nikkei by failing to reach its peak for a lot of years to come. There will not be another 2017 when Bitcoin surpassed Trump on Google Trends. This type of crypto-mania will not happen again.

After the Lightning Network launched the Bitmain network, it has indeed achieved very low-cost instant payment, which is being adopted by more and more merchants.

This article is divided into four parts to introduce the past, present, future and detailed principles of Lightning Network in detail.

First, the lightning torch movement; Second, the current status of the lightning network; Third, the development history of the lightning network; Fourth, the detailed explanation of the lightning network principle.

**I. Lightning Torch Movement**

A lightning network reward relay is in full swing among Twitter users. This viral campaign is now known as the Lightning Torch Campaign. Just like the Ice Bucket Challenge campaign on social media in 2016, this caused a lot of spread and attention on the Lightning Network.

On January 20, 2019, twitter user  u/hodlnaut tweeted that he sent 100,000 Satoshi (100k satoshis, 1 BTC equals 100 million Satoshi) to the first selected user through the lightning network rewards application tippin.me, An additional 10,000 users will be issued to the next user. And so on, until the last user is unwilling to add another 10,000 Satoshi and take the bitcoin accumulated by the previous owner as his own, the game is over.

Hodlnaut wanted to see how many Satoshi the reward relay game would end.

Enthusiastic netizens have specially created a website to track in real time which Twitter user the lightning torch has reached. According to the website information, as of press time, there have been 215 users participating in the delivery, and recently one person needs to send 3.15 million Satoshi Bitcoins. The cumulative total of Bitcoin sent has reached 4.56 BTC.

If no one actively terminates the game, the torch transfer will automatically end when more than 0.168 bitcoins are passed. Because the current maximum capacity of the Lightning Network payment channel is set at about 0.168 Bitcoin. Developers are currently developing to increase the capacity of payment channels.

Many celebrities in the digital currency industry have participated in the delivery of the lightning torch, including Andreas Antonopoulos, author of Mastering Bitcoin, Anthony Pompliano, founder of Morgan Creek, Roger Ver, Bitcoin Jesus, Joost Jager, Lightning Lab engineer, and Zhao Changpeng, founder of Binance , Tron founder Sun Yuchen, Twitter founder and square CEO Jack, BitMEX Research.

Hodlnaut, the initiator of the Lightning Torch, has ordered a Tesla to promote Musk's participation in this event.

Tippin.me developer Sergio Abril said that the Google Chrome extension for Tippin.me has been released on February 17. After installing the extension, a Lightning Network reward button will be displayed under each tweet, which can directly reward twitter users. But you need to open Tippin.me first, otherwise it will show that this user does not exist.

At present, the lightning torch is only available among twitter users, and you can log in to tippin.me with a twitter account and create lightning network invoice information (invoice). Twitter and tippin.me are closely related because Twitter CEO is one of Tippin's investors.

**Status of Lightning Network**

Lightning Network has grown rapidly since October 2018.

According to the 1ml data of Lightning Web Browser, as of press time, Lightning Network has 6,473 nodes, a total of 28,783 payment channels, and a total network channel capacity of 708.34 Bitcoins. Both the payment channel and the total network capacity have increased by nearly 30% within 30 days. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is worth noting that another layer of the 1ml name means that the goal of Lightning Network is to reach 1 million Lightning Network nodes, which currently only achieves 0.6% of the goal.

According to p2sh.info statistics, the capacity of Lightning Network Channel is more than 8 times of half a year ago, and 157 times of a year ago. Golden Finance estimates that at the current growth rate of 30% per month, the lightning network capacity can reach 10,000 BTC in 10 months, and the lightning network capacity can reach 100,000 BTC in 19 months.

On February 11, Twitter, Square CEO Jack Dorsey, and Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark participated in the Stephan Livera podcast. Jack announced that the Lightning Network was not a question of integration into the Square Cash App, but a question of when to integrate.

Because of the low-cost (or even no-service) small-amount instant payment feature, Lightning Network Payment has been integrated into various applications such as sports event prediction, betting, knowledge payment, rewards, and payment on behalf of others. These integrated apps are called Lapps.

&amp;#x200B;

Y'alls is a paid reading website that uses the Lightning Network to pay, and paying a small amount of bitcoin can read the articles inside the website's pay wall.

Zigzag is an exchange that can exchange other cryptocurrencies to Lightning Network Bitcoins at a low cost and high speed, or exchange Lightning Network Bitcoins to other cryptocurrencies.

Australian cryptocurrency payment gateway livingroomofsatoshi provides various services such as payment of credit cards, bank bills, and rent with the Lightning Network.

Satoshi's place, similar to EOS Pixel Master, people can spend a bit of smart Bitcoin to occupy pixels in the picture. The gold financial reporter spent 1890 Satoshi writing the word ""golden"" in the lower right corner of the canvas (red circled in the figure below).

Competition is fierce, as of press time, pixels have been covered by other users

Event prediction and sports betting website microbet.fun currently provides event prediction and betting functions for four sports: football, rugby, basketball and ice hockey. NBA, Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A and other famous sports leagues are predicting the bet list. 

Golden Financial reporters tried several Lapps and found that Lightning Network truly achieved at least two of its stated goals: extremely low fees and instant payment. In terms of fees, several payments initiated by Golden Financial reporters have no fees, and the amount can be as low as 1 Satoshi. In terms of payment speed, it is indeed within seconds. The payment experience is not lost to Visa.

 There are currently several Lightning Network clients, the three most popular of which are Lightning Labs' Ind (Lightning Network Daemon, Go implementation), ACINQ's eclair (Scala implementation), and Blockstream's c-lightning (C implementation).  


Lightning Network gives users / merchants a great deal of freedom. Any user / merchant can set up their own Lightning Network node by themselves, and can directly use third-party node services such as lightninginabox and Casa Node to own the node out of the box, as well as open source third-party payment services, such as the open source project lndhub, BTCPayServer sets up nodes and develops wallets for users to use your nodes, and everyone can open a bank freely. In terms of wallets, similar to Ethereum's Metamask wallet, Lightning Network also has Google's extended wallet Lightning Joule, as well as light wallets provided by third parties and ToB payment service providers such as OpenNode and Lightning Network POS system NanoPos.

How does Lightning Network achieve the fast payment experience? Bitcoin analyst JP Thor research pointed out that because the layer-2 lightning network payment does not need to go through a third-party intermediary, the payment between two points can be as fast as the TCP / IP connection, so the lightning network payment speed will exceed Visa. At present, the processing speed of a channel of Lightning Network can exceed 250TPS, and there is no upper limit for network expansion. Visa's current payment peak is 50,000 tps, with an average value of about 24,000 tps. Bitcoin's processing speed is only 7 tps.

In this way, real-time payment is truly realized, and the vision of the Bitcoin white paper cash payment function becomes a reality.

**Third, the development of Lightning Network**

The prototype of the Lightning Network can be traced back to the first version of Bitcoin software Bitcoin 0.1 released by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Bitcoin 0.1 includes a draft of the original code, allowing users to update transactions before they are broadcast on the blockchain to confirm transactions. This may be the prototype of the payment channel concept. Satoshi Nakamoto explained in detail to how the payment channel will work in a personal communication with the then Bitcoinj developer Mike Hearn.

In 2014, Alex Akselrod proposed a two-way payment channel, and he is now an engineer at Lightning Labs.

Prior to the publication of the 2015 Lightning Network White Paper, in order to address the Bitcoin scalability vulnerability, PeterTodd designed and implemented a new type of time lock timelock, CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV) in the Bitcoin protocol.

In February 2015, Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon published a Lightning Network white paper-Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable off-chain instant payment. That same month, they elaborated on their ideas in public for the first time at a Bitcoin developer seminar in San Francisco.

For almost a whole year in 2015, the Bitcoin community focused on issues such as Bitcoin expansion and block size issues. Two expansion conferences: Scaling Bitcoin Montreal in September, and Scaling Bitcoin Hongkong in December.

Soon after the Hong Kong Expansion Conference, Bitcoin core developer Gregory Maxwell proposed a Bitcoin expansion roadmap in the Bitcoin-development mailing list. This roadmap includes the Lightning Network. This roadmap has the support of most Bitcoin technology communities and became the Bitcoin Core roadmap.

In May 2015, the blockchain development company Blockstream hired Russell, the core Linux developer, and hoped that he would implement the Lightning Network in C: C-Lightning.

In January 2016, two authors of Lightning Network, Poon and Dryja, and Elizabeth Stark and Olaoluwa “Laolu” Osuntokun co-founded a new company LightningLabs to develop the Lightning Network. LightningLabs will develop lnd in Go language.

In October 2016, the third Bitcoin expansion conference was held in Milan. A few days after the meeting, the main developers of Lightning Networks such as ACINQ, Amiko Pay, BitFury, Blockstream, Lightning Labs and Purse held their first LightningSummit. This conference discussed how to make all different Lightning Networks compatible and interoperable with each other, and form the Lightning Network Protocol Specification BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology). BOLT became the basic specification of Lightning Network.

The idea of ​​the Lightning Network white paper is incompatible with the Bitcoin protocol and requires some protocol upgrades to Bitcoin. CLTV time lock requires that the payment channel be closed regularly, and the use of relative time lock Lightning Network will perform better. In the summer of 2016, the Bitcoin network implemented a soft fork upgrade called CheckSequenceVerify (CSV).

Before Segregated Witness is activated, Lightning Network based on Segregated Witness is continuously tested. In May 2016, the fourth version of Blockstream segregated witnessed the ""SegNet 4"" Lightning Network c-lightning test online. In October of that year, Christian Decker of Blockstream purchased a photo of a cat from his colleague Rusty Russell on the testnet, which is considered to be the first breakthrough of the Lightning Network.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cvhqqaaoche41.png?width=884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dca1a97d94ce82dd8735b927c2190745fd734c5

 

In January 2017, lnd released an alpha version. More and more developers are starting to develop various applications based on Lightning Network, including desktop, mobile wallets, small knowledge payment platforms, gaming, browsers, and other Lapp applications.

In August 2017, Segregated Witness was activated, and obstacles to the deployment of Lightning Network on the Bitcoin mainnet were cleared.

In November 2017, Blockstream first announced that the beta version of the c-lightning Lightning Network was launched on the Bitcoin mainnet and completed the first transaction. Then, Lightning Labs announced that Lightning Network completed the first cross-chain transaction between Bitcoin and Litecoin.

In December 2017, Blockstream, Lightning Labs, and ACINQ announced that the three implementations of Lightning Network are compatible with interoperability.

Although the Lightning Network on the Bitcoin mainnet is still in beta, users can't wait to trade with real Bitcoin.

In December 2017, Lightning Network ushered in its first transaction. Lightning network developer Alex Bosworth and payer Bitrefill established a payment channel and paid their phone bills with Bitcoin.

In January 2018, Lazlo Hanyecz, a legend in Bitcoin history, announced that he had successfully purchased pizza again through the Lightning Network. Lazlo Hanyecz was famous for buying pizza with 10,000 Bitcoins.

In March 2018, Lightning Lab released the ind beta version and received a $ 2.5 million seed round investment including the twitter CEO.

Since then, nodes, wallets, payments, and applications have been continuously developed, and merchants and services connected to the Lightning Network have continued to increase, and the Lightning Network has begun to explode.

**Interpretation of the working principle of Lightning Network**

This part is a hard core understanding of Lightning Network, mainly from the Lightning Network White Paper by Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon.

To understand the Lightning Network, you need to understand several concepts: 1. Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO); 2. Multi-signature; 3. Two-way payment channels; 4. RSMC — Revocable sequential expiry contracts Revocable Sequence Maturity Contract, 5) HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract.

**1.Unspent transaction output UTXO**

The Bitcoin model is not a common account model, but uses unspent transaction output UTXO. Except for mining rewards, there are no inputs and only outputs, and all other Bitcoin transactions have corresponding inputs and outputs.

UTXO specifies the number of Bitcoins that can be spent and the owner. You can only spend Bitcoins at this address if you prove that you are the owner. Prove that you are the owner by unlocking a ""ScriptPubKey"" which is stored in a field in ""Output"". When UTXO is spent and used as the ""input"" of a transaction, a ""ScriptSig"" needs to be provided, and the ""Unlock Script"" and ""Lock Script"" are combined to run. The verification is successful. Allowed and generate new ""output"".

We use the famous digital currency Alice, Bob, Carol transfer to illustrate.

Assuming Alice transfers 0.5 BTC to Bob, the ""output"" of this transfer transaction will be set as the following ""lock script"":

&gt;OP\_DUP OP\_HASH160 &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG

The effect of this lock script is that if you can't prove that you are Bob, you can't spend 0.5 BTC.

When Bob wants to transfer the money from Alice to Carol, Bitcoin will first find the UTXO from Alice, then create a new transaction and generate the ""output"" of this new transaction. This output also contains ""Lockdown Script"" for Carol. At the same time, an ""unlock script"" is generated in the input of this transaction, and it is arranged by &lt;Bob digital signature&gt; &lt;Bob public key&gt;. Then broadcast the transaction into the memory pool and wait for the miner to verify that Bob's transaction is legal and not spent.

The specific method for the miner to verify is to take out the ""unlock script"" in the ""input"" of this transaction and run it together with the ""lock script"" in UTXO that Alice transferred to Bob. The specific form is as follows:

&gt;&lt;Bob signature&gt; &lt;Bob public key&gt; OP\_DUP OP\_HASH160 &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG

The verification steps are as follows: 1. Take out the &lt;Bob signature&gt; and push it onto the stack; 2. Take out the &lt;Bob public key&gt; and push it onto the stack, and now the &lt;Bob public key&gt; is on the top of the stack; 3. OP\_DUP copies the &lt; Bob public key&gt;; 4, HASH160 instruction to hash the &lt;Bob public key&gt; and push it into the stack, and now at the top of the stack is the hash value of Bob public key; 4. Take out the &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; And push it into the stack, where the &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; comes from the output of the previous transaction; 5. EQUALVERIFY instruction: take out the two public key hashes at the top of the stack and continue if they are equal, otherwise the verification fails 6. CHECKSIG instruction: Take out &lt;Bob public key&gt; and &lt;Bob signature&gt; for signature verification. If it is true, the transaction is legal.

In the above example, a private key unlocks the corresponding UTXO, also called a pay-to-pubkey hash (P2PKH, Pay To PubKey Hash). For asset security and transaction expansion, Bitcoin also has multi-signature technology. Multi-signature requires multiple private keys to unlock the corresponding UTXO.

**2.Multi-signature technology**

The technology that uses multiple private keys to unlock the corresponding UTXO is called multi-signature technology. The general form of multi-signature is M-of-N multi-signature. There are N public keys (2 &lt;N≤15) in the ""lock script"". A digital signature generated by at least M private keys is required to unlock UTXO.

Multi-signature technology only relies on the OP\_CHECKMULTISIG instruction to verify the legitimacy of the transaction. This instruction reads the M signatures and N public keys and the M and N values, and then uses the public keys to verify the signatures in sequence, and the successful matching counter is incremented by one. Finally, the counter is equal to M and the operation is successful.

The following uses 2-of-3 multi-signature as an example.

Lock script in the 2-of-3 case:

&gt;2 &lt;Public Key 1&gt; &lt;Public Key 2&gt; &lt;Public Key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG  


Assuming that only private key 1 and private key 3 are used, the unlock script is:

&gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 3&gt;  


The composite instruction is:

&gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 3&gt; 2 &lt;public key 1&gt; &lt;public key 2&gt; &lt;public key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG

Run successfully.

However, the multi-signature lock script uses all public keys, and the amount of data is too large, which will increase transaction costs. So now multi-signature uses a payment to Script Hash P2SH (Pay to Script Hash) transaction, introduces a Redeem Script concept, and moves N public key information from the lock script to the unlock script.

The locking script in the new scheme has become concise:

&gt;OP\_HASH160 &lt;hash of redemption script&gt; OP\_EQUAL

The hash of the redemption script here is only 160 bits, or 20 bytes, which is much shorter than the previous N public keys.

Original text of ""Redemption Script"":

&gt;2 &lt;Public Key 1&gt; &lt;Public Key 2&gt; &lt;Public Key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG

The unlock script is:

&gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 2&gt; &lt;redemption script&gt;  


Synthetic instructions:

&gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 2&gt; &lt;redemption script&gt; OP\_HASH160 &lt;hash of redemption script&gt; OP\_EQUAL

Based on the characteristics of the stack, this instruction first performs a hash operation on &lt;Redemption Script&gt;, and then compares with &lt;Hash of Redemption Script&gt;. If the original script is run like this:

&gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 3&gt; 2 &lt;public key 1&gt; &lt;public key 2&gt; &lt;public key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG

**3.Two-way payment channel**

With the understanding of multi-signature technology, the first step of Lightning Network is easy to understand. The Lightning Network interacts with the Bitcoin network through a payment channel. Users first establish a two-way payment channel, and the core transfers the user's Bitcoin to a multi-signature address. This is called Funding Tx in the Lightning Network white paper.

We also take Alice and Bob as examples. If Alice buys breakfast or coffee from Bob every day, they only need to pre-store a part of their money in a third-party common account. After each transaction, the two parties agree to update their account allocation. The transactions between them are paid on Lightning Network. The peer-to-peer expansion in the channel (also known as the Commitment Transaction Commitment Tx), the whole network broadcast is not on the chain, and the peer-to-peer instant payment is truly achieved. Only after one party decides to stop using the other party's service and close the payment channel, the final channel status is broadcast on the Bitcoin network, and Alice and Bob unanimously sign the agreement and settle the chain. In theory, as long as the number of Bitcoins recharged when the payment channel is opened is sufficient, the number of transactions in the channel can be unlimited.

**The essence of the payment channel is that Alice and Bob transfer their bitcoins into a 2-of-2 multi-signature address.**

But how to prevent Alice or Bob from cheating when closing the payment channel and not broadcasting the final status on the Bitcoin network? Lightning Network uses RSMC to ensure that both parties are honest and not cheating. If the payment channel is closed, the latest channel status is broadcast to the Bitcoin network.

**4. RSMC-Revocable Sequence Maturity Contract**

The Lightning Network white paper page 19 describes how RSMC works:

If the user does not broadcast the latest channel status, it will be punished, and the other party will take all the funds in the channel. Because the funds of both parties are kept in RSMC, he has to wait for 1,000 blocks to confirm (Note: Timelock) before he can get the funds, while the other party has two signatures and he gets all the funds in the channel before him. If the user broadcasts the latest channel status, there will be no revocable transactions. After a period of time (1000 block confirmations), both parties to the transaction will get their own funds.

We also choose Alice and Bob to deposit 0.5 bitcoin each to a multi-signature address to open a payment channel as an example to illustrate how RSMC actually ensures that people pay honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/88b73zawche41.png?width=1065&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82f8c8396e6d84f61be2f2fc519081689b1eaec4

 

In the picture above, Alice and Bob are mirror-symmetric. It is enough to study one person clearly. Alice and Bob will create a Commitment Transaction (Commitment Tx) C1a and C1b, respectively.

Commitment transaction (Commitment Tx) C1a has two outputs, one is 0.5BTC in the RSMC address signed by Alice and Bob, and the other is 0.5BTC of Bob (output 1 in the figure).

Below C1a, there will be a Revocable Delivery Transaction (RD1a) and a Delivery Transcation (D1a). RD1a uses BTC in RSMC. Because RSMC is a multi-signature address, both Alice and Bob's signatures are required. The RD1a output is paid to Alice 0.5BTC, but only if the C1a transaction is broadcast and confirmed by 1000 blocks. D1a indicates that Bob can consume this 0.5BTC at will. As long as C1a is broadcast, Bob can immediately broadcast D1a to get 0.5BTC.

The essence of the final result of the whole mechanism is that if Alice wants to terminate the transaction with Bob, he can choose to broadcast C1a, Bob can get 0.5 BTC immediately, and Alice needs to confirm to get 0.5 BTC after 1000 blocks. The same is true for Bob.

Consider again the transaction between Alice and Bob. For example, Alice spends 0.1 BTC to buy a cup of coffee from Bob. Now the allocation of funds in the payment channel needs to be changed to Alice (0.4 BTC) and Bob (0.6 BTC). This requires two steps. One is to create a new committed transaction, and the other is to invalidate the previous transaction.

**Create new committed transaction**

Below is the left side of C1a and C1b (the RMC and subsequent transactions are omitted for the sake of illustration); the middle column is the new transaction created by Alice: C2a, RD2a, D2a; the rightmost column is the new transaction created by Bob: C2b, RD2b, D2b.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 57kmkconehe41...*

 

C2a and C1a have the same structure. From Alice's point of view, the number of BTC in the RSMC address that Alice and Bob sign together is 0.4 BTC, and Bob's is 0.6 BTC.

Bob will also create the corresponding C2b, RD2b and D2b, and then the two parties will exchange the promised transaction and the RSMC transaction to complete the signature, and the new transaction will take effect.

**Obsolete old commitment transactions**

At this time, the old and new transactions (C1a / C2a, C1b / C2b) exist simultaneously and are valid at the same time. How to abolish the old promise transaction?

Lightning Network abolishes the old committed transactions C1a and C1b through two methods: one is to exchange private keys between the two parties; the other is to create a ""Breach Remedy Transaction (BR1a / BR1b)"" instead of the RSMC revocable transaction (RD1a / RD1b).

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img nei5s55rehe41...*

 

As shown in the figure above, the input of the new Breach Remedy Transaction (BR1a) is 0.5BTC in the multi-signature RSMC, and the output is 0.5BTC paid to Bob.

Therefore, if Alice signs and broadcasts the old channel state C1a in violation, the funds in the Funding Tx multi-signature will be transferred to the multi-signature RSMC and Bob addresses, each 0.5 BTC. At the same time, in addition to owning the private key of 0.5BTC in RSMC, Bob also received Alice's private key, so Bob can broadcast BR1a to the entire network. The RD1a created by Alice needs to wait for another 1,000 block confirmations to take effect. In this way, Bob has all the funds in the payment channel.

The multi-signature RSMC firstly delays the acquisition of funds by the person who closed the payment channel, and secondly, it can provide economic incentives to invalidate the old transaction without cheating, because broadcasting the channel status of the old transaction will have penalties, and the Bitcoin in the payment channel will be fully Be owned by the other party.

Through this mechanism, it is ensured that Alice will not broadcast C1a, and C1a will naturally become invalid.

Subsequent new commitment transactions D, E, F in the payment channel are also processed according to the above process, ensuring that Alice and Bob always broadcast according to the latest channel status when they want to close the payment channel.

The above discussion is the payment process of Alice and Bob, which cannot be turned into a lightning **network** . If there is no direct payment channel between two nodes, they can be indirectly connected through other nodes to form a lightning network. The payment between them is called Multihop payments.

The Lightning Network can make multi-hop payment between nodes through HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract.

**5. HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract**

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img le30h85xehe41...*

 

What if Alice wants to pay Dave 0.1 BTC, but there is no direct payment channel between them? Dave will generate a random number R as a secret, and then send the hash value of R to Alice. Alice will tell Bob: If you tell me the preimage of H within three days, I will pay you 0.1 BTC. Bob tells Carol in the same way: If you tell me H's preimage within two days, I will pay you 0.1 BTC. Carol can tell Dave the same thing, but time is within a day. And Dave does know R.

Remember the case where someone gave a reward to a golden reporter via tippin.me? At the beginning of preparing this article, the golden financial reporter experienced Lightning Network Payment with Lightning Network Wallet, and transferred 1000 Satoshi to his tippin.me. In fact, there are multi-hop payments in this process. The golden financial reporter's wallet was jumped to tippin.me through Indhub.

The above is the overall picture of multi-hop payment. Let's take a look at the specific transaction between Alice and Bob. In multi-hop payment, although Alice and Bob use the established payment channel between them, the transaction between them is not the same as direct transaction, and HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract is introduced.

 

Through the detailed explanation of Lightning Network above, the essence of Lightning Network is to link the nodes into a network through a payment channel, and then use the mechanism design and technical methods of RSMC, HTLC and other methods to avoid the moral hazard of the counterparty in the payment channel, so as to avoid the need to trust the other party and For third-party point-to-point payment, because there is no need to go online, the bottleneck of payment speed lies in the speed limit of the network, so it can be paid instantly.

According to the characteristics of the Lightning Network, such as payment channels and multi-hop payments, although the Lightning Network now basically achieves the user experience of instant payment at very low fees, there are also some problems, such as the centralization of payment channels, liquidity, and payment collection. People online, routing, etc.

**Conclusion**

Looking back at the development of Bitcoin and Lightning Network, maybe Bitcoin as a value storage currency and payment currency do not conflict at the same time. Bitcoin acts as a clearing network and Lightning Network acts as a payment network.

The widespread use of payment functions will increase the transaction volume of the Bitcoin clearing network, increase the transaction fee of the Bitcoin network, and increase the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Positive feedback makes each other.

The only problem left is the problem of large price fluctuations. Lightning Network payment is based on Satoshi. If the price of Bitcoin is high enough, its volatility may be low enough to become a daily payment tool.

Bitcoin investor Tim Draper recently stated that the world will use Bitcoin to buy coffee in two years, and by 2023 baristas will laugh at those who are trying to buy coffee in fiat currencies.

Maybe one day this will come true.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently launched a new project called BitcoinRoot.

&amp;#x200B;

On the website, I slowly revealed the private keys to a topped up Bitcoin wallet. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I was presenting my new project to my own community and to other crypto communities I noticed that people were ready to deploy all sorts of scripts and apply all sorts of tools to get it cracked before anyone else to reap the prize, which was around $25. 

&amp;#x200B;

To check out the project I have published a very short video about it here - \][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEn5obPY5wU\[/url\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEn5obPY5wU[/url])

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this brings a question. If people have an incentive to crack a private key with only 14 unknowns and with such a small prize at stake. What incentive is there for supercomputers and quantum computers to crack a million dollar worth of BTC wallets!

When I first got in to crypto I bought lots of different cryptocurrencies, this is because when J first got in to crypto people was saying that ""all boats will rise"" and that basically you'll make money investing in any project as blockchain is the future. Obviously that turned out to be very wrong. My first purchase was some Ethereum, after though I bought some Bitcoin and then Litecoin. As time went on I ended up buying many currencies such as XRP (hated it even when I bought it), Cardano, Monero, TRON, Dash and ARK (awful investment). As time went on I found myself losing trust in many alts so I was swapping them for BTC until about a year later I held just BTC and ETH. In all honesty I love ETH and I'm not for one second saying it's going to fail because I don't think so, but right now I'm happy with the money I have and I don't see the risk worth it when it has so many competitors that are faster and more scalable etc. I'm confident ETH will do well in the future and if so it may have more upside than BTC in the short to mid-term but I'm certain BTC is here to stay, I'm happier with a safer investment.

I know some people may say after just one year maybe I didn't give some of these projects like Cardano enough time, and that may be true I admit. Also I want to clear the air on the whole profits bit at the end, not to sound cliche but I do care about the tech and the movement behind BTC, I've been in to crypto for almost two year now and I've never once sold and have no intentions in doing so for many years.

I feel like I'm in a weird situation right now as many people may call me a Bitcoin Maximalist but that's not true, other projects will succeed also but I've reached a point now where I'm not as greedy chasing alts for big gains, I like BTC for what it is and happy to stick with it.",1580611151,53,1

I recently sold my business and got a good payout and want to invest more into BTC but my wife is sceptical because unlike me she does not watch youtube all day educating herself on the topic.

Can someone please drop links to videos which would educate her on why we should invest this money into BTC.

Specifically, im trying to find the video of the guy who talks about BTC going up then down and then up then down over and over in his video to show her it volatility, and show her in the end its always going up.

I will be showing her the stock to flow video as well but I also cant find the video about BTC cycles so she can understand the 4 years cycles and accumulation phases etc.

Your help would be awesome.

The main objective is to secure the funds and never be able to spend them without a dedicated effort to do so. For example, if under physical duress, it is simply impossible to spend the funds right there and then. Spending the funds should require a considerable amount of time, possibly physical travel.  Another important requirement is redundancy! If I use a password manager (KeePassXC ?) to store all/some of my seeds and somehow lose access to my password database, the funds are gone.

Looking  for some advice on incorporating bitcoin into the business I work at.  Full disclosure, I’ve drunk the bitcoin cool aid and yes I own my keys,  and yes it’s where most of my minimal wealth is located.  Whilst I am  nowhere near smart enough to truly understand it, I'm in.

My  owners keep asking me about bitcoin/crypto/P2P transactions, mainly  because it seems that it could be a viable way to sidestep the 1.9-3%  transaction fee that is standard in our industry through traditional  methods.

SO in short I am asking, how do you start to accept this currency as a business and what do we need to be aware of?

My Dad is not very technical and also not familiar with Bitcoin so I thought it would be a fun present to perhaps pique his interest. In my efforts to make this as easy as possible for him I did not setup 2 factor authentication on his account. 

Fast forward to the end of last month and I get a message from him saying his wallet app is showing he has 0 BTC in his wallet. I logged into his account and see all the BTC was transferred from his wallet to another on Jan 21st. It was then immediately split and moved to other wallets the next day. Looks like it was definitely stolen to me and looks like my Dad's trust in Bitcoin is forever shook. 

It was definitely my fault but wanted to hear people's thoughts on what might have happened. I had the BTC in 2 paper wallets that I put in cards that I then transferred to the blockchain wallets I setup. Attached is an image of the transaction that emptied the 2 wallets. Between Xmas and Jan 21 somebody seems to have gotten the password I setup for the account.

A recent survey carried out by Eurekahedge found that dedicated crypto funds returned over 16% last year. Elsewhere, Hedge Fund Research (HFR) said that traditional hedge fund strategies returned 10.4% for the same period.

Galaxy Digital’s asset management boss Steve Kurz [**told**](https://www.ft.com/content/e4369c82-4369-11ea-abea-0c7a29cd66fe) the Financial Times (FT):

eye4u6,DistinctSkin,Vlogger Ivan On Tech gives his thoughts on the programming part of Bitcoin (C++) and compares it to Ethereum,"When he stumbled onto Bitcoin, Ivan liked that it was coded in C, because he was a bit familiar with that programming language. “I could easily start reading the code and understanding the code,” he said. 

He said if they had chosen another language, say, Erlang or Haskell, while it would take a bit more time to understand, he’d probably get the gist of it soon enough. But, for me, it was good that they chose something that I am comfortable with.”

Because it’s a protocol, C++ was a good choice for Bitcoin, says Ivan. “You don’t really want to use Python or other higher level programming languages. With C, you have access to hardware to the extent that is not possible with higher level programming languages. So it is a natural choice, when you’re writing something like Bitcoin.”

He never programmed on Bitcoin, but his developer experience helped him learn certain aspects of Bitcoin, like hashing, digital signatures, and how a system of digital cash without intermediaries, without a central bank or company to control everything, works. When he entered into the space there were many colored coins projects, too, which he looked into from a technical perspective. 

The main thing that really caught his attention, in terms of building applications on blockchain, was Ethereum and Solidity. “There you could truly program whatever you wanted and you had the fully fledged turing complete programming language, which is solidity,” said Ivan. “So it was a whole other level. And you could really express yourself as a developer in so many different ways that simply wasn’t possible on Bitcoin. “

ezd6u0,TingleWizard,PyCryptax - Open Source UK Income and Capital Gains Tax Calculator,"I've made a calculator for UK income and capital gains that can help with Bitcoin transactions. It is available on github and is completely free and open source: [https://github.com/MatthewLM/PyCryptax](https://github.com/MatthewLM/PyCryptax)

You have to provide prices and transactional data in CSV files. Prices can be downloaded from various sources such as [cryptodatadownload.com](https://cryptodatadownload.com). Details on how to use it are in the [README](https://github.com/MatthewLM/PyCryptax/blob/master/README.md).

PyCryptax uses same-day; 30-day bed and breakfasting; and section 104 holdings rules to calculate capital gains which is a massive headache to do manually for more than a few transactions.

I've tested it on Linux but I see no reason why it should not work on Mac or Windows. You will need to use [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install and run the software which must be done on the command line.

There is another project known as [BittyTax](https://github.com/BittyTax/BittyTax) which is worth checking out too. I've not used it myself but it appears to have some more advanced functions. PyCryptax uses a different input data format which is designed to be simple and separates out income, price and capital gain data. Hopefully both of the projects can be helpful in their own way. BittyTax uses the [AGPLv3](https://github.com/BittyTax/BittyTax/blob/master/LICENSE) licence, whereas PyCryptax uses the [MIT](https://github.com/MatthewLM/PyCryptax/blob/master/LICENSE) licence.

Please let me know if you come across any issues. You may post an issue on github [here](https://github.com/MatthewLM/PyCryptax/issues).

Be very careful; do not trust them with funds you care about without this transparency,"**TL;DR:** Bitcoin\.com used to publicly release and track changes of their wallet's source code. Currently it is NOT true anymore for the most recent versions (5.x/6.x). **Please be careful, trusting a closed-source/non-public source wallet is VERY risky for your funds.**

---

This wallet is mainly an altcoin focused wallet nowadays, it has [multiple other flaws](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/bts0z4/i_hear_bad_things_about_the_bitcoincom_wallet_can/ep1wprs/) and [serious unresolved security issues](https://www.coinbureau.com/news/jaxx-bitcoin-com-wallet-vulnerabilities-discovered-researchers/).

But since it is still possible to store actual Bitcoin funds on it and it appears in the first results of a search for Bitcoin wallets (due to its name) on various App stores I've figured this post could be useful to new/unaware users.

This wallet is supposedly (hard to tell without source code) still a fork of Bitpay's CoPay wallet which is under MIT License. If this is the case authors have no obligation to publicly release the source code, but up until the last couple versions it was public and tracked on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/Wallet).

Without any justification the new releases are now happening [on a new GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin-portal/bitcoin-wallet-releases/) belonging to apparently ""bitcoin\.jp"", without any tracked source code in the repository and with only binaries available for download.

There are compressed files named ""Source code"" along the releases, which are empty (only containing a meaningless README file in them). Those files could easily be there to deceive people into thinking everything is like before and that the source code is still available but it clearly is not the case.

You should never use a close source wallet as it generally implies that nobody was able to independently review and audit it. Without this ability, you have no guarantee that this application is not going to leak and/or purposefully steal your private keys/seed/funds. When a wallet goes from a public open-source model to a closed source/non-public source like this wallet it is even more suspicious.

I've seen Roger Ver being asked about it multiple times on r\/btc and he only directed users to the new GitHub, without further comments when people pointed out there was no source code there.

So please, be careful, and **do NOT blindly trust this company with your funds**. There are [plenty of wallets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aZ1zbaUEzCo9NCctN8-eL2VLIiSdY009tTJvRXDUWEw/edit#gid=0)

I was selling my online business and 2 people emailed me and claimed to purchase my business and they ask to pay by bitcoin, using so-called ""Secure deal"" on their ""Trade Platforms"".

Well.... Those 2 ""platforms"" are with exactly the same design and even same login system. lol

Here you are. I checked that they have Cloudflare ssl and browsed with incognito. Not sure if the websites are malicious or not.

Bitcoin should pause above the $ 10,000 barrier against the US dollar.

Many supports are forming near USD 9,700 and USD 9,500.

An important rising channel is forming on the hourly chart of the BTC / USD pair  with support near USD 9,710.

Successful completion above the $ 10,000 barrier may trigger a massive stop-run.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xn3x6y7bzgf41.png?width=1117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c4f1a25abd3ac13ed9c56d4b0d04c598121b37e

**Bitcoin is expected to exceed $ 10,000**

In recent sessions, there has been a steady surge in bitcoin above the USD 9,500 resistance against the US dollar. BTC even moved above the USD 9,700 level and convinced with a closing price above the simple moving average of 100 hours.

Eventually, the price climbed above $ 9,800 and reached a new high of 2020 at $ 9,850. Gains above the $ 9,700 support area are currently being consolidated. The last swing low was $ 9,656 and the high was $ 9,836. [Bitcoin halving 2020](http://thecryptobasic.com/) may be coming in to increase the price

Bitcoin corrected below the 23.6% fib retracement level of the upward move from the low of $ 9,656 to the high of $ 9,836. However, the bulls protect the $ 9,750 range. More importantly, the hourly chart of the BTC / USD pair forms an important ascending channel with support near USD 9,710.

On the upside, there are short-term hurdles near the $ 9,850 and $ 9,880 levels. The current structure suggests that the price of a major upward break is above the USD 10,000 resistance area.

If there is a successful breakthrough above $ 10,000, it could trigger a strong rally and a stop-loss hunt. In the case mentioned, the bulls should aim for a test of $ 10,400 or even $ 10,500 in the coming sessions.

**Dips remain supported**

Initial support is near the transmitter at $ 9,700. In addition, the 50% fib retracement level of the upward move from the low of $ 9,656 to the high of $ 9,836 is $ 9,746.

If channel support falls, the bitcoin price could correct towards the $ 9,600 support area. Main support is near the $ 9,520 and $ 9,500 levels below which there is a risk of a short-term turnaround that could lead to a bear market.

**Technical indicators:**

Hourly MACD - The MACD is moving back into the bullish zone.

Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) - The RSI for BTC / USD is now well above the 50 level with a positive angle.

Major support levels - $ 9,700, followed by $ 9,500.

Major resistance levels - $ 9,850, $ 10,000, and $ 10,400.",1581068262,5,1

My current setup is probably like the majority of people, my words written out on paper and stored in a couple safe locations. The issue with this of course is if someone finds the mnemonic phrase, or it otherwise gets compromised then someone can easily take my coins.

I have been looking for solutions to this problem. One solution I have found would be to use a split Mnemonic like on the ian coleman BIP39 tool. This would break the key up to 3 parts, each part exposing 16 words in a 2of3 configuration **The tool states that it would take ~3.8 Million Years** with only 1 part (16 words) can someone explain the math behind this?

Other solutions involve Shamir Secret Sharing and or the new SLIP39 Standard. Unfortunately the solutions here where either unstandardized (Shamir39 tool or Seed-Split) or incompatible/impractical to use with my existing 24-word seed.

If it truly would take 3.8M years to hack like the iancoleman site suggests I would feel pretty secure, but I would like to know the math behind how that number was reached.

Any other solutions out there? I want it too be pretty straight forward and secure.",1581056698,8,1

*Professional traders having to follow FOMC meetings and interpret fed bullshit instead of doing something useful

haven't posted here for a while. I was discussing lightning network with a friend and we couldn't find an answer to this:

&amp;#x200B;

It is very theoretical since of course it will be more than 100 years until it happens but, when the Bitcoin mining reward ends, how will miners collect fees if almost everyone exclusively transacts on second or third layers?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, from an economic perspective wouldn't we want to have miners be rewarded as much as possibe to keep our network safe? So why are we trying to minimize this effect by never allowing to expand the blocksize, indirectly harming the intended fee model?

And, if Bitcoin rises to very high prices, it will be ridiculously expansive to open lightning channels in the first place so.. there is that too

&amp;#x200B;

You kind of get what i'm thinking about here probably.

Am I missing something obvious about LocalBitcoins, or is it much harder to use it for that now?","Back when I first got involved in Bitcoin around 2011, I used LocalBitcoins quite a bit when it was new and traded a lot of my freshly-mined coins with it. 

I live just outside NYC and I can't possibly find a way to trade bitcoin for USD cash in person on LocalBitcoins anymore, in either NYC or NJ. 

What I used to do with folks was simple. They came to me with a phone with a bitcoin wallet and a pocket full of money. I'd bring my phone with a bitcoin wallet full of bitcoins (this was back when they weren't worth much, so I brought quite a few BTC). I'd scan their QR code, they'd hand me the money, I'd make sure it's all legit, and then I'd send them the bitcoins and be on my way. But I can't find any website that can facilitate that, or at least none that have any reputation. 

(I found one called LocalCoinSwap. There are only two people on there that are in my area, and none of them have any reviews. I'll pass.)

f1fyy0,natoshoSakamoti,I am Satoshi Nakamoto but you should not care,"Hey All,

I am overwhelmed by how much crypto has developed in the years since i created it. I felt i have to get the word out because there is a lot impostors who try to claim they are me. 

I wanted to clear the and come out one last time to tell you, why i invented bitcoin and why my privacy is so important for me.

First of all, to give you a little hint, i am from Germany the email provider i used was a clue, that is all i am going to reveal about myself, it is a useless information.

Second i don't give a shit about fame looking at those superstars all over world who can't piss on a tree without a photo of it being in the news the day also i don't want to be bothered by anyone thats why i left and all of you done well so far, you create a new society a world free of banks and financial constraints.

Bitcoin was invented for that reason, a form of digital modern gold. Bitcoin needs miners, many of them to spread the currency as much as possible. My vision was that not only a handful of people should hold a bag of BTC but that everyone on the planet has some. I wanted a money system away from the current system, there are a few that control it all. Today we pay negative interest to banks who use our money to further enrich themselves and charge us for it.

This has to stop, though i like what ripple is doing by connecting the world through crypto, but again they should not have the biggest bag of it. My vision is not what some say, hard forking the old code and advertising a system that only has a handful of people making a buck by solely mining it. THIS IS NOT BITCOIN. Please don't fall for these charlatans.

I will not name anyone or point the finger to specific projects in the same breath i will also never claim a patent for this because i just gave you a soccer field so you can play on it. I trust in the justice system to punish those who try.

Third, Bitcoin is YOU and is supposed to be developed by YOU the people, by whomever is interested participating in it, it is open and free and nobody but YOU should benefit from it. I want the normal person on the street to get a chance of being rich by simply owning digital gold.

Please remember this is a free system for everyone to participate in, a system from people for people my contribution was done and while i still participate from time to time (different names).

I am proud of each and everyone of you guys.

That's it i have spoken.

If you don't believe it or don't get it, I don't have the time to try to convince you.",1581285834,0,1

f1eqip,WorkingLime,"Venezuela update. Last week 553 BTC (amount has been steady weekly) were traded using LocalBitcoin which is 365,670,000,000 Bs. Minimum wage is 5 USD per month. One BTC is 729,000,000 Bs. (Bolivares). AMA.","Just updating this week numbers.

These volumes are only measured using Localbitcoin (LBTC) using their API (Coindance). Big part of that exchange come from Venezuelans that live abroad and send money to their families, miners, people that get paid in cryptos (freelancing) and even the own government. It is around 2000 BTC per month.

Other exchanges and other trades were done, but no way of measure them.

Today exchange rate is around 1 USD = 75,000 Bs. (Official rate is almost the same)

Minimum wage (which is earned by a big chuck of the population, not like other countries) is 250,000 Bs. wage (less than 3 USD) + 200,000 Bs. food bonus (less than 3 USD) PER MONTH.

Biggest bank note is 50,000 Bs. which is around 0.75 USD. You need to use debit and credit, bank transfer, cryptos and USD to pay anything.

Here in Venezuela situation is really hard, some people dont believe that amount is the minimum MONTHLY wage. I work and earn more than that (anyway, the amount is really low, I'm sure with that amount I would be living homeless in Colombia, Peru or Panama for example), usually get some donations from redditors and do some freelancing work (translating mostly) and it is really hard to keep up daily.

f1da4f,Mannagun,"Satoshi Nakamoto, Abstract.","Reading people’s post and replies about Bitcoin hitting $10,000 is annoying to me. If Bitcoin some day hit $20,000 I wouldn’t get excited, not even at $50,000. To me it’s not about the value so much but more towards its initial intent to change from an third party system to: Peer to peer. And of course most of us do understand basic blockchain concept, but I do think most people never read Satoshi Nakamoto Abstract let along any part of his or [them] White Paper. 

Most exchanges do offer fiat vaults and in fact Coinbase lists the dollar first in its portfolio’s. And of course with many of these services account holders do not control the most important thing, their keys. And we are right back from where we started with third party bankers. So what the reason for getting all excited about Bitcoin hitting certain value points? Are you in it for a new payment system and total collapse of Wall Street or unjustifiable ambiguous hope? Again, I am asking, how many of you actually read Satoshi Nakamoto abstract? How many of you lost something of value during 2008-2009 financial crisis? How many here are of age to reflect what had occurred little more than 11 years ago and truly appreciate the possibility someday will hold real value that’ll be impossible for another to invest against? I might not see that possibility in my lifetime, I suggest if nothing else read Satoshi Nakamoto white paper-abstract if nothing more or in my humble opinion it will not mean nothing if 1 Satoshi is worth $1.00 because you’ll only construct yourselves with a new system of debt.

f26rqr,epicbru,Is it possible to recover my Bitcoins from a CPU mining software that I uninstalled back in 2013 on my laptop ?,"Hey guys, so I'm from South Africa and I remember in my first year of University, I discovered mining and that one could use their laptop to mine BTC. I didn't know what it was at the time and I would leave my laptop in my room running and mining while I went to class(for 2/3 weeks if I remember correctly). 

Honestly, I didn't know what I was doing at the time, I didn't know what Bitcoin really was but it seemed legit and I was convinced that it wasn't a scam.

I later uninstalled the software though, but I was wondering whether one can somehow recover 'deleted' stuff from their laptops(Windows 7)

I still have the laptop. I didn't know much about addresses and all of that. The only thing I knew was mining and I remember downloading a Blockchain wallet on my android phone. 

Hope to get a response, 

Regards🇿🇦🤙🏿

### What is a Virtual Credit Card (VCC)?

A Virtual Credit Card or  VCC is an electronically generated credit card that can be used in the  online world only. It has no physical significance. The purpose is  simple, to make the online purchases that typically require a credit  card for a successful transaction.

Following are the important properties of Virtual Credit Cards:

Virtual  credit cards only work online: as explained above, you can’t use a VCC  in the real world where a card with physical form is required.You can  install a VCC on your computer or phone: as VCCs don’t have any physical  form, they can be installed or used on any device including your  computer, smartphone, or tablet.You can use a Virtual Credit Card for  monthly payments: if you have bought something that requires monthly  payments, i.e., subscription-based services, then VCCs can be your  savior if you don’t have a real credit card.You can set limits for  different merchant: Unlike a traditional credit card that has a limit  set by your bank, a VCC can have a limit specified by you for a  particular merchant. That’s really helpful if you want to avoid any kind  of additional amount charged by the merchant on your card.You can  decide when your Virtual Credit Card will expire: yes, you read that  right. Virtual Credit Cards don’t have a long expiry date. You can set  it to expire in a few hours, days, weeks, or even months as per your  needs.

### How To Make Unlimited Virtual Credit Cards ([VCC](https://l-earningmarketing.com/2020/02/learn-how-to-create-unlimited-virtual-credit-cards/))?

Let’s start!

Today  I will show you how to create unlimited virtual credit cards.You can  use this card for verification (paypal, google ads, bing ads, facebook  ads, amazon aws). This method is unique.

f25muk,lifeaser,Anti-money laundry or black money tools and practices as a way to promote Bitcoin?,"One of the constant criticism from regulators / agencies towards Bitcoin is the difficulties to prevent money laundry or black money to be within the bitcoin network.

It's easy to understand that this is one of the fallacies against the adoption of a new standard that has potential to rival with the current financial system. It's equally easy to understand that people from the network want to have privacy on financials, nevertheless, privacy must not be confused with secrecy. 

As such, instead of just positioning ourselves against the system, why don't we start breaking these arguments by promoting/developing/launching tools that help preventing black money &amp; laundry?

Big investors always think to put money into something and then, eventually, taking it out. And by increasing cleanliness of the network it could unblock a considerable flow of money into Bitcoin, as real people and big investors would find it safer that the regulators would not forbid it.",1581410428,0,1

I'm proud to summarize my simple way to help who wants to get money from generous and kind unknown people. Let's call it The Service.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The Service asks them to send the equivalent of 0,25$ to activate their prize;

\- The promised prize is 1.000$ or even more; 

\- The Service actually doesn't give anything.

In this way, with the modest price of a quarter, they can experience the saddest and humiliating emotion of having been fooled: this should make them become stronger in our untrustworthy world and preserve them to lose in the future an important amount of money.

Is there any real point to diversifying? Like, really? My gut thinking is that if bitcoin got in to severe trouble that every crypto would be in severe trouble an account of how new these markets are. I know markets are far more complicated than that, but still, if something happened that wrecked everyone’s confidence in bitcoin, how would that not take all the other serious coins with it?

Diversification in the stock market is sound advice. I just don’t see any real reason to buy anything other than bitcoin right now.

At the height of the 2017 bull market, I found that one of my friends couldn't recover his recovery phrase kept safe on paper due to an unfortunate house fire. At the same time, another one of the colleagues had kept his 24 word mnemonic phrase as a screenshot on his phone which got lost when the phone was corrupted. That's when I realized the need for a secure hardware wallet + with a recovery solution that caters to both data loss and data theft problems without a single point of failure.

To facilitate mass adoption, it is necessary that -

1. Regular, non tech savvy people should be able to use and secure crypto without the fear of losing it.
2. The solution to secure and recover crypto should be a non-custodial solution and the support should be open to all assets.

This was the belief that gave birth to [**Cypherock**](https://cypherock.com/). Current hardware wallets secure the crypto but the unencrypted seed phrase on the paper becomes a *single point of attack*. We believe that seed phrases deserve the same level of security that your private keys have.

So, we used 2 of 4 Shamir Secret Sharing (with the option to change the threshold in future) along with tamper-resistant hardware to secure your private keys. Simply put, it is like Multi-sig but for your wallet recovery phrase. Practically, it’s much easier to use than multi-sig, if implemented correctly. Even Coinbase uses Shamir Secret Sharing to secure their own assets.

More on what we developed

\- Each shard will be stored in a EAL6+ tamper resistant secure element chips. As comparison, your iPhone has the same level of security chip for securing fingerprints.

\- Nothing will be stored in the X1 Wallet on which the computation will be done.

\- Keys can be recovered by tapping any 2 out of the 4 cyCards on the X1 Wallet. Each cyCard can also be protected by a PIN just like your hardware wallet. The recovered keys are stored in a volatile memory on the X1 Wallet which gets wiped out as soon as the operation is done.

\- You can store 3 wallet recovery phrases in a single product.

\- The cyCards can be distributed around different places to increase security of the funds and protect against $5 wrench attacks.

What this means is without the knowledge of location of atleast 2 cyCards and the PIN, it is impossible for the hackers to steal your assets. We'll be able to support multiple blockchains (read: coins) using this along with other digital assets like your passwords, secrets, non Blockchain private keys etc. You can secure the cards by distributing it among trusted people or keeping it secure in different places that only you know of.

https://preview.redd.it/aqkuuizvfng41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fc5bb71e79df86fef5ea5855c29d0fe154e5b05

It has been a hell of a ride to provide an optimal solution for the mnemonic phrase/seed phrase recovery issue, without compromising the security of the user or the ownership of the assets.

We recently got backed by Consensys which was a high point for us. It has been a huge journey for us coming from India, where blockchain or the related hardware isn't that big with consumers yet.

**The product is in the testing phase and we have started with the** [**pre-orders**](https://cypherock.com/)**. You can book one today with &gt;50% off and if you don’t like it, we will give you a full refund, no questions asked.**

Small Example to show how it works:

1. You enter/generate your mnemonic phrase on the device or any other sensitive information like passwords.
2. You tap four cyCards on the device to make 4 shards of your phrases.You'll need any 2 of them to recover your keys or perform a transaction.
3. The cyCards can be stored at different locations or kept with different people for security.
4. It can solve the issue with inheritance too with proper management of keys. (PM or comment to know more on this).
5. To conduct a transaction, tap 2 cards on the device. The keys will be generated on the X1 Wallet for the transaction in a volatile memory which will be wiped off once the transaction is done (**no current generation wallet has this**). This allows for the hardware to have similar security as of multi-sig with the possible support of every asset.

Any feedback appreciated.

**TLDR**: **With the dream of making storage of seed phrase an easy solution for everyone, started out with Cypherock and in the process found out a solution for removing single point of failure and a way for easy crypto inheritance. Would love any help from the community to take this further.**

I said wow okay thank you for your customer services... sorry to keep you from leaving.. ...phone call ended.  

(This isnt the first time I called their support and having them telling me something else or Im wrong and their right..  One example I requested to have them re-transmit a transaction since they had it defaulted on a low fee.. then i was told this wasn't a blockchain................. )

&amp;#x200B;

I submitted my e-mail later on in the evening to the support... to have my account unlock.

On 2/11 I called customer support in their morning trying to advised them on my situation about my lock out ..trying to explain it was my vpn that cause the lock out..  I couldn't even complete a word with this rep .. . then I was told again it wasnt vpn that cause a lock out.. and I was advised to e-mail support on this..   half of my conversation with this rep was having her cut me off before i can speak  and her trying explain what shes knows is absolute. Then she goes from knowing it wasnt my vpn that cause my lock out to a maybe she thinks. Then shes asked me what was going to use the bitcoin for?( I went totally livid on this  and switch to 55hole  mode)  I requested to speak to  a manager but she hanged up on me - I called back 4-5 times.. same person. which ended with her hanging up on me.

&amp;#x200B;

Later on during the day I finally got  a response from the customer support manager advising me that  I need to fill out a form to have my account  unlock - then I was told  have to wait 24/48 hours now to have my account unlock. So I asked them how come you guys were able to unlock my account 3 months ago and it only took 10-15 minutes?  I probably sent him about 3  e-mails requesting why the change in their time frame.. 

&amp;#x200B;

I finally got a e-mail to have  me call back again....  talking to a different person telling me their corporate police has changed so now i have to wait 24/48 hours now..

This is a perfect example of dont piss off the waiter.... 

 little advice  if you do business with them.. dont try to correct them.. try to be super polite if you can... dont be a 55hole..  just be that yes man.. they are right.. you are wrong.. and stay calm =)

&amp;#x200B;

because you will be waiting like me..

&amp;#x200B;

btw i checked their TOS and policies.. I do not even see anything about a 24/48 hour waiting period to have a account locked out..  

&amp;#x200B;

its currently 4:02 PM EST 2/12/2020 - no response from them... i didnt bother waiting for them to unlock my account..  I had to find a btc atm.. took me about 10 minutes to drive their... but at least  I am able to send the money money to my family now. 

&amp;#x200B;

i submitted this on my mobile.. still frustrated.. ill make corrections.. if something dont make sense..",1581541577,4,1

f3rs57,tke1600,Halving importance: Miner perspective,"The bitcoin halvings in 2012 and 2016 were at times when mining changed from a fun hobby to the beginning of farms and larger mining operations. We went from CPU-GPU-ASIC in these 2 halving periods. The main theme during most of this time was people mining for fun and at a relatively low cost, all while BTC was mainly under $1k. 

Things changed when the antminer S7 and later S9 came out and BTC began to really rise in price. Miners were making a lot of real money and thus began the creation of major mining farms for profit.  

When the element of mining as a business is the forefront of the network, selling BTC to cover costs becomes a big part of most operations. We have all heard the number of 1800 BTC created daily during the 12.5 block reward time, and this has translated to around 18,000,000 usd per day @ a $10k BTC price. 

The reason this is so significant is miners are the only group of people that have brand new BTC that is constantly open sold on the market.  Every other person involved in BTC is buying and selling existing BTC supply. 

When the miner reward is cut to 6.25, this will help in the long run imo, but may add even more selling pressure by miners in the short term. Miners will instantly be making half the amount and will still have the same business costs. Even with rewards cut in half, 900 BTC and $9 million will be created per day as of right now. This is still a huge amount to be absorbed in the market, and we could see even more selling pressure than we do now where a lot of miners have a buffer in mining profits at the 1800 BTC per day network rate. 

TDLR: Halving will help in the long run but short term could add even more selling pressure than right now at a higher BTC inflation.",1581684839,14,1

I had just been given a decent raise at my job, nothing crazy but a nice bump. My dad takes this opportunity to congratulate me and then proceeds to start talking about investment strategies and how opening a Roth IRA is probably the best move long term. After hearing him out I tell him about my BTC auto buy of about 50% of my income every week. He asks how that is doing and if I am doing well. I may have started to DCA around 12k but I'm still near breakeven. He argued that over the long term compound interest will give me great returns and says, ""imagine how much you'll have in 5 years."" I proceed to tell him about Bitcoin and how in 5 years it will more than likely yield much greater returns. I had a hard time not cackling just a tad, yet restrained myself somewhat. 

Eventually we ended up agreeing that if I open a Roth IRA then he has to buy some Bitcoin. I would be psyched if this happened but would definitely take an early withdrawal penalty to turn and around and buy BTC with that IRA money. We'll make Bitcoiners out of these old people eventually, or they'll just die off.....slowly.

TLDR: Boomer dad says go Roth IRA, I say go BTC. A compromise is reached. Possible Bitcoiner in the making.",1581673605,57,1

f3ogyf,IamPANDAMAN8,Help With Fraud On Koinal!,"TL;DR Someone stole money out of someone else's bank account via Koinal to buy marijuana with BTC, please help! What can we do?

A friend of mine's cousin recently had $2.5K (US) transferred out of her bank account, and the reference on the transfer lead her to the cryptocurrency purchasing site Koinal. What's strange is that she's never had anything to do with cryptocurrency - no trading, no wallets, no mining, nothing!

She reached out to Koinal and it turns out she had an account on there linked to her email address that she had no knowledge of. She can see the BTC transactions having gone through on Koinal for the same amount that left her bank account (roughly 0.22 BTC), but there's no reference to a source or destination wallet address. At the time of the transaction, there were no wallets associate with her account, but my friend has since added his wallet there, incase the funds come through by some miracle. 

The only thing on the transaction that she can follow is a blockchain transaction number. When following the number, it takes her to a site with no English on it at all (I believe it was blockchain.com if I remember correctly). On this site, it appears as if the the transaction was part of a larger one to but marijuana (wish I was making this up).

She's already tried contacting the bank, but that hasn't lead to anything useful yet (still looking into it though). What else can we do? Has anyone had a similar experience to this?

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if anyone here has suffered attempts disputes/chargebacks when selling Bitcoins.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to create a database in which, if a chargeback/dispute is initiated, the individual/business would be added to this database. This would warn other Bitcoin traders not to trade with this individual/business as they have issued chargebacks/disputes on legitimate transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if anyone would be interested. This would obviously be a global thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I would also not mind working with or alongside other people when doing this so if anyone wants to collaborate to create this, I would be more than happy to work with someone. I would also not mind if anyone would like to share information of individuals/businesses that we should add to the database.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, you would need proof of the dispute/chargeback being attempted (at the very minimum) before we would add users to the actual database.",1581631099,4,1

f3hnm9,samdane7777,Bitcoin Community Should Take Treasury Department To The Supreme Court,"I think the inevitable necessity of taking the treasury department and FinCen to the Supreme Court is coming. Most of the Banking Secrecy Act and laws surrounding it are imho and others opinions significantly unconstitutional, but the increasing interpretations of it and how we would see it interpreted to apply to crypto would be even more unconstitutional. They are in many ways circumventing the need for a warrant to do searches. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mnuchin and the Senate are becoming increasingly hostile to bitcoin, and making increasing demands that are incapable and incompatible with the protocol. The bitcoin protocol absolutely is a numbered swiss acount by design, so they are not so subtly implying that they see the protocol as inherently criminal. This is all going to come to a head at some point likely in the Supreme Court.

&amp;#x200B;

mark my word they are going to go after software developers, miners, hardware wallet manufactures, and most likely criminalize non reporting of addresses through onerous treasury reports and accounting. It's a lot like red flag laws with guns, they do not want a bill of rights, and they do not want you having cash or firearms. They hate what they can't see.

I was paying $100 a month per S7 and now will be paying $65 each.  That's just about exactly breaking even at current bitcoin value.  Which has me wondering, would I be better off just buying bitcoin?  The benefit would be I could sell these miners (not for very much of course, maybe $100 each) and not have to worry about mining at a loss.  Of course BTC price could still go down and I'd be at a loss.

Or I could mine for a year (contract length) locking in the current price but not committing to it fully like I would if I just bought the same amount of BTC now.  I could always pause mining or even quit altgother if the price tanked.

I'd like to keep mining as I don't love the idea of selling these for next to nothing and also throwing out all the money I spent to have them shipped.  But I don't want to give in to the fallacy of sunk costs either..

f61ybe,AvailableHorse,Which industries will rise or fall in a deflationary world?,"Sorry for the heavy question in a subreddit full of memes and lolz.

My prediction is that when Bitcoin will rise to around $50k-$100k the governments and world-banks will be forced by their people to make all currencies deflationary. The governments will not be able to excuse inflation as a method of ""taxing the black market that uses cash"" or as a way to manipulate people into investing in the stock market. Even if the governments will succeed spreading FUD about bitcoin being useful only for criminals, the average citizen will think: ""If the criminals have a deflationary currency, why don't I?"". The governments/central-banks will then be forced to stop adding more of their local currency into circulation, either by turning it to a crypto-currency or simply with a constitutional law. The governments could also guarantee that this currency stays stable, because the entire public sector will be paid with that currency.

Consumerism will obviously drop, and there will be very high unemployment at first because many people that work in the consumerism industries will be laid off. A new class of ""bitcoin nouveau riche"" will rise, and will have their own consuming habits. There could be violent revolutions in many countries, so maybe there will be higher demand for canned food and personal weapons. There will be less money for giant bureaucratic corporations that are only good at providing a safe investment for shareholders (who needs that when you can keep the money in a deflationary currency), so maybe there will be more money for small daring startups.

What else do you think will happen economically in a modern deflationary world? Which industries should young people seek to work in?",1582072185,52,1

I'm worried that if I don't establish ownership for her/her parents in this tax year, the IRS would consider it mine. And then when it's transferred to her it would count as a gift of whatever 1 BTC is worth in 2037... and idk if it would be taxed both capital gains and a gift tax then..

I'm French and I got into bitcoin in late 2017 when it was a super big trend. I used Coinbase to buy like 50€ in BTC and watched it grow (and crumble, lol).


Water has flown under the bridge and now that I have more free time, I'd love to get back into bitcoin. Especially ""trading"" a little bit (at very low level, like, 100€ max).

I was disappointed in Coinbase because transactions take a long time and the fees were pretty big. 
Back in 2017, I think Coinbase was about the only wallet available for France. 


I've heard that nowadays, there are many more wallets that can deal with French bank accounts. A friend told me ages ago that 'coinbase is shit' and that there are new, amazing ways to buy BTC and other cryptos, and learn more about them.

I checked the sidebar and bitcoin.it, but I'm not sure if everything is up to date and applies to France. Also I filled the form on the Bitcoin website and I got the Bitcoin wallet app recommended, I wasn't sure if it was just a big ad from the site or not.

Sooo I'm looking for advice. I wrote about wallets, but basically any advice is welcome. If you have advice about amounts to buy, how to buy, how to sell, really, whatever, I'll take it.


Thanks",1582050625,18,1

f5vltu,lilbauerjr,Blockchain Technology Can Help Xi Jinping And China Find Redemption After Coronavirus,"Although still [growing at slightly over 6%](https://www.ft.com/content/62524508-3825-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4) (this quarter’s numbers notwithstanding), the country’s economy is expanding at its slowest rate since 1990. And this trend started long before anyone heard the word coronavirus*.* 

*Now*, with factories across the country [slow to re-open, or operate anywhere close to maximum capacity](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/business/china-coronavirus-economy.html), all eyes in China and around the world are focusing on Chinese President Xi Jinping and his brethren in Beijing.

This is a major problem for a country with one political party and little individual freedom. One whose legitimacy is solely based on the ability to “outperform the global market”. 

Populations around the world have proven willing to sacrifice certain democratic rights for better livelihoods. However, as we have seen recently [throughout Latin America and the Middle East](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2019/11/06/a-crypto-arab-spring/#4577df564608), when the government fails to uphold its side of this social contract, citizens demand transparency and accountability. 

Without a formal mechanism for redress, chaos can ensue. 

In need of a savior, crypto and blockchain may provide the catalyst and relief valve that China needs. ",1582047985,0,1

I configured the program in order to install the program on the first of the two disks that I have, and in the second disk (both are 320GB) I put the datadir, blockdir ecc files.
I also decided to run the node in prune=50'000.

Now I have a question for you:
Does a prune node helps the network? I'll speak in a crearer way....if I don't storage the all 280GB of blockchain it will be a problem for the other peers?
Does it will be a problem if in a few months I decide to run a lightning network node?

I haven't done so yet but the idea is quite appealing to me personally but I'm trying to determine the cons of setting up something like that. Besides the potential risk of damaging relationships if money is lost, I'm trying to figure out the legal realm of this.

I'm not entirely sure what the rules are for crypto-trading for other people. I know with stocks and SEC regulated things you have to be licensed and all that jazz but I wonder if it's the same for crypto since it's not regulated the same (or maybe it is, I'm not entirely sure). 

I'm hoping the smarter minds of this sub will be able to inform me or point me in the right direction. Thanks all!",1582174165,9,1

I explain briefly:

I received this amount of Bitcoins to be able to trade on the platform on 10/02/2020 at 14:24.

[Receipt](https://preview.redd.it/tcue6zmf60i41.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82caa060058007a8833a19b24f5d0071f385b00a)

Then my account goes into level 3 tier3 verification mode, ok there are no problems I proceed to verify as requested.

[Receipt](https://preview.redd.it/2nh6ery070i41.png?width=1154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4466c5ed80e8fa99a8bfd0b763d1d2ef9d41c4a)

After sending the information they ask me, they do not respond to me, since the options they give me are that they take 3 to 5 weeks and the other alternative option is to delete my account and wait 14 days that I want to return the funds that were entrusted to me to trade and now I'm in trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

[Level 3 ..... time ?](https://preview.redd.it/jjugnjez70i41.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f3722744829abd0eb686be1c3a845be94431cd1)

It is absurd to have to wait so long to verify my account and / or return the BTCs.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/phg2gt8i80i41.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88f6a67829012a70d513a44887028d5708960960

Who answers me if Bitcoin reaches 1000 dollars? Who covers the losses? it's fair ?

I have legal problems with these funds in BTC that localbitcoins have withheld from me and they only answer that I wait ... until when they go more than 9 days, where I have not been able to eat, I have lost my job, localbitcoins have ruined me.

https://preview.redd.it/hfg64qkd90i41.png?width=1190&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=571f1d6d1c074341c82f8e515b7e215739e66a5f

They don't care about their customers, they hurt me and we care, that's why I publicly hold them accountable that if something happens to me they are responsible for getting me into serious trouble for these funds.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hchglakg90i41.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c30ad2bc8c728724977f51ad1956084770742f7

Localbitcoins must respond, it is not fair that I have to go through this, I have sent them all the support they ask for, even with deception since they asked me for the supports in PDF format when the web form does not accept them.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img nfam5czq90i41...*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8kgn2pft90i41.jpg?width=1016&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e644f06c97e0396a0d6dc5149b9219d6143bce7

I have been writing on social networks and they don't answer me, if anyone knows how I can do or help me get this because I don't know what to do, I'm desperate and they don't give me a solution.

The most sensible thing would be to return the funds to the address where they came from, but they don't give me that solution that I have helplessness and they take months to respond.

\- We take care of all property management responsibilities, so you don't have to be a landlord.  
\- We accept Bitcoin, and payouts can be made in Bitcoin as well.  


At the moment, we are anywhere between 12 to 18 months away from a public launch and are looking to onboard beta testers from our waitlist.

For those who are new around or been living in a cave for the last 3 years, it was the year 2017 when McAfee predicted Bitcoin will hit $500,000 within three years. So the time ends on 31th December of this year. He actually didn’t say $1,000,000 in the first place, this number was a correction over his first prediction a few months before, when he stated 1 btc = $500k within 3 years and said the famous “if not, I will eat my dick on national television”. 

If you watch closely the chart of Bitcoin you will notice that Bitcoin has been going parabolic since the start of 2019, and the volume has been increasing dramatically ever since. Bitcoin has gained exposure like never before and has become a mainstream thing. Everybody knows about Bitcoin or at least heard of it. Which means that the number of potential buyers is even wider, has shot up exponentially since December 2017. We have a halvening in less than 3 months we all know how scarcity affects the value of things, this is basic economics. Bitcoin just need the spark to unleash the hysteria. You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one. You may say that history doesn’t have to repeat itself, but if I have to bet, I’m on the side of mathematics. Vires in numeris.",1581833924,0,1

The card is funded and you can scan the QR code and deposit BTC into a wallet of your choice (or get a new wallet).

The closest BTC ATM to me is currently selling BTC for $17k/BTC, (WTF?!) so that's not at all an option, and this seems a more fair way.  Even if I had to pay a sales tax, that's worth it to me to get BTC anonymously.

So far, besides the shilling articles, I've found some people saying that it is legit. Their arguments are:

1. The CEO is Alex Mashinsky, a supposedly reputable and trustable entrepreneur.
2. Their return rates seem ""realistic"".
3. People that have money invested in Celsius seem to be receiving the announced returns.

Also, I've found no reports of users saying they were scammed.

Some people said that Celsius is similar to the well known bitconeeect, but they haven't supported their claims with evidence.

There is still something I don't understand about their business model. They say investors deposit crypto in Celsius wallet so that they use to lend to borrowers. However, if anyone wants to borrow money from Celsius, they have to deposit 200% of the requested amount in crypto. When borrowers pay back the fiat plus interest, they get their crypto back.

In this case, why do they need investors' money? It seems unnecessary to me, since borrowers need to provide both the initial crypto plus a colateral.

f4fbv3,cringeworthyxd,How bitcoin Can Empower Developing Nations [A college admissions essay OC],"    The global crisis I am most passionate about is socioeconomic inequality in developing nations. To imagine that all of your hard work and capital can disappear in an instant due to your governments mismanagement of power is abstract to us in developed nations with strong banking systems. Yet, more than half of the population in developing countries are unbanked. In a world where corrupt governments can simply print money, leading to hyperinflation, there is a need for a solution that is available to all. The solution to this challenge is Bitcoin, it has the potential to solve the greatest problems for those living in developing nations. The implementation of a global currency will give those struggling with hyperinflation, bankless societies, and corrupt government a means of financial inclusion. These limitations of developing nations is what has kept them impoverished for all this time.
    Hyperinflation is caused by corrupt governments that print and circulate money for various reasons. One example of hyperinflation is Venezuela's currency, the Venezuelan Bolívar. The Bolívar has the highest inflation rate in the world with an average of 4374% per year from 1973 to 2019. The effects of a crumbling economic system in a developing country is enormous, many lose jobs, savings, and the ability to send and receive payment. To combat the socioeconomic turmoil in Venezuela, citizens are beginning to turn to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as an alternative solution. No matter the choice of Cryptocurrency, they have performed considerably better than the Venezualian Bolívar. In developing countries where citizens do not have access to a central bank there is also a need for financial inclusion. Bitcoin and the blockchain network allows these people to build up credit, savings, and the option of receiving loans. A decentralized financial system paves the way for emerging businesses and customers, bringing a flow of trade to a country with a lack of it. The reason Bitcoin can be used to bring finance to a nation without any is because Bitcoin does not require a bank account. 
    As for the blockchain, it is a viable option to counter a corrupt government, with each transaction being secure and publicly recorded. This lack of anonymity makes corruption more difficult than using cash based currency. The great thing about this is that it restores power back into the hands of the people, without the control of government or third parties in peer to peer exchanges.
    It is my goal to promote the use of these emerging technologies to the benefit of developing countries. With cryptocurrencies only gaining in popularity over the past decade, there is an incredible amount of potential that is yet to be realized. With innovations in Cryptocurrency's being made every day, I believe that people in developing nations will finally be able to participate in the global economy within our lifetime.",1581799159,11,1

f4bnl5,tempaccountnumber23,Initial set up judgment,"So I am relatively new to BTC  ( in Canada) and I have set up an old phone to use a cold storage device following the instructions I found online.

I was hoping that someone in the community could spare a few minutes to read over the instructions I followed and provide some feedback. 



Step 1: Prepare your phone
Remove the SIM card if your phone has one. You don’t want any cellular communications, only WiFi.
Perform a factory reset. This is typically found under Settings/Backup &amp; Reset. This procedure wipes all personal data from the device and returns it to a factory state. Obviously back up anything you need before hand.
After resetting the device and connecting to your WiFi (make sure your WiFi is password protected), you will have to log in to a Google account during the setup process. Do not use an existing account. Instead, create a new account with a fake name. Save the details of the account for later. This new account is to be used for absolutely nothing but tasks related to interacting with this device. Also during setup, don’t back up your phone to Google’s servers, don’t select to stay up to date, and don’t add any billing information. When it asks you to secure your phone, choose PIN and make sure it’s at least 6 digits long; I use 10. Remember, this isn’t about convenience, it’s about security. When prompted, choose to not show notifications when the device is locked. Lastly, don’t enable any of the offered services like backups, location, bug reporting, etc.
Once the phone is done setting up your profile, turn off data communications. On most Android phones, swipe down twice from the top of your screen to bring down your quick menu. Click on the icon for your data or cellular connection and then disable mobile data.
Go into Settings/Apps, swipe over to All, and uninstall or disable every app that isn’t explicitly needed for using the device for offline storage. If in doubt, leave enabled all of the apps with the green android avatar. Also leave enabled Google Play, Google Play Services, and Google Keyboard. Don’t worry, if you accidentally disable something you need, it can always be re-enabled; just make sure you’ve tested everything before you start moving the bulk of your coins to the device. It’s also a good idea to reboot your phone before moving on to the next step.
Go to Settings/Security. Set it to automatically lock after sleep. Enable the “Power button instantly locks” option, disable “make passwords visible”, and disallow installation of unknown sources
Finally, encrypt your phone. There should be an option on the Security page. It will warn you that encryption will take a long time but since there’s hardly anything installed or stored on the phone at this time, it will only take a few minutes. If the option to encrypt isn’t available, don’t use this device. If you can’t encrypt your device, your security is highly compromised and isn’t worth the risk and you’ll be better off using something else.


Step 2: Install software
Install a VPN client. While there are free ones available, I don’t trust them. I use and pay for Private Internet Access (PIA); they have a strong history of protecting their customers. A VPN (virtual private network) encrypts and routes all data coming and going to and from your device through a proxy server masking your IP address. If your VPN allows for it, set it up so that if the VPN loses connection, it will kill your network connection and prevent any unencrypted data from leaving your phone.
Install LastPass. LastPass is a free (with paid premium features) app that allows you to manage passwords and secure notes. It is a fully encrypted cloud based service that nobody can access but you, not even LastPass. Since LastPass is cloud based, you can log in to your LastPass account from any computer or device. When setting up LastPass, make sure you use a good master password and DO NOT LOSE IT. If you lose your LastPass master password YOU POTENTIALLY LOSE EVERYTHING!!! Write it down and memorize it. Do not save it as an unprotected file on your computer.
Install wallets. There are a number of wallets available on the Android platform, all with different features. Do NOT use a hosted wallet app such as Coinbase. Using a hosted wallet completely defeats the purpose of using your device for offline storage. When choosing your wallet, always try to choose wallets that offer a 12 word recovery phrase. If you ever lose your device or it malfunctions, you’ll need this phrase to recover your money. The wallet that suits my needs best is Coinami. It has a good interface, holds several of the coins I own, can be protected by a password, and has a 12 word recovery phrase.


Step 3: Backup your data
Create a new Secure Note in LastPass. Choose the Generic template and give it a name that’s not too obvious as to what it’s being used for. Make sure you check the box “Require Password Reprompt”.
In the Notes section, add the following information:
Google Account info. Enter the username, email, password, and personal info of the fake account you created earlier.
Screen Lock PIN. This is the PIN you need to unlock the phone
Wallet Info. Record the name of the wallet, its password, and most importantly, the 12 word recovery phrase.
Enter the addresses for all of the coins in your wallet. By saving these in LastPass, you can log in to LastPass from another device and access your addresses and send money to your cold storage device without having to power it on. However, note that some wallets use what are called ‘change addresses’. Whenever you send money out of an address, it moves all of the remaining money in the originating address to a new address. If you use a wallet that uses change addresses, you will need to record the new address and key every time you send money from this wallet if you want to maintain backup redundancy. Since this is cold storage and rarely used for sending money though, you shouldn’t have to do this very often. Coinami has the option to turn this feature off.
Optionally, for redundancy in your backups, you may want to record your private keys as well.
Backup LastPass. On your computer, login to LastPass. While you can do this from the website, I recommend getting the browser plugin. Once logged in, click on Options/More Options/Advanced and choose Export. Choose the csv export option and save it to your computer (if it displays in your browser window instead of giving you the option to save a file, copy and paste the data into Notepad and then save it). If you don’t have Z-Zip, you’ll need to install it. Once you’ve done that, open 7-Zip and navigate to the the export file you saved. Select the file and click on Add. On the setup screen enter a password (I use the same password as my LastPass master password) and click ok. Now in the same location where you saved your export file will be a new encrypted .7z volume containing your exported file which can’t be accessed without a password. Save your new .7z file to a secure location. It’s a good idea to save a copy of this file on a thumbdrive or some other removable storage. Lastly, go back to the original, unencrypted export file you saved and while holding the shift key, delete the file. Holding the shift key bypasses the recycle bin and permanently deletes the file.

Step 4: Test your setup
On your computer or device where you access your existing currencies, log in to LastPass and search for the Secure Note you created in Step 3 and open it.
Copy the address of the coin you want from the Secure Note and use it to send a small amount to your address. Go back to your smartphone and open up your wallet and verify the transaction went through. Do this for all the coins you wish to store on this device.
Wipe your wallet and then restore it with your 12 word recovery phrase. If it restores properly and show the correct balances, you can now be confident in your setup and may start transferring your money to this device. You may need to create a new password after restoring so make sure you check on this.",1581784010,7,1

I have a question about bitcoin, gambling, and taxes in the US. 

How to file if:
Someone buys $100 of bitcoin
Transfers it to an online bookie and gambles with the bitcoin
Withdraws $1000 of bitcoin from the bookie and exchanges it to $

Is this reported as capital gains or gambling or both?

I have done some research on it and I think that you would have to:
Report the gambling win

Report any change in price between buying/selling the bitcoin as capital gains

I'm working with a team to build a new platform to help speed up Bitcoin adoption. It would be great to get any feedback so we can improve.

The company is called Satstreet ([www.satstreet.com](https://www.satstreet.com)) and the platform allows you to send as little as 1 sat to any email address. We also have an Earn section where you can earn Sats back by signing up at exchanges or making online purchases. We will be tying these two concepts together so anyone that you send Sats to allows you to receive a split of their commissions! We think it's a great way to incentivize the Bitcoin community to send Sats to their friends and family to help speed up adoption.

In order to provide this service without KYC, we have to restrict transaction amounts to $1000 or 50 Euros depending on the user's IP address.

f4wch2,TheDigiDoc,Bitcoin &amp; insurance,"Just some weekend thoughts from someone who's been less active in the space recently...

With fiat, banking, and credit cards, insurance is a huge reason people like the existing system.  If something happens and I ""loose"" money, it's generally insured in such a way that I'm not the one who pays in the end.  Yes, it's imperfect and doesn't always work, but it works enough that people are comfortable with it.  Same with insurance on your house and vehicles.  If your house burns down or your car is crashed into, insurance will take car of most of the costs involved.  Again, yes, it's not a perfect system, but it works well enough that we still drive and own houses.

With Bitcoin, if we mess up, our satoshis are gone.  There is no recourse.  This is very intentional and all part of the system.  There are many things we can do to make sure we don't mess up, but it's still gonna happen.  Especially with the ""other X billion"" that I hear speakers talk about.  Most people are not techs or engineers; even if we design Bitcoin with systems and layers that make it near impossible to mess up with, it will still happen.

So then, will there be a potential future market for crypto insurance?  Where people pay in, and those who misfortune falls upon are payed out to?  Would an insurance ""layer"" in Bitcoin be worth investigating as an idea, or are we okay with ""if you mess up and loose your Bitcoin, that's on your head and your head alone""?",1581883775,6,1

f7iwcu,DistinctSkin,How Bad is Bitcoin Mining for the Environment? New Research Suggests Not So Bad,"Bitcoin mining emissions were on par with Estonia, suggesting that the climate change impact of the first digital asset is less than previously reported. Furthermore, the research seems to suggest that where Bitcoin is mined contributes to how much carbon Bitcoin emits. With so much of the mining being done in China, one might wonder if that country’s infrastructure is more to blame than Bitcoin.

Past research demonstrated that emissions from mining bitcoin could be as high as 63 megatonnes of CO2 per year. Reports surfaced suggesting Bitcoin mining put out as much carbon as some Scandinavian countries. But, Susanne Köhler and Massimo Pizzol at Aalborg University in Denmark suggested previous researchers had built misguided axioms into their studies. Poor assumptions about carbon emissions from electricity generation across China, in part, led to the doomsday conclusions about bitcoin mining.

Köhler and Pizzol instead broke emissions down within China to take into consideration regional levels of CO2 produced, as reported by *The New Scientist*. They came up with a lower carbon footprint for Bitcoin: 17.29 megatonnes of CO2 in 2018. The new numbers result from facts such as coal-heavy Inner Mongolia accounts for 12.3 percent of bitcoin mining, resulting in more than a quarter of the total emissions.

“On the one hand we have these alarmist voices saying we won’t hit the Paris agreement because of bitcoin only,” said Köhler. “But on the other hand there are a lot of voices from the bitcoin community saying that most of the mining is done with green energy and that it’s not high impact.”

Köhler and Pizzol say the affect of Bitcoin mining on the environment won’t truly be known until more accurate data on where it takes place is available.

f7hqhi,rubi510,Closed Coinbase account and funds missing after more than 2 years of being a faithful user,"I’m a Coinbase Pro user since it was still Gdax and I was a huge fan.

I’m an active but non-professional trader and I own accounts at more than one exchange, yet, to all of my friends and family who showed interest in investing or trading with crypto, I always recommended Coinbase Pro. About 10 people have opened or are about to open their Coinbase Pro accounts based on my recommendation for their first encounter with crypto.

Then, a few days ago, I received a letter of ‘gratitude’: **NOTICE OF ACCOUNT CLOSURE**.

After the initial shock and a normal human reaction to apologize if I did something wrong, to try to find out what was the problem and to try to resolve the issue, I quickly realized, after contacting the Coinbase support, that that’s not going to happen:

&gt;“for security reasons we are unable to elaborate on our internal decision process”.

Being a huge fan and a supporter, I was a bit heart-broken. But soon, using my reason instead of my feelings, I made peace with that. I realized that I’ve probably somehow triggered a red flag in an automated algorithm which increased my risk analysis a bar too high and... off I go.  
 In the eyes of Coinbase I was now being viewed as a risk they need to mitigate, not as a desirable user. They don’t hate me - they just can’t trust me anymore. Fine.  
 They needed me to transfer my assets from my Coinbase accounts.

But when I tried to do that, I was in for another big surprise: about **90% of my assets were gone!**

BTC and fiat balances were flat-out **zero**. I did have access to some of my other currencies and have successfully withdrawn them. But that was only a small percentage of my portfolio.

My efforts to find out what happened to my BTC, fiat and some other currencies always gave the same result:

&gt; “...we are no longer able to support your Coinbase account...”  
 “...we have not blocked access to the balance currently in your Coinbase account...”  
 “... you may still send your balance offsite to an external address...”

Yes, but **what about the balance that is missing from my account** and it was there before the closure?

The closest I got was when they replied:

&gt; “We have transferred your case to a specialist who will be able to assist you with this specific issue.  
 You will be contacted directly as soon as we have reviewed your case.”

But the next answer was the same generic answer I received before...

I started to **suspect that my account was breached** prior to closure and that someone spent all of my fiat and stole my BTC.

I’m totally fine if Coinbase halted my BTC and fiat for the inspection purposes, as it’s written in the User agreement. I’m all for preventing terrorism and money laundering, even if that means that they need to check me from time to time, but **I need to know** that that’s what’s happening, **that I wasn’t robbed** by someone.

I need to know what currency my funds are being held in, if they are being held, to be able to adjust my trading activities to minimize the losses.

I also tried to **download the trading reports**, to be able to calculate and pay the taxes, but the button for generating reports on the ‘Close account’ page **doesn’t seem to work**.

Although I might sound like some big-time trader with money to throw, that is actually not the case. Most of my portfolio was on Coinbase Pro, because I trusted it the most, and it was worth a **few years of hard-earned savings** from my day job.

I was a big fan but will I stay one - it all depends on how this issue will be handled and, hopefully, resolved.

**Any help in founding out what happened to my money** and, perhaps, getting my transaction history **would be greatly appreciated**.

With love, still,

f7fl1o,mirkus796,URGENT: connected to thin wallet without VPN,"Hi everybody, I'm so upset since my Bitpay wallet checked for incoming transactions (and found a new one) while my VPN hadn't run yet. This means it connected directly to my ISP, which could see something I don't know exactly and that's why I'm writing this post.

I know that any Bitcoin client sends unencrypted messages of a standard and unique format to well-known TCP ports, this means my ISP can easily assume I'm using Bitcoin. What I'd like know, however, is whether Bitpay wallet (or any other thin wallet) sends and receives data in plain text when checking for incoming transactions. In other words, I need to know if my ISP can know exactly all BTC addresses stored in my wallet (by just looking at my incoming / outgoing traffic) or if it can only see a generic traffic to Bitcoin nodes.

I also read somethere that some thin wallets (don't know if Bitpay as well)  start relaying transactions for other people once the syncronization finishes, maybe this reduces the risk of letting the ISP know the exact addresses stored in my wallet ?

I did NOT send any transaction, my Bitpay wallet just checked for incoming transactions and found a new one.

Thanks for your help, much appreciated

Also, the fiat price prejudice is another barrier rescinding mass adoption; the price of a t-shirt is 10$ and not 0.0010 btc to them.

long story short, few weeks ago I made my first BTC purchase for a pizza delivery. The payment processor was BitPay (that I understood not being ideal?) that asked me to turn off ""replace-by-fee"" and ""spend unconfirmed"" options, that I didn't even know being possible settings.

The pizza ended up costing something like 0.8$ more at the time of purchase, with 0.3$ of fees and the other I guess just being BitPay shitty exchange rates; but that's ok, currently the shop covers for card transaction fees on card, but not on BTC, so i guess it's something not too relevant in the future, unless fees skyrocket.

The things that I was most concerned with, was having to wait 3-4 blocks for the payment to be confirmed. BitPay informed me I was using low transaction fees (electrum default ones), but even with higher ones, I can't wrap my head thinking it's convenient to wait any amount of time over 5 minutes for a transaction to confirm.

I have to say I have knowledge basically just with vanilla BTC and know pretty much nothing about LN and SegWit. So I was wondering, how does BTC plan to achieve short transaction time and at the same time not being overcrowded with shitload of transactions driving up the fee cost?",1582558440,14,1

Incognito is a privacy blockchain. We have come up with a new solution for trustless Bitcoin anonymity and we would like to have the discussion here with the community.

Our approach is called 'Privacy Bitcoin'. Imagine that you are using Google Chrome browser. Just by pressing some key , you can open and exit the Incognito mode easily. In the Incognito mode, every website you search for can’t be tracked. The concept of Privacy Bitcoin is the same as that. Privacy Bitcoin is Bitcoin in Incognito mode.

Basically, we built the Trustless Portal to connect Incognito Chain and Bitcoin Blockchain, through which your Bitcoin can be trustlessly 1:1 turned into Privacy Bitcoin and vice versa anytime you want. Issued on Incognito privacy blockchain, Privacy Bitcoin is technically a privacy coin just like Monero or Zcash, which means you can send, receive, and store Bitcoin in complete anonymity in Monero style or Zcash style. Moreover, Trustless Portals connecting to other blockchains have been also built. So, for the very first time, you can trade cross-chain Bitcoin to other cryptos completely anonymously.

We would like to read our proposal here: [https://incognito.org/t/privacy-bitcoin-incognito-mode-different-approach-for-bitcoin-anonymity/402](https://incognito.org/t/privacy-bitcoin-incognito-mode-different-approach-for-bitcoin-anonymity/402). Let's open the floor for discussion!!!",1582549315,1,1

Markets ‘calm down,’ as the world awaits more lies from China, says

“The Wolf of Wall Street,’ Omar Abdulla…??

by Nabila Dockrat

(2 March 2020—ABC NEWS) The Wolf of Wall Street

Mr. Omar Abdulla

says that

China is reporting low number of cases the past several

weeks whilst other

Asian countries are starting to peak with new cases

daily from South Korea, Japan

Hong Kong and Singapore.

“Maybe the other Asian countries are the ones to be

trusted, instead of lying

China,’ he told ABC NEWS.

Another resident who spoke to Hubei Times looped

that China has been injecting

billions of dollars into their economy by stagnating the

impact of Covid 19.

“China has been injecting stimulus into their economy to

keep the market alive.

We believe that much more people have died at home, and

China is keeping the

numbers low so that people can get back to work.’

Addressing members of Washington, President Trump says

that the Corona Virus

Is ‘under control,’ and should see smaller numbers as Winter

in China progresses.

The Omar Abdulla Group which owns shares in Bitcoin SA, Forex SA,

Instagram SA and

Facebook SA added that investors were queuing to invest into

GOLD and SILVER as these

Commodities were known as ‘safe havens.’

“Markets have stayed away from the see-saw markets of China

and The United States,

and have Gold as the medium of trade.’

In other news, speaking to The Hong Kong Sun, local resident,

Ms. Sue Ying cooled that

the rest of Asia should be trusted with their numbers, and

not the Chinese.

“The Chinese government want to keep numbers low so

that people can get to work,

and not cause billions of other people in Asia to panic.’

Meanwhile, South African shares seem to have progressed

during this flu season,

as first world currencies have seen their money moved to

third world currencies.

“Markets have moved some of their investment into Africa

and South Africa, as very

few cases have been reported in these countries.’

Economist for The Omar Abdulla Group, Ms. Ayesha Noormahomed

concluded her remarks

to The Sunday Times that she expects the South African Rand

to get stronger within the year,

due to better economic data from South Africa and expects

the Covid 19 virus to come to an

end by April 2020.

“We are already seeing low numbers from China, and

although the virus is still not yet fully contained,

we should see billions in China returning to work in

coming days, which could see

the Asian markets rise to market expectations.’",1582546850,1,1

f8n8x3,emersonian85,What would happen if sovereign governments gave bitcoin a gold peg?,"This is a totally theoretical post, but I believe it is a really interesting idea and would love to get the Internet's feedback on it, and what you think the ripple effects would be in the scenario described.  Am very interested in writing this up and republishing it widely so it can be read by monetary policymakers in all major developed countries - if you know anyone like that, pass it on.  In a move that would act like a bridge to a pre-Bretton Woods type of gold peg, (here is a great paper on a history of this in the US:  https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41887.pdf) sovereign governments with gold holdings could (again, it is a theoretical idea - I am saying they COULD do this NOT that anyone or any country is doing this that I know of) establish open market operations to purchase bitcoins (partly as a diversification strategy) using their physical gold holdings at a fixed peg rate of 5 ounces per bitcoin.  The reason I say 5 is because the current chart here seems to suggest that somewhat of a convergence to 5 oz is already occurring:  https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=XBT&amp;to=XAU&amp;view=10Y  

If any government did this and offered to buy physically delivered bitcoins from private holders of bitcoin (no other coins just BTC) in exchange for private delivery of physical gold, then the standard governmental unit of physical gold (held in places like Fort Knox) - known as the Good Delivery Bar which is 400oz of gold - could be procured by any holder of 80 or more coins in a secure and sanctioned exchange with the government in question - the most impactful of course would be if the US did this.

My theory is that any time the exchange rate mechanisms in the forex or crypto markets violated the peg, there would be arbitrage opportunities that would bring the peg back in line.  It would not only stabilize BTC, but the stabilization might spread via the 24/7 exchange rate mechanism in the crypto market to stabilize many cryptos that are still somewhat worthy experimental stores of value.  Depending on the strength, credit, and depth of gold holdings of whatever governments engaged in this, it would seem that such a strategy could transform bitcoin into a new type of sound money, and also signal that owning bitcoin and gold is a priority of governments as well as their citizens.  The gold standard was powerful both because it was tethered to something of limited quantity in the earth's crust with unique properties, but also because pre-Bretton Woods gold standards acted very much like a peg - and the government honored the peg no matter what.  So in some sense it was still the ""faith and credit of the government"" that made that peg work so famously.  I was partly inspired by this recent award-winning documentary www.inmoneywetrust.org in formulating this idea, and partly by my own academic interest in cryptocurrency.  I believe bitcoin, above all others, because of its deflationary nature and algorithmically fixed quantity, is powerful all in itself - but with a peg from a real government to a real precious metal that many governments do in fact hoard (for whatever reason) - it could become both an international currency, and a form of truly sound money backed by governments' physical gold reserves and a legal or policy commitment to a peg of 5 ounces to 1 bitcoin.

What do you all think would happen if a major government or many major governments did this?  Remember the idea is to convince monetary policymakers in governments to willingly and openly bypass completely the fiat currencies of their governments and to make no informational commitment to those free-floating fiat markets for forex - so the bitcoins transacted for in the peg wouldn't be bought with dollars or yen or anything that could be printed by fiat.  This would simply be a convertibility guarantee by major governments that 1 bitcoin, transferred to the Treasury by a private citizen or business (again so the Treasury could diversify holdings of sound money), would be convertible and be guaranteed to be convertible to 5 oz of physical, deliverable gold bullion (or 80 bitcoins per bar). 
 Here is a list of the largest physical gold holders on earth who could theoretically engage in this type of operation:  https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040715/what-countries-have-largest-gold-reserves.asp

f9jryy,hariprem,Why I sold most of my Bitcoin and so should you.,"    Sorry Bitcoin Shills but Bitcoin is not a currency yet it is a speculative asset with a future maybe, a present in doubt , and a dubious past. Yes if Bitcoin were adopted and worth 3or four trillion market cap and the price stabilized and it might be a safe place to put your money but for now it is a speculative asset and it doesn't do so much that there is any reason to hold it in the present unless you think it's value will go up in the future ie a speculative asset. For now it is a multi-level marketing product that does almost nothing that other cryptos or stablecoins don't do just as well. So with the slowdown of the world economy people traveling less and less need to have a world currency Bitcoin price is bound to drop. Like all addicts you can stare at the charts all day and pray for that Rush when prices go parabolic . And like all speculative investments you can pray all day to get rich by doing nothing producing nothing . And maybe one day you will get rich. Or maybe one day you'll just be another lazy speculative dreamer.",1582674540,60,1

In the begging there was gold and silver as currency.

Home robbery was common, lotta people got their fingernails pulled out for gold.

Therefore banks.

Banks issued IUOs.

Home robbery was common, lotta people got their fingernails pulled out for IOUs.

Therefore trust with banks, KYC and ID etc. only issue small amounts of IOU not worth fingernail pulling.

People just started using the IOUs as trade.

There was demand for credit as always, banks gave credit.

Banks recognised no one ever really actually withdrew the gold.

Banks recognised no one had any idea how much gold was really in the vault if any.

Fractional reserve was invented with a modest ratio to limit risk.

Governments took control of the banking industry as it was corrupt and assumed the right the make up the IOUs (far more more liberal with the risk).

Fast forward to today.

The world begins to enter the phase of hyper bitcoinisation.

Home robbery was common, lotta people got their fingernails pulled out for bitcoin.

Therefore banks (storage of private keys).

Banks issued IUOs.

KYC and ID etc. had already reached an advanced level of evolution because computers.

People just started using the IOUs as trade.

There was demand for credit as always, banks gave credit.

Banks recognised no one ever really actually withdrew the bitcoin.

Everyone recognised how much bitcoin was really in the vault because computers.

Fractional reserve was already an excepted thing.

Governments previously had control of the banking industry but government became corrupt and gave the right the make up the IOUs to the banks.

We are now full circle.

In a very short period of time this created a neuvo rich and was deemed to be widely unfair akin to a massive pre-mine given the few early adopters and the resultant given financial disparity.

Bitcoin was banned and given a narrow trade-in window at massively reduced rates.

The global economy is so fucked the need for universal basic income is widely accepted ,global finance is in despair, food lines are endless worldwide, the fiat system has completely collapsed.

The bank of international settlements creates a global crypto currency, fully pre-mined and distributed to everyone on earth equally.

Each country creates their own second layer national crypto currency pegged to the base layer with fractional reserve parameter sovereignty.

The majority of world governments issue decrees to their population the right of seizure of the base currency.

Governments begin to enact haircuts to facility global trade.

The vast majority of the worlds population at any given point in time never really understood the details of what has changed, most of them do not recognise any difference.

Their crypto enable multisig RFID tags wallets open locked doors (most of the time).",1582666675,10,1

f9cx55,amatsukaze29,Coinbase: technical questions," My current understanding is that:

\- Coinbase is a custodial exchange that retains control over my private keys;

\- Transactions between Coinbase users happen off-chain and are reflected on an internal Coinbase ledger tracking which user owns what;

\- Coinbase owns a number of large wallets on-chain as one of the Bitcoin ""whales"" - presumably, a significant proportion of these Bitcoins are held in custody for its users.

What I need help understanding is:

\- What is the point of Coinbase ""wallets"" if transactions between Coinbase users are not reflected on the blockchain anyway. Are these actually wallets (i.e. a set of public and private keys)? If not, is the Coinbase wallet just marketing jargon for a claim I have against Coinbase for a certain number of Bitcoins, similar to a Paypal balance reflecting my right to X USD from Paypal?

\- How do transfers from Coinbase wallets to external wallets actually work? I understand that such transactions are reflected on-chain. Therefore, would Bitcoin move from a Coinbase ""omnibus"" wallet containing a pool of Bitcoins owned by various Coinbase users to a wallet under my control? If so, what is the point of Coinbase retaining custody of a wallet with my private keys, if this wallet does not actually hold any Bitcoin and transfers do not occur from this wallet?

\- How do transfers to Coinbase wallets from external wallets work? It appears I can obtain a public address from Coinbase that allows me to transfer funds onto my coinbase ""wallet"". Where does this money actually go on the blockchain? To the Coinbase omnibus wallet, or a separate wallet on the blockchain to which Coinbase holds my private keys?

f80a4s,SMB-10,Sim Swapped Beware,"I got Sim swapped this morning around 4 AM from California while I was asleep in Texas. This morning around 3:30 my sim was swapped by what i believe was a T Mobile employee with access to this function from home or from their work location.

I woke up this morning to No service which i thought was unusual, so i trouble shoot myself to no avail, i go to a store front just to be asked repeatedly if i switched the sim which started to aggravate me to the point where i refused their solution of buying a new sim card so i went to the next one down the road. She pulls up my account and calls the employee customer service which the first store didn’t even do, the tech mentions my sim was switched at 3:30 AM and bypassed the “go ahead” from me (which can only be done by a t mobile employee). we get it resolved at the store and i’m at a loss because i don’t know anybody who would have the capacity to do this to me. She mentions to check my other accounts to make sure they’re up to date and safe. First thing i do is check my main email which had also been compromised due to the 2 step factor being trumped by them getting my sim and entering through their own iphone. I get multiple emails with password changes and coinbase password reset, followed by receipts for conversions and then a lump sum payment to a bitcoin wallet.
Already submitted a ticket, but what else can i do besides changing passwords?

TLDR: got sim swapped in the middle of the night (by what i think was an employee of my phone company) and got my bit coin stolen. how they knew I had any is beyond me",1582411681,38,1

In these early days those comparisons are irrelevant.  Volatility and violent free market price discovery make them irrelevant. Bitcoin is like the earth back when it was still forming with meteorites raining down and volcanos everywhere constantly erupting creating an insanely volatile environment that couldn't harbour life, just like bitcoin can't yet harbour stable commerce.

Once speculation and store of value use cases have driven prices up to highs that represent the amount of wealth needed to facilitate global commerce life will emerge. Stability will form, skies will clear, the meteorites and volcanoes will turn dormant and the first signs of life will form. Commerce will emerge and evolve faster than you can imagine.

Then and only then will a ratio like the gold/bitcoin ratio tell us anything comprehensible. 

However, over time it is possible that in a few decades from now the gold/bitcoin ratio becomes the single most important financial metric on earth, maybe even as important as fed monetary policy is today, because we sure as hell won't be measuring bitcoin against fiat anymore.",1582396281,12,1

State authorities on a routine overnight patrol spotted and then arrested Collins with an estimated $2,171 of cannabis in his car. The man quickly earned himself a five-year jail sentence.

Nervous about having a ton of money tied up in a single wallet, Collins diversified in 2016 by splitting his 6,000 bitcoins across 12 newly created wallets,

And to further secure this fortune, Collins reportedly hid a piece of paper containing the access codes inside a fishing rod case at his home.

Now if that's a security mechanism, it just doesn't work : I went along with the address that was copied to receive funds (luckily not much) and didn't receive cause this address isn't mine.

So I tried with exodus wallet, manually copy the displayed address, but it wasn't valid so again I went along with an address that turn out to belong to someone else.

Now on exodus I believe you owe two addresses : a segwit and a legacy one (correct me)

So I took the second one (more conventional one that stars with a 1), manually copy it and it turned out to be valid and I received my money. But still I looked up the address that it copied and it stills belongs to someone else who used it 4 days ago.

Its high price prestige. The barrier to entry of owning a complete Bitcoin makes it somewhat of an elite club. Not everyone can own a Porsche or an island or a $10k coin.

\[insert reasons I didn't list.\]

That said, to put it mildly, the quality of information on the merits of owning Bitcoin is disappointing. Listening to all these Bitcoin Youtubers would make one think only an idiot would buy Bitcoin.

Maybe my Bitcoin purchase was a mistake. One of the most compelling reasons for me to buy Bitcoin was the wild notion that the world's wealthy and powerful elites have everything to gain with the status quo of the prevailing monetary system. And that the established cryptocurrencies are a disrupting innovation that has just begun to transform the financial landscape.

Am I the only one who hears all the senseless hype on one end, the bashing by financial titans on the other, then looks at the price history of Bitcoin, and who (in his confused inner Chris Farley voice) says ""What in the \[HECK\] was that all about !!!?!?!""",1582359602,49,1

It is in fact a loss of resources, maybe good now for hodl or speculation but not really simple to manage in case of real adoption and real economy.

It is quite scary to me, knowing that financial capabilities change if somebody die today and the keys get lost.

here's the problem:

Since the update to 1.6.0 of the Ledger Nano S I have no access to my different wallets.

If you are using Ledger Live 1.20.0 for Windows 10, you have access to the manager where you can install and uninstall the wallets. But if I want to access each wallet individually to send or receive something, the Ledger hangs.

&amp;#x200B;

It loads forever until it connects and at the 2nd step, when I want to access the wallet with the stick, I click on (open Wallet) and it automatically jumps back to ""open Wallet"".

Connected is checked, but he wants me to open the wallet again.

On the stick he shows me that he is ready.

Then it stays that way.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried the following solutions without success:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Ledger Live reinstalled (+ data deleted atAppData)

\- Ledger with the 24 words restored

\- other ledger + other cable tried 

\- tried another PC

World Bank launches 'pandemic bond' to tackle major outbreaks
LONDON (Reuters) - The World Bank has launched a “pandemic bond” to support an emergency financing facility intended to release money quickly to fight a major health crisis like the 2014 Ebola outbreak.

World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim delivers his speech during the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing, China May 14, 2017. REUTERS/Lintao Zhang/Pool
The catastrophe bond, which will pay out depending on the size of the outbreak, its growth rate and the number of countries affected, is the first of its kind for epidemics. It should mean money is disbursed much faster than during West Africa’s Ebola crisis.

Ebola spread across the region in the early months of 2014. Michael Bennett, head of derivatives and structured finance at the World Bank’s capital markets department, said that if the pandemic emergency financing facility (PEF) had existed in 2014, some $100 million could have been mobilised as early as July.

In reality, money did not begin to flow on this scale until three months later, by which time the number of deaths from Ebola had increased tenfold.

“In the end about 11,000 people died in that pandemic and it’s estimated that the cost to the countries most affected – Guinea, Liberia and Sierre Leone - was about $2.8 billion,” Bennett said.

The PEF will offer coverage to all countries eligible for financing from the International Development Agency (IDA), the arm of the World Bank dedicated to the world’s poorest countries.

It covers outbreaks of infectious diseases most likely to cause major epidemics, including pandemic influenza strains; coronaviruses, including SARS; filoviruses, which include Ebola and Marburg; plus others such as Crimean Congo fever, Rift Valley fever and Lassa fever.

Bennett said the PEF as a whole would provide more than $500 million of coverage against pandemics over the next five years. This includes today’s $425 million transaction, comprising $320 million raised through the bond market and $105 million through swaps transactions.

The transaction was oversubscribed by 200 percent, attracting interest from dedicated cat bond investors, asset managers, pension funds and endowments, the World Bank said.

For the pandemic bond, the World Bank will pay bondholders a coupon that replicates an insurance premium plus a funding spread, in return for a payout if the bond is triggered.

“If a trigger event occurs, instead of repaying the bond in full, some or all of the principal is transferred to the PEF trust fund,” Bennett said. “So essentially the investors are acting like insurance companies.”

Under the swaps transactions, the swaps counterparty pays out if a trigger event occurs.

“The objective of offering the risk in both forms is that the bonds and swaps appeal to different types of investors, and therefore … we are creating the broadest possible investor pool for this risk,” said Bennett. That helped drive down prices.

A replenishable cash window available from 2018 will provide funding for diseases that may not meet the activation criteria for the bond, whilst future donor commitments may be used to purchase additional coverage from the market.

Munich Re, which helped develop the insurance component of the PEF in conjunction with Swiss Re and catastrophe risk modeller AIR Worldwide, said pandemics were among the most likely uninsured risks to occur.

The annual global cost of moderately severe to severe pandemics is estimated at roughly $570 billion, or 0.7 percent of global income, the World Bank said.

fawb8g,Melkorious,Opinion: Bitcoin is not always an “uncorrelated asset”,"I have oftentimes read that Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset class.

Just to be clear for anyone not familiar - when I’m referencing “an uncorrelated asset”, I mean that Bitcoin does not/has not followed the other traditional equity markets, historically.  Just because the price of gold is rising, doesn’t mean that Bitcoin will rise for example.

That being said, I do believe that Bitcoin is correlated to the macro economic view - admittedly a convenient opinion considering how bitcoin has tumbled in recent days alongside the broader markets.

This got me thinking that there are certain cases where Bitcoin must follow the macro economic trend.  I believe we are definitely currently in one of those situations.

No figures to reference (this whole post is purely opinion based and should not be taken too seriously), but there must be a significant number of people who invest in Bitcoin with disposable income, or invest in addition to their traditional portfolios.

A global market downturn - not immediately and directly tied via the media to the incumbent banking system would/could cause many of these investors to sell their positions, whether to reposition themselves in the traditional equity markets, or simply from fear.

The difference here, is that this fear - something that has oftentimes moves the Bitcoin market independently, is now global.  As such, Bitcoin may have (temporarily) become a macro-economically-correlated asset class.  Just my 2 sats.

If there was anything of significance to take away from my thoughts here, it would be that we should never assume that Bitcoin is truly free from the economic models of the world.  In a way, the failing of the traditional economic system, the very system that Bitcoin has been trying to supplant, could be very detrimental to the health and prosperity of Bitcoin.

Ideally, Bitcoin needs to continue to flourish alongside the incumbent system, and only upon reaching critical mass in strength and market capitalization, see the decline and ultimately elimination of the aforementioned system.  Bitcoin needs the Central Banking system to survive...at least for the time being.

The fact that the FED is even considering to think about using monetary policy to counter the economic consequences caused by Corona is one of the most ludicrous statements I have heard in a long time. 

An actual, tangible event which leads to serious loss of productivity in meatspace (and therefore loss of value, at least temporarily, for economies/companies) immediately triggers a monetary intervention statement from the FED. In my opinion, this a telltale sign of the state of our current monetary system. For the FED, there's only one way forward left and they know it: growth at any and all costs.",1582879754,5,1

Pretty new, so I'm not sure if it was Dash or some other system where a small privileged minority owned almost all the power. That does not sound like decentralization to me. Also, this:

&amp;#x200B;

 ""One supposed security guarantee of a blockchain system is “decentralization.” If copies of the blockchain are kept on a large and widely distributed network of nodes, there’s no one weak point to attack, and it’s hard for anyone to build up enough computing power to subvert the network. But recent work by Sirer and colleagues shows that neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum is as decentralized as you might think. They found that the top four bitcoin-mining operations had more than 53 percent of the system’s average mining capacity per week. By the same measure, three Ethereum miners accounted for 61 percent.""

exa2bu,thisisalie4,"Bitcoin ""rehab"" for cutting-edge therapies? Make the world a better place?","Hi everybody.

Bitcoin's looming wealth is a gift  we are hopefully going to be granted. This will also be the biggest transfer of funds from the old generation to the new generation. Well, the old generation has always been well known because of frauds and offshore accounts as their ultimate goal, fuelling a deranged capitalism with the main purpose of hiding money in the Virgin Islands and maybe shelling it out in the most stupid and addictive ways (guess how many...) ,basically creating nothing and ruining other people lives,ultimately this to affect the poorest (like in 2008 crisis). Capitalism is a good thing if you reinvest back in the real world the resources you have generated, otherwise it could be just a ponzi scheme. Socialism has also its cons where the service is not enough then corruption kicks is. Anyway, there is capitalism in the western worlds, hence just try to make the most of it.  I'm wondering if now that the new generation will be gifted with this wealth coming from bitcoin ,could anybody be interesting in using it wisely. I'm trying to imagine if the youngsters could be better than their predecessors and as result, be able to build a better world. Although it's plenty of lambo dreams and all of the wild material things as i can see out there, i'm pretty sure we can also find some wise people among bitcoiners here.  Plus, the latest US study shows that happiness stays in earning 70k per year, more or less than this makes us miserable. In short, money should be just a tool and if you don't believe so, then you are the tool. Coming to the idea, this is simple, building the first rehab in Europe where you can actually heal from a lot of mental health conditions like ptsd,depression etc... In a nutshell, giving something back to the world as a service, while obviously earning from it. You have to know that in the US they are legalizing those therapies on a larger scale , to be put in the market in 2021. Check it out on maps (dot) org or google: maps mdma ptsd for instance . As far as we know, the route to legalization in Europe is going to take another 6 or 7 years , due to the heavier bureaucracy . The idea is to set this rehab in a micro-state which are legally out of the EU like san marino ,liechtenstein,andorra or monaco  ,where (as it's written in the sovereign individual, the book) it will be easier and quicker to roll out the US findings into their laws, because they are smaller and can set their internal laws as they wish. This way will be possible to avoid the long waiting time necessary for an EU approval. Nonetheless, people could travel to the clinic from all over europe in a short time,  thanks to central position of these states in the eurozone.  How do you know that this work? I'm a doctor and i've worked with trauma. I know there have been already some crypto funds like the pineapple fund which contributed to this non-profit ""maps (dot) org"" and have made the fda approval possible. Well, we miss all of that here in Europe. We sit at point zero here, therefore we need action. Moreover, i can imagine this project not like a fund but like a proper company where the contributors will be members of the board and will hold their personal key of the multisig wallet of the company, while everything will be notarized.

Everyday we get a report of the trades and the total profit made. What is also a plus point for me is that the currency used is Bitcoin.

TLDR: The Ultranet, a new type of marketplace that is fully-decentralized, private, and censorship-resistant with its own native hyper-deflationary cryptocurrency called Ultra (aka ""digital oil""), will be launching on **February 25th at 9am PST**.

# Motivation

Today, the world’s major technology platforms (Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Baidu, Facebook, WeChat, etc) are controlled by a relatively small group of people with relatively limited oversight. As a result, virtually all of our information is owned by people who may not have our best interests at heart, and the basic rules that govern virtually everything we do online get decided through opaque processes that we have very little transparency on and input into. Moreover, the owners of these platforms can exhibit an unprecedented amount of sway over our political process not only through traditional lobbying but also through their control over us as their users. Thus we are left with a situation in which what we say, what we see, what we hear, what we buy, and, if the trend continues, what we can and can't do with our lives, is ultimately out of our control, with little indication that things will change anytime soon. Is a world where a handful of platform oligarchs rule over us the kind of world we want to live in? Or could there perhaps be a better way to organize society’s technical infrastructure?

# Summary and Links

The Ultranet is the peoples' answer to the platform oligarchy.

* **Summary:** The Ultranet is first and foremost a decentralized private marketplace with a native cryptocurrency called Ultra (aka ""digital oil"") that can be purchased through a private decentralized exchange embedded in the Ultranet software. The Ultranet is designed such that each user who runs the software downloads and stores a cryptographically-secured copy of all of the listings, orders, ratings, and all other marketplace data through a novel concept we introduce called a ""block pool."" This means that as long as a single node somewhere in the world is running the Ultranet software, all data, including all listings and all reputation data, will be preserved. This is in stark contrast to virtually all platforms that exist today, which are subject to censorship of listings and/or outright take-down, the latter of which results in all reputation data being lost. Indeed, we are not aware of any marketplace that exists today, centralized or otherwise, that offers a comparable level of censorship-resistance and privacy (the Ultranet is pseudo-anonymous like Bitcoin), and the Ultranet achieves this while maintaining full feature parity and user experience parity with existing centralized marketplaces. The Ultranet also introduces Ultra, a hyper-deflationary cryptocurrency that is burned every time an order is placed on the system and by merchants in order to promote their listings, resulting in exponentially increasing scarcity over time (i.e. hyper-deflation). We refer to Ultra as ""digital oil"" because it is steadily burning away over time, unlike nearly all existing cryptocurrencies which do not actively burn or deflate over time (including Bitcoin and Ethereum).
* **White paper:** You can read the white paper to learn more about how it works here: [np.ultranet.one/white\_paper.pdf](np.ultranet.one/white_paper.pdf)
* **Subreddit:** You can join the Ultranet subreddit to ask questions here: [r/Ultranet](np.reddit.com/r/Ultranet)
* **Code:** You can review the code [here](np.gitlab.com/sarahc0nn0r/ultranet)
* **Launch date:** The Ultranet launches on **February 25th at 9am PST** and you can sign up to be notified here: [np.ultranet.one](np.ultranet.one)

# Features

Below are its main features:

* It offers a higher level of privacy and censorship-resistance than any marketplace platform that exists today.
* It is fully decentralized and pseudo-anonymous like Bitcoin and everything is generally end-to-end encrypted.
* As long as a single node somewhere in the world is running, all data, including all listings and reputation data, is preserved.
* This is made possible through a new concept we introduce in the paper called a “block pool.”
* It comes packaged with a rich graphical user interface that provides a user experience that is on-par with existing non-decentralized, non-private alternatives (and that we think is superior in many ways).
* The software includes a built-in decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platform, a built-in decentralized messaging platform, and a hyper-deflationary cryptocurrency called Ultra.
* The decentralized exchange embedded in its software allows any user to seamlessly exchange Bitcoin for Ultra without involvement from any third parties, a feature made possible by a new concept we introduce in the paper called “interchange” (Monero can also be used).
* The complexity of the decentralized exchange mechanism is completely abstracted away from the user, making the experience feel identical to depositing and exchanging coins on a centralized exchange.
* The messaging platform is end-to-end encrypted and fully-decentralized.
* Ultra, the cryptocurrency native to the Ultranet platform, is hyper-deflationary in the long run (much more so than Bitcoin in fact), and can power a network effect to bootstrap usage of the platform.
* We refer to Ultra as “digital oil” because, unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, it is constantly “burning” away over time through commissions as users make purchases, thus making it more and more scarce.
* These features are implemented on a new type of blockchain written entirely from-scratch in Go.
* In the paper we also present a proposal that uses the decentralized exchange concept to scale blockchains to thousands of transactions per second without compromising on decentralization or censorship-resistance.
* The Ultranet is completely open-source, which means that everything from the UI to how listings are ranked is collaboratively modifiable and upgradable. As such, through the power of global collaboration, the hope is that Ultranet can become the first ""Decentralized Platform Monopoly.""",1580755233,2,1

I have this thought, in the current currency, the value of money deceases as time goes by hence ""forces"" people to use their money in some kind of business or investment. Which creates jobs and promote circulation of money.

In bitcoin, your money gets more valuable as time goes by so it incentivice someone not to use their money which makes nothing for the world. Hoarding money even lowers the supply which makes it more valuable. That looks bad to me but I might be missing something.",1580748628,23,1

After that, two months, no one answered me in the ticket.

About two weeks ago, Paola Balzano responded to the ticket, which asked me for verification via Skype. I gave my skype contact and I began to be ignored again. 

after a month of waiting, I went through skype verification. I showed there my face, my documents, my account and trading operations.

Then they began to ignore me again and are still ignoring. The last answer was 10 months ago.

Is this behavior normal for the exchange? Block your account for trading and do not answer in tickets! I have already lost a lot of money because of the difference in rates, because I could not make a trading operation on time. Trading on my account does not work.

**First**, lightning as a payment mechanism will proliferate with every point of sale terminal and every banking wallet app able to send from and receive to a lightning invoice. The world will use lightning as the standard for transaction and transfer processing.

**Disrupted**: Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover, alipay, wechat pay, paypal, transferwise, worldremit, western union, SWIFT, and similar companies of this nature.

**Second**, as the world settles on using lightning as the global standard to process the worlds transactions and transfers it will simultaneously (like a Trojan Horse) make every point of sale terminal and every banking wallet app capable of receiving bitcoin. This will mean bitcoin can be spent anywhere and sent to anyone even if the recipient has no idea what bitcoin is. This will increase the demand globally for holding bitcoin directly instead of using bank accounts forcing banks around the world to offer Bitcoin accounts in order to keep customers. 

**Disrupted**: Bank of China, HSBC, JP Morgan, Chase, BNP Paribas, Bank of America, Credit Agricole, and similar deposit taking institutions of this nature that do not adopt bitcoin. 

**Third**, as the move away from banks occurs and the smart banks adopt bitcoin accounts in order to survive we will see demand for fiat decline and demand for bitcoin rise. This will lead to a dramatic rise in inflation creating a self reinforcing feedback loop that acts as a vortex. People adopting bitcoin to escape inflation will in the process of doing this create even more inflation, until the inevitable outcome of a catastrophic collapse in demand for fiat globally occurs.

**Disrupted**: US federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, Swiss National Bank, Bank of Canada, Reserve Bank of Australia, International Monetary Fund, Bank for International Settlements, and similar entities of this nature around the world.

At this point the world will converge on one fair, sound, and politically neutral money, **Bitcoin**, and one free, instant, and politically neutral payment system, **Lightning**.",1580735665,4,1

eys1ou,psionides,Trading Bitcoin for fiat in the EU without KYC,"This might sound like an ad, but I swear I just randomly found this…

I've been trying to find exchanges and services which let you exchange Bitcoin for fiat without full KYC, and especially in the recent months it's been getting harder and harder. All the places that previously used to work (e.g. Kraken) stopped working recently. I never really tried to hide my identity on exchanges - it's almost impossible when fiat is involved anyway - and I used to be verified in a couple of places. But I'm just extremely uncomfortable sending my ID scans, selfies and who knows what else to some web service, which will surely store it forever, and might lose it later in some hack, and suddenly some teenager is taking a credit in my name using this info. For various reasons I also don't want to use the peer-to-peer exchanges where you trade directly with a random person.

And one day I come across this: [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/edge-wallet-partners-with-bity-to-offer-non-kyc-fiat-exchanges](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/edge-wallet-partners-with-bity-to-offer-non-kyc-fiat-exchanges) 

I tried it 2 times so far and it seems to work fine. The iOS app itself is shit in terms of UX (the top navigation bar scrolls together with the page, FFS…), but I got the transfers to my bank account, and I got them surprisingly quickly (sent BTC in the evening, got euros in the afternoon on the next day).

Here's more info: [https://support.edge.app/support/solutions/folders/8000087797](https://support.edge.app/support/solutions/folders/8000087797). It works with SEPA transfers, both ways, and the limit is apparently €5000 per day (!). They take around 1% fee, which I think is fairly good for a service of this kind (ATM fees are much higher). I don't know what law tricks they pulled, since they launched this recently when everyone else is restricting everything, but it might have something to do with being located in Switzerland I guess.

Anyway, just wanted to share this since there are probably more people looking for services like this. Any catches I'm not seeing?

(Note: this is obviously not helpful if you actually want to hide your identity, since your name is right there on the bank account - in that case, ATM or face to face trades are your only option. This works only if you're worried about identity theft like I am.)",1580831648,35,1

My plan:

I'll try out Compound and one or two DEXes, but would also like to buy some tokens, hoping it will be a good long term investment. First ideas:

\- buy a bit Maker and a bit Kava to join the governance club for stablecoins

\- buy a collateral token: Synthetix

Question: Is this a good approach? Is there any platform that I definitely should check out to not miss the fun? Do you think the tokens I mentioned are solid or would you rather get other ones?

I'm also wondering which is the best use of my BTC for DeFi (doesn't seem possible to use it as collateral, or is it?)-",1581017105,4,1

Screenshot of the account lock screen: [http://prnt.sc/qygpyk](http://prnt.sc/qygpyk) I wrote in support, but no one answered my request. During February 4, 5 and 6, I continued to send requests (36 tickets in total), but the support service ignores my messages.

In connection with these actions by Coinbase, I have a personal opinion that Coinbase is not going to open access to my funds for me. Ignoring my requests to the support Service about the reasons for blocking, I regard as a mockery and humiliation of my dignity.  I warn everyone who has Coinbase accounts about fraudulent activities on this site. If you have a Coinbase account you are at risk:

1. Your account may be blocked at any time for no reason.

2. Coinbase support does not work and will not help you.

My guess is that if bitcoin is considered a stable deflationary investment, detached from human error and corruption (like stocks), then people will put their money on bitcoin instead of taking huge loans to buy a house. Even if the bank goes down, you still have your bitcoin.
Less people taking loans to buy houses means lower prices for houses.

f0h234,Thesearchoftheshite,My BTC adventure,"So this is more a story of an opportunity lost than a story of regret. 

But, I do regret this at least a bit. 

I heard of Bitcoin around 2009 to 2010. The coins were around 50 dollars when I first read an article on them and they fluctuated up and down from there. 

My first experience was mtgox and then coinbase. I made an account and would buy 20 bucks worth of coin at a time. See, I used the coin to buy music from Russian sites for 10 cents a song roughly instead of a dollar here. So I'd spend that 20 on a few albums and then reload it whenever I'd think of new mp3's to buy. 

Well after around 5 or 6 albums I decided I was set on music for a while and I just left 20 bucks on coinbase just to see what happened. Well, I forgot about it. 

At that time the coin was around $80 for one, then shortly after it was $100 for one. I really wanted to buy one whole coin, but that would have been a third of my paycheck at the time and I just couldn't afford to gamble it. 

As I  said, I forgot about the coin completely for like 6 months. 

Another article popped up about how bitcoin was shooting through the roof and so I checked on it. My 1/8th of a coin netted me $140.  The rumor mill was out that it was surely tanking soon so I sold it when one coin was worth around $1400.

I then took that extra $120 and enjoyed a full tank of gas and a night out or two. I figured a reinvestment wouldn't be worth it as it was too much for one coin and forgot about it again.  

It tanked for a week to like $800 and I thought good job to me! Patting myself on the back. 

Then it hit 4k, 6k, 8k, 14k, 20k. 

That 20 bucks would have netted me 5k if I had just let it ride. And if I had just managed to buy one coin I'd have paid cash for my next vehicle.  

This lesson reminds me alot of people's skepticism of Microsoft and the people who missed an opportunity. The point being, always let a small amount ride and see. Take the risk!

I made a huge return on my investment. I had 140 dollars I didn't have before. 

But hey, it could have been A LOT more.",1581110196,29,1

Surely all that matters is the high, the low, and some sense of the average (either mean or median). Possibly the interquartile range could be useful as well, but I'm not sure.

How would he go about doing this and maintaining possession of the shit forks (to sell of course) and safely transferring ownership of funds to a new storage option.

f1aivn,penguin4111,Will the Halving Create a Drop in Network Hash Rate and Security?,"Currently, miners receive 12.2 btc plus transaction fees, to be reduced to 6.25 btc plus transaction fees this year. This would naturally mean miners will lose profitability and many may leave the network I would assume, *unless* the drop in 6.25 BTC is dwarfed by what miners make in transaction fees each block. 

To calculate this, if I assume an average of $0.65 fees per transaction (source:  [https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#1y](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#1y) ), and the current average transactions per block of 2,300 (source:  [https://blockgeeks.com/guides/bitcoin-halving/](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/bitcoin-halving/) ), then that results in $1,495 per block from fees, or \~0.15 btc right now. Compared to 6.25 btc, 0.15 btc is nothing. If correct, this would imply that the *vast* majority of miner income is from block rewards. With profitability effectively cut in half, the hash rate should fall by half, or at least until enough miners leave that it becomes profitable again (I assume half, but I don't know). Transaction fees would need to be on the order of 42x what they are now to have the same block rewards for miners, which would not happen. Am I missing something, or is this a huge potential issue? Especially long term, fees will need to be *very* high to provide incentive to enough miners to keep the network safe, which could only happen with smaller blocks or much larger transaction volume.",1581263995,19,1

https://preview.redd.it/xaecvljrkvf41.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0523d8b50bb28013ef354005e0dd17476fbaa16e

Blockchain technology profoundly changes how businesses operate and are structured. Getting involved in blockchain may appear optional however, it’s more of a subtle necessity as every growing economy will eventually embrace this technology in the near future. Secure data transfer is something that we’ve all been looking forward to for a long period of time and it’s been a major challenge to which blockchain now provides a solution.

Thus, getting involved should not even be the point of discussion, as whether we take hold of this opportunity now or later, or maybe through consumer driven applications, it is most definite that adoption of blockchain is non-negotiable. At some point in time, you are definitely going to be very much involved in the technology or risk being among the modern-day primitives. Eventually, the blockchain will be so ingrained in everything that it will constitute our everyday living. The same could be said of the internet; it was difficult to figure out how the internet worked way back then, but now everyone just uses the internet.

**What is Blockchain?**

It is funny how the technology seems so complex, yet its name feels so simple; “blockchain”. At its most basic level, blockchain is literally just a chain of blocks, but not in the traditional sense of those words. When we use the words “block” and “chain” in this context, we are actually talking about digital information **(block)** stored in a public database **(chain).** “Blocks” on the blockchain are made up of digital pieces of information and they have three specific parts:

* Blocks store information about transactions like the date, time, and dollar amount of your most recent purchase from a friend.
* Blocks store information about who is participating in transactions. It would record your name along with that of your friend but instead of using your actual names, the block only records your purchase without any identifying information except a unique “digital signature” which is more like an alias/username.
* Blocks store information that distinguish them from other blocks. Much like you and I have names to distinguish us from one another, each block stores a unique code called a “hash” that allows us to tell it apart from every other block. Let’s say your friend (Bola) who you transacted with at first, is not online to sell the same item to you and moments later, you wanted to get something similar. You then decided to buy from Bolu this time. Even though the details of your new transaction would look nearly identical to your earlier purchase in terms of price and quantity, we can still easily identify which purchase came from Bola and Bolu not just using the time factor, but also because of their unique codes (Hash ID).

A single block on the blockchain can actually store up to 1 MB of data depending on the size of the transactions. This means that a single block can house a few thousand transactions (between you and Bola and even Bolu and many other friends of yours) under one roof.

**What To Note About The Blockchain**

When a block stores new data it is added to the blockchain. Blockchain, as its name suggests, consists of multiple blocks joined together. There are four things that will have to occur to validate a single block;

* A transaction must occur between two parties i.e. you and Bola.
* That transaction must be verified. Vetting data, just like in all other traditional systems is carried out to confirm the details of the purchase. It includes the transaction’s time, dollar amount, and participants. The only difference here is that this vetting is not carried out by any central authority but by a network of computers connected together like a union. This way transparency is promoted.
* That transaction must be stored in a block. After vetting, you are sure that the verdict is trustworthy because the computer is only capable of true or false statements. Think of it as a continuous assessment; if you pass, you get into a new class which is the block.
* That block must be given a hash. It’s like your certificate to show the successful completion of your continuous assessment. With this, the block is added to the chain of blocks. At this point, you relate it to a recent graduate who is ready to be deployed into the labour market.

When that new block is added to the blockchain, it becomes publicly available for anyone to view; even you. Just like when that graduate begins to walk around with a brown file, looking for work, everyone can easily tell that he is a job seeker. In our next article, we will define the kinds of blockchains that are available i.e. the Private and the Public blockchains as well as some examples of where they are implemented.

**Blockchain- An Innovation For The Future**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o7dacbyskvf41.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40c2be94d2a17f5d2c9da2ff334b8eb800e56de8

Sometimes, becoming obsolete is great for innovation but not great for the consumers of the innovation themselves. This, at some point in the not-too-far-away future, will be the tale of those who have chosen to shut their eyes to the blockchain technology. Predictions about world economies and businesses moving to blockchain-based infrastructures are already becoming a statement of fact with recent interests coming from China and Russia and others.

It is therefore very pertinent to stress the need to harness the decentralized opportunities made available by this technology. What better way to start than learning everything you need to know from Telos4Africa? We are a major promoter of Telos Foundation, one of the best blockchain protocols out there powered by block.one. In a bid to make learning and community building more personal, we are putting together the Telos4Africa Blockchain Podcast.

The podcast will be an educative series where we, together with hands-on industry experts in the economy, would seek to expose the African community to the basics of blockchain and cryptocurrency as a thriving industry in the world today. We will painstakingly answer all possible questions that may arise from any such conversations about the blockchain within the Telos4Africa community. It will bring to bear, the benefits of building on the fastest, highly scalable, cost effective and eco-friendly blockchain protocol on the planet.

f1xun4,BadBadgerChef,Another halving explanation - Why the halving will cause the next Bitcoin bull run.,"The halving will cause another Bitcoin bull run because that's what the halving is designed to do. And it'll do it again and again and again every four years. We've seen this happen twice before with the previous 2 halvings. There's no reason to expect anything different for the upcoming halving this may. 

The halving cuts Bitcoin's inflation rate in half. This drives scarcity, which in turn drives a higher and higher price for Bitcoin. 

This spectacular performance on investment draws more and more attention, which drives more and more people to learn about Bitcoin and realize what Bitcoin is. Once people understand enough about Bitcoin, they invest. 

Then the network effect kicks in and drives the price parabolic. Rinse and repeat on a 4 year cycle. This may will be the third halving. It's almost a religious holiday for Bitcoiners. 

Why does the halving increase the price? It's because cutting the creation rate of new Bitcoins reduces the sell side pressure. If the buy side pressure remains the same, the price will necessarily rise. The rising price usually draws more attention and more new investors. 

This, combined with the fact that there's 7.7 billion people and only 21 million BTC, means that the price of Bitcoin will continue to go parabolic.

Just imagine what the price of Bitcoin will be in 12 years after 3 more Bitcoin halvings. 

Cryptocurrency is all about security. What secures cryptocurrency? The hash rate is the most important factor. Which cryptocurrency has the highest hash rate? Bitcoin and its not even close. https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate

Bitcoin is the most ultimate form of wealth storage ever invented. Control of Bitcoin is so diversified that changing Bitcoin is nearly impossible, unless the vast majority of the community agrees. It's harder than removing a president through impeachment. 

Bitcoin is a platform and it evolves slowly over time. Ungraded are fully discussed and tested before being implemented. Bitcoin is the internet of money. It's only ever going to grow and the price will reflect that. Bitcoin is the future. 

So happy halvings day to you this may.",1581372382,11,0

Hey Reddit!

There is a little paradox. On one hand, everyone is saying you should hodl Bitcoin and never spend it on your whims as when the mass adoption comes, it will be worth times more than it is now. On the other hand, it’s generally agreed that the mass adoption will only be reached when people should start using Bitcoin for everyday purchases. On top of that, for small purchases BTC fees could be too costly and Lightning isn’t widespread yet, so it’s easier to just pay in fiat.

Some merchants have also noticed this problem and suggested a compromise — a discount on crypto purchases. Usually, a modest discount of 5–10% is enough to both cover a buyer the transaction fee and slice off a couple of bucks as a bonus.

Of course, [Accepted Here](http://acceptedhere.io/), being an aggregator of companies accepting crypto, wants to see more business accepting crypto, and help those who already accept thrive and find new customers. That’s why we decided to create this weekly discount digest. Hopefully, it will become a tradition and we will always find some more merchants for the next week’s one.

f1urdy,waraxx,Lightning isn't enough to solve the scaling problem.,"Hello, I'd like to discuss the scaling issue that bitcoin faces. I have only thought about this breefly and I realize that I've probably missed a few things. This have been discussed in other topics similar to this but I don't think that any of those topics really answered the question other than ""you never know what the future holds"". 

I know that lightning haven't claimed to be the silver bullet for the scaling problem. But I think lot of people view it that way. I belive that lightning is a part of the solution to the problem at hand but we have to realize what that technology doesn't solve if we want to solve the scaling problem entirely. 

Even in the most kind estimations the transaction rate is not enough. 

Let's assume that one billion people each use one transaction per month to refill their lightning channel which I feel is a fair assumption to make. That would equate to almost 400 transactions per seconds. 

Now, I firmly belive that the fixed blocksize of 1MB is one of the things that makes bitcoin beautiful and increasing it to a size that would solve this solution is absolutely  not an option. 

So what tech and/or concepts could be the solution to this issue? 

I hear a lot about parallel chains or ofchain solutions.",1581360367,44,1

My name is Fuseini Alhassan I hail from Tamale South Sub-Metro Area of Northern Region of Ghana. I attended the University for Development Studies between 2014 - 2018, where I obtained a Bachelor degree in Development Planning (Honours).

&amp;#x200B;

[Poultry Farm](https://preview.redd.it/x9ml8mmst4g41.jpg?width=425&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ceb5ee1b15399f32560d6bc2b53028835820c02)

**Background of the proposal** 

My business is poultry farming—this is the commercial rearing of chickens and other birds for their meat and production of eggs. The poultry industry has become one of the most efficient producers of protein for human consumption, in response to public concern over dietary fat; poultry has become the popular substitute for beef and other types of meat.

My business is basically egg production and chicken rearing. The demand for eggs and chicken on cities has become more prevalent than ever before. The increasing consumers demand for quality eggs and meat products result in the development of eggs products in our societies today. The growth of the urban population in the Cities of Ghana, directly influence the consume goods and services of all kind. It is realized on a preliminary observation that eggs are always in demand round the year. Egg is obtained from birds and hence bird production is a profitable activity. This activity has the potential to provide regular income and employment opportunity.

My business will be done using modern production techniques in an excellent environmental control and with quality management. The environmental impact from my poultry farming and egg production operation will be minimal. We will do everything to keep the operation as environmentally conscious as possible. The crates that will be utilized for packaging our eggs will be made out of recyclable material instead of chemically altered plastics.

**Objectives of the proposal** 

· To supply Eggs and Chicken internationally by the end of 2022

· To create employment avenue to people within the region and beyond

· To increase the consumption of local produce Eggs and Chicken at the end of 2021

· To Boost the local economy and contribute to the economic growth of nations.

· To become the self-producer of my own animal feed 

· To create and register a poultry and ruminants farm to raise local breads by the close of 2020

**Things to consider in setting up a Poultry Farm**

Whenever the construction of a new Poultry Farm is envisaged, a plan to overcome possible defects is recommended. It is of vital importance to draw up a plan giving the greatest efficiency to the entire Poultry farm in the Region by considering some factors such;

· **Proposed Location of the farm:** The Poultry Farm would be located in an area completely separated from any other plant or building. This is because, the birds actually finds it difficult living in an area polluted by noise every day. Thus, isolated site shall be acquired devoid of frequent human intrusion. This will be located in the south-eastern part of Tamale, a capital town of northern region.

· **Commercial Considerations and Target Market:** The first and the most important consideration is the Eggs supply follow by Meat products to consumers.

Naturally, the target market are those who are the end consumer of commercial poultry farm produce and also those who benefits from the business value chain of the poultry farming and egg production industry is all encompassing; it is far reaching. Every household consumes produce from commercial poultry farms be it chicken or egg. So also almost all hotels, provision stores and fast restaurants sell chicken and eggs. In essence a commercial poultry farmer should be able to sell his or her chicken and eggs to as many people as possible.

In view of that, we have positioned our business to attract consumers of chickens and eggs not just in the Ghana alone but also other parts of the world. We have conducted our market research and survey and we will ensure that we meet and surpass the expectations we set for the business.

· **The Socioeconomic Impact:** the impact of this business will be of high benefit to the socio-economic development of my community. In that, it will increase the supply of eggs and chicken in the market. Also, it will also provide both direct and indirect employment to the people.

Below is a list of the people and businesses that will market our chickens and eggs;

* Households
* Individuals
* Hotels
* Restaurants
* Fast food eateries

· Provision stores

**Why the Motivation**

My motivation for this project is to create new and significant employment opportunities: increase the state Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and per-capita income, as well as improve the living standards and economic well-being of the citizens thus given back to the society as a priority. 

Also, the rate at which unemployment grows in Ghana takes people with entrepreneurship and risk loving minds to identify and exploit the available opportunities to be able to create and employ themselves and others who could not explore the available opportunities. Graduate unemployment grows every day and as a graduate I need not to add to the numbers but rather identify and take advantage of opportunities available to me. The Agriculture sector in Ghana is poorly developed and needs more hands from both private and public sectors to expand. In order to reduce poverty, hunger and create jobs in Ghana. 

Since I have graduated from the University, I have engage in part-time employment without a permanent job, I have work with development partners in providing out the best possible information. The gains of our business to my community and me include:

To provide job opportunities, first to myself, and to others that will be employed in the farm (that is, both direct and indirect employment). This we will do through training of the individuals on the latest technology used in poultry farming and egg production

To produce, market, and supply eggs and dietary protein to the market/public. This will help in the process of achieving food sustainability in our community and the country at large

We will also provide manure to farmers from the bird droppings that will be produce from our farm. As the bird damp/droppings from the birds are used as manure/fertilizer in the farm. Thus, this will help in increasing the level of food production in our community and the country too.

**Management and Staff of the Business**

Management of the business will comprise me and my two friends. I have completed university for development studies in 2018. I read Bachelor of Science in Planning. I also involved the services of my two friends Mr Baba Lukman and Mr Awaki W. Sulemana they also completed University for Development Studies in 2018. We also look forward to constitute a board for the business when it expands in five years’ time.

**Financing of the Business**

No matter how fantastic your business idea might be, if you don’t have the required money to finance the business, the business might not become a reality. Finance is a very important factor when it comes to starting a business such as commercial poultry farming. No doubt raising startup capital for a business might not come cheap, but it is a task that an entrepreneur must go through.

The action I intend to take to achieve my goals towards the success of my project include:

· Keep 1000 birds poultry farming operation producing eggs 

· Produce 2,000 eggs daily from our poultry farm operation

· Established markets for all the eggs produced in our farms

· Maintain a good line of equipment in good operating condition

· Operate good facilities for handling/keeping birds and eggs

· Increase farm gate sales of eggs by developing a brand name for ourselves

· Improve packaging and promotional activities

**Budget Activities of the Business**

**Activities**  Amount 

· Acquisition of land $1000

· Construction of poultry pan $800

· Poultry equipment $800

· Acquisition of day old and pullet (1000 birds) $2000

· Feeding for 18 weeks $1800

· Vaccination and general medical care $600

· Transportation $200 

**Total**  **$7200**

f1rygt,simonmalaga,Dawn in Malaga (Spain). Looking forward to spread knowledge here in the South,"Hello, guys

I took this pic this morning while I was walking my dog and listening to the person who taught me all, Mr. Antonopoulos.

I´ve been trying to reach an original idea regarding how to spread **Bitcoin** and all knowledge I´ve managed to get over last two years and then saw this beautiful dawn.

Through this picture, I´d like to collect as many Sats as possible and donate them to a good cause (I´ve been thinking of visiting my daughter´s school and doing some talk and giving those sats at the end of the class, to start with) After all, Bitcoin is going to be used mostly for todays youngsters. Let me know if you have a better idea.

I´m currently taking Andreas´ MOOC course so, at least, I´d show some formal background when introducing myself in public.

I´ll let you all know the outcome of my presentation and you´ll be able to track transactions (the whole amount I collect will be split into a bunch of Sats each one).

We currently are 1.3m members in this subreddit so investing a few Sats won´t hurt and I´m willing to repeat these talks if I get good feedback!

Will you support my idea? PLEASE, LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF IT.

Looking forward see how it works!

Thanks!!!

PS: I´ve just read the Bitcoin Rules. Honestly, I do not  need those Sats so, Mods, feel free to delete my post If you consider so. What I try to do is to contribute to BITCOIN success. I´m not a programmer and, so far, my full node has been my only contribution to the ecosystem.",1581348922,0,1

Asking for support by E-mail i have got the following answer :  &lt;i&gt;Thank you do much for your email.I am so sorry about the DEB withdrawal issue, we are negotiated the problem with project teams now.Once we fix the issue, we will open the withdrawal, thank you so much for your kindly support. &lt;/i&gt;So I had a bad feeling about this and started to ask for more question by mail and in TG chat with the support team that they came up with this answer :&lt;i&gt;Sorry to inform you that your account 496753 was blacklisted due to your account have triggered the risk control system.BTW, you made Withdrawal of 1069012.32952401 DEB on 2nd Oct, 2019, this withdrawal haven't deduct from your account.

So at this moment I find myself with my account blacklisted and with not access to it and the coins stolen . At this moment the TG support is telling me this :

BitOffer Exchange, \[10.02.20 12:51\]George, our technical team said that your account has been attacked on 2rd Oct.

B. George, \[10.02.20 12:53\]i will do KYC and change the password , but you guys need to unlock it

BitOffer Exchange, \[10.02.20 13:05\]George, due to your account has been attacked on 2rd, Oct, so the withdrawal of 1069012.32952401 DEB token haven't been deduct from your account.

f1r71g,1UazZNfbWi,Help required to establish bitcoin is money,"I have created a new site [https://bitcoinismoney.info/](https://bitcoinismoney.info/) and I need the community's help. I am collecting and collating links that refer to bitcoin as money rather than a digital asset.

Moneys/monies (including cash) are not usually subject to taxes when they are transacted. Digital assets however tend be treated in the same way as stocks or shares and are usually subject to Capital Gains Tax and may be regulated as securities.

This argument is not about avoiding tax—it is about the principle that exchanging one money for another (including non-government money) should not be taxed. When bitcoin is exchanged for another money (dollars, pounds, yen or another crypto-currency) no tax should be payable. This principle is already accepted by tax authorities for government monies (unless you are a professional trader paying tax on your profits). Taxes on non-government money are unfair and will stifle innovation, and prevent a currency of the internet

Unfortunately, (largely due to a lack of experience of a digital asset that can also function as a money), governments are coming down on the side of bitcoin being like a stock or share. This is patently absurd as bitcoin does not pay any dividends or act like a stock. It has been done to adapt new technology into an old rulebook.

Satoshi’s vision of bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash will never be realised if it is treated as a tradeable stock or security.

Please can you send me your references? We want links or references to:

* Articles, Web pages etc. in which bitcoin is described or written about as money
* Jurisdictions where bitcoin is treated as money
* Institutions or banks that regard bitcoin as money
* Submissions to legal or regulatory bodies that argue bitcoin is money
* Rulings or adjudications that bitcoin is money
* Significant money-like transactions involving bitcoin﻿
* Significant money-like systems involving non-government tokens (for example in-game)
* Books on bitcoin as money
* Academic research on bitcoin as money including definitions of money, cash or currency

and

* Reasoned arguments that bitcoin is NOT money (for analysis)

Any feedback on the site would also be welcome. Thanks for your help in advance.",1581345607,5,1

One that you do not need to download the full blockchain like BitcoinCore, but still have your seed or private keys.

I have looked at that EXODUS wallet and it seems to be the best option for user interface and secure.

f2ttl0,brianddk,Does Bitcoin Cash CashAddr and Bitcoin Core Bech32 use fundamentally different checksums (polymod)?,"Reviewing the [spec for CashAddr](https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/cashaddr.md) and the [spec for Bech32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki), the checksum methods seem to be fundamentally different.  Am I reading this correctly?

CashAddr sample code:

```c
uint64_t PolyMod(const data &amp;v) {
    uint64_t c = 1;
    for (uint8_t d : v) {
        uint8_t c0 = c &gt;&gt; 35;
        c = ((c &amp; 0x07ffffffff) &lt;&lt; 5) ^ d;
        
        if (c0 &amp; 0x01) c ^= 0x98f2bc8e61;
        if (c0 &amp; 0x02) c ^= 0x79b76d99e2;
        if (c0 &amp; 0x04) c ^= 0xf33e5fb3c4;
        if (c0 &amp; 0x08) c ^= 0xae2eabe2a8;
        if (c0 &amp; 0x10) c ^= 0x1e4f43e470;
    }
    
    return c ^ 1;
}
```

Bech32 sample code:

```python
def bech32_polymod(values):
  GEN = [0x3b6a57b2, 0x26508e6d, 0x1ea119fa, 0x3d4233dd, 0x2a1462b3]
  chk = 1
  for v in values:
    b = (chk &gt;&gt; 25)
    chk = (chk &amp; 0x1ffffff) &lt;&lt; 5 ^ v
    for i in range(5):
      chk ^= GEN[i] if ((b &gt;&gt; i) &amp; 1) else 0
  return chk
```

I ask because I was trying to put together a PR to `pycoin` to add CashAddr support.  I got it all done then noticed that my checksums seemed problematic.  Best I could find, the `polymod` functions are incompatible between `bech32` libraries and `cashaddr` libraries.

I have Blue Wallet installed on my phone, to carry some BTC when I'm out and about - just a small amount.

I had Blue Wallet on my phone for a couple of months now, but I didn't create the wallet in question until like three weeks ago and loaded it up with cash (0,0055 BTC) 10 days ago. Subsequently, I did a couple of very small test transactions. After that, I never touched the wallet again.

In the morning, I started Blue Wallet and saw that there was one transaction which cleared the entire wallet, 5 days ago. I checked all my other (non-mobile) wallets to see if I transferred such an amount somewhere. Nothing. Furthermore, I'm sure I didn't use it to buy anything. If I had cleared the wallet with one transaction, I'd remember.

All my other funds are save and more secure. Blue Wallet does not require a password to send funds. However, I can say with 99,99999% certainty that I didn't leave my phone unlocked somewhere.

My question is: Can I somehow check with certainty whether my phone was hacked? Is there any other check-list I can follow to gain some intelligence what actually happened?

Just a reminder that the last time the reward halved in June 2016 it took until about December of 2017 (about 18 months)  to hit its all time high, so if it doesn't happen in the course of 10-15 minutes (block mining time) don't panic sell just yet.

**How I send mistakenly 1 BTC to the Huobi Cold Wallet?**

A day I was watching a BTC rich list and exploring the addresses. I'm unsure how exactly it happens because I verified the address, but when I sent 1 BTC I did mistakenly to the wrong address!!! I verified that I was sending to the correct address, but I had to remake the sendship because the wallet crashed, probably there was the problem, the huobi's cold wallet address was in the clipboard. Anyways I don't have certainty how it happens.List:  [https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)

It was a mistake, I work often sending and receiving BTC. When you do a certain task all the days copying wrong data could be a **TERRIBLE** but **EASY** mistake to do, because we are humans and we fall in the trust. **As you did a task correctly many many times you earn trust on yourself and try save time.** If it didn't happens to you ever you aren't being honest.

&amp;#x200B;

**7 months talking with Huobi Customer Support (part 1)**

I tried to contact Huobi's customer support. First they first didn't understand me, thinking that I tried to deposit on Huobi and sent to a wrong address. After they understand they told me that the address doesn't belongs to Huobi and they can't help me. That is false, I did an investigation and they have direct relation with this address, they can help me. Read my following analysis please:

&amp;#x200B;

**Huobi Ownership Analysis**

Searching, sites says that the address belongs to Huobi Huobi support says that address doesn't belongs to Huobi

I don't know if belongs to Huobi or not, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi

Why? The address 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 regulary sent big amounts to 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D

Then, is VERY PROBABLY THAT 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 OWNER KNOWS 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D OWNER And the 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D OWNER can help me.

Searching, some sites (and sites like USDT Official page [https://web.archive.org/web/20181113185656/https://wallet.tether.to/richlist](https://web.archive.org/web/20181113185656/https://wallet.tether.to/richlist)) says that the address 1LAnF8h3qMGx3TSwNUHVneBZUEpwE4gu3D belongs to Huobi

Again, I don't know really if the address is of Huobi, but I can deduct and track that the address is related with Huobi

Why? On my Huobi account I made only 2 BTC withdraws from Huobi in the past

2018-05-08 18:36:45 , txid: 0e6bf02323ebc166b6638afcd6170ecb73948748235e687def7e7a3cb1902fca , it has 239 inputs 2018-05-08 20:17:10 , txid: b59b988d642fe3773268e246ef1a0d048bbd3f734a611d00722b39126ed9e20b , it has 239 inputs too

In both transaction, all inputs are addresses that BELONGS TO HUOBI, because you huobi are sending me BTC

Both transactions has 39 addresses as inputs in common (all huobi address, maybe deposit addresses of anothers huobi users)

Example: 1M9ndPSQ4fmMKaKW2oX7LtjduDqYUcFKCW

**7 months talking with Huobi Customer Support (part 2)**

After understanding this , they asked me my consent to pay a fee. I agreed. After they asked me sign a message with my privates keys. I did it. And finally they tell me ""Wait"". I'm waiting 7 months ago, all months I ask and they ever reply the same ""We will contact you"". Now they told me "" Hello，sorry for the inconvenience, we feedback your problem to our technology department.  After a series of research and development, but it can not be solved.  Please understand this.  ""

I want to think that the team is failing and Huobi isn't wanting steal my BTC. What they are doing maybe could be illegal. I'm thinking to talk with lawers on Singapore, I don't know what more to do.

I tried to contact the CEO Livio on Twitter ( [https://twitter.com/livio\_huobi](https://twitter.com/livio_huobi) ) but they don't reply me! I want to think that someone else is administering their account.

    Couldnt parse using pkey.data
    Couldnt parse using hex public key

The idea is to parse the public key from the generated one to see if it is really correct. Also, i tried using openssl with the same private key and i get a different public key from the private one using ecdsa secp256k1..  
Any help or example on how to use the library in C++ is more than welcome.

Practical example: if I buy something on the internet with bitcoin and the seller doesn't send the goods to me, I can't do anything to get my bitcoins back. I'm screwed.

If, on the other hand, I pay with PayPal and the goods do not arrive, I can easily open a dispute and put the seller in trouble. Besides, I'm sure I get all my money back.

Can you explain it in plain terms, why would a payment system like bitcoin be better than PayPal?

Thank you.",1582035845,11,1
f5s88o,jakkkmotivator,What Are Bitcoin Trading Bots,"In the virtual world, a bot is a program that is configured for repetitive actions. They are written to save a person from mechanical and monotonous work.

The [bots for trading cryptocurrency](https://thecryptobasic.com/2020/01/28/3-commas-crypto-trading-bot-review/) are no different from their counterparts in general: they are set to trade mechanically on the exchanges according to defined parameters.

The simplest versions of bots buy cryptocurrencies when the [exchange](https://thecryptobasic.com/2020/01/28/binance-exchange-review/) rate drops and sell when they grow.

Since many people trade Bitcoin passively and therefore cannot spend much time analyzing the market, Bitcoin bots allow users to build more effective trades without having to stay in the market.

Although the cryptocurrency market is much less developed than other financial markets, the digital nature of the market means that the technology didn't take long to keep up with the competition, even though it had significantly less time to integrate algorithmic trading

&amp;#x200B;

Can I trust a trading bot?

Due to the popularity and rapid growth of the crypto world, the cryptocurrency market is full of phishing bots designed to get your data to completely steal your money or personal account.

The crypto exchanges are not responsible for the security of the user's money in the event of hacking your account. Also in the event that you transfer your personal funds and data to third parties.

Be careful with the software you are using and pay attention to the other user's feedback. It is important to find a reputable trading bot that is free from coding errors and reduces downtime to a minimum.

The security of the account for ""stolen"" information is on your shoulders.

&amp;#x200B;

Main types of bots:

[A trading bot](https://www.cryptohopper.com/) is software that interacts directly with exchanges (often using the API to obtain and interpret relevant information) and, depending on how market data is interpreted, places buy or sell orders on your behalf. Bots make these decisions, track market price movements and react according to the pre-defined and pre-programmed rules. Typically, a trading bot analyzes market actions such as volume, orders, price and time, although these can usually be programmed according to your taste and preferences.

&amp;#x200B;

Trade bots

Trade within a single cryptocurrency exchange, earn income by buying currencies at a low price and selling at a higher price.

Arbitrage bots

If they are the same trading robots, they only trade on multiple exchanges and earn income by buying currencies on the exchange where the price is lower and selling on another exchange where the price is higher. Although the spread between exchanges is now much narrower, they still appear from time to time, and trading robots can help users take full advantage of these differences. In addition, arbitrage can also be used by traders who want to include futures contracts in their trading strategies. They benefit from any differences between a futures contract and its underlying asset, taking into account futures contracts that are traded on different exchanges.

Market creation -

In order to implement strategies for creating markets, border orders for buying and selling must be defined in the vicinity of the existing market situation. When prices fluctuate - the trading bot automatically and continuously places limit orders to take advantage of the spread. Despite the fact that it can be beneficial in certain time periods, intense competition for this strategy can make it unprofitable, especially in conditions of low liquidity.

Are trading bots useful at all?

Trading bots react to the market. They collect the data needed for trading execution based on the analysis of the trading platform. However, the crypto trading platform can only tell ""half the story"" because many increases and decreases are based on other sources that cannot be programmed into a bot for analysis.

What can I do to get the most out of the Crypto Trading Bot?

The main rule: Coins in which you invest should be chosen very carefully.

Tracking the latest developments in the market is also effective. You should look for a lot of clues as to whether certain trades are successful or fail.

Well-made bots can be a tool that helps you stay one step ahead of the market. You can execute transactions based on the parameters of the developer or the parameters you set.

Some of them even offer the opportunity to copy more established dealers and analysts - and fully assess their track record.",1582034526,0,1

f5rc23,kirhyip,Cryptocurrency Wallet Development - What Does It Mean?,"[Cryptocurrency wallet development](http://www.kirhyip.com/cryptocurrency-wallet-development-script) enables users to send/receive digital currencies or store them for further use in the future. In fact, it is a software program that stores private and public keys and lets users interact with various blockchains to perform multiple actions, but it does not store coins like a physical wallet. It makes operations safer by storing currency addresses, such as public and private keys. 

**What are the public and private keys?**  

Each crypto wallet has public and private keys, which help make digital transactions more secure. As names, the public key is a public address that can be used by anyone to send coins to that address, and the private key is the address that the address owner uses to maintain the coins. Simply put, when it relates to banking sector transactions, the public address is a bank account number that anyone can use to deposit the amount to the account holder. In this case, the private key is a security card tied to the respective account to access the funds in the future. 

**Why use Crypto wallets?**  

The digital era is experiencing tremendous growth in the use of digital coins by people worldwide. With the increasing use of digital coins, cryptocurrency wallet development is becoming increasingly important to maintain it in a flawless manner.    

Cryptocurrency Wallets keep users away from the “hacking” threatening online attack. Wallets are safe for varying sizes. The level of security depends on the wallet you receive from the provider. When you receive a product from a [reputable cryptocurrency wallet development company](http://www.kirhyip.com/cryptocurrency-wallet-development-script), security measures are at the highest level of protecting your digital assets very securely.    

**What are the features of a well-developed cryptocurrency wallet?**    

The wallet can be encrypted with a strong password - difficult to crack that provides 100% security. 

**Multi-layer security**  

Safe infrastructure will be maintained using various security tests. One of them is 2FA. Two-factor authentication can be achieved on the website using one of the best authenticators on the market. This authentication is mandatory to log into the wallet. Re-captcha, secure PIN, and verification code add additional layers of security to the wallet. 

**Multi Crypto Supportable**  

The wallet supports major cryptocurrencies so that users can store and use them in the most sophisticated medium. Users can also exchange major cryptocurrencies using the wallet. 

**Seed Generation**  

Without too much hassle, to retrieve the own wallet, a unique 12-word mnemonic phrase is implemented in the crypto wallet. This helps to resolve the drawbacks and losses that occur when the users run a new device.  Further great features include:

* Session Log out  
* Ticket system  
* Improved security  
* QR scanner facility  
* Tracking transactions  
* Lightning speed transactions  
* High responsibility for different gadgets    

Thus, creating a unique and modern cryptocurrency wallet can help make many digital transactions more secure and also help users with new needs and services that are successfully trading online globally!!!",1582030341,0,1

f5pr3o,FevaValas,"Judge Bitcoin by yearly lows, not all time highs","Source:  [https://www.newmine.io/blog/judge-bitcoin-by-yearly-lows-not-all-time-highs](https://www.newmine.io/blog/judge-bitcoin-by-yearly-lows-not-all-time-highs) 

A lot of attention is given to the all time highs (ATHs) when it comes to the price of Bitcoin. The famous all time high of $20,000 is regularly thrown around and many people are on the lookout for when BTC may break this price again. The issue with ATHs is that they usually occur during a ""bubble"" where market hype drives the price to make new highs. These ATHs are usually short lived and don't really provide a concrete measurement to the value of Bitcoin. A better way to look at BTC's price is by looking at the yearly lows.

* 2012: $4
* 2013: $65
* 2014: $200
* 2015: $185
* 2016: $365
* 2017: $780
* 2018: $3200
* 2019: $5000

By analysing the yearly lows, we can see that BTC's price has been growing strongly year on year. It would not be unwise to expect that the yearly lows will be hitting 5 figure sums within the space of 3-4 years.",1582021343,9,1

As long as the price are so volatile bitcoin can never be used as a store of value or as a monetary system. For now transaction volume is also an issue if bitcoin were to become a widely accepted form of payment. 

Many businesses operate with profits as low as a few % of revenue, they can not accept bitcoin because of what can only be described as extreme price volatility compared to what businesses are used to. Yes they can convert the bitcoins to fiat as soon as it clears but whats the point then? Only adds extra transaction costs. 

This goes for people as well. I can not keep my savings in an asset that can fluctuate in price up to 10% a day or 50% a month. Thats called speculation and not a viable option. You need to know that the money is there when the rent is due. Bitcoin also does not pay interest like money in a bank account usually does. 

As for store of value, same argument as above. I need to know my hard earned savings are still there when im ready to retire. How can i do that when i dont know what the price will be in a year or 10. Most other forms of saving can give me a prediction of what my investment will be worth after some time. I can say today that the price of bitcoin might be 3k in a year, or it could be 30k. Nobody can argue with that prediction as there is no underlying asset that can be analyzed. Bitcoin price today is mostly based on adoption, speculation and greed. 

And of course i do understand that neither fiat or gold or any other asset are perfect, dont get me wrong i would love to move to a better working system, but at the moment i just dont see how bitcoin and blockchain can be that system.

f68ple,BoBoWhiteDog,99% of Guys will succeed at this and 1% of girls will succeed at this..,"  

Its called CryptoCurrency mining. A study was done by a group of Harvard PHD Monkeys on a sample of women and men in relation to ""patience"". 

The hypothesis was that men were more patient than women. So they put it to the test. They got a group of 500 women and 500 men and told them to download a new Cryptocurrency app from the Playstore (Android) or Appstore (iPhone) called pi Network. In order to join pi Network, they had to input a particular invitational code into the app after it was downloaded.This wasn't hard because the app ALWAYS asks for an invitational code as you cannot proceed without one. 

The invitational code is dryan8889 They each downloaded the app and put in the code dryan8889 and start the ""mining"" process. This process involved pressing a button every 24 hours to kick off the mining process again because after 24 hours, the mining stops. Essentially, mining means earning coins by doing nothing. 

The scientists told the men and women that this Cyrptocurrency will go on the stock market in summer of 2020 and the more coins you mine, the more money you will essentially have because those coins will be worth money. The men and women asked ""what is the point in this?"" The scientists replied ""it is a test of patience to see if men or women can last longer"". 

The results showed that men are better at lasting longer. Want to prove them wrong? Download pi Network from the playstore or appstore and use the invitational code dryan8889 and prove that YOUR gender is best and also.... you can make money in the process for free.",1582106171,0,1

f46svq,financeoptimum,16th Amendment and The Grace Commission,"We have previously encountered Senator Nelson Aldrich in the context of the [formation of the Federal Reserve in 1913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEFlPwA8uEE):

Well, it turns out he played a pivotal role in another significant piece of legislation.

The 16th Amendment...

The 16th Amendment states that:

**""The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""**

Now an income tax amendment to the Constitution was first proposed by Senator Norris Brown of Nebraska.

He submitted two proposals, Senate Resolutions Nos. 25 and 39.

However, the amendment proposal finally accepted was Senate Joint Resolution No. 40, introduced by Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island, the Senate majority leader and Finance Committee Chairman.

Clearly, as we have seen in the Federal Reserve story, Aldrich was a man of significance with some pretty powerful friends. The 16th Amendment became part of the Constitution on February 25, 1913. This is the same year in which the Federal Reserve Act was passed, on December 23rd 1913.

The Sixteenth Amendment exempted income taxes from the constitutional requirements regarding **direct taxes**, after income taxes on rents, dividends, and interests were considered direct taxes and ruled to be illegal.

Some would say that Federal income tax on labour has been unlawfully imposed on the American people and kept in place for over a century, contrary to various rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.

But why? And where does the money go?

**Well, it exists such that successive federal governments can continue to pay the interest on money which, since 1913, they have been obligated to keep borrowing from central bankers, and which the government previously could print independently.**

Now of course: the Federal Reserve *is* the Independent Agency that controls the money supply. Don't just take my word for it, this is confirmed by [former Chair of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w4AUAdN12c).

In 1984, US President Ronald Reagan requested an investigation, authorized in Executive Order 12369 on June 30, 1982.

President Reagan used the now famous phrase, ""Drain the swamp"".

The focus was waste and inefficiency in the US Federal government, and became known as **The Grace Commission.**

Its head, businessman J. Peter Grace, asked the members of that commission to ""Be bold and work like tireless bloodhounds, don't leave any stone unturned in your search to root out inefficiency.""

Members of his team included one hundred and sixty-one top executives, assisted by 2,000 volunteers from the private sector.

They contributed more than $75 million worth of their time and resources to examine all major federal programs and agencies.

In January 1984, the Grace Commission’s work culminated in a report.

The conclusion of that report?

**""One third of all income taxes is consumed by waste and inefficiency; one third is not collected due to the underground economy; and 100% of all income taxes are absorbed by interest plus government contributions to transfer payments.""**

In other words, all individual income tax revenues are gone before one nickel is spent on the services that taxpayers expect from their government...

f46jlw,sl73hf,Philosophy of mixing,"From a legal and moral perspective I have an issue with bitcoin's attempts to deal with its lack of fungibility.

It always revolves around actively choosing to mix and/or swap coins with someone else. It is very obvious that a tiny percentage of people do this, as will always be the case if bitcoin survives and becomes more mainstream, so the participants will be likely to be doing something criminal. Therefore, if you mix you are likely directly involved with helping a criminal obfuscate their funds.

Despite being of a cypherpunk mindset it makes sense to me why this could be made illegal and I would feel discomfort doing it. It surprises me that systems like Wasabi with its centralized coordinator that gets paid are not treated the same as custodial mixing services and I would not be surprised to see it deemed illegal in future.

Alternative projects that are private on the protocol level, like constructs that use ring signatures, do not mix coins like this; the cryptographic constructs just don't reveal information that shows which output was spent. Ignoring the technical limitations of mixing, this achieves a similar goal but without the legal/moral issue of directly swapping coins with other people. It seems black-and-white to me, this is completely different, and money should be fungible without having to do the digital equivalent of going to a money laundering shop to clean your funds.

This is a PSA that OG LulzSec did not hack the Altsbit Exchange,"After some discussion, OG members of LulzSec have collectively concluded that something happened to the original @LulzSec Twitter. It was entrusted to someone's care and they seem to have accidentally posted the login credentials in a screenshot to a tech support individual in India or it may have been swept up in a Twitter vuln. This may have occurred as early as 2015 or as late as 2017. The BTC account masquerading as the Lulz treasury matched the same account funding KissAnime sites. There are many other ""LulzSec"" actors worldwide so as long as they were on message, nothing was done about it, but now they appear to have gone their own way and declared themselves ""LulzSec 2.0"" as is evidenced by their Sister account @LulzHQ. More recently it seems the owner has become very active but sailed their pirated LulzBoat in to enemy harbors. Instead of the hactivism laughing at the 1% of olden days of yore, they have betrayed the flag of Lulz with a blatant heist on the Altsbit crypto exchange (or at least, they are claiming they did it, some of us have serious doubts). The main account hijacker is claiming crypto in general is some money scheme they invented (which makes no sense obviously to those who know anything about crypto's real history) and has laid siege to the 99% instead of corrupt overlords of the world.

We're not asking you to do anything about it. ;-) Some of us have seen enough jail time already bruh. We're just posting this here to make everyone and the media aware that this is a splinter person or group and does not represent the original flavor classic LulzSec.

Should the situation change and the account returns to safe harbor, we will post an update. Sail strong brothers. One boat does not make a fleet. To the frigate!! Yo ho!

I put together a quick list that you may want to reference in case someone you are discussing crypto with brings up money laundering. There are hundreds if not thousands of cases brought against these banks, so this list is by no means comprehensive. It is merely a starting point to get the gears spinning in people's heads that perhaps the financial institutions that they have dealt with their entire lives are not as squeaky clean and upstanding as they believe them to be.

""The reason it's so hard for most people to understand is that most people don't really understand money. Money isn't wealth. It's an accounting system used to facilitate the exchange of wealth. (The paradox of money is that while everyone wants it, no one actually wants it - they want the stuff they can buy with it!) Many people are put off by the fact that Bitcoins are 'just data'. But that's what ALL money is, information! More precisely, money is a means for credibly conveying information about value given but not yet received (or at least not yet received in a form in which it can directly satisfy a person's wants or needs).

To put it yet another way, money is a ledger. With fiat currencies like the dollar, that ledger is centralized. And that gives the central authority responsible for maintaining that ledger tremendous power, power that history has proven will inevitably be abused. With Bitcoin, the ledger is decentralized. And that means that no one individual or entity has the power to arbitrarily create new units (thereby causing inflation), freeze (or seize) your account, or block a particular  payment from being processed. We've had decentralized money before. After all, no one can simply print new gold into existence. And the 'ledger' of gold is distributed because the physical gold itself (the 'accounting entries' in the metaphor) is distributed. But with gold, that decentralization comes at a heavy price (literally). The physical nature of gold makes it hugely inefficient for global transactions. 

And this is why bitcoin is important! It is the first currency in the world that is both decentralized and digital. It is more reliably scarce than gold and more private and transactionally efficient than ""modern"" digital banking. This is why people are excited about bitcoin, it has the potential to be completely revolutionize money.""

f75vu6,1MightBeAPenguin,"After almost a week of working in my spare time, I finally found a formula to precisely calculate the amount of bitcoins mined for any given date!","Just a little background here. I'm a high school student, currently studying calculus. I don't quite understand the concepts of limits or integrals thoroughly, but I was fascinated nonetheless by how the reward system of Bitcoin and its halving worked. When I initially wanted to know how many Bitcoins were mined, I would just use a calculator, and add the previous block halvings, and amounts mined. Afterwards, I realized I can make a rough approximation of this with this formula:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vst5911td7i41.png?width=356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87ff13e279ad62d5fd775e99dc6373c3b0a5791e

The problem with this function is that it assumes that the mining and reward system were a smooth curve, which isn't the case. It's a curve that consists of a bunch of straight lines. So I had to find a formula that reflected this.

&amp;#x200B;

My first start would be knowing that the starting block reward was 50 BTC, and that reward would halve every 210,000 blocks or \~4 years. So I started with this formula:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bni62w74f7i41.png?width=242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=591e27a4d790a5b87fc2f043eb778f7545183603

With this formula, I got all of the lines, but they were not in the correct position, so using my knowledge, and logical reasoning, I came up with this formula for determining how many Bitcoins were mined for any given date:

[Note: The results won't be 100&amp;#37; accurate because this model is made on the assumption that each block is exactly 10 minutes](https://preview.redd.it/dvpi2gmpc7i41.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb8d49ef6c3c6bb1fe1a8e325d6bb46781f6a87f)

To get your 'x' value all you have to do is:

*x = (given date - January 3**^(rd)**, 2009)\*144*

Then input this value into the formula given above.

&amp;#x200B;

[Donations will be much appreciated!](https://preview.redd.it/cfst3bxfg7i41.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=158eb139b056c26a9ca394d1622157d5baadbbcf)

On the mining front: 

* The Fiber Network for connecting all the miners 
* Matt Corallo’s Stratum Version 2 Protocol, (“going to make it a lot better for individual miners to control how the blocks get created instead of the mining pool screening it,” says Mayer). 
* Mining derivatives (“like hashing contracts, will likely trade on a CFTC regulated swap execution facility,” says Mayer).

On the privacy front; particularly confidential transactions:

* CoinJoin
* Mimblewimble
* Dandelion
* Bulletproof (shorter proofs for more efficient confidential transactions)
* SNICKER (coin mixing)
* Value Shuffle (coin mixing)

Smart Contracts:

* Mast (Merklized Abstract Syntax Tree, for smaller transaction sizes, more privacy, and larger smart contracts)
* Taproot (for expanding Bitcoin smart contract flexibility)
* Graph root

Everyone has heard of someone that’s lost a USB drive with xyz bitcoins on it; but how does this actually become lost (besides physically misplacing it) bitcoin I gather is stored on the decentralized ledger and when this person received 1k coins someone transferred it to a public key (his wallet) and it was placed in wallet with a private key. When he lost the USB I assume that means he lost the private key? And if they all were sent to the USB offline and this public address was created offline, in theory if this wallet never connected to the decentralized ledger couldn’t someone randomly generate a new public address to match the ledger and just claim ownership of the 1k bitcoins? For instance if my usb randomly generated this public address, it received these coins, never connected to the decentralized ledger, lost private key, someone else’s wallet randomly generates or purposefully generates same public address, would the decentralized ledger now believe this new wallet is the owner?",1582508177,19,1

f8h8lg,Mcgillby,Science Project: Creating a BIP39 Mnemonic with Dice,"&gt;**Disclaimer:** This is for education purposes only. This is quite advanced for the average user. If you are to going to protect funds with a mnemonic generated using this method, be extremely careful to only source trusted software and to do all processes in a completely secure offline environment.

Let me begin by saying there is nothing to suggest that the RNG used in popular software/ hardware wallets is flawed. The generation process uses TRNG's certified from 3rd parties which should satisfy the large majority of users. However, if you are the type that trusts no one and you want to verify your BIP39 Mnemonic is truly random, then you must generate it yourself. 

The process itself is straightforward, The BIP39 dictionary contains 2048 words, each of these words represents 11 binary bits (0 or 1). A 24-word Mnemonic consists of 23 Words (253 bits) and Checksum (3+8 bits). To create our own mnemonic we start by generating 256 bits of random binary (23 words + 3 bits of the Checksum) then calculating the rest of the checksum. There is many ways to randomly generate the binary, but specifically for this experiment we use six-sided dice. 

**Tools needed:**

  - Set of Casino Grade Six-Sided Dice 
  - BIP39 Wordlist  (**MUST BE NUMBERED 0-2047**)
  - Notepad ++ (Useful because it tells you how many characters you have entered)
  - Coin (For generating a couple extra bits of entropy)
  - Base Conversion Tool for Converting Base6 to Binary/Hex
  - Tool to generate SHA-256 Hash from Hex String
--------------------------------------------------
  - **Step 1 -  Generate Entropy using Dice:** We will need a total of 99 dice rolls to generate the amount of entropy needed to create a 24-Word mnemonic. Roll each dice in groups of five or more to save some time. Write down each dice roll starting with the one landing farthest to the left. Keep rolling until you have 99 rolls completed. Record the rolls with no spaces in Notepad++ for the next step. (example for 10 rolls: 6524132321) [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/GRKxNbD.png)

  - **Step 2 - Convert Dice Rolls to Base6 encoding:** In your Notepad++ application you should have a written string of 99 numbers from 1-6. To convert this string to Base6 simply change all the 6's to 0's using the replace function built into notepad++.  (CTRL+H ; Find What: 6 ; Replace With: 0 ; Replace All) [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/tDi1S41.png)

  - **Step 3 - Convert Base6 to Base2 (Binary):** Open up your Base Conversion Tool and select the option to convert Base6 to Binary. Copy/Paste the 99-digit Base6 string and convert it to Binary. Copy/Paste the binary to a new document named ""binary"" in Notepad++ [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/qTHk24u.png)

  - **Step 4 - Make sure entropy is divisible by 32:** In order to generate a checksum, the entropy must be divisible by 32, which means our binary must equal exactly 256 bits before adding the checksum.  Depending on our dice rolls, the binary after conversion from base6 will be 254-256 bits, if its under 256 bits we must add bits to the binary. To do this we can either pad the binary with leading zero's or flip a coin (Heads=0/Tails=1) and add the number to the beginning of the binary string in the document labeled ""binary"".

  - **Step 5 - Convert 256-bit Binary to Hexadecimal:** Open your Base Conversion tool again and convert the 256-bit binary to a HEX value. Copy the HEX value to a new document named ""HEX""

  - **Step 6 - Generate Checksum:** We generate the checksum by hashing the HEX string from the previous step with SHA-256 (Make sure the tool your using is hashing HEX values and not Alpha-numeric). It will output a new HEX string. Write down only the first two Characters of this string. These 2 characters will be used to generate the checksum. Convert the 2 HEX characters to 8-bits of binary using Base Conversion Tool (Hex to Binary). If the output is less the 8 digits add zeros to the start until it is 8 digits. Add these 8 digits to the end of your long binary string. It will be a total of 264-bits now. (ex. a HEX value of [34] outputs as [110100], since this is 6 digits we add 2 leading zeroes to make [00110100]) [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/WAHCqvI.png)

  - **Step 7 - Divide Binary in to groups of 11:**  Open a new document in notepad named ""24 Words"", Paste the 264-bit binary and divide it into groups of 11 bits.

  - **Step 8 - Convert 11-bit binaries to Decimal Numbers:** Using your Base Conversion tool, take each group of 11-bit binary and convert it to a decimal number between 0-2047. This number will represent a word in the BIP39 Wordlist. 

  - **Step 9 - Write Down your 24 words and use them with a BIP39 compatible wallet:** Find each word in the wordlist that corresponds to the decimal numbers you generated in the last step. Write down each word in order 1-24. You now have randomly generated your own 24-word mnemonic. You can use these mnemonics with any BIP39 compatible wallet. Create a high entropy BIP39 passphrase for additional security. [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/Fe8QLYM.png)

  - **Step 10 - Clean Up:** Destroy/Wipe any files that contain your raw entropy, hex or binaries. These are just as good as your 24 words to a hacker.

f8h601,fraqaq,Leaving Bitcoin on an exchange is incredibly risky and defeats the whole purpose of Bitcoin in the first place.,"Leaving bitcoin on an exchange means the government can seize your bitcoin if you fail to pay taxes.

Exchanges have lost bitcoin in the past, look no further than mt.gox all it would take is one rogue employee to transfer funds to a different wallet and boom its gone.

Bitcoins purpose is for you to be your own bank, when you leave bitcoin on an exchange it functions as a bank. The exchange can manipulate the price of bitcoin to their will because they control it. They can do anything they want with “your” bitcoin.

You don’t “own” your bitcoin on an exchange. THEY DO. You are not in control. This is exactly why bitcoin was created in the first place. Because big banks CAN AND WILL FAIL. 


Don’t do this. It hurts the community and allows a very small group of people control the price to their will. If everyone took their bitcoin off exchanges and into a hardware wallet, I can guarantee you the price would increase.",1582497211,8,0
f8gz6d,jarederaj,Major Moon Math Update: The Pre Halving Prognostication Update,"##Major Moon Math Update: The Pre Halving Prognostication Update

https://www.moonmath.win/


The halving is coming and just like each preceding halving event bears argue that the halving is priced in while bulls argue that it’s impossible to price in the halving. The pattern repeats itself predictably. If you don’t believe me go back and look at the discussion threads leading up to the last halving. We see the same arguments using the same reasoning today that we saw back then.

Where does Moon Math stand on the controversy? That shouldn’t be hard to predict; both perspectives have important truths to observe. Unwrapping the truths and attaching ourselves to what seems most important is a hard problem, and maybe we can try to figure that out together.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/mgWU9IkM/

We’re going to unpack that graphic over the course of this post.

Bitcoin’s price moves ahead of itself a little before each halving event and cools off immediately after the price surges. That happens even though eight weeks before the last halving we saw the price almost double in a four week period.  Bulls will be quick to point out that the price still jumped from a low of $430 to a high of $780, but the market showed that the price was unsustainable on the high end of that.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/pJK2Ppd6/

The 2012 halving also showed an unsustainable doubling of the price, from a low of $7.05 to a high of $15.50 8 weeks before the halving. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/zKx5pyYx/

Each time bitcoin breaks out like this before the halving we see the price recede back to more rational prices. Then, after the halving, the price rises into a slow multi-year parabolic advance.

To be clear, I do NOT see bitcoin’s price doubling *again* before the halving. That improbable event will take us to a new ATH and performance like that will out pace all previous halving events. It *could* happen, but $20k bitcoin before the third quarter of this year is an extremely low probability event. Instead, I think we’re seeing the impact of a mature and slower market. Instead of the price doubling over a few weeks we see it more than double over a year. Proportionally we’re right where we should be, and $10k bitcoin only seems like a slightly high premium for late market entrances.

The Moon Math narrative is that the price of bitcoin is stabilizing over time. We can see that by measuring the gap between Bollinger bands from week to week. 
https://www.tradingview.com/x/uN71Abe5/

BBand width shows us that volatility is trending down, but also that we’re seeing fewer periods of extended price stability. Overall, though, bitcoin is much less volatile in the past. 

We can also see that we’ve been in an extended period of accumulation as measured by “on balance volume”

https://www.tradingview.com/x/VlEjfXgd/

The market is accumulating bitcoin week over week and the rate of that accumulation is, compared historically, very gradual. We haven’t seen rapid accumulation spikes pre halving, yet. The lack of obscene pre halving accumulation might convince some bulls that the market hasn’t seen what should be a pre halving surge. Those bulls might pause for a minute and observe the impact of leverage and the increased volume we’ve seen over the last several weeks. The pre halving surge is here, but the market might have priced in the “inevitable” surge and crash by way of leveraged short positions. Have short positions stabilized bitcoin’s price performance and prevented what would otherwise be a very irrational pre halving swing? Indeed, the market cannot rationally anticipate the impact of the halving event, but it can smooth out the peaks and valleys that we’ve seen in the past. Again, look at OBV and BBand widths on the weekly chart and try to tell yourself that bitcoin is less stable today than it was 4 or 8 years ago.

Retail’s share of overall market volume has also been increasing steadily.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/33C6kCoR/

The story is the same with (green) and without (red) Bitmex. More bitcoins are being purchased on unleveraged markets. Presumably those bitcoins are being held longer term.

On the twelve-hour chart we see a descending broadening wedge.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/dfi2jtzB/

http://thepatternsite.com/dbw.html 

If this pattern confirms we’ll see an irrational pre halving surge, but I don’t think it we’ll see a local high before the halving. 

### The Final Prognostication
Cash, stability, volume, fractals, fundamentals, classical charts… everything is pointing to business as usual for the halving, but with less gusto. The price isn’t going to do a lot in 2020 and any substantial breakout will probably be kyboshed by way of shorts on leveraged markets. It’s going to look a lot like past halvings; the price will look and feel flat, which is what our final chart projects. 

Behold, the price projected using the price performance of the last two halvings. The blue line describes what I think will happen:

Thanks, and please let me know if you have any feedback. I built this because I believe strongly that we need an alternative to “surveillance capitalism,” and together I think we can make it happen.",1582623869,0,1

Hi everyone, I've been fairly active in this forum the past couple years and would love some feedback on an app I've been working on. I've never done this before, and this is an initial version to solve a very simple problem (headache) I've experienced in trading.

I've wasted countless hours waiting for exchanges to put a transaction on the blockchain, and I've wasted as least as much time waiting for a certain number of confirmations, so I can trade on another exchange where I sent the crypto. 

This app simply sends a push notification when the transaction receives one confirmation and then another push notification after a certain number of confirmations that the user specifies. I have lots of ideas for additional types of notifications, but I'd like to hear thoughts from the community on this first version.",1582603791,6,1

If Instead the government changed the policy and distributed all the newly created USD to the actual holders of dollars in banks (or USD denominated securities), each dollar would still lose value, but a holder of USD would receive their pro rate share of the new dollars, balancing things out.

This change in methodology would disincentivize the use QE for the purpose of theft of value held on USD, because the newly generated dollars are not going to the government, they are going to current holders of dollars.",1582332472,29,1
