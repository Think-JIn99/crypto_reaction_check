Lightning nodes grow large and influential, similar to goldsmith guilds and banks of old\n\n\nNow of course a cryptographically enforced ledger makes the lightning network many times better than the gold note analogy, but are we still setting ourselves up for many of the same problems that have always plagued fiat currencies before Bitcoin?

Bitcoin,edh43x6,adb51d,"***sigh***.\n\n1.  Payments are routed over the network via onion routes.  This basically means that intermediaries can never be sure who is the ultimate source and ultimate destination of payments.  They are unable to view transactions and thus unable to usefully censor transactions.\n2.  Intermediaries are always optional.  A proper LN node will have dozens of channels to dozens of different intermediaries.  If one intermediary thinks it can somehow use statistics and decides it will censor based on fuzzy statistics, let them.  You have other channels you can use and other routes you can try.  You are in control of what route to take.\n3.  Intermediaries are always optional.  You can always make a direct, unpublished channel to any ""subversive"" idiot you want.  Since it's unpublished nobody else knows about the channel except you and that idiot, and your channel looks exactly like any random 2-of-2 multisig.  If we get Schnorr then your channel looks exactly like any random UTXO and nobody else can know anything.\n4.  ""Fewer on-chain transactions and reducing block rewards lead to high transaction fees to support chain security"".  Fewer onchain transactions mean ***lower*** onchain fees, because less competition for limited resources.  Further, high onchain fees hurt cheaters more: enforcement actions for cheating behavior are cheaper than  the cheating behaviors they correct, while completely honest actions continue to operate offchain at high speed.\n\nDo you honestly think those concerns were never thought about by the designers of Lightning Network or are you just spreading FUD?",1546872710,t1_edg5voh,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adb51d/i_the_past_you_could_close_your_goldchannel/edh43x6/

Bitcoin,edh7v42,adc601,"Sadly the yellow vest protests could be fired up by right wing people to change the system and to  let le Pen win the next election. I would be very careful with jumping on this protest - it'll be used in the next elections against democracy. Russia today is involved, breitbart., Etc. Especially young people are triggered to go on the streets against Macron and against the 'system'. Think about who will win by bringing up the people against the more left party. Macron needs to fix the problems the conservative party left over. I'm not saying he's a good or bad president - just be careful and look close to see what's going on with those protests. It's obvious, that right wing parties gain more and more power. USA, Turkey, Poland, Hungary, Brazil, Germany, etc. \nTo use Jeanne d'Arc as the leader of the neo revolution is maybe a little bit strange. It's not the revolution - it's the evolution of the right wing.\nMy two satoshis. The best way to gain power is to make the people belief that everything is fucked up. It's not getting better when right people gain more power. It's dangerous. Same shit happened in Germany after ww1. People were unsatisfied with the situation - and then the 'great leader' just came up in the right moment... And we all know what this led to. \n\nKudos to your art though!

Bitcoin,ee2tt6b,adc601,"How are the colored bars encoded? Take for example, group 2. I see 'Yellow Blue Blue Orange Yellow Blue Blue Peach Brown Peach'. The first letter is supposed to decode to 'U' in 'USURE'. There are six colors, so this is base-6. 'U' is letter #21 (decimal). In base-6 this is '33'. I would think the first two color bars would have to be the same color to represent '33' in base-6.\n\nEDIT: I read how the winner solved this part, and he didn't. He cross-referenced all the color-bar codes with the French BIP wordlist like a giant Sudoku to get 4 of the words, then wrote code to brute-force the last 2 words. So he never did figure out how the color-bars are coded. Very clever.

Bitcoin,edgjhqw,adddja,"My current theory is that the nonce gaps result from the way the S9 mines. ASICs search a range of nonces, and when they receive a new job from the mining pool, they abort their current job and mine the new one. If my theory is the correct one:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\+ The S9 firmware gives chips new jobs at a steady rate\n\n\+ This rate is probably 1 job every 1-2 seconds\n\n\+ Each hashing core therefore is probably able to cover 500 million - 1 billion nonces\n\n\+ Making new headers for each core is expensive, so the same header is distributed to 4 different hashing cores that each start offset by a count of \~1 billion. This quarters the number of headers your primary CPU needs to generate each second\n\n\+ The pattern appears 4 months before the S9s started shipping because Bitmain was mining on the S9 for 4 months before announcing them widely\n\n\+ A firmware update around block 430,000 expanded the nonce range slightly for each core. The gaps shrink in size over a range from 430,000 to 450,000, which would make sense because you can't roll out a firmware update to millions S9s worldwide in a short period of time.\n\n\+ The gaps are clearest during the periods where the S9 had the most dominance, and the gaps become less prevalent late in the chart which corresponds with the rollout of the halong miners and some of the other competing machines\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, I'm personally pretty happy with this explanation, though open to other ideas if someone has a good reason why this explanation is likely false or has some other more likely explanation.",1546852350,t3_adddja,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adddja/the_weird_nonce_pattern/edgjhqw/

Bitcoin,edhq3fi,adddja,"Interesting study.\n\nBut I think it is possible to be more profit to focus on the gap in some case.\n\nThe finding time of a mining rig is almost an exponential distribution with pdf g \* exp( -g \* X ). The 1st-order statistic of a set of N mining rigs is with pdf g \* N \* exp( -g \* N \* X). Suppose Alice have N mining rigs and all other people have M mining rigs, then the probability of her finding block is Pr( X < Y ), as fairly expected, N / ( N + M ). Let B be the number of nonce satisfying the block, Alice will find B \* N / ( N + M ) nonce with N rigs. The 'ROI' for Alice and other people is always the same as B / (N+M).\n\nOn the other hand. If Alice focus on a gap of nonce with portion A and other people focus on the other portion for whatever reason, then the number of nonce that she will find is now B \* A \* Pr (X<Y) and the number of nonce that other people will find is B \* (1-A) \* Pr(X>Y). It is B \* A \* N / (N+M) for Alice and B \* (1-A) \* M / (N+M) for others. The 'ROI' for Alice and others will be BA/(N+M) and B(1-A)/(N+M) respectively, which Alice is in a favor if A > 1-A. \n\nFor example, from block 40000 \~ 80000 as indicated in the graph, the gap is so wide that the word 'gap' is funny, but any way, we can see that the gap has roughly 80% nonce space. Alice could make a fortune because the buggy focus of other people.\n\nExtremely, if the mining rig would be so buggy that it only tries 10 nonce and repeat by its factory default which people don’t care to change, Alice would earn all the profit.",1546885218,t3_adddja,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adddja/the_weird_nonce_pattern/edhq3fi/

I understand what you are trying to say but if there are many different pools and thousands of miners in each, it could be likely that these different pools are brodcasting some same solution spaces to their miners. For example, trying the most valued transactions first, modifying all bits with those transactions and then moving on to a new set if solution is not found.\nIm not sure how pools pick the work for their miners and how often that work overlaps over different pools but on second tought with block rewards being way higher than tx fees pools can pretty much pick totally random set on transactions for roughly the same award, so yeah you are right!",1546853332,t1_edgisp7,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adddja/the_weird_nonce_pattern/edgk7jn/

Bitcoin,edixuk4,adddja,"> if there are many different pools and thousands of miners in each, it could be likely that these different pools are brodcasting some same solution spaces to their miners\n\nNo. Different pools have different coinbases so two pools will never search the same space. And it would make no sense for a pool to give the same work to two different miners.\n\nThere's no duplication of work, and so no advantage to be gained by knowing that some mining equipment doesn't search particular nonce ranges.",1546909947,t1_edgk7jn,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adddja/the_weird_nonce_pattern/edixuk4/
Bitcoin,edgxo3w,adddja,"It would be easy to detect very quickly if a mining pool is duplicating work, because the mining rate (frequency of successfully mined blocks) would underperform for the hardware's hash rate and current difficulty level. All three of these are well known metrics.\n\nAnother way to look at this is an analogy. Imagine  a collective of gold miners digging in an effectively infinite desert. It's effectively infinite because the number of variables in a block (selection of transactions, order of transactions, timestamp,  nonce, extra nonce etc) mean the global mining capacity can only explore an infinitesimal proportion of the solution space. The probability of any given square metre of desert containing a gold nugget is exactly the same no matter where you dig. So it doesn't really matter if your digging work allocation excludes certain strips of land, there is still far more than enough to ensure no two people dig up the same piece of land twice.",1546867861,t1_edgk7jn,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adddja/the_weird_nonce_pattern/edgxo3w/

Bitcoin,edgmncb,adf6aw," \n\n# The Coming Bifurcation of Bitcoin\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/the-coming-bifurcation-of-bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/the-coming-bifurcation-of-bitcoin)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n*Angus Champion de Crespigny is an advisor to blockchain projects and a former EY blockchain lead.*\n\n*The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s* [*2018 Year in Review*](https://www.coindesk.com/category/2018-review)*.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nAmongst many others, the bitcoin community for the past few years has been working with two particularly important ideas related to the asset’s future.\n\nOne is the narrative of institutional adoption: the idea that institutions will begin buying (or facilitating the buying) of [bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/) as an investment. The other is decentralization: emphasizing control of one’s own monetary sovereignty and the ease with which people can participate in the network at an affordable cost.\n\nWhile both are important in their own ways, considering how institutions operate, it is likely that these two narratives are going to conflict. This does not need to be a problem, however. What we’re likely to see is a bifurcation in bitcoin usage throughout the world for different purposes, and consequently, how it is handled.\n\n## The Institutionalization of Bitcoin\n\nThis thesis comes from a number of different directions.\n\nThere is what I’ll call the “hard money” thesis: that bitcoin will be recognized as a superior form of money due to its monetary policy and will be adopted en masse by institutional investors. In this case, these investors are the likes of pension funds, endowment funds, insurers and, possibly, central banks.\n\nPart of institutional adoption, however, is looking beyond the underlying benefits of the asset, and into whether there’s an appetite for people to buy, sell, hold and trade bitcoin. Where there is an appetite for a financial asset, institutions will facilitate. In this case, the investors will also include individuals.\n\nThe challenge faced by institutions in working with bitcoin in either instance, though, is that financial instruments for institutions need to be boring. Institutions rarely custody their own assets. Over many years, custody functions have been centralized with specialized institutions in the financial sector, who will hold the assets and perform all management functions that are needed on behalf of the ultimate asset owners.\n\nBut for bitcoin, custody is challenging, and not just for the technical reason that private keys need to be secure.\n\nHow do institutions manage forks? Do they need a central clearing function to offset risk? How do they manage sanctions risks for transaction fees if a block is mined by a miner in a sanctioned country?\n\nFor institutions to hold the keys is rarely operationally sensible: few financial institutions have the expertise in-house nor have the appetite to take on such a technically complex process.\n\nConsequently, for institutions to get on board with bitcoin, these issues will need to be addressed, and they will likely be addressed in the same way that the management of financial instruments usually are – with standards and centralized products. These standards may define what forks to accept and processes to follow to manage sanctions risks, which the industry will want to ensure is in line with peers to manage perceptions to clients and regulators.\n\nCentralized products managed by specialized companies may include custodians and clearing houses: we’re starting to see this already.\n\nWhile there is opposition to this centralization, and in particular how certain custodians manage forks, the reality is that few financial institutions, at least in the short term, have a desire to undertake this side of digital asset management. Many seasoned bitcoiners object to this centralization. And rightly so, at a technical level.\n\nWhat’s the point in censorship resistant money if you standardize and centralize it such that it can be censored?\n\n## Censorship-Resistant Money\n\nAs recently covered in [Time](http://time.com/5486673/bitcoin-venezuela-authoritarian/), bitcoin is effective for freedom because it allows people to store money away from a government they don’t trust. If there is a demand to keep money away from the government and bitcoin is effective in doing that, then naturally countries to which this is applicable will wish to restrict its usage.\n\nWe have already seen such controls with Zimbabwe and China. For such usage, bitcoin must be decentralized.\n\nCentralized custodians, clearing houses, and standards organizations can be influenced by such jurisdictions through law enforcement and consequently will not be held up to be censorship resistant.\n\nNow, if bitcoin for some reason is not effective as a tool for freedom, it is unlikely to adopted as such, in which case this whole discussion is moot. As much as I can probably assume that the reader is a fan of bitcoin and bullish for its eventual disruptive power, we should be pragmatic about the obstacles to it being adopted as a store of value.\n\nIt will need to significantly improve in its ease of use, particularly around key management. It will need a reduction in perceived volatility, and liquidity in these countries that need censorship resistant money, that by their nature likely have capital controls restricting money movement.\n\nUltimately, we will need a shift in perception to bitcoin being seen as a store of value on par with or superior to gold – which is no mean feat in itself. So while I’m optimistic we can get there, we may well have a long road.\n\nIf Bitcoin is successful in achieving this status, the logical conclusion is that we would expect bitcoin to hold a dual status globally. In countries where people have greater faith in the rule of law and central banks, censorship resistance is less attractive, and thus bitcoin could be seen as an investible commodity akin to gold with the majority of assets held in centralized institutions.\n\nIn parts of the world under oppressive regimes, however, bitcoin may be closer to an illegal or at the very least highly restricted asset, where there would need to be a greater emphasis and need of self-management of wallets and keys.\n\nIt would certainly be exciting if it was use in those countries that drove the price for the rest of the world.\n\nCentralization of bitcoin products and services are not in and of themselves bad, as there will be a different demand for the asset from different markets. It is critical, however, that bitcoin at its base remains a decentralized, censorship-resistant medium of value transfer and storage: as without censorship resistance, we don’t have an innovation at all.\n\n&#x200B;",1546856352,t3_adf6aw,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adf6aw/daily_discussion_january_07_2019/edgmncb/
Bitcoin,edizfvg,adf6aw,"Got this in my e-mail today.  Just a peek into what the Gemini exchange (Cameron + Tyler Winklevoss) is doing to build the future of money.\n\n\n---\n\nHello,\n\nToday, we ran a full-page ad in the New York Times outlining what we think the cryptocurrency revolution needs to succeed. We firmly believe this revolution will re-architect trade, the financial system, the Internet, and money as we know it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut it won’t be easy, and there is no guarantee. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe crypto revolution has the potential to solve meaningful, real-world problems that no other technology can – but only a thoughtful, rule-based approach will get us there. Revolutions that build sets of rules to ensure a better future, are the ones that last.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs a result, we are sharing the following set of guiding principles that we believe will help crypto fulfill its ultimate promise. As we build a real, sustainable bridge between the ‘old world’ of money and the future of money, we strive to always:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. Build the Rules.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo work with regulators to establish thoughtful regulation that promotes positive and fair outcomes for all.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn 2014, we testified at the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Virtual Currency Hearings. These hearings set the stage for a thoughtful dialogue between the NYDFS and the crypto community, eventually leading to the New York Virtual Currency Regulations. To date, NYDFS has licensed or chartered 12 virtual currency businesses. All of these businesses, including Gemini which is a New York trust company, operate within a regulatory framework that fosters consumer protection. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn addition, we have championed best practices that we believe make Gemini a safe place that fosters market integrity:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Marketplace Conduct Rules - On September 21, 2017, we adopted Marketplace Conduct Rules. These rules were modeled off of the Cboe Futures Exchange, LLC (CFE) Rulebook.\n- Marketplace Surveillance - On April 25, 2018, we announced our partnership with Nasdaq to implement Nasdaq’s SMARTS Market Surveillance technology to monitor the Gemini marketplace. As of August 10, 2018, SMARTS has been deployed on the Gemini marketplace.\n- Market Surveillance Team - On April 25, 2018, we hired a Head of Market Surveillance. Since then, we have built a Market Surveillance Team that continues to grow. \n- Virtual Commodities Association - On March 13, 2018, we published a proposal for the Virtual Commodity Association, an industry-sponsored self-regulatory organization for virtual commodity exchanges. CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz issued a public statement in support. The initial working group held its inaugural meeting in September 2018.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is just the beginning as we plan to continue to engage and work with regulators across the country on both the state and federal level (Gemini currently has licenses or approvals in 49 states), as well as internationally, to help shape thoughtful regulation and oversight so that consumers are afforded the same protections in the crypto market as they are in more traditional markets.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2. Play by the Rules.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo operate with necessary governmental or regulatory approvals. Ask for permission, not for forgiveness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlthough we started building Gemini in 2014, we waited until we received our New York trust company license in October of 2015 to begin operating. Our decision  —  to ask for permission, not forgiveness  —  was a first in cryptocurrency. We chose this path because we believed that in order to build the future of money, we had to first build trust in this new asset class.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe are compliance-centric company — we have developed (and will continue to invest in) cutting edge tools for our Compliance Department to ensure that Gemini is not a place for bad actors. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n3. Value Security Over Profit.\n\nTo never cut corners. To set the standard and follow best practices in order to provide a platform that is free of hacking and fraud.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFinancial crime affects both fiat and cryptocurrencies alike, but the crypto revolution will not succeed if our industry is plagued by nefarious activity. High-profile hacks that result in catastrophic losses must become a thing of the past, and we must shake the image of an industry characterized by poor security standards, internal controls, and policies and procedures. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn an effort to do so, we built our team with a security-first mentality from day one — a team that has built a state-of-the-art hot wallet and cold storage system and is deeply committed to employing cybersecurity best practices to protect your funds and the integrity of our platform. Recently, we added a further layer of protection by securing insurance coverage for the cryptocurrency that we hold on your behalf in our online hot wallet. We are, and will continue to be, committed to making Gemini a safe and secure platform to store your cryptocurrency. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n4. Be Principled.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo do the right thing – because it’s the right thing – even when it’s the hard thing. To put the interests of our customers ahead of our own and provide proper disclosures and transparency.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe four pillars of Gemini are Product, Security, Licensing, and Compliance. We refuse to compromise in any of these areas and will continue to invest in long-term solutions that align with our North Star of building a company that provides enduring value to our customers — for more than a 100 years — a Centurion. We will continue to do these things even when it’s the harder, less profitable, and slower path in the short-term. We’re in this for the long game; we’re trying to be the fastest tortoise in the race.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n5. Pay it Forward.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo bring cryptocurrency to the people and places that need it most.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLike the invention of money itself, which solved the coincidence of wants dilemma and removed the shackles of barter; like the evolution of credit and debt, which helped transfer capital from idle savers to risk-taking entrepreneurs; like the invention of the joint-stock company, which spurred on investment by enabling atomistic ownership structures and limiting an investor's liability to his or her stock ownership; and like the invention of the stock exchange, which allowed liquid markets for a company’s shares to emerge, the invention of cryptocurrencies have irrevocably expanded our concept of money and will forever change how we exchange, transfer, and store it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNot since the dawn of the Internet has technology had the potential for such profound impact. But in order to make such an impact, we must bring this technology to all reaches of the globe. We have started by building the Gemini dollar, which brings U.S. dollars onto the blockchain and to anyone in the world with an Internet connection. This is the first of many projects we hope to embark on that help foster, among other things, financial inclusion (e.g., banking the 1 billion+ unbanked citizens of the world), reduced friction and costs of cross-border payments (e.g., remittances), access to digital safe-haven assets (e.g., buying bitcoin through the Gemini Mobile App), and a more decentralized Internet that returns control of your data back to you. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nJoin the Gemini Mission\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe are only at the beginning of this journey. Yes, some of the hardest work remains ahead, but we’re up for the challenge and we know you are too. We welcome industry leaders, developers, builders, entrepreneurs, investors, and whoever else, to join us as we strive to build rules for this amazing revolution that will ensure not just the future of money, but a better future for all.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nCameron + Tyler\n\n---\n",1546911028,t3_adf6aw,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adf6aw/daily_discussion_january_07_2019/edizfvg/

Bitcoin,edhsazr,adhj7f,"While you are correct about the cash settled product and it’s direct effect on the supply/demand of the underlying product, I believe your view may be a little short sided.  The main reason for it, is every short doesn’t impact the supply/demand of a product.  The act of short selling the market is when an investor/trader “borrows” a security, sells it on the open market, and buys it back at a later price.  This ultimately has no direct impact on supply/demand because they borrowed the product.  If they didn’t borrow the product and try to buy it back, it would simply be called selling.  Additionally, derivatives have a major impact on the underlying product they represent.  A perfect example is the flash crash on May 6, 2010, which originated from the CME E-mini S&P500 contract (a cash settled product), but dragged the price of the individual stocks with it.

Bitcoin,edhwbtc,adiis9,"This is patently untrue, in multiple ways, because it’s untrue for banks as both moneylenders and moneyholders.\n\n1) Banks have enormously improved financial inclusion as moneyholders. Previous to banks’ existence, moneyholding had to be performed by the individual, and as such could only be effectively done by those with enough money to provide for their own security. This meant nobles, proto-capitalists, brigands, and governmental leaders. Because banks are started with high amounts of capital, they can provide security while also allowing those who are poor to store their money inside. Yes, I realize that inflation infringes on this guarantee of security, but everyone losing X% of their initial investment due to inflation is far more democratic than everyone below a certain capital threshold losing 100% of their investment while those above it lose 0%.\n\n2) Banks as money lenders have dramatically increased inclusion because loans collateralize large expenditures into multiple small expenditures. Because of this, those with small incomes who might have to wait decades to save up money for large purchases can do so immediately by spreading the cost out over a longer period of time, into payments they can afford. This is far more inclusive than a system incapable of moneylending. In a system incapable of moneylending, it would be impossible for the poor to decide that they wanted to start businesses, or own houses, or even buy a car, without waiting years if not decades to save up to buy it wholesale.\n\nBitcoin certainly makes the former more inclusive: instead of needing a bank, value can be stored at home, or in more secure vaults, but far more secure than dollar bills under the mattress. However, it is far less capable of the latter because it is inherently deflationary, which means that it disfavors the lendee. \n\nSo what is the utility of bitcoin? That it’s more secure and more capable of handling cross-border, or wartime, or high-volume transactions. Not that it increases inclusivity. It does not. Since the amount is fixed, bitcoin is fundamentally incapable of increasing financial inclusivity by allowing the poor to subdivide large purchases into affordable increments.",1546888535,t3_adiis9,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adiis9/banks_have_been_given_the_better_part_of_history/edhwbtc/

Bitcoin,edipja9,adjeh0,Fair enough. I had been starting to think it meant there would literally be as much scaling as we'd possibly need.,1546904265,t1_edinu6w,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adjeh0/help_me_understand_if_this_bcasher_i_talked_to_is/edipja9/
Bitcoin,ediu5dc,adjeh0,">Google knew they could slowly build data centers. Is there a rough consensus about how lightning Network might reduce this long figure I quoted for the number of years required for mass adoption?\n\nDo you honestly think that Bitcoin is going to be mass adopted in a year?  How about 5 years?  10 years?\n\nWe *do* have time to slowly build better scaling on top of Lightning.\n\nIf you think we should work faster, then I suggest putting money where your mouth is and sponsoring some LN developers, like the freelancers /u/ZmnSCPxj or /u/renepickhardt , to help LN development.\n\n>If plans are a dime a dozen, please tell me: what plan/plans are LN enthusiasts thinking of for addressing this particular scaling concern?\n\nChannel factories, statechains, multiparticipant channels.  One can argue that statechains are just channel factories by another name with a pile of steaming custodiality on top, but well.  Multiparticipant channels become unwieldy beyond n=5 and should really be made into channel factories anyway.  Channel factories potentially let dozens of people create channels with each other (and if at least one of them is already connected to the wider network then that is enough for all of them to be connected to the wider network) while having only a single onchain UTXO represent all their channels.\n\nChannel factories are the next step for now.  With better online-ness it may be possible to have hundreds in a single channel factory, with each channel factory anchored on a single onchain UTXO.  We still need additional 10x->100x improvement on top of that, but channel factories by themselves already cuts down your estimate from 38 years to ~3.8years give or take a year or so (at 10 per factory), which should be enough provided we can figure out a good way to spec channel factories.  More practically we can probably connect much of the first world in LN with channel factories in 5 years or so, with more than a few channels per person and with some blockspace used by onchain users.\n\nThe great thing is that channel factories won't require any blocksize increase while providing 10x scaling.  We just need one or two more 10x scalings on top of that to onboard the whole world in less than a decade, and we might never need to increase the blocksize again.\n\nThe next issue with scaling LN is the public routemap.  Eventually the public routemap will contain so many channels that it will no longer easily fit in the working memory of lower-end devices.  Hopefully by that time lower-end devices will have larger working memories, but eventually we will need to develop heuristics for pruning the public routemap and keeping only sections of the public routemap with a high probability of successfully routing our desired payments, and methods to trustlessly query sections of the public routemap from other nodes.",1546907388,t1_edi52hf,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adjeh0/help_me_understand_if_this_bcasher_i_talked_to_is/ediu5dc/

Bitcoin,edjt0di,adjeh0,"The concept I believe everyone is trying to get across to you is that LN is exciting because it is simply the first 2nd layer application, with probably heaps more to come. Like the first real application on top of tcp/ip was email, then FTP, then things like bulletin boards and forums started, then we had usenet groups which were paid for, then we had proprietary systems like microsoft network, compuserve and AOL, then we got www, then bit torrent etc.\n\nI saw the bcash drivel that your friend was repeating to you. Did they mention that the bcash idea is to have a new 200GB block EVERY TEN MINUTES ?!?!?\n\nThat is 1.2 terrabytes per hour or 24.5 terrabytes of new blockchain data a day.\n\nI know these folks are 7 years behind and love to quote moore's law (which died 7 years ago), but that is a lot of storage needed to keep up.\n\nThey also like to quote nielsen's law which says internet speeds increase by 1.5X per year. I'd like to know where and to whom this kind of speed increase is an actual reality, but seriously, to broadcast and verify 200GB every 10 minutes ?!?!?  The bandwidth will really increase THAT much at 1.5 time a year ?!?!?\n\nThere will be plenty of layer 2 solutions besides LN, there will be layer 3 solutions. Some will be through 'trusted third parties'. None of that matters on layer 2 and 3, as long as security is not compromised on layer one.\n\nBcash was an important spectacular public failure in that it showed the world the danger of trusting the leaders of a bosscoin in layer one 'management'. Compromising layer one security has destroyed any possibility of anyone taking bcash (both versions) seriously, nor any bosscoin.\n\nBitcoin has no management. Bitcoin is bossless.\n\n'Onboarding' will happen organically as user friendly solutions evolve. Adoption is already way fast. The tech is ever evolving. \n\nLN is arguably the first real successful use of smart contract in the crypto space.",1546937355,t1_edipja9,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adjeh0/help_me_understand_if_this_bcasher_i_talked_to_is/edjt0di/

Bitcoin,edj5jiq,adk7nu,"If you want to have a try with LN, you could install **Eclair wallet for Android**, which is quite simple to use. You can find some popular services accepting LN on [https://1ml.com](https://1ml.com)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LN is an off-chain scaling techology.** It consists of many payment channels. A payment channel looks like ordinary 2of2 multisig address, but it's much more than that, because both parties hold some unbroadcasted transactions which could be broadcasted to the bitcoin network in case of misbehavior (like stealing spent funds back).\n\nTherefore, currently **LN requires the user to keep online, at least every now and then**, in order to watch potential cheating transaction broadcasted to the bitcoin network by a malicious counterparty. If the user is unable to run his own LN node to do that, there must be someone else to do so instead, such technology is under development, which is called ""watchtower"".\n\nFurthermore, since HTLC requires that all participating parties must negotiate with each other to complete each payment, **it's impossible to receive LN payment offline** \- ~~except for custodial wallets~~ this is true even for custodial wallets (although such service could free their users from maintaining LN nodes), because the provider of such custodial service still has to run his LN node & keep it online, which is not the case with ordinary on-chain transactions. In addtition, custodial services provided by 3rd party are obviously against the trustless/decentralizaion idea of bitcoin.\n\nFor example, if you want to pay Walmart, you could open a channel with them directly. Once the channel setup is complete, you and Walmart could repartition the funds stored in the 2of2 multisig address, which is equivalent to sending funds back and forth. But, this is obviously quite limited, because a single channel only enables two related party to transact with each other, in other words, the fund is in fact locked in that 2of2 multisig address. Techniques like splicing may relieve such limitation, but you must do on-chain transactions to take your funds out of a channel, which doesn't meet the idea of off-chain scaling.\n\nThe core idea of LN is that a payment could be ""routed"" through a series of payment channels, therefore the limitations mentioned above could be circumvented. HTLC ensures that the relaying nodes along the path cannot cheat, otherwise they would be penalized. For example, If Bob has some spare bitcoins, he could use these bitcoins to open payment channels with some popular businesses, like Starbucks, McDonald's, whatever. After that, you could simply open a channel with Bob, then Bob will use his spare bitcoins which are already deposited in the payment channels to ""route"" payments for you. In more detail, while making a payment, your wallet software would have some negotiation with both Bob and Starbucks first, which ensures both you and Bob cannot cheat against each other. After that, Bob first pays Starbucks with some of his spare bitcoins with confidence, you then pay Bob the price of a cup of coffee+a little bit routing fee.",1546915308,t3_adk7nu,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adk7nu/eli5_what_is_ln_and_how_do_i_use_it/edj5jiq/

Bitcoin,edk7bu1,adk7nu,">What if I send a large amount of BTC using LN and no node has enough balance to afford it ? Will the transaction stuck in the network ?\n\nNo, it won't stuck. It will simply fail, after several rounds of probes/attempts. AMP (a WIP tech) could improve this by combining local balances of multiple channels.\n\n>Where would the original BTC go es ?\n\nPayment channels. A payment channel looks like an ordinary 2of2 multisig address, but both participating parties hold their own unboradcasted transactions, which can be broadcasted whenever something goes wrong, like cheating penalty/unilateral force-closing.\n\n>What is the concept of deposit balance of LN BTC wallet ?\n\nThere's actually no unified ""deposit balance"" in LN, although a LN wallet could simply add up local balances of all existing channels together. Different channel has different counterparty, thus they have different liquidity or ""reachable ranges"". However, a wallet could try to rebalance its channels (by on-chain operations like splicing) to circumvent such problem.\n\n>Would BTC LN affects the BTC price by this ?\n\nIt's hard to say. Some hype might arise, but LN should be able to improve usability of Bitcoin in general after all.

Bitcoin,edi16mr,adkad3,"What are you thoughts about leaking identity data via sending out coinjoined utxos from Wasabi in the same block?\n\nIf a user enqueues 1 BTC, and it takes a few hours for these funds to be coinjoined (in ten different joins), those funds stay in Wasabi for quite a while, typically, until the user withdraws them to their general-purpose wallet (e.g. trezor). But the fact that 10 coinjoined utxos (likely from consecutive coinjoins) are being sent out in 10 different transactions on the same block gives a non-trivial indication that they're going out to the same holder. The timing of the ""withdrawal"" from Wasabi can leak a user's identity, and the size of the leak is inversely proportional to how many other participants withdrew at the same time. \n\nOne way I can think of to improve on this, and possibly improve the UX of the wallet as well, is to pre-schedule withdrawals of all participants funds to non-wasabi addresses in the same block. e.g. the block immediately following the coinjoin. In terms of UX, it also eliminates the inevitable step of taking your funds out of Wasabi (I assume more Wasabi users just use it for coinjoins and not to hold/transact normally). As a user, I'd have to not just enqueue the funds, but also provide the target addresses for them (enough to send each utxo separately). But that's something users end up doing anyway - might as well allow them to do it ahead of time, no?\n\nNaturally this problem goes away if there are enough coinjoins going around, because the chances of withdrawals occurring in the same block go up, thus increasing the anonymity. But a the current scale (not many / day), the leak might not be negligible. ",1546891119,t3_adkad3,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adkad3/ama_im_nopara73_cofounder_of_wasabi_wallet_ask_me/edi16mr/

Bitcoin,edhtsp5,adkad3,"> 1) Will it be possible to ever use Wasabi on a phone? (or would u create an app for it?)\n\n**TLDR.:** Not anytime soon.\n\nFrom a timing point of view there is a [tremendous amount](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/Meta#traditional-bitcoin-addresses-vs-bech32-adoption) of improvements those can make make privacy in Bitcoin cheaper, faster, more convenient and more intuitive. New systems and features tend to carve old features and architectures in stone, so it would be more efficient to do porting to mobile after we cannot do anything meaningful anymore.\n\nFrom a technological point of view, there are some practical issues building a privacy wallet to smartphones.  \nThe main issue that is blocking us right now is light wallet privacy on the network level. The only light wallet architecture that does not leak the links between your addresses is [BIP157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki)-[BIP158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki) (Client Side Filtering, Neutrino.) These filters that the clients download are if over 1GB. For now, we are cheating here, because Wasabi is a bech32-only wallet, so we only build filters from bech32 addresses, thus our wallet can still feel as a light wallet on desktop, but as bech32 adoption grows we'll even have scaling issues on desktop without additional code optimization, which is possible it's just a lot of hard work and we don't have unlimited resources. Another issue with this is the network usage. After a a wallet gets the filters, it downloads full blocks from Bitcoin nodes, which are ok on desktops, but on mobile, network resource should not be taken lightly. Finally, coinjoins are bloating wallets with addresses, which results in a lot of CPU usage, which in desktop is insignificant, but on mobile battery is scarce. Sure there are many ways to solve these, too, but they are more like compromises than solutions and **the path to a bad software is filled with compromises.**  \nFinally Tor. Tor is an anonymity network Wasabi cannot be used without. This adds humongous amount on friction even to desktop development, on untested mobile platforms I can imagine so many things go wrong.  \n\nAnd these are only the existing features. What complications can we expect if we add Lightning?  \n\nFortunately smartphones are also improving quickly, so not everything is lost.  \n\nI also hope Samourai will be implemented to iOS and grows itself out of Beta by the time we even get there to consider creating a mobile wallet.\n\n> 2) How do you see Bitcoin developing in the next 5 years?\n\nI am most excited about Lightning Network and privacy improvements. I most worried that the mainstream to pour in before we make this two crucial fronts of Bitcoin strong enough.",1546887161,t1_edhoycy,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adkad3/ama_im_nopara73_cofounder_of_wasabi_wallet_ask_me/edhtsp5/
Bitcoin,edhq0y8,adkad3,"1) In theory, Wasabi could support smart phones (Android, iOS). In practice, these platforms and their tools are not mature enough just yet. The concept of network analysis resistant smartphone wallets are not yet proven. If we would try to port Wasabi's code, the wallet would use too much disk space, battery and network today. Another implementation issue comes from Wasabi's reliance on Tor, which adds another layer of friction.",1546885182,t1_edhoycy,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adkad3/ama_im_nopara73_cofounder_of_wasabi_wallet_ask_me/edhq0y8/
Bitcoin,edi3xc4,adkad3,"[Yes, we do.](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/Meta/#simple-send-improvements)  \n\nAs I've noted in that post I envision the ultimate Pay to EndPoint in a way that the user wouldn't even have to be aware that he is using Pay to EndPoint in the first place. For this the requirement would be to have a dedicated anonymity network work in the background that your wallet could check against the address you received and if at any point someone is listening on the other end, then you make your transaction in a trustless manner.\n\nDreaming aside, current implementations and implementation plans of P2EP is nowhere near as ambitious and from this Wasabi's plans aren't exempt either.  \n\nIn Wasabi we have an advantage that all of our users are using Tor in the background, so we could just set up a hidden service they're listening on and our users could add their friends by adding the onion endpoint and communicate there.  \n\n1. At first it could be a simple P2P, end-to-end encrypted chat client that can be used mainly to securely transfer Bitcoin addresses.  \n2. Later they could use this to send each other while facilitating merge avoidance.\n3. Then send each other by using P2EEP sender-receiver scheme.\n5. Finally send to other people, outside of Wasabi while doing a 2 of 2 coinjoin.  \n\nThis is how I see it play out, the beauty of this that after you added someone you don't even need to be aware of anything, everything can happen automatically in the background.",1546892594,t1_edhpn71,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adkad3/ama_im_nopara73_cofounder_of_wasabi_wallet_ask_me/edi3xc4/

Wasabi is bech32-only wallet, thus we only build filters regarding bech32 addresses. I know it won't scale in the long term, but we have some years to optimize before it becomes an issue.\n\nA more elaborate description of our validation algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. First a Server creates an `index`. This `index` contains `block hash` and `Golomb-Rice filter` pairs.  \n2. Clients download this `index` over Tor.  \n3. A Client from the index figures out which `blocks` it is interested in (there are false positives.)  \n4. The Client asks random Bitcoin Nodes for blocks: one `block` - one Node, over the clearnet.  \n5. The Client verifies the downloaded `block hash` matches to the already known `block hash` (downloaded from the Server in step 2.) and validates the `block`.",1546891074,t1_edhrjqe,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adkad3/ama_im_nopara73_cofounder_of_wasabi_wallet_ask_me/edi13mb/

What do I do with this lump sum which is just below half of what I queued for coinjoin 2 days ago. This just happened after my other transactions started getting confirmations. There were about 7 0.10xxx transactions starting now they are 5 and this lump block showed up. Does not say anything is still queued for coinjoin, despite me queuing the whole 1 btc initially (2 days ago)\n\nOften you have to wait to confirmation for remixing (not always though, 2-3 unconfirmed coinjoins can be built on top of each other.)\n\n> What is best to do with the multiple 0.10xxxx transactions ?\n\n[Combining Mixed Coins - Privacy MegaThread](https://old.reddit.com/r/WasabiWallet/comments/avxbjy/combining_mixed_coins_privacy_megathread/)\n\n>  If I want to withdraw 5000 usd(approx 7 x 0.10xxx transactions), can I withdraw them all to one address?\n\nYes, that amunt should be fine.\n\n>  Should I do each segment to an individual address that pools everything?\n\nIf you can that' be even better.\n\n> Is there any loss of anonymity if you withdraw them all to one address?\n\nYes, there is.

Bitcoin,ednbd8g,adkad3,"> That being said, if you take a look at the graph in my article, it would suffer from the same scaling issues due to Bitcoin network fees as JoinMarket does\n\nI dont follow; Would it not just be the lesser of the two curves? It would also become elastic, since a high demand for it could boost rate which could attract more liquidity to clear the market.\n\n> since in Wasabi you'd have to pay until the round is filled and you wouldn't even mix everything, like in JoinMarket, only a small portion of it.\n\nImagine that the coordinator has a set of liq providers who have registered an amount of liquidity they are willing to provide, and a price for which they will participate. (they could adjust their fee rates and amounts over time)\n\nWhen filling out a round, the coordinator could reach out to those liquidity providers and include them in any unfilled rounds, starting from the least expensive. Of course, it would only be able to include them if other participants in the round have agreed to contribute towards the cost of liquidity sufficient to cover the expense.\n\nAn concrete example of a two participant round: \n\n* a liquidity provider (X) agreed to provide inputs to a join on demand, in exchange for fee coverage (txfee + coordinator fee) plus 20 basis points, then \n* a normal tumbling user (Y) indicates that they are willing to pay up to 50 basis points extra to expedite their transaction (above the standard txfee and collaboration fee costs)\n* lets say Y's tumbling amount is 10 million sat, and this means Y is pledging up to an additional 50K sat towards liquidity, but would prefer to pay as little as possible.\n* Including client X in the CJ transaction has a cost for the inputs and outputs to be included. It also has a cost for the coordination fee. Lets say for the sake of argument those sum to 10K sat\n* Assume client X is the cheapest offer for liquidity, verified by client and coordinator\n* Client X expects 20K sat as its fee, 20bps * 10million, and the total cost to include the liquidity is 30K, and since there is 50K available, X is invited to join the round\n* Client Y pays a total of 30K sat extra to induce X to participate, on top of the 10K normal fees, for a total cost of 40K sat out of 10M\n\n\nOf course, if a cheaper liquidity source is found before the round completes, X could be uninvited from the round on that basis. If there is not enough satoshi available to purchase liquidity, or not enough liquidity on offer, then the round has to wait as usual. \n\nBut as soon as enough liquidity is available the transaction is completed. \n\nIt provides an economic incentive for liquidity to be provided, and allows the cost to float with the market rate. \n\nThe cost of liquidity could be evenly split across all pledging participants, up to the limit they indicated when joining the round. If they find they are waiting too long, they could increase their proposed amount in order to attract more liquidty and/or expedite the completion of the round.\n\n> even if I think it wouldn't be feasible in the long run.\n\nWhy not?\n\nI dont see why it is not strictly superior. \n\nEven if the average is zero fee, there could be times when the network is slow or lacking for participants, and those that do participate want to do more tumbling that is possible. The risk and overhead cost of operating a liquidity provider hot wallet could be low enough and the fees high enough to attract additional liquidity. \n\nThe liq providers could also benefit from tumbling as their primary earning. For example, a tumbling client with a very low time preference who is not in a hurry, may offer liquidity participation at no additional cost other than subsidization of their txfee + coordinator fee. (or even less) In this case, they are not participating for profit, but for the benefits of tumbilng - they simply want cheaper and slower tumbling.\n\n> but instead of direct transactions, these would be self-mixing transactions as always. \n\nI dont follow; do you mean solo tumbling ?

In this Wasabi-JM mix you would only pay for the speed, but you wouldn't be able to mess with the amount,\n\nI see those as the same; in Wasabi you get change and pay some fees. If you have enough inputs, you could get slightly less change and get slightly more fees, within the bounds of the join structuring. \n\nThat said; it would be nice if a predictable output amount could be expected. That way a ""spend"" operation could be identical from a ""tumble"" operation. \n\n>  In JoinMarket, anyone who participates can map the links.\n\nThe anonymity model in zerolink is clearly better. In JM not everyone can map all the links. It depends on their order of participation. the Taker always can,  someone who controls the IRC server arguably could. It does reduce the value of joining for the makers, unlike wasabi's model.\n\n> I mean, in JoinMarket you are mixing to other people. Your transaction is a mix in itself. In Wasabi you're mixing to yourself.\n\nIm confused by this terminology here; if other people participate in a round, then  you are mixing with other people. \n\nDo you mean that the funds must always return to yourself, and cannot be part of a spend to an outside address you control ? (jm doesnt handle that well either)  If so, then we are just using different terminology.\n\nI think it would be a huge benefit if a spend was indistinguishable from a tumble. Do you think it is not possible for zerolink to allow spends ?\n\n\nTransaction jargon:\n\n* Join/Mix = any transaction with multiple separate participants with separate aims.\n* Spend = a transaction including a transfer of funds from one person to another, usually to buy something or pay a debt\n* Tumble = a transaction where the funds are returned to the same owner, only done for the purposes of increasing anonymity\n\nIf wasabi zerolink join tx's included an indistinguishable amount of tumbles and spends, then it would be much harder to perform forensics\n\nIts the difference between:\n\n* Tumble, Tumble , Tumble, Spend, Tumble , Tumble\n\nand\n\n* Join, Join, Join, Join, Join, Join\n\nMany of the forensic weaknesses of JoinMarket come at entry and exit points from the tumbling modes, and the wallet exodus. \n\nAlso, Unlike samourai, where a ""spend"" is pretending to be a ""Tumble"" using stonewall, its much better to perform a real tumble with other uncorrelated coins. \n\n",1547137262,t1_edpn2kp,/r/Bitcoin/comments/adkad3/ama_im_nopara73_cofounder_of_wasabi_wallet_ask_me/edpxgp4/

I'm a former editor at TechCrunch and current EIC at TheBlock and the way sponsored posts work is they try to piggyback on the goodwill associated with real content on the site and 99% of the time sponsored content is either ignored or mistaken for real content and you get pissed off.\n\nSo we asked what would it take for a win-win-win - the marketer gets GOOD eyeballs, the site gives back to its readers, and the readers get a little cash. The best solution is HypeHop.\n\nLook: you're being surveilled. You click a link on Amazon and that garbage follows you around the Internet and creates a dossier on you. In our case we don't store your face or video, the video is entirely client side, and we use your face as confirmation you're watching and not messing around on Reddit. You can game it, sure, but it's the only way right now to confirm that. We also take emotional readings - happy, sad, angry - using client side tools. If you're going to give up your privacy, why not get paid by the marketers who want it so badly? \n\nIf it sounds weird remember that once upon a time some dude said ""Hey, wouldn't it be cool if you could rent out your basement to a stranger?"" and they ignored him for years until they didn't. \n\nRight now it's kind of a ProductHunt that pays you to browse it but in the future we will offer embeds.

Or did they simply ban them and tell them to close their account and remove their funds?  If it's the latter, then it's arguably reasonable, as companies can deny business with certain clients for any reason, and the market can decide if such behaviour is reasonable or not (personally I'm not yet sure how I feel about it), but if they confiscated or indefinitely froze their funds, that would be terrible and any exchange doing that should be shunned.

Bitcoin,edaxc43,acty49,"Exactly what I thought, opinions are so diverse on the thread.\n\nI really enjoy reading what random people says about BTC!\n\nIt helps me seeing how we are still clearly in the ''early lunatics phase'' haha and that no one really think about Bitcoin as a technology, which is saddest thing about this... because they themselves are on Facebook/Youtube/Netflix/Mobile Banking/Gmail... why can't they picture the value behind this? because those companies are more huge ''AI-for-consumerism'' ''marketing'' corporations than anything remotely/closely related to tech.\n\nThey saw the complete infrastructure inversion and disruptive technologies get all those really nice things built ''on top of it'', but it's harder to make people realize the impact of those tech on consumer protection, and facilitation with programmation of economic exchanges/relations between individuals locally/globally. Most people don't really care anyway about any of their personal info/privacy so I would not bet on that to make people see why Cryptos are a necessity and all and the importance of FIAT & Crypto coexistence.\n\nSome people see BTC as what it is, a recipe and a base, flat, decentralized protocol.The web/TCP/IP did wonders for content distribution & many many other applications. It's very easy to picture with that in mind why Bitcoin/Cryptos will effectively & constantly bring more & more financial inclusion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean damn, even Corn nowadays is a platform in itself, a technology.  Corn is a rich source of infinitely-flexible polysaccharide starch. The same thing with rice. Corn is dominant because of pricing not because it’s a single tentpole.(You are slowly realizing it has literally been years, maybe decades, since you ate any meal made without corn. It's used in EVERYTHING and is in EVERY product. And no not because of some ''GMO conspiracy'' crap or whatever, but because it is a technology, a platform. Eat at any fast food or dine-in restaurant chain and avoiding corn becomes impossible.  When broken down, derivatives of corn get used as a food filler, texturiser, emulsifier, sweetener, preservative, adhesive and many other applications. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the big problem is that like always, price dominates the conversation. Media wants clicks to sell their ads. People LOVE talking or speculating about PRICE all the time. It's the first thing that comes in mind, after all the ''terrorists are using Bitcoin today'', exchanges & wallet ''hacking'', robbery, ransomware & other things they consider very scary complicated and weird geek/nerd stuff.\n\nOf course, for most people in developed country, Bitcoin is not ready for them. It is for of billions of people that have worst, bad or no access to financial services. Why would most people in developed country use BTC today, if hes not ''investing'' or using it to escape a little everyday digitally out of the global banking cartel by mining a little or earning BTC on a daily basis or simply buy with FIAT a small amounts everyday?\n\nThe tech will evolve so much in the next 10-20 years and when they are going to use it, probably when they won't even know it (like most people don't know banks use HyperLedger/R3)\n\nPeople that have no idea about the nature of the financial system that they live in right now can't understand or picture in their head why Cryptos are important to 2/3 of the Earth (and the rest too yes)The problem is that it's kinda like trying to explain Wikipedia or Facebook on paper, he might look at you weird and say ''that shit won't work man'' (also depending on if you ask them in 1990,2000,2010 or if hes 20,30,70 or 80 years old and knows about the fact internet is not like 25 years ago haha)\n\nSome average Reddit users really sees this as a pyramid scheme (but not their own Fiat $ cause they don't see the global daily currency war & the real on-going massive scale corruption of the banking cartel & secrecy advantage that Fiat has) but that's simply normal\n\nSome sees this as 120% ''gambling nerd money'', some of them have with small, medium or no amount at all\n\nSome sees this as a way to make money (the reason why I first joined mining in 2016) but stayed when they realized how deep it was.Some really think ''miners'' or large holders get ''all the profits all the time'' and think those people are taking ''no risk at all'' having stacks & stacks of coins/miners instead of FIAT?\n\nAnd of course some have some have a funny conspiracy theories about it profiting only 1 or 2 guys like ''Satoshi'' himself and totally controlled by the Chinese Gov.",1546701231,t1_edartu6,/r/Bitcoin/comments/acty49/here_is_what_the_average_reddit_user_thinks_about/edaxc43/

Bitcoin,edc89va,acua4t,">They have absolutely no obligation to use SW.\n\nYes, they don't.\n\n>Then their lack of SW doesn't matter. \n\nIt actually does, I'd like to redirect you to the tragedy of the commons dilemma: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\n\nIn shared ecosystems, it is required of all of its participants to be good stewards of shared resources and optimize accordingly, in this case, block size. Another great example in computing is the memory footprint of global BGP routing tables, ie. the number of routes that is shared between all global routers that carry full routing tables. By not being good stewards and not optimizing, we spoil the shared resource for all and harm the ecosystem -- in Bitcoin this means Bitcoin nodes are squeezed out from participating hurting censorship resistance and in the greater Internet, networks disconnecting from the internet due to routers failing from OOM (out of memory) events.\n\nLuckily, the Bitcoin blockchain has built in protections against this, specifically transaction fees. Those who don't optimize (adopt segwit, batch transactions, optimize transaction sizes) are economically penalized through higher fees. Services and users that adopt sooner are rewarded by paying less for transactions.\n\nThe selling point of Segwit wasn't exactly optionality, but rather that it gave each service or user their respective required time to upgrade to the new protocol. Networks adhere to the law of inertia, larger networks have more inertia and take longer to adopt/change hence we stick to soft-forks to smoothen out the process.\n\nSegwit will eventually replace the old P2PKH/P2SH schema. But it is absolutely important that we understand the tragedy of the commons dilemma as we continue to build out this new global network.

Bitcoin,eeecby0,acupww,"OP There are a few different options to choose from if you want to use your PayPal account to buy cryptocurrency:\n\n**Peer-to-peer marketplaces.** The first option is to buy crypto through a peer-to-peer marketplace, 	such as LocalBitcoins or Paxful. These exchanges allow buyers and sellers to trade directly with one 	another, giving the seller the freedom to set their own exchange 	rate and accepted payment methods. Some sellers accept PayPal, and you can filter your search of available deals on the marketplace by 	payment method to help find a suitable seller.  \n **Cryptocurrency exchanges.** Most exchanges don’t accept PayPal payments; however, you can use 	the VirWox platform to exchange fiat currency for SLL (Second Life Linden Dollars), which 	you can then use to acquire bitcoin.  \n**Peer-to-peer lending platforms.** xCoins is 	a peer-to-peer lending platform for bitcoin lenders and borrowers. 	It accepts PayPal as a payment method for people wanting to access a 	“secured loan” of bitcoin.  \nPros and cons of buying crypto with PayPal\n\n#### Pros\n\nIf you already have a PayPal account, payment is quick and convenient\n\nSafe and secure payment method\n\nAllows you to buy crypto with your country currencies  \n\n#### Cons\n\nVery high fees substantially increase the cost of the transaction  \n If the platform doesn’t accept your local currency, currency conversion fees apply  \nLimited 	number of platforms support PayPal  \n \n\nIt’s possible to buy cryptocurrency with PayPal, but should you? The high fees involved and shortage of platforms that accept PayPal payments means that there are other more cost-effective and convenient options available.\n\nFor example, rather than funding your PayPal account from your credit card and then using that balance to buy crypto, you could use a platform that allows you to buy crypto directly with your credit card. For me , I rather use exchanges like Luno by bank in my deposit then receive the bitcoin directly before I continue with my usual activites at vegascasino.io .

So in the end the US may enter recession by its own actions, without China doing anything. \n\nTrump wants to keep the QE printing presses going to devalue the USD against the yuan, to make US exports more competitive, which is why he wants to fire the Fed chair Jerome Powell.\n\nOf course if (or when) things turn ugly the Fed can start money printing again, but it may lead to hyper-inflation next time and the USD finally losing global reserve status. As you point out no one knows where this is heading, we’re in uncharted territory. \n\nEdit: Don’t forget Russia, China and others are buying as much gold as they can, through official and unofficial channels. Virtually everything mined each year globally and whatever else they can get their hands on.

All evidence suggests it was sold off gradually and illegally, melted down to 1kg bars, which ultimately made their way to China. Hence why the Fed will not allow an audit, or even allow sovereign nations that deposited their gold at the Fed for 'safe keeping' to even inspect their own gold. You may want to look into Germany and other countries demanding their gold back from the Fed.

Many people think they can, but in actuality, most active traders cannot beat the market, after fees, and this applies in spades to individual stock traders. The entire HODL meme was born from a frustrated crypto trader throwing in the towel on active trading, and I would argue that an 8 % headwind would make beating the market virtually statistically impossible. Also, just how much money could you really have needing to onramp, that you could not have sent in 10 days ago ? Part of one paycheck ? If you are that good at timing the market, you should have almost all of your funds in an exchange (or cold storage) in advance, and save the fee, but the truth is, timing is not that easy, or you would be living the high life, rather than having internet debates with randoms. I have an aunt that was SURE she could time the market, of course she lost all her money timing the market, but she was still convinced she could do it, and would do the 'play money' trading with online stock trading companies, even though her real money was spent.

He is extremely knowledgeable and provides in our opinion, unbiased analysis. He does a great job explaining flow charts so you can make educated decisions on your cryptocurrency plays. He cranks out a video 5 times a week and does a mix of information, data livestreams, and interviews. We also love how transparent he is, in his hope for a decentralized economy free of monetary policies.  \n\n2. CRYPTO LARK\n\nCrypto Lark seems to have teletransported through time. It’s like he came out from a 70’s movie, in a good way.  He provides great insights on different Alt Coins, Mining, and Interviews. Our favorite video is his price prediction videos. He calls out the BS from “gurus” giving price prediction. He provides some great insights on how to proceed with your trading, goals you should put in place, etc… Plus, he is all about piling up Bitcoins.  \n\n3. CRYPTO DAILY\n\nIf you love sarcasm, Crypto Daily is your dude. Funny guy, who brings a twist to cryptocurrency news. He also provide time-stamps to all his videos so you can skip to what interests you (how genius is that?).  Plus, in our opinion, he provides the best crypto music videos on Youtube. \n\n4. SUPPOMAN\n\nAnother one on the list is Suppoman. He has a Udemy Course which he pushes pretty heavily on his channel. But if you can get pass that, he does a great job breaking down the news and provides simple ways to get started.  He also goes through different Alt Coins positive and negatives reviews so you can make educated decisions on your investment plays.\n\n5. CRYPTO NEWS\n\nDid Crypto News get a Bitcoin tattoo? That’s a good look. Crypto News is hosted by Matthew Beasley and provides a show Monday through Friday. He originally created the channel to help people invest in Ripple during the early Ripple boom. He now extended the channel and provides interactive interviews where he gives his audience full access to his guests.

Bitcoin,eddpzoc,ad3dbx,"Only 100 years from now, will we look back and realize the magnitude of Bitcoin’s importance in the arch of human development.\n\nFor the first time, individuals are seizing monetary monopoly away from the state. For a long time, the monetary authority of the state was necessary to establish ubiquitous value systems that enabled efficient trade. 2009 marked the invention of a commodity with intrinsically valuable characteristics (divisibility, verifiable scarcity, ease of transfer, openness) that will push extrinsic characteristics (network effects) and the benefits (stability, liquidity, value storage) to take hold given time. As superpowers continue to wield their monetary weapons (USA/China) at the expense of less powerful nations, self-interest will drive individuals and eventually those nations to adopt Cryptocurrencies (most likely one) as the standard for value.\n\n2009 marked the beginning of the revolution. What we will see 100 years from now as the natural evolution of money, today seems radical. What does a world look like where fiat regimes are reigned in and every man, woman, and entity is held accountable for its fiscal deeds? Most people use simplistic mental models framed by the structure of their world today to assess the likelihood of events in the future and as a result, they miss the first principles that are driving Bitcoin’s story.\n\nDon’t let price day-to-day make you forget what is already set in motion.

Bitcoin,edoe7rq,ad3fmc,"OP , you can start with:-\n\n1.The Ledger Nano S is one of the most-popular hardware wallets on the market. This wallet supports Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Dash, Dogecoin, Neo, and Zcash in addition to a large and growing number of lesser-known altcoins. All transactions with the Ledger Nano S require the manual input of a four-digit PIN code via the hardware buttons and the device is malware-proof, making it very secure against hacking.\n\n2. The Ledger Blue features all of the security of the Ledger Nano S but is much more user-friendly due to its built-in color touchscreen which can be used to open and use apps on the device itself. Managing transactions is much easier and faster on the Ledger Blue than the Ledger Nano S. The setup process has also been streamlined due to the touchscreen navigation.\n\nThe Ledger Blue is a good hardware wallet option for those who aren't particularly tech savvy or who have less-than-perfect eyesight.\n\n3.Ledger's range of hardware wallets may be number one but the Trezor is a very 	close second. The Trezor hardware wallet supports Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Dash, Dogecoin, Zcash, and several others while also allowing for integration with 	third-party software wallet ups like Electrum and Copay.Transactions made with the Trezor wallet require confirmation via the device's 	hardware buttons and there is also added support for 2-factor 	authentication for an extra layer of security.\n\n4. Exodus is a free software wallet that runs on both Windows and Mac computers. It supports one of the largest collections of cryptocurrencies and features a clean, easy-to-understand visual design that clearly lists transactions and a user's entire crypto portfolio.\n\nOne of the best features of Exodus is its built-in ShapeShift feature which allows users to convert one cryptocurrency into another with the push of a button and without leaving the program. This is one of 	the easiest ways to buy cryptocoins not supported by services like Coinbase. Want to buy some Dash?

Bitcoin,eddmv9t,ad47oe,"I will answer a few question the other person didn’t.\n\n1. Censorship resistance means (if I understand it correctly) that if I am the government or bank and I don’t like what you’re doing but cannot legally stop it, I can stop allowing you to transact. A bank is a private company and therefore has no obligation to allow you to use their services (it can choose to discriminate however it wants). This level of power is worrying. This is what PayPal and Paetreon have been in the media about recently (although they may have been reasonable, they have entered a slippery slope). However, some crypto (like Bitcoin) is decentralised, one entity can not control it and nor can it stop a transaction from happening.\n\n2. Does one currency to rule them all concern me?\nYes and no. Yes, it would if that were the case, but no, im not worried, because it (hopefully) wouldn’t be the case. You would move from country-based fiat currencies to various crypto currencies I.e. you would have Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Cardano etc etc all existing simultaneously.

Bitcoin,eddkcu6,ad4luz,"A **pure exchange** can do it exactly as described above. The signed public list could be made available for download as plain text file on the exchange's public home page.  \n(if the exchange is concerned about publicly disclosing wealth distribution of his user base and prefers to keep this a company business secret, it should implement the measures listed below for ""wallet services"")\n\nA **wallet service** where users can receive bitcoins, an additional measure is needed to make sure that user privacy cannot be compromised by a ""privacy attacker"".\n\nThe ""privacy attack"" would go like this:\n\nThe attacker sends e.g. 0.00003847 bitcoins to a certain user (the victim or target of the privacy attack) in the middle of two publishing events of said public list. Then the attacker compares the two public lists before and after his transfer, and searches for that user ID whose balance has changed by 0.00003847 BTC. If that balance had other incoming/outgoing transfers in that time interval, the attack will fail. But otherwise, it succeeds, and the attacker now has a mapping between the public (pseudonymous) user ID and the actual identification.\n\n**Counter measure:**\n\n* -> 1. User ID changes each time that the list of pseudonymous balances gets published, by changing the ""salt"" each time. Remember that user ID is a function of real user name (and perhaps address, birth date, email or so) and(!) a random salt. The history of salts and corresponding user IDs is always visible to the user in his/her login area.\n\n* -> 2. Each user has not only one user ID but at least two (better: e.g. ten) user IDs associated with it at each publishing time. In the public list, his actual account balance is distributed over all these (ten) user IDs in a random manner. This obfuscates the user ID tracking for a privacy attacker.\n\nThis way, the privacy attacker can no more identify the user IDs that contain the difference of his 0.00003847 BTC transfer.\n\nTo obfuscate it even more, a third measure is possible:\n\n* -> 3. The online wallet service can increase the balance in the public list by a few satoshis for the user IDs of the victim user. This way the attacker's 0.00003847 BTC will not show up anywhere, even if the attacker tries out every combination to ""reconstruct"" wich user IDs may belong together.    \nClearly, this 3rd measure only works if the exchange has (at least slightly) more than 100% reserves, but this can be assumed to be the case in all realistic cases. Note we are only talking about small satoshi or cent amounts. So the ""reserve surplus"" by the exchange / online wallet can be used to artificially increase the published balances of user IDs in a random manner at each ""publishing time"", thereby effectively obfuscating actual wallet differences between publishing times, making it virtually impossible for the privacy attacker to find out what was going on.\n\nFurther improvement:\n\n* -> 4. Instead of splitting a user's balance over a fixed amount of e.g. ten public pseudonymous user IDs in the public list, split it over ""n"" user IDs, where n is larger if the balance is higher.     \nTo get the idea:\n\n * In the extreme case it would be as many user IDs as there are satoshis in the user's balance! This would create perfect(!) obfuscation, because an observer of the public list would have no idea how many users there are or how balances are distributed between ""rich"" and ""poor"" users.\n\n * Practically, the granularity of user IDs could be made more coarse (to reduce the number of user IDs per user and overall), while still hiding the wealth distribution of user accounts sufficiently well. An example could be to follow this strategy:     \n.   \n-> Each user gets a minimum of [ten] user IDs at each publication time.   \n.   \n-> Each user gets more user IDs if necessary, such that in the public list each user ID has a balance of no more than [m] satoshis. Clearly, for m=1 we have our extreme case.                 ",1546774396,t3_ad4luz,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ad4luz/how_every_reputable_exchange_wallet_service_could/eddkcu6/

Bitcoin,edef90n,ad4r0b,"I've always favored the layered approach where the base layer retains the kinds of stability characteristics emphasized by Song and the higher layers provide room for innovation. \n\nThe innovative layers require a strong, dependable, secure, and trustworthy foundation. But it is also true that the stability layer becomes more secure the more services and projects depend upon it.\n\nGold does not magically act as a store of value. It's value depends on the fact that it has utility beyond its use as money. This is why gold continued to have value even after it was no longer being used as money. It is that fundamental utility that guarantees it will always have value that lends confidence in it as a store of value in the first place. Jewelry and the various uses of gold are, for the purposes of this conversation, the innovative layers of gold. They are human inventions built on top of the base layer of the raw metal that give that base layer what people call ""intrinsic value."" That is to say, the intrinsic value of gold is not a magical, god-given property, it comes from the higher layers of innovation that make gold indispensable to society.\n\nFor Bitcoin to be likened to gold, to be ""digital gold"" as it were, it must, like gold, have something akin to ""intrinsic value,"" otherwise the comparison is not fitting. For gold, the intrinsic value comes from the innovative uses of gold such a jewelry and ornamentation. For crypto, the innovative uses are just now being explored. But the problem is, much of the culture of exploration isn't happening on Bitcoin, it is happening on other projects like Ethereum, and in response to this the Bitcoin culture seems to hardening into an anti-innovative stance as reflected by Song's tweet. \n\nIronically, Jimmy Song and Vitalik Buterin used to be colleagues on the Colored Coins project back in 2013, a project that was meant to give Bitcoin erc20-like tokens.  When it became clear that Bitcoin was not conducive to this sort of thing, Vitalik committed himself even more to the concept and went on to create Ethereum; Jimmy had the opposite reaction and became convinced that the whole idea had been stupid. This divide echoes forth to this day, with innovators constantly favoring Ethereum (which has the largest developer community) and the Bitcoin community saying everything that is being done over there is dumb.\n\nBut the problem is, the more these competing networks like Ethereum become robust with projects depending upon them, when you have stock exchanges, derivatives, banking and lending riding on top of them, the more these networks become indispensable and gain the very properties of gold that Bitcoin prides itself as having. \n\nBitcoin is poised to become the ultimate digital gold because it has focused heavily on security and trust, but gold did not become valuable just because of its shiny and malleability properties, it had to be used. And while Ethereum and EOS may be creating jewelry out of lead and tin, the fact is they are at an advantage for even creating jewelry at all while Bitcoin twiddles its thumbs. Bitcoin offers the promise of creating jewelry out of a superior metal, but it won't matter if the curmudgeons of the space won't let it.

Its distinguishing property being that it is fundamentally decentralized, and that anyone is free to run a node themselves in order to participate in the network without going through trusted third parties or intermediaries. The proper emphasis should therefore be: ""Bitcoin: A **Peer-to-Peer** Electronic Cash System""\n\n>Bitcoin is currently unable to function as sound cash because transaction times take too long.\n\n1) Transaction times have nothing to do with the definition of ""electronic cash"" whatsoever.\n\n2) Block times remain the same old ten-minute-average that Satoshi originally designed them to be.\n\n>Why are some people trying so hard to redefine Bitcoin as digital gold when Satoshi clearly had a different vision in mind?\n\nSatoshi explicitly said that he modeled Bitcoin's inflation/mining-schedule on gold mining in the Bitcoin whitepaper itself:\n\n>The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\n\nThis was not the only time [he likened Bitcoin to gold](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583.msg11405#msg11405), either.

Bitcoin,eddylxp,ad4r0b,"dude you are so wrong.\n\nFirst - golds utility is definitely not worth 7T\n\ngold has most of its value from aesthetics - people like to wear gold , and as a society we value it as something valuable to have. It’s use case? Relative \n\nit’s so hilarious to see people say gold has intrinsic value when gold is used primarily as jewelry. What’s the utility case of jewelry ? Not survivability but simply human endearment.\n\nThe thing gold is used for most is ultimately to look nice.. which isn’t necessary for surviving .\n\nGold is used in TRACE amounts in electronics and orthodontics, definitely not worth 7Trillion as a utility though.\n\nFor bitcoin you then go on to confuse the fact that something has to be tangible to be valuable. Because your train of thought is like a barbarian, what would be valuable if “society” were to collapse ? This metal because I can smash people with it and defend myself( in true crash of society anarchy would reign and no one is looking to collect gold in a lawless state of existence when people can just rob for free). \n\nRather the better question is what’s more valuable to society - gold as a physical item or a system of connection. \n\nIt’s like, what do we use more and holds more value to us in civilization - gold or the internet ? I can’t touch the internet, build directly with internet, make the internet into a weapon and defend myself with it or kill anything to provide food for myself with the internet. The internet can’t clothe me or keep me warm or build a shelter with. What’s important in tribe based living is different from what’s important in an advanced society.\n\nDo people really think gold is more valuable to humans than the internet ?\n\nAbsolutely it isn’t.\n\n“Systems” can be more valuable than things. You would rather have a rock or metal if you have to fight someone in 1v1 combat, but if you wanted to build - math (a system) is way more valuable. So in a fight, understand you will select a metal. But to build? Knowledge is more valuable. Knowledge is also intangible. \n\nSoon people will realize bitcoin does everything gold does, except better. The only thing bitcoin doesn’t have is its tangible. But as discussed with the internet or with math, or knowledge, there are intangible systems which values outstrip a metal rock. By far.\n\nTransferring bitcoin is 10,000 times easier than transferring gold.\n\nAccepting and verifying bitcoin is 10,000 times easier than accepting and verifying gold.\n\nMoving bitcoin, storing bitcoin.\n\nWhat’s easier to rob - an individual carrying gold or an individual “carrying”  btc. What’s easier to travel with ? What’s easier to store in a safe location that can be accessed by only those you give the keys  to. If someone tells you the gold they have is authentic, it takes time and resources to verify this to be true. I can “inherently” know the bitcoin i receive is a bitcoin. That’s what inherent means, gold has almost no “inherent” value(definitely not worth 7trillion). Also bitcoin “inherently” tracks its own transfers - something you can’t do with gold- which adds even more security and validity \n\nRemember, the bitcoin system has never been hacked - only the exchanges and outside forces have.\n\n\nSo bitcoins worth is in the system it provides. The security, ease of access, ease of validity, ease of transfer, ease of exchange, ease of ownership, ease of decentralization, ease of immutability, ease of storage \n. \n\nOn top of all this, golds supply is unknown. Additionally, we know there is magnitudes of gold in different places , other planets and even our own sea waters which we just currently can’t extract. As tech improves we will be able to extract this and then essentially gold will be as common as aluminum. Gold is a decently terrible way to store wealth once interstellar traveling begins.\n\nSo yeah. btc > gold.

Bitcoin,edhhayq,ad4r0b,"Sorry that you got so many down votes, you are raising some important points.\n\nI agree with your assertion that gold has intrinsic value, where intrinsic value is defined as: A) having utility beyond its use as money and B) where that utility cannot be replicated by anything else. (Saying gold has no intrinsic value because value is ""subjective"" is a straw man argument.) Where I find flaw is in your assumption that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the founder of Bitcoin, once wrote a post on this topic:\n\n>As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties:- boring grey in colour- not a good conductor of electricity- not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either- not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose  \n>  \n>and one special, magical property:- can be transported over a communications channel  \n>  \n>If  it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone  wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit  it, and have the recipient sell it.  \n>  \n>Maybe it could get an  initial value circularly as you've suggested, by people foreseeing its  potential usefulness for exchange.  (I would definitely want some)   Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.\n\nThe point here is that scarcity that can be transported in the digital space is intrinsically valuable. It doesn't qualify to meet our traditional monetary definition of ""intrinsic value,"" however, because A) it is a utility that is difficult to separate from its use as money and B) it is a utility that seemingly can be replicated by altcoins, as you suggested. \n\nNow with regard to A, that it is a utility that is difficult to separate from its role as money, Satoshi went on to write this:\n\n>I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the  assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that  are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value  will surely win out over those without intrinsic value.  But if there  were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as  money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still  take up something.\n\nIn other words, Satoshi believed that money in and of itself has intrinsic value, that it is indispensable to society in its utility, and that therefore even if we could not find a commodity from which to make money that had pre-existing utility, we would still use something. \n\nI completely agree with this point. The main purpose of ""intrinsic value"" is to lend confidence to a currency, but a currency does not inherently require that that confidence be derived from intrinsic value, as fiat money has demonstrated. If the Bitcoin network provides a unique utility, specifically designed to make value transfer in the digital space possible, and this utility is not easily replicated, then that in itself may be its intrinsic value. This, of course, brings us to your main concern:\n\nB, that Bitcoin's utility, the ability transmit scarcity in the digital space, can be recreated by other cryptocurrencies and therefore is not unique to Bitcoin. The problem is that cryptos depend on the network effect for their security, and without security their ability to preserve scarcity in the digital space becomes compromised. In other words, less popular cryptos are effectively worse at value transfer than bitcoin because they lack security. This is further aggravated by their lack of liquidity: the more valuable cryptos--the most valuable of which is Bitcoin--have more liquidity than the lessor known cryptos, and this makes them better at their core utility which is preserving and transferring value in the digital space. \n\nCryptos are networks, and consequently they are heavily dependent on network effects. Facebook and even the internet itself are good examples of networks whose value became locked in to the point where we might even call it ""intrinsic."" When Facebook and the internet were new, they had competitors and it was easy to imagine that they could simply be replaced by those competitors. To suggest the internet provided intrinsic value to society early on would have been laughed at, yet today few would dispute that. \n\nThe point is, you can't simply recreate Bitcoin. You or I could not simply fire up our own blockchain and ""poof!"" have accomplished an equal value transfer network. So in this sense, Bitcoin actually is like gold in that in the same way gold is the best metal from which to make jewelry, Bitcoin is the best network to transfer value. This property Satoshi spoke of is, relatively speaking, unique to Bitcoin.\n\nAnd while it is true that Bitcoin has competitors, like Ethereum or XRP, that is not at all unlike saying gold has competitors in silver or copper. The only difference is that it is not yet a done deal that Bitcoin will emerge as the most popular network. One of the primary reasons to suggest Bitcoin won't end up as the primary network is because it actually isn't completely fulfilling its mandate as a value transfer network, but that is another topic. At some point a most popular network will exist and at that point one will be hard pressed to suggest we could simply switch to another network on a whim when so much is dependent upon it. The ability to transfer value in the digital space will, ultimately, be a property that ""can't be replicated"" for all intents and purposes, and therefore the network upon which we rely for such will be considered intrinsically valuable, along with its associated token.

Even more so, it has the potential to put enormous pressure on governments and the whole existing, creaking economic system that is leveraged on debt to the *n*th degree. \n\nDisruption and disintermediation are the hall marks of a nascent, game breaking technology a la internet.

The safe, simple, powerful and immutable ledger\n\nWrong. The blockchain is not safe, immutable or powerful on its own. On its own, it's an inefficient distributed database. It's the combination with two other systems that gives it those desirable qualities mentioned: security, immutability, power. The two system I'm referring to are the token-based rewards coupled with the hash-based mining system.\n\nWithout both a hash-based mining system to create deterministic consensus, and a token reward (i.e. the ""coin"" part of Bitcoin) to punish malicious actors, the whole thing falls apart. The blockchain on its own is not revolutionary or innovative in any way. It's a data construct which has been known in computer science since pointers were invented. However, it's a part of a larger system, Bitcoin, that is revolutionary and innovative.\n\n>on top of this technology, you can build all sorts of applications\n\nWrong again. There's only a few, very limited applications for which a token-based trust-less transaction system is useful. Digital, global payments is one. I've yet to see a serious, non-bullshit proposal for a different kind of application that applies the basic concepts behind Bitcoin in a way that 1) doesn't compromise the fundamental mechanisms in a way that breaks the trust-less, decentralized nature of it; or 2) a bunch of nonsense pipe dream promises with no science or research to back it up (looking at you, ETH).",1547082700,t1_edo0oxp,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ad84s9/the_world_has_never_seen_a_phenomenon_that_even/edof0em/

Bitcoin,edjpngh,ad84s9,"I guess your username is accurate, since I'll freely admit you are *technically correct* (which - as we all know - is the best kind of correct!)\n\nI'd argue however that although the total cost of mining globally increases with the value of bitcoin, which is indeed directly related to usage, I think that view is missing some critical nuance.  Specifically:\n\n1. Production of assets, mining of raw minerals, and similar are generally only performed for profit.  That means that the value extracted/produced is expected to be greater than the expenses put in to it.  When viewed like this, the ""cost"" of mining is less relevant.\n2. Even when viewed as if there's zero gain (i.e. cost is simply ""wasted""), the costs of mining don't scale linearly with usage.  That is, if Bitcoin has twice as much usage as today, the cost of mining is not necessarily twice as much as today.\n3. Second layer networks such as Lightning skew this even further since it's usage of Bitcoin without being *additional* usage of block space.  This enables significant further usage of the currency, which may affect the exchange rate (however see next point), but as mining profit incentive switches towards collection of fees rather than newly minted bitcoin, the number of transactions becomes less relevant than the need for new channels which are the on-chain transactions giving fees that miners want.\n4. Exchange rate to fiat is not obviously tightly bound to mining cost over short time scales: We can in fact see from global hash rate that during 2018, the hash rate continued to increase significantly despite the falling price.  The ""big dip"" in hash rate actually only set it back 6 months (which it's already recovering from) meaning that it is still higher than when bitcoin's exchange rate with USD peaked.\n\nI think all of these together show that while - on the longer time scale and/or as long-term averages - your concept makes sense and is likely/probably correct, the reality over shorter time scales is quite different.  Point 4 possibly shows that it's more the case that mining cost and exchange rate together find a minimum equilibrium together but are not bounded in the upwards direction for exchange rate or downwards direction for mining cost.",1546932658,t1_edhaz3c,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ad84s9/the_world_has_never_seen_a_phenomenon_that_even/edjpngh/

When you are over 35 a lot of new things seem to be against the natural order of things, but when you are 35 almost *nothing* new is against the natural order of things.\n\nTo put it differently, when I was young I always wondered why people were so ""set in their ways"" and not open to new things.  I resolved that when I got to be their age I would not be like that.  But it wasn't until I was in my 40s that I realized that while sometimes people's resistance to change is irrational and could be done without, it is also sometimes the case that people don't want to change because they have found something that works, a local minima of effort and local maxima of their own effectiveness, and change necessarily involves moving away from that.  ""If it's not broke, don't fix it""  The true challenge is not to continually exist in unoptimized regions operating at sub-optimal efficiency in search of that elusive global maximum, but rather to recognize when a promised new maxima is in fact meaningfully higher than where one currently operates.\n\nFrom that standpoint, while bitcoin is an intriguing technological development, I have yet to be convinced that for the average person - or myself at least - it's not trading off one set of problems which I can effectively deal with for a new set which will prove to be more troublesome.",1546882887,t3_ad9bjy,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ad9bjy/douglas_adams_explains_why_some_old_folks_dislike/edhlhlf/

By offering an illusion of democracy created by representation. Indebting poor people to have them vote for social benefit systems. Keeping the middle class down by taxing them close to 70% with direct and indirect taxes so they cannot easily escape the tread-mill system. Increasing the complexity of doing trade by creating ever new laws as if they were ordered by the hour. Social contracts broken by mandating families to have both parents work full time to make ends meet with a moderate lifestyle while leaving the upbringing of the children to third parties.\n\nPeople feel this partly consciously, mostly subconsciously in one way or an other and it's mouting to a change in the next decades. It's unsettling to live in a period of slow change. When you know history is in the making and it will be looked back upon in history as a decisive period of 20-30 years but events itself are unfolding in such a slow pace while you're witnessing them.\n\n",1546877178,t1_edg523t,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ad9bjy/douglas_adams_explains_why_some_old_folks_dislike/edhb83m/

Bitcoin,eczt14x,abegjs,"Whether you start with the payer and try to find the payee, or start with the payee and try to find the payer, it is exactly the same search problem.\n\nThe ""figure out how many nodes it will take"" is what a pathfinding algorithm does. The simplest version of such is Dijkstra's algorithm, but this is expensive because it searches uniformly in all directions of the graph.\n\nThere are optimisations such as A*, which assigns a weight to each edge (for example, based on the fee required), such that the algorithm will search the lowest-fee paying routes first. You could use some other heuristic instead of fee if you wanted to optimize for success rate or other metric.\n\nThe issue with LN is that the above process will become excessively expensive if the network grows very large. We're far off that stage yet, so the issues do not exist yet. There are other ways we can optimize the search path, but they're not priority to implement because they won't be needed for a while.",1546318499,t3_abegjs,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abegjs/i_have_solved_the_lightning_network_routing/eczt14x/

Bitcoin,ed0td3t,abekqq,"Do not mean to offend and initially I was thinking your strategy is pretty good. However, based on today's pricing ($3740) that will mean you made 10% if based on $3397.46 and that 10% is over 3years 6 mths. Which works out to be around 2.86% ROI per year. \n\nIf based on avg price $2500 and from 2013, that will be 49.6% ROI in 5 years so about 10% a year. \n\nBasically, in conclusion your strategy may not be good since most crypto investors coming from as early as 2013-2015 will have made quite a considerable amount.  \n\n\nBelow are my thoughts on why your strategy isn't amazing:\n\n  \n1) You mentioned 5% of your paycheck over 3-5 years. If I assume your paycheck only goes up due to promotion (I think most people get a few promotion over that time), that will mean you are investing a bigger portion in USD as time moves forward which is reflected in a higher average due to a bigger portion of your investment will be in the recent years.\n\n  \n2) Your portfolio reflect more risk with time and not a constant risk since you are averaging down but in a manner whereby a bigger portion is always in the recent years and therefore losing out on the rewards from your earlier years due to huge risk in later plays. For example, buying at $19,450 when your lowest was $227.20. That is 85 times the value of your initial investment which in a way reflect 85 times more risky than your initial investment plus more since you will be investing a bigger amount in USD value.   \n\n\n3) If crypto crashes to almost nothing, you will have spend 3-5 years to lose your money as opposed to people who invested 3-5 years ago and had already realized gains or diversified their portfolio outwards from crypto to reduce risk.   \n\n\n4) Take note as well since your best ROI is 10% a year, while BTC already went way more than 10% a year, that will mean your passive strategy of just holding BTC and not micromanaging it is under-performing the market by a mega huge margin. Anytime your passive portfolio underperforms the market, when you hardly touch it, I think it is very telling that your strategy do not work.  \n\n\nI double check my own strategy by ensuring that my extra management must translate to over-performing the crypto market.",1546364958,t1_ed0f0or,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abekqq/ive_put_5_of_each_paycheck_into_bitcoin_for_the/ed0td3t/

Bitcoin,ed1om8t,abekqq,"I think those are just people new to the space. They got here by way of traditional trading, and see it through that lens. After some time, they'll come around to what makes bitcoin unique (scarcity, immutability) compared to traditional assets and value it based on those characteristics. Or they'll get bored, leave, and in 2022 as btc starts heading towards $90k they'll be that guy talking about how he bought two btc @4200 and sold both at 7500.\n\nI got here through gaming, overclocking my amd gpus, and finding the monero mining community using the same tools I was. Mining xmr was just a way to test my overclocking ability, and I didn't even look into bitcoin because it had nothing to do with my gpus.  Took me quite a while, 6 months or so, to get a full(ish) understanding of the crypto landscape. Stock traders, Info sec guys, libertarians, drug dealers/buyers, FBI analysts, bankers... all these communities initially see bitcoin as something that seems obvious and familiar on the surface: simply a dollar that has some trait they like or dislike. It fits well into their worldview at first, but it crystallizes after a while, like water freezing inside a boulder. They see the whole, the earth-shattering potential, and that worldview cracks. Then they're one of us. ",1546387984,t1_ed1juxa,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abekqq/ive_put_5_of_each_paycheck_into_bitcoin_for_the/ed1om8t/
Bitcoin,ed13mlo,abekqq,"Cheers. \n\nTL;DR for those not wanting to watch the video. \n\nDCA (Dollar Cost Average) is often used by those who lack upfront investment capital and a fine tool to use for this purpose because not investing something is worse than inaction. \n\nDCA when used as a hedge to simply average out buying high and buying low is foolish strategy if one has the upfront capital and often used with uncertain investors and for emotional reasons. \n\nDCA is foolish for these reasons:\n\n1) One cannot predict the future short term price of an asset because the intelligentsia of the market will always have more information than any individual or subset of people. The exception to this is in insufficiently liquid markets where you control the market(altcoin developer with majority premine that pumps and dumps) . Thus one should evaluate an investment and make as large a purchase one can do as quickly as possible so the compounded returns with time can be the highest. \n\n2) Delaying in making an investment means that you will not only be losing 2-3% per year at the best due to inflation but opportunity cost from the compounded returns from the investment over time \n\n3) DCA is good from the aspect that it trains one to remove emotion from investment but it does so using a crutch that restricts an investor from making wise investments at the right time . One should evaluate an investment logically and make a decisive decision. Whether this calculated risk wins or fails is less important. What is greater importance is you are training your mind to act decisively and without emotional biases and even if you make the wrong bet you will learn from your mistakes and make wiser decisive investment in the future. DCA reinforces indecision and uncertainty which is not what one should train their mind with. \n\nThis does not mean that one should not lack and stable fiat savings. Minimum 3 months, but better a year is recommended. This is critical because not having any buffer will make being a rational investor almost impossible and one needs to have insurance for life's unexpected surprises.

Bitcoin,ed175sz,abekqq,"Watched the video, I think will be better if there was some visuals rather than chewbaca. \n\nI think what he said makes sense and I agree, except one thing. I think there are some subjectivity on how to see something as DCA. For example, DCA over a period of many years vs a period of a month. Due to the smaller time frame, the penalty on DCA is reduced and allow for extra benefits that a one time investment won't.\n\nExtra benefit of smaller time frame DCA:\nTo allow for personal experience to affect decision making. We can research and read all we want but personal experience is very valuable. For example, one may directly learned of new scams or be a victim of a scam and therefore act more decisively. In my first investment into crypto, I was immediately scammed of USD200. The exchange was fake and they had fake review sites to rank the exchange and promote it. I did not have any close friends who knew about crypto nor anyone I trusted to consult in. I am also in a country where there were very few information on exchanges. I took the leap, got scammed. If I had invested one lump sum, I think I will be crying. \n\nI went on to finally find a reliable way to invest, had to test exchange, learn about wallets, learn about trading crypto, participated in crypto community and with my accumulated experience of over a month, I started to understand a lot more than what is offered online. I understood there were way more manipulation than people know. Therefore with some amount of personal understanding and reflection, I invested a final sum and went on to manage it. \n\nDCA in smaller timeframe could allow for reservations to test learned knowledge in case of misinformation since misinformation is pretty rampant these days.

Bitcoin,ed182bm,abekqq,">DCA over a period of many years vs a period of a month. \n\nmost of Bitcoins largest periods of appreciation happen in a few days each year thus spreading out ones investments over a month will lower the probability that you invest in before these events occur. \n\n> If I had invested one lump sum, I think I will be crying.\n\nInvesting small amounts in different less trusted exchanges is part of the research process to test the trustworthiness of an exchange and not really a DCA strategy. \n\n>learn about trading crypto, participated in crypto community and with my accumulated experience of over a month,\n\nAgreed , but this is all part of the learning and research phase before one makes a decision. Thus I agree , new users need to initially buy a very small amount of BTC to learn how to use it and secure it and spend it .\n\nThe question is , once you understand Bitcoin and believe it is scarce and will appreciate in the long term what do you do when you inherit or get a bonus of a small amount of 10k USD? Do you DCA it over a month or do You immediately invest all 10k between BTC and other investments you have already decided upon?\n",1546375023,t1_ed175sz,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abekqq/ive_put_5_of_each_paycheck_into_bitcoin_for_the/ed182bm/
Bitcoin,ed01hxh,abelmy,"It is true. Many people cannot see this reality yet, but it will happen and will bite hard when the super-recession hits.\n\nThe USA will see hyper-inflation with investors fleeing not only stocks and bonds, but also fleeing the US dollar as it increasingly becomes worthless. Traditionally gold has been the go-to safe haven, however the gold market has gotten heavily manipulated with price fixing and the paper gold to physical gold ratio now over 210:1 (gold price manipulated down in an attempt to disguise all the Fed's inflationary money printing and the fact the West has sold off most if its gold reserves). This means for every ounce of gold a person holds, at least 210 others believe they also own that same ounce! Gold is actually very scarce - all gold mined since pre-historic times would fit into an Olympic sized swimming pool. Hence you can see why there will be panic once investors realize unless they hold gold in their hand they don't own it, and will look to safe haven alternatives. Bitcoin is becoming the best alternative.\n\nOver the past week there has been a gold to bitcoin correlation factor of 0.84, suggesting investors are waking up to Bitcoin being a viable ""Gold 2.0"".  The Wall Street Journal even reported on this: [https://cointelegraph.com/news/wsj-bitcoin-trading-at-strong-correlation-with-gold-as-traditional-investors-step-in](https://cointelegraph.com/news/wsj-bitcoin-trading-at-strong-correlation-with-gold-as-traditional-investors-step-in)\n\nAnyone who critiques Bitcoin as not being a valid store of value or safe haven by suggesting it is ""too volatile"" or ""collapsed in 2018"" can be pointed to a sequence of Bitcoin's annual \*lowest\* prices.\n\nHere are Bitcoins lowest prices per year if you've read this far:\n\n2010  $0.003\n\n2011  $0.29\n\n2012  $4.19\n\n2013  $13.31\n\n2014  $317.85\n\n2015  $199.02\n\n2016  $357.02\n\n2017  $789.67\n\n2018  $3212.25\n\n2019  ?\n\n&#x200B;",1546329020,t3_abelmy,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abelmy/bitcoin_is_a_great_store_of_value_and_is_better/ed01hxh/

Bitcoin,eczxqyf,abfgh5,I suppose you have to start by defining what you mean by ownership. Take real estate for example. What is ownership of real estate? Does it mean you can pack up your property and move it whenever you want to? Nope real estate is immovable so you can't move it. Does it mean that you decide who gets access to the property? Yes.

Bitcoin,ed08wa1,abfgh5,"Agreed, OP understand correctly. \n\nThe blockchain is the database of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). There are inputs and outputs. An UTXO is the product of an input. An input is a proposed change to the state of the blockchain which when verified creates a new UTXO. \n\nThe way we interact with bitcoin gives us the impression that Aaliyah has this thing that she gives José, and for Bitcoin to work as a currency that's a perfectly adequate way to think about it; just as a patient with an infection doesn't need to understand the intricacies of how an antibiotic works for it be effective. That said, examining the intricacies of how a particular antibiotic works isn't pedantry, it helps understand how that drug may be applied to other organisms, how it may be improved, and when it may not work. \n\nSo we may be satisfied, just as the patient that takes the antibiotic to ""get better,"" that one user uses a wallet and ""sends coins"" to another wallet. Take a deeper dive and we have to examine what exactly a wallet is, which brings us right back to UTXOs because a wallet is a collection of private keys that give a user access to spend UTXOs by creating an input which proposes a change to the state of the blockchain, generating a new UTXO to which another user is granted access. Bitcoin, then, doesn't move from wallet to wallet but *from transaction to transaction* within the blockchain.\n\nIf we put all this together:\n\nThe state of the blockchain is a collection of UTXOs. UTXOs are bitcoin that have the potential to be spent. Private keys give access to UTXOs so the potential spend can be actualized in an input that then generates another UTXO for which someone else is given a key. Wallets collect private keys to UTXOs and display an aggregated balance of the UTXOs. \n\nSo you never ""hold"" bitcoin, bitcoin lives as potential in UTXOs on the blockchain, you only hold a key that gives you the power to make a change to the state of the blockchain.

Bitcoin,ed0ga7h,abfgh5,"Happy new year!! ... Basically a data structure is a way of storing data in code.  An array or linked list would be a data structure. Usually the data is stored in some format so that it's easier to perform some function.  Sometimes it is to make searching easier (databases use these types of data structures often).  \n\nIn the case of the Blockchain the data structure makes pulling data from it ... well.. a pain in the fucking ass.  \n\nA database is an application that stores data in an unified manner.  A database allows for better data storage/access and often times can even perform certain tasks on the data pretty easily.  \n\nThe most popular type of database is a sql database.  SQL stands for Structured Query Language.  It's very good for storing data in a highly normalized format for querying reports.  Also I like using different designs for different purposes.  \n\nThe most common purpose is for storing user/application data and for scalability sake it's typically advisable to store the data the way the business application wants to use it.  This is why nosql databases have become so popular, but I don't really see their value so I'd have to learn more about them.

If you think about it the vendor who is selling you the stuff has to pay Visa/Mastercard a particular fee per transaction, and clearly that adds to their cost. Unless they are willing to cut from margins (which are razor thin in most retail anyways) they are basically putting that amount to your bill by raising the prices of the items.

Bitcoin,ed0dys2,abhkzl,"There's some key differences between what's held by banks and exchanges that makes the difference. If fiat is stolen from your account by fraud or a security breach the bank generally just adds new numbers to your account and fiat is generally backed by some central bank insurance to prevent bank runs. The liquidity of banks is generally much higher, for example last I heard HSBC had a market cap of 200billion, nearly twice the market cap of all cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf crypto is stolen from your account it's irreversible, I'm not aware of an exchange that will use their own funds to top you up. If the theft happens on a large enough scale, even should an exchange make some vague promise of recompense, the exchange may be insolvent. \n\nCrypto also has unique properties that allow it to be exchanged person to person without any intermediaries determining if the payment is in accordance with their policies, political motivations, etc. If you want to send 100k to Taiwan on a Sunday you don't have to get anyone's approval, answer questions about what it's for, be subject to mandatory government reporting, etc. etc. You can't be locked away from your funds because you said something unfortunate a year ago and MasterCard decides they don't like you or law enforcement decides you're engaged in illegal activity by selling emergency contraception and it cant be confiscated should the authorities decide they have a claim to your assets.\n\nUsing an exchange as a bank puts exactly the same restrictions on your crypto as you have on your fiat. Exchanges have and do lock people out of their accounts for extended periods of time and because there is little regulation and their behavior is entirely dictated by their ToS there is no one to appeal to other than the exchange themselves, who are often as disinterested in helping their customers as they are concerned with protecting their own interests first and foremost. \n\n",1546347694,t3_abhkzl,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abhkzl/safety_of_exchanges_versus_banks/ed0dys2/

Bitcoin,ed29es7,abhykt,"A is quite correct. Necessary is a social agreement here.\n\nB is not about raspberry pi's, really, or IOT devices being able to be full nodes, although those kinds of devices still being able to work is a consequence of our success of *not* raising the bar for running full nodes. I know it can't stay that way forever, but letting the requirements rise too much is *bad*. Bitcoin was created to be validated by all participants that needed to. Taking that possibility away destroys a very fundamental part of bitcoin.\n\nI encourage you to think: *What* is the fundamental reason we trust bitcoin, and put value in it.\n\nC) I don't disagree that cryptokitties are a legitimate use of *a blockchain*, but growing the main chain to ""onboard the cryptokitties"" are foolish. Sidechains are invented. The building blocks are largely there, see for example https://elementsproject.org/ - anyone is welcome to create gaming-oriented sidechains! Gaming and money are two different use cases and are better off in separate chains -  but they can still be linked!\n\nD) Sure. But would it help any? See C. Is it a legitimate reason for a disruptive hard fork? I believe hard forks needs to be super-necessary to be justified. Hardforks are disruptive, and not to be encouraged. Any hard fork has the potential to turn into a chain split. See BCH/BSV, ETH/ETC, etc. It diminishes the security of the blockchain, we're better off united under same PoW.

I believe your points are all true.\n\nA) right\nB) I would just like to point out that SPV verification should be possible by all participants for a very very long time even if we bump the blocksize up significantly, so the only people that really need to run full nodes are institutions and miners and such. I do trust Bitcoin. I also know the incentives and I don't believe that centralizing the full nodes necessarily leads to BFT being compromised. I can appreciate your point and it would be ideal to have as many full nodes as possible, but the only people who actually need to run full  nodes are the miners and they're already institutions. I don't know I just am not convinced that bumping the blocksize up to even 8mb will knock that many nodes offline.\n\nC) sidechains, LN, and other second layer solutions are all great and I truely do support the effort, but as I said below I dont believe that ""second layer solutions"" justify not increasing the bandwidth of layer 1. \n\nD) I agree with you and I think this may be your best point that hard forks really really need to be justified. I am not really arguing that we need to bump it up right this minute, but we could at least start outlining the conditions we need to meet in order to bump up the blocksize.

Bitcoin,ed1bp3k,abhykt,The market doesn't chose the easiest solution. It chooses the solution that benefits the individual the greatest. If you enable both options of LN or regular blockchain transactions you leave it up to the individual to decide what they want to do. If the majority of individuals don't want to use LN it's because it's not a good enough solution. Making Bitcoin transaction fees artificially high does not make LN artificially good.

Bitcoin,ed2tmy0,abhykt,"B) SPV verification gives way too much power to miners. It's a false statement that only miners need to run nodes, incentives shift radically in this case. Case in point: With fewer full nodes, miners could easier unilaterally activate protocol changes! SPV nodes are in general good for ""following the longest chain"", but doesn't validate much else!\n\nD) About the Segwit2X hardfork, I am glad it failed. It was a backroom deal created at a conference, and that is *not* where bitcoin consensus is formed. Sure, you can discuss and agree on what to work on in conferences. But there *is* a reason there was eventually a *spoken* policy about ""no decisions ever should take place at Scaling Bitcoin conferences!"". Conferences generally favour corporations and others that can afford sending a lot of people to the conferences. Yes, there were Core developers there that signed the deal, but *everyone* signed only for themselves, there *is* noone that have authority to speak for anyone else.\n\nSegwit2X succeeding would have been a success for ""corporate takeover"" bitcoin and a failure for consensus forming in the truly decentralized way. The decision was *much* more socially important than technically important, imho.\n\nFact is: Bitcoin will scale up when it's sufficiently evident that bitcoin is not viable without it, so that there *is* consensus for it. Right now, we have much blockspace to save on LN usage, sidechain usage (this one has huge potential, I believe), and other optimizations.\n\nFor every MB we add unneccessary to the blockchain, bitcoin lose. It will increase the sync time for new full nodes, too. This is actually a underestimated problem, we can't just keep adding the size of the blockchain faster than technology improves. And today we are actually doing that.

Bitcoin,ed2va7x,abhykt,"B) If you're running a full node and the miners decide to unilaterally activate a protocol change you will fork, but nothing will change. If you were using an SPV node that was listening to two separate protocols it would get confused. If there were literally no miners on the chain that didn't update to a bigger blocksize, it means that that chain has become very insecure and you don't want to use it anyway. I believe this point is moot essentially. Yes SPV nodes follow the longest chain. More or less people running full nodes doesn't change anything in the case of miners unilaterally activating protocol changes, it can already happen and running full nodes doesn't prevent it.\n\nD) ""It will increase the sync time for new full nodes, too. This is actually a underestimated problem, we can't just keep adding the size of the blockchain faster than technology improves."" This is a statement predicated on the idea that increasing the blocksize as much as discussed above (2-4-8mb) will result in this happening. You can't infinitely increase blocksize, but resyncing with blocksizes of 8MB would be tedious work for a modern home computer. It's just CPU power and modern CPUs can handle resyncing with ease. I was a blockchain developer at steemit and I can tell you that scaling to 100,000 tps per 3 second block was not a technical concern. We are not approaching the point where the blockchain grows faster than you can sync on bitcoin, not even close.\n\nI would guess that bumping the blocksize up to 8mb would knock off less than 5% of current full nodes, yet it would facilitate exponentially more transactions thanks to 2nd layer solutions. There are legitimate points on both sides of the blocksize debate. It's my opinion that increasing blocksize dramatically improves useability of bitcoin and it's effect on the greater ecosystem of bitcoin will be net positive, although yes it will somewhat centralize the system (Though like I said I'd guess just about 5%). If you're so concerned about the miners doing a ""non-concenseus"" hard fork, perhaps you should consinder PoS. No blocksize will protect you from individuals hard forking the chain.",1546439957,t1_ed2tmy0,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abhykt/poll_safely_increase_blocksize_by_the_end_of_2019/ed2va7x/
Bitcoin,ed31sy1,abhykt,"In B) you aren't wrong per se, it's just that with enough full nodes, there *are* incentives for miners to stay on the coins that actually makes it possible to sell their coins to pay the bills. If most people and even shops would run SPV, they'd follow whatever the miners dictated.\n\nThinking about this a bit more, let's say there's a majority of economic activity that uses their own full nodes to validate their activity. In this case, it'd be a risk to validate transactions that did *not* confirm to these nodes, because you risk yours coins being invalid where you wanted to spend them!\n\nYes, that people actually run their a full node to verify their activity *do* give them more power than not doing it.\n\nD I think any increase will have to show *more* benefit than we lose, and that we don't lose anything we can afford to lose. Thus, it's up to those who want to hard fork to higher blocksize that have to prove that it's needed and that it'd give a significan gain. In my opinion, what we have lost from having full blocks is not the *useful* transactions, it's the spammy transactions. SatoshiDice type things etc, that might be cool to think about but not something it's worth to increase block size to keep on-chain. Currently, a lot of these games are moving to LN, where I believe they rightly belong.\n\nBeing a blockchain developer doesn't magically make you get this. What those who have worked on centralized blockchains fail to understand is how difficult it is to do this decentralized.\n\nAnd you are right. Anyone can hardfork. What we want to maintain are the incentives to *stay* on the consensus-agreed chain. And for that, miners need to be accountable to someone.",1546445800,t1_ed2va7x,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abhykt/poll_safely_increase_blocksize_by_the_end_of_2019/ed31sy1/
Bitcoin,ed35bzp,abhykt,"I can see your point with B) but I don't agree with the premise. If some business was running a SPV node to validate their transactions and the Miners decided to update the consenseus protocol to something the shop owner disagrees with, the shop owner should A) stop pointing his SPV node at untrusted nodes and B) start his own full node. This idea has nothing to do with blocksize. If the blocksize was so big that the shop owner couldn't run his own full node to run the ""classic fork"" I wouldn't agree with it. However, 2-4-8mb blocksizes are not prohibitively big. Those sizes are all small enough that a raspberry pi can keep up. I wasn't trying to pull an argument of authority bringing up that I was a blockchain developer but just give you context for my claims, I appologize if it came across any other way. \n\nD) I agree it's just a difference of opinions. I believe that an increase would have more benefit than what's lost, and I believe we wouldn't be loosing anything we can't afford to loose. I can't debate you the usefulness of the missing transactions. All we really know is that the transactions can't afford to be included in the chain. IMO exclusion of transactions from the main chain where it's not absolutely neccessary is a shame.\n\nI think fundamentally we just disagree on the effect of bigger blocks. It's my assertion that if the miners do something against the majority social consenseus, peers will spin up miners and keep the original fork running. I don't think everyone running SPV nodes effects that much, unless the blocks were so big that it's prohibatively expensive to spin up a new miner. Bumping the blocksize up to 8mb wouldn't change the barrier to entry (of miners/full nodes) very much. I conceed it centralizes the system, I just don't think it's realistic to expect a global payment network to be processed by low power machines. If it can still be processed by a raspberry pi I don't see the risk.\n\nEdit: to get back to the point "" Bitcoin was created to be validated by all participants that needed to. Taking that possibility away destroys a very fundamental part of bitcoin.""

Larry Silverstein owned the trade center buildings, he bought them and was suffering huge losses and also became had a huge asbestos problem with both buildings and building 7 which estimates were going to cost between 1 and 2 billion dollars to remove.  Asbestos is already very expensive to remove just in someones garage, nevermind multiple 100+ story buildings.  Suddenly 2 months before the planes crash into the building, he updates his insurance policy to specifically cover ""acts of terrorism where planes fly into the side of the building"".  Wouldnt you know it, Larry has all the luck, 2 months later, Lucky Larry's failing buildings that were full of asbestos, are demolished by *exactly what was covered in his insurance,* which he updated only 2 months prior, and he thusly received **the worlds largest insurance payout in human history up until that point.**  Somewhere around 4 billion dollars.  I'm **very** interested in what they've uncovered with the insurance company internal talks between insurance companies and Larry Silverstien, and who knows what else involved in all the murky waters of 9/11, the attacks, the response, and the trillion dollar war that was waged with the enormous detour of Iraq for no reason.

Second, since the genesis block(s) are made by a good actor...hell..even if you gave the gave the genesis block a different time than the actual time it doesn't matter because its the first block, the second block can only differ more than 2 hours or else it will be rejected and it can't be less than the first one so since everyone is using one time zone and we have this limit it seems like it all works out. \n\nStill...what happens if someone timestamps a block a little bit further in time (by accident) and some other person sees that and timestamps it earlier than that block, does the earlier one get picked?",1546414552,t1_ed1yl31,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abj9kf/bitcoin_mining_difficulty_adjusts_10_upwards_for/ed2ezpc/

Bitcoin,ed0ps6f,abjakd,This is tricky because nodes aren't guaranteed to be in sync. A naive load balancer that only checks if the node is responding to requests will result in the creation of a bunch of edge cases. In my experience you'll want to write a smart health check daemon that compares the data / block heights of your nodes with multiple external sources in order to remove nodes that are not healthy from the load balancer. ,1546362140,t3_abjakd,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abjakd/whats_the_best_way_to_setup_two_nodes_in_load/ed0ps6f/
Bitcoin,ed1hen2,abjakd,"Probably the biggest problem affecting reliability and preventing Bitcoin scaling is that there are a lot of shitheads who like to DDoS attack public Bitcoin nodes.  And many of them are actually in the Bitcoin ""community"".  So here is one way to mitigate that:\n\nGet two VPS accounts at different providers.  Put one node on each.  Setup tunnels from each of these servers to a third server with its own node at your location.  Your local node only connects to your two VPS nodes.  Disable any kind of node discovery on the local node, and try to keep the IP address from being used for any other Bitcoin activity.  You will need to disable the advertising of your (local) IP address on all of these nodes as well (which I don't recall how to do off the top of my head).\n\nThat's the basic theory.  When one of your public nodes goes down, you can easily bring up another one.  You can add more nodes on different networks or in different geographic regions, if necessary.  If your local node is on a dynamic IP address, you can cycle a new one if it has trouble.  But the idea is to prevent that.

Bitcoin,ed33ji5,abn4tn,"Hard to say. The market is definitely more desperate now than what it was in the 6k range. But I am not yet convinced that we have seen the bottom already. To my taste it's still too optimistic, i.e. I expect the bottom yet to come.\n\nIn the end, nobody can make predictions with certainty, because it depends on events in laws, regulations, political and fiscal decisions, the stock market, other world events, and of course news from the bitcoin world. And on top of all that comes the psychology of the traders and private and institutional investors, how they interpret these signs.\n\nI personally see a 20% likelihood that the bottom remains above 3k, 60% that it bottoms out between 1.5k and 3k, and 20% that it falls below 1.5k (splitting this 20% into 15% above 900 and 5% sub-900).\n\nUnless something terrible happens, I expect a moderate upturn around Q3/2019 leading us to price levels of 2-3 times ""bottom"" by mid 2020 (wherever that ""bottom"" is). I see prices above 10k not in 2019, and new ATH (i.e. surpassing 20k) at earliest 2020 (probability=10%), but more likely 2021 or later (p=90%), possibly not before around 2023-2024 (p=65%).\n\nI see the often-quoted 6-digit prices not before 2025 (and only if circumstances remain favourable in the face of risks, see below) (p=80%).\n\nAll this is quite difficult to ""predict"" of course, because of way too many unknowns, like e.g. (in no particular order):\n\nUp(+) / Down(-) potential because of:\n\n* (+) India legalizing Bitcoin and local exchanges\n* (+) Euro currency crisis in Europe e.g. due to Italy\n* (+) Another banking crisis (Europe, world)\n* (+) Accelerating inflation in USD due to USD ponzi scheme becoming more and more apparent, US economy too weak to justify amount of new debt each year.\n* (+) Big players (companies) adopting Bitcoin/LN\n* (+) Firefox/Mozilla/Smartphone OS providing native BTC/LN support (without plugins)\n* (+) LN with cool GUI for end users, and watch tower services\n* (+) Side chains (rsk or alike) with 2-way peg opening to individual users, boosting tx capacity enormously, trading rsk (or alike) vs. btc on exchanges to reduce amount of 2-way-peg on chain TXs (still 3+ years ahead)\n* (+) Market starting pricing-in anticipated Block reward halving event around May 2020.\n* (+) ETF (not other kind of ETP) accepted with requirement for 100% backing by BTC (unlikely, ca. 20%)\n* (-) ETF rejected (more likely, ca. 80%)\n* (-) ETF accepted, but long term getting too much power over Bitcoin as a dominating market participant, destroying BTC's original value proposition (see also Andreas Antonopulous' concerns why Bitcoin ETFs are a bad idea) - more of a mid-long-term concern for price for 4+ years after ETF gets licensed.\n* (+/-/?) Stock market crash, world recession (""+"" because ppl flee into btc & gold, or ""-"" because ppl sell btc to cover living expenses after getting unemployed)\n* (+) Space company mining gold from asteroid (15+ years from now), investors move from gold to btc because of new inflation of gold. (similar effect as the sudden growth of supply of gold after the spanish brought gold from south america in the 16th century)\n* (-) Legal Bitcoin ban in favour of Central Bank issued digital tokens, in important countries (would revolutionize banking money system, to happen not before 3+ years from now)\n* (-) Sun flares like 100 years ago, destroying significant parts of energy and communication infrastructure both in space (satellites) and on earth (transmission lines...) - effect on Bitcoin would be the smallest problem in our modern society, logistics standstill, anarchy in big cities, food shortages, ...\n* (-) 51% attack coordinated by a state/central bank, disagreement in Bitcoin community how to handle it (checkpoints? PoW Algo change? regular change? algorithmic change schedule?), hard forks, media talk of a ""finally failed experiment"" ...\n* (-) quantum computer or mathematical approach to weaken Bitcoin encryption (unlikely near-mid term)\n* (-) little innovation for protocol or GUI enhancements and corporate adoption, falling below expectations, stagnation\n\n...and I probably forgot many other opportunities and risks.

This is called survivorship bias.\n\nThe only thing that gives the predictions’ correctness some credibility is the repeated success of its’ source, suggesting it is not a mere guess but has some underlying assumptions being correct.

Bitcoin,ed9jfgr,abn4tn,"I won’t say that, but glad we are at least discussing something rather than tossing random quotes at each other :)\n\nAlpha is a weird measure of performance imho, because the market itself is an ever-evolving entity, just like a river. Thus it is never the same at any two points in time. There are just way too many variables globally to estimate the direction of the stock markets, thus most one can do is “guesstimate”. Sometimes they can have high alpha other times they won’t do track record becomes a blurry thing. This is why your quote of “past performance ...” actually applies there. Only few exceptions I know against this (like Buffett) but that is mostly because of isolated calls on his end.\n\nWhat I am suggesting on the prediction of static or near-static entities however is different. There you can actually pinpoint why the prediction is made and what basis it has. If it depends on mostly correct assumptions than you should see positive or negative correlations on the end results. This is true for plumber case because it is skill based. Sure there might be really rusty outlier pipes here and there but if you have enough number of data points your model will converge to sth meaningful. Similarly bitcoin so far is a closed space entity, so if somebody had long track record to call the directions successfully it might, just might, mean sth. Without that it is completely meaningless, and only pops up on survivorship bias cases.\n\nThat is all I am saying essentially.

The easiest on-ramp is a major exchange (if you are in the USA, Coinbase or Gemini are good options to get started).  If you prefer to keep your Bitcoin in cold storage, you can easily buy a ledger or trezor hardware wallet, or you can generate your own paper wallet for free. If you do a paper wallet just download a wallet generator, then generate your private-public key pair offline, and print on a hard-wired printer while offline. Then you can laminate it if you wish, or put into a zip-lock, and store in your safe or in a bank safety deposit box if you wish. You can transfer all or part of your Bitcoin from the online exchange wallet to your paper wallet or to your hardware wallet any time you want.\n\nEDIT:  \n\n(a) I neglected to mention mobile wallets (eg. breadwallet) as another good option, very easy to use, so a nice option for someone new.\n\n(b) Personally, I would *not* recommend any user to keep any significant % of their crypto holdings on exchanges.

Coinbase, Gemini & Bitstamp) could be good as an ""on-ramp"", easy for new users, and generally increases utility, so keeping an account with one of them is not a bad thing, but my own recommendation would be to keep most or all of your holdings in cold storage, and simply using the exchange when needed.

Bitcoin,ed2gqca,aboqsl,">the current thinking on this is to find a way for full nodes to provide cryptographic proof of a block breaking consensus rules.\n\nThis thinking has been abandoned (It's also not *current*; it's from the naive time when Satoshi just wrote the paper and thought `nSequence` was a plausible way to implement payment channels and the `1 RETURN` bug was not yet fixed).  The problem is that we have no good way of listing *all* consensus rules, including consensus rules that happen as a consequence of implementation (""bugs""), and with new additions to Bitcoin occurring every few years, we are adding new consensus rules also, which themselves requires new proof-of-violation to be created.\n\nSome rules might not have an easy proof-of-violation, either.  For example, suppose there is a block where one of the transactions spends a UTXO that has never existed.  This is a proof-of-nonexistence, which tends to require that you... download the entire blockchain and check that no, that UTXO does not exist in any of the previous blocks.  But if you're downloading the entire blockchain, you might as well just be a fullnode.  Now suppose you say, ""Oh but we only have to download the full blockchain if somebody says this block has a UTXO that never existed"".  Then by tomorrow I write a spamming fullnode that says ""this block has a UTXO that never existed! and that block!  also that block! and that block 144 blocks ago!"" which means every such ""SPV"" node is automatically promoted to a fullnode that downloads all the blocks.  So no, such a thing is not possible.\n\nIt requires that you are able to write out all the rules, and never change them, meaning you also have to somehow prevent softforks that add new rules, which is in general not possible if alt dev teams make a popular-enough version with a softfork that everyone prefers over your stodgy old rules.  In short, it requires that you be perfect and that all possible extensions and uses of the blockchain have already been known to you.  Which will not happen, because any designer will have limits to their abilities, because they do not possess infinitely rational brains larger than the universe squared.  New rules will be needed later, and you need new ways to have proof-of-violation of new rules, and that means adding more and more to your blockchain.",1546417448,t1_ed2e2qw,/r/Bitcoin/comments/aboqsl/simplified_payment_verification/ed2gqca/

This means Blockstream does control the data that's being broadcasted, but not the broadcast itself.\n\nThere is a contract between Blockstream and a satellite operator, which most likely gives the satellite operator a certain level of control (at least an on/off button).\n\nIt shows Blockstream has world-scale ambitions with bitcoin. But on a technological level, it won't be significant till they launch innovative services on top of this network.\n\nOh and by the way, broadcasting data via satellite networks isn't as expensive as you might think.

In addition to that some mobile phone plans provide text messaging capabilities without providing the ability to establish TCP connections.\n\nSo whether or not SMS is being used over GSM and repackaged in SMTP over IP, pulled using POP3 or IMAP by a proprietary client at the service provider level which then delivers a push notification to a custom HTTP service running as a part of the mobile phone's core operating system and persisting the message to messages app on the recipient's smart phone is irrelevant.

Bitcoin,ed2a8hs,abov0i,"The LN, is composed of many insights.\n\n1.  It is possible to create a cryptocurrency system, without the use of blockchain, but is dependent on some other, secure cryptocurrency system.\n    * This is basis of idea of ""sidechain"".  Sidechain is a blockchain, but it uses tokens that are created on a separate blockchain.\n    * In LN, the realization is that, it is not needed to use a blockchain to scale a blockchain (the ""sidechain error""; you are simply *moving* the scaling problem to another blockchain, not *solving* it).  We can instead have consensus in a cryptocurrency system by limiting the set of parties in that system to a fixed set, then having all of them sign each update of the cryptocurrency system.\n        * The important insight here, is that the size of this system is immaterial.\n        * All that is important is: if *you* have money in that cryptocurrency system, then *you* should have veto rights in it.  Then the rest of the system can have 1 more participant for all you care, or 100 participants, all of which are actually the same person.  Hence, two-party payment channels are sufficient.\n        * Veto rights simply means you can refuse to accept an update, and that update will not be added to the system.  This is trivially implemented by an n-of-n multisignature: if you do not sign an update, that update can never occur on the cryptocurrency system.\n        * Update systems are needed that can effectively invalidate old updates by transfer of data.  Poon-Dryja is one such system; it is the basis of current LN.  Other systems such as Decker-Wattenhofer are possible.  A new system, Decker-Russell-Osuntokun (""eltoo"") has been proposed but requires changes at the blockchain layer.\n2.

Bitcoin,ed2a8z4,abq766,"You don't ensure that. Currently, I think fees might be a bit on the low end, but basically it's up to each node to set their own fee policy. If some nodes decide they want to keep fees low to let people get into and play with LN cheaply, then that's what you have to compete with. I don't think there's too much money to be had from being a routing node yet, but there's nodes that have a more expensive routing policy (like a feerate of 0.25 percent of tx value) that still are doing quite well, this shows that there is demand.  \n\n\nMost people running nodes now, I guess, either does it because they want to learn, or to use it for their own transactions - whether they receive payments or they are more payers using services.  \n\n\nYou are wrong that it's batching. I use to think of it as 0-conf transactions with better security. \n\nA 0-conf transaction is a transaction that is not yet mined, but a shop might still accept it because they are reasonably sure it will be mined.\n\nA payment channel-transaction is a multisig-transaction with properties  that makes it submittable by \*both\* parties at any time, with reduced risk for doublespend. The doublespend protection is the timelocks on force-closing of channels, giving you (or a watchtower) ample time to correct the issue. This added security makes it safe not to submit it to the mempool, which means that should you later decide to change the amount, you \*can\* do so! An LN transaction thus doesn't create more data to be written to the blockchain when the channel closes (except in special circumstances when things go wrong), so it's not batching.  \n\n\nLN is made up of many such secure payment channels, so secure that nodes are willing to pay on your behalf to the destination \*even before\* you have given them money. The first part of an LN payment is you sending a cryptographic proof that these money exist, and a hash that together with the proof that the payment is paid to the end can be submitted to the blockchain if necessary, to claim the money from you. Now, since neither party usually want that, because that incurs fees and will lead to new channels having to be created, things are settled safely between channel partners and the ready-to-submit transactions are updated with new balances.  \n\n\nHope this has increased your understanding just a tiny bit.  \n",1546407959,t3_abq766,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abq766/questions_about_opening_a_lightning_channel/ed2a8z4/

Instead, what happens is this:\n\n1.  I offer you a payment with the condition, that you need to tell me a secret.\n2.  You can only learn that secret by forwarding the payment of a slightly smaller amount to another node.\n\nNote that if you stall, you can never learn the secret and the payment times out and reverts to the sender.\n\nNo node ever forwards a payment before receiving money.

Is it even possible for such a third party to exist without sacrificing the primary tenet of trustless money? \n\nI realize there are some creative use cases for multisig as a way to spread out the risk of loosing a single private key, but as far as I know, all such uses involve some counter party risk.\n\nObviously it's best for an individual to maintain tight control and security over their private keys. And there are ""best practices"" for doing so. But even if you've followed all best practices you still risk, however unlikely, an unforeseen catastrophic event that could suddenly and without warning annihilate you.\n\nNot really worried about this risk personally as I'm comfortable with my own security practices.

Wait for it to confirm (bitmex only requires a single confirmation) and orphan off the main chain by mining on top of the second oldest block, double spending the confirmed tx. They can double spend the tx with a new deposit tx to keep ""depositing"" for as long as exchanges allow deposits (unless the exchange is prepared for this).\n\nIf they would margin sell (high leverage) with the bitcoin they deposited 10 times they could crash the price.

Bitcoin,ed2zq5o,abtyz8,"There is a big difference between 'maximalists' and 'bitcoin users', the same as there is a difference between 'islamic extremist' and 'followers of islam' - one group is repulsive, the other inviting - one group is 1%, the other 99% - one group is loud, demanding, invasive, the other quiet, amenable, and passive.\n\nWhen you think 'what is wrong' about Bitcoin, the issue almost always flows to the extremists - not because they represent Bitcoin, but because they dominate talk (and many, unfortunately, have been promoted to moderator positions, etc). Macafee is a great example, ""Eating dicks"" is not investment advice, but LITERALLY EVERYONE LOVES TO AGREE OR DISAGREE to that statement - stuff like that should really be banned from 'bitcoin', similarly with Ver smears, but that's if you understand culture and community. (on the contrary, investment advice SHOULD be promoted instead).\n\n> They also call out scams - keep bad players in check\n\nThis is 100% - positively, completely false. This is a BAD way of thinking. It is TRULY TERRIBLE (aside the minor exception to bitcoin com and twitter bitcoin redirecting, which is more of brand defending from a relatively egregious attack). But calling out scams, such as ""Bitcoin Private"", without a 100% sound basis (sure, 3 Mil hidden coins became discovered, but they were labeled a scam months in advance of any actual knowledge), is completely, ABSOLUTELY terrible practice.\n\nETH people do the same thing. It's a REALLY stupid practice. It's as logical as censorship. **Stupid people do stupid things**. Sure, DEMONSTRATE how you are better - educate how you are better - but NEVER call others ""scam"". That's stupidity, base level thinking.\n\nETH (for example) calls literally everyone who does an ICO a scam, despite ETH doing an ICO. ETH calls others who sell unfinished products scams, despite their product being unfinished...\n\nAnd Bitcoin is also 'unfinished' in some respects (not remotely comparable to the degree of unfinished'ness of ETH) but one could argue it's not 'perfect'. Is Bitcoin Gold a scam? What is the quantitative reason for saying ya or nah? How does Monero get a pass lol? (that's always the funniest to me - all BTC maximalist have decided, at some point, Monero and BTC are chums just because Fluffy poured some wine and told some jokes...) Is that *really* what defines scam or no scam? Whether or not you get your ego sucked off?\n\n""Scam"" label is about as stupid as calling someone a ""terrorist"" or ""unhinged"" or ""politically incorrect"". It is an inventive, obtuse term which is used to stroke one's ego, as opposed to educate. BTC (or ETH) *could* demonstrate how they (as organizations) are superior to others, and then highlight these differences without relying upon use of undefined terminology to invent their differences day to day - that process is reliable, instructive, educating, and allows users to form their own judgements, objectively.\n\nVirtue signalling is an *absolutely horrendous process*. By praising those who denounce others as *liars* or *scams* the loudest, you encourage others to worship them as a source of moral certitude - instead of teaching others *what is moral*, etc.\n\nI know you mean well, but I am 100% certain you are wrong to praise others for being unnecessarily hostile, and for telling others to follow their advice (blah blah is a Scam!!!), as opposed to allowing them to make informed judgements (BTCP mined 3 Mil coins without disclosure). In the second example, I prove to an educated person *scam* without resorting to 2 year old name calling, and in the first example I say ""Look at me, look at me, look at me"".\n\nThat first behavior is absolutely bad, repulsive, and atrocious - for Bitcoin.",1546444080,t1_ed2vpjx,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abtyz8/maximalists_scare_away_reasonable_people_poison/ed2zq5o/

""Bitcoin maximalist"" for me is someone having a high degree of conviction that in the long run one cryptocurrency will accrue the most amount of value/users, and it looks like it will be bitcoin.  \n\nThis conviction can be arrived at by logic and reasoning, and doesn't need to be expressed as ""loud, demanding, invasive"" (as you describe). I've seen plenty of people arguing in an opposite way of that. Not saying that being ""maximalist"" protects somehow from being a troll, but screaming and shouting is not what makes one a maximalist - in my opinion.

Bitcoin,ed3aqsp,abtyz8,"That, is not at all, how one *generally* perceives a maximalist. I will clarify:\n\n> conviction that in the long run one cryptocurrency will accrue the most amount of value/users\n\nOK, that's obvious...\n\n> and it looks like it will be bitcoin.\n\nWhat you are denying yourself is the implicit follow up statement... AND ONE SHOULD BUY BITCOIN.\n\nAs in, the whole *freaking* idea of 'supporting Bitcoin' is that you can buy shares in it, or can get paid in it by providing services to it - NOT that ""obvious obvious obvious"". You are absolutely falsely reflecting upon your own actions and behaviors if you *believe* that you are stating:\n\n""Bitcoin could become really big - NEVER ACT ON THIS INFORMATION.""\n\nYou 100% are suggesting to either buy it, or work for it. Or that in some way this information is useful. That's the idea behind *productive, constructive thought* that it is actionable.\n\n---\n\nThe falacy is multifold:\n\nAction 1: Buying Bitcoin\n\n> That is relative to X, Y, Z assets... is BTC a good value comparative to USD or ETH, for example? Without comparison, your suggestion is generally meaningless, aside for the *very* passive investor, at which point you *should* omit your comparative statement ""Bitcoin will grow bigger than all others"" and should only be self-referencial ""Bitcoin will grow bigger than Bitcoin of prior years"".\n\n> Similarly, time is relevant here. Is buying Bitcoin in 2017 the same as buying Bitcoin in 2019? Is buying Bitcoin May, 2020 the same as buying Bitcoin May, 2022? Any educated user knows otherwise...\n\nAction 2: Work for Bitcoin\n\n> How do you get paid? When, how, can you get paid working for Bitcoin, does it pay better than other comparable occupations? Sure, you can clarify ""Luke gets paid shit and begs for money all the time, NOW, but one day, if Bitcoin grows, he could get paid better than the 100th most important person working for Ethereum"", for example.\n\nYou can further make some other *actionable* statements such as, working for Bitcoin will pay better in the future than it does now (self-referential), but again, you should omit the comparison to other products *because you are not even analyzing other products*.\n\nThere is the action, which is inherently evil, which I will state as:\n\nAction 3: Slave, Donate to Bitcoin\n\n> In this scenario, you own share of Bitcoin or Walmart, and you are encouraging young people to trade time for no wages what-so-ever or to benefit yourself without any expectation of trade off. This is very similar to churches saying ""your reward is an early, impoverished death"" and meeting the invisible man who says job well done.\n\nThat's a very bold and malicious lie to sell ignorant people, but perhaps that is how one justifies their actions: knowledge of God, etc.\n\nBut assuming imperfect understanding, you make statements to direct *positive* action, which can either be working for Bitcoin (for money, or some convertibility thereof), or to invest in Bitcoin (for money, or some convertibility thereof for goods, services, skills, etc).\n\nIn either situation, you are ABSOLUTELY ignorant to believe *at all times* Bitcoin will outperform *every other asset ever*, IMO. History says you are wrong, but who knows the future... maybe starting tomorrow BTC begins a straight upward trajectory - or *paying* jobs working for BTC open at an unlimited rate. If not, you are giving bad *implied* advice. And you know that is what you are implying... same as those who say *bitcoin is sound money*... the implication is clear ""buy Bitcoin"" not ""let's bullshit and waste our lives as if we are idiots, together"".\n\n---\n\nSo to clarify where you are wrong:\n\n1) You make a *relative statement* that is clearly historically and *probably futuristically* inaccurate - at certain points in time.\n\n> accrue the most amount of value\n\nIf it has already accrued the most value (which it has), then your statement is meaningless - but as you imply about the *future* your statement is easily interpreted as *relative to all others*... ""accrue the most value, relative to all others""... and then you have to make the *natural* followup (for educated investors) ""to come""... as in, the value is not already priced in, as a % of product... thus you mean to say (with full clarity):\n\n""accrue the most value - as a percentage to current value - relative to all others""\n\nThis is clearly your implication, but this is also clearly wrong, historically (and frankly is a nonsense statement).\n\nYour other alternative is to clarify your meaning, ""accrue the most users - providing the most job opportunities""... this may come to be true, but I would disagree based on what I see from Ethereum vs Bitcoin, historically.\n\nI will help you craft an actually true statement, that communicates what I believe you intend to communicate, without the brain washing:\n\n> Bitcoin is the front runner with the lowest downside risk of extinction.\n\nStating the current, actual, negative is generally much more accurate than stating the positive... or to put another way ""It is unlikely Bitcoin will suddenly be worth $0, as comparative to any other choice, as of Jan, 2019.""\n\nPredicting the future, such as ""nothing will ever be better than Bitcoin"" is a pretty wild assumption - and particularly when you add in the relative aspects which applies to new users - ""nothing will ever be better than Bitcoin, at every possible moment in time"". Such as statement is truly fanatical, and the tell-tale sign of the maximalist, religious extremist.\n\nI think it's also *very fair* to say that ""And I believe the value of Bitcoin today will be worth more any Bitcoin 4 years into the future"" - this is self-referential, and doesn't *assume* limitations upon the outside world. As in, Bitcoin obeys the rules of Bitcoin, but it does not say ""and everyone else, throughout time, will obey Bitcoin rules, or they are cheating"" - such a statement restricting the future moment of others is oppressive, in thought, and in action.\n\nIf you were honest with yourself, and stated the *implied* action aloud, whatever you intend that to be, I am positive you'd find that:\n\n1) Either your words are meaningless, as you take no accountability for action, or\n\n2) Your words are extraneous, as you add salesman filler beyond what you intend to convey, or\n\n3) You would regret your words as false.\n\n---\n\nI do have great respect for you, but you should be honest with yourself, and communication with others, if your intent is to be honest.\n\nI often deceive. I make this plain, for the educated audience, and belligerent to the uneducated. Regardless of my intentions, I know I will be wrong, often - therefore, I adhore the responsibility of being right - and ""knowing the future"" (beyond explicit instruction or fantastical jest).\n\nBut if you are one who believes themselves to be one who can ""identify scams"" and communicate such knowledge to others, then at a minimum you should resist *actively* scamming others, and making a false predictions of the future (that frankly is ludicrous when considered objectively) that 'Bitcoin will be the best thing ever to come for cryptocurrency - forever and ever' - and instead should limit statements to current day, the past, or the negative.\n\n""Bitcoin has accrued the most value, has the highest new sales turnover, and is the least likely to experience a sharp decline of assets of a similar size"".\n\nThat could be verified historically (ignoring tether) - and would be supported by standard economic thinking. Your other statement is NOT supported by economics, or financial thought. I have high confidence you are more experienced in programming than in finance lit. Not to be dumb about this, but how do you think I would sound making predictions about computer hardware?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I do... I have opinions on *everything*, but I am willing to defer to others, regularly, and resist emphaticness in matters in which I am *objectively* undereducated.\n\nIf you want to talk money, you can follow me [here](https://twitter.com/MayorOfBitcoin/status/1075481365200683013), and I will show how I acquire significant shares of Bitcoins without significant work or money. I will likely cut this short, as I have no real desire to give away so much free insight - I am simply not that charitable toward the world as a whole, nor do I have so much that I can afford to sell short my future family, etc.\n\nWhat you will find is that I am able to buy, hold, and trade Bitcoins for profit, by analyzing trends, etc. The statement ""Bitcoin will one day be everything"" is meaningless to me, because I will own more Bitcoins than I would have, had I followed that advice as if it were true every moment of every day.\n\nToday I own more Bitcoins than I did in 2017, without a dime of added investment, and have cashed out (or diversified) 300% of my original investment. That is an action which is only profitable because you are wrong in the immediate, regardless if you prove right, one day - and if that day comes, and say it comes like a thief in the night, than I am on equal footing as I would have been, otherwise.\n\nI strongly recommend Antifragile by Nassim Taleb, if you want to consider yourself educated in finance - and by the statements you make, you want others to consider your opinion to be one of merit, so... you do.",1546452610,t1_ed349wp,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abtyz8/maximalists_scare_away_reasonable_people_poison/ed3aqsp/

Bitcoin,ed3fiqw,abunr4,">What should I do? Should I actually go out and buy a physical wallet?\n\nHow terrible would it be for you to lose it all?\n\nIf somewhere between ""pretty bad"" and ""really catastrophic"", then yes, you should buy a hardware wallet and transfer the funds to it as soon as you're comfortable with the usage of it (test with a small amount first).\n\nHowever if you're willing to go with ""a bit less security, but still way better than leaving it on the exchange"" you could just download a mobile wallet.  Samourai is well known and respected on Android, and I personally like bitWallet on iOS (the UI is terrible, but it's functionally very good).  The ""less security"" of a mobile wallet is the fact that the device is storing your private keys and so if your device can be hacked, the keys can be stolen.  With a hardware wallet, the keys are on the hardware wallet which itself never connects to the internet and has no way to send the keys over the cable to a computer, only the transaction data.\n\n> If not, what could potentially happen if I leave my funds in those exchanges.\n\n""Probably"" nothing bad.  But you're trusting someone else who might not have your best intentions at heart and is a ""juicy target"" for attacks.  If someone hacks the exchange and steals all the bitcoin, that includes yours.  Hackers are more likely to target an exchange with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin than your mobile phone with only $6000 worth of bitcoin on it.\n\nAnother risk is that the exchange itself just runs off with your coins and claims a hack.\n\nAnother - and this is the main drive behind proof-of-keys - is that the exchange might be *lying* about your bitcoin balance.  They might hold only 1000BTC but have 5000BTC as belonging to customers on their databases.  As long as people don't ask for all their money at once, the exchange can keep doing this, essentially selling you bitcoin that doesn't actually exist (which is just simple theft, but easy enough for them to do).  By withdrawing it, you *prove* that it's real by holding it yourself instead of just trusting what they're telling you.",1546456100,t1_ed3dv1z,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abunr4/remember/ed3fiqw/

Bitcoin,ed40fv4,abx2nu,"Full disclosure, I do not own this device, but have considered it. There are so many red flags I can't recommend it in good conscience. Any kind of antenna in the device makes it inherently unsecure. Worse, it has it's own power supply so the device could conceivably operate without any action by the user. It only works with a connection with a smartphone. I don't really see any enhanced security beyond what you may get on your smartphone, and a TAILS USB with an Electrum wallet would be a vastly superior option and it's free less the cost of a thumbdrive. \n\nThere's a few Amazon reviews that leave you scratching your head that the company hasn't deigned to respond to and the Google Play reviews for their very generically named ""ourtoken"" app--which is another risk because it would be easy to confuse it for a similarly named app that's been pumped to the top of the app store--generally indicate problems with functionality with no response from the devs. If a hardware wallet manufacturer lacks the resources to maintain their app and engage users in troubleshooting it raises serious doubts as to their ability to respond to critical security vulnerabilities. \n\nIn general, the less complex the device the smaller the attack surface. Consider a Ledger Nano S, currently available at a discount but Ledger is announcing a new device in a few days so you may want to wait, or a Trezor T which is more expensive, both have wallet integration so you can use them with wallet apps outside of official channels. ColdCard is another decent option but it currently lacks the ecosystem that the two previous hardware wallets share if that's what's important to you.

Bitcoin,ed5d60y,abx311,"I am fairly new in the crypto space but I liked HitBTC also because of low fees and for some reason I saw the prices DGB/BTC where mostly higher then on Bittrex. But when Huobi also listed Digibyte then I could not withdrwal my DGB there.   \n\n\nAn other time before the BCH hardfork, I had issues vulling my BCH. Their support told me my withdrawl address where not compatible with their latest system upgrade. I said to them I had no problem with my Ledger Nano S or Exodus wallet and other Exchanges using that same address.   \nThis was their excus:  \n\n\nDear trader,  \n\n\nUnfortunately, it is possible to withdraw BCH only to the new addres format.  \n Don't forget to include ""bitcoincash:""  \n\n\nBitcoin Cash has recently switched to new address format. So did we. Probably the software which you're using to receive transactions from HitBTC hasn't switched to new address format? We would suggest you to send your funds to a wallet, which software supports new addresses.  \nIf you get this message ""This address doesn't look like Bitcoin Cash one. Please, check carefully and fill in the relevant address"", it seems like the sending party doesn't support the new format.   \n\n\nIt makes sense to contact them in order to clarify whether and when the new format will be supported.   \n\n\nSorry about the inconvenience you're experiencing. It's the downside of the progress, but it's temporary.  \n\n\nRegards,  \nEmiliana Bracco  \nHitBTC Support Team  \n\n\nMy BCH was stuck there for weeks, so I had to sell it there for BTC which I was able to withdrawl.   \n\n\nMy first issue with them when I had deposited Stellar XLM there it was stuck there for weeks.   \nI had to sell it for BTC and before I was able to transfer my money out.   \n\n\nBut on the other hand I have been trading a lot of Digibyte there and that mostly went well.  \nBut you take a risk if you use them.   \n\n\nPrior to ""Proof of Keys"" event, about 2 weeks before I already had my pulled my DGB from Bittrex without any problems. I never ever had a problem with withdrawls. I where the deposits of DGB that where a pain in the ass. They needed 200 confirmations that took 30 min to an hour. So I reached out to devellopers of Digibyte and asked them if they could not sent a message to them. Since other exchanges like KuCoin and OKEy did not have that problem, your funds where there directly. I asked Bittrex support to lower the confirmations and now it is down to 100 confirmations (still long but a lot better)  \n\n\nWhat is the use having a fast blockchain like Digibyte as Bittrex asks for 200 confirmations it was ridiculous.  \n\n\nBut Bittrex has higher fees then HitBTC but at leased you get your coins back.   \n\n\nOn 27 december I pulled my Zcash (ZEC) and Populous (PPT) from Binance, no problem what so ever.  \nOn 31 december I pulled my  DENT off the Binance, again without any issues.   \n\n\nPersonally I don't see a lot of people having problems until now, just a few people. More people promoting PoK then people reporting failing withdrawls. I expected a lot more failures to take place.  \n\n\nAnd HitBTC already had withdrawl issues, nothing new there. Luckily I have always been able to sell the coins I could not withdhrew for BTC, which I could withdhrew. So a hassle, but no financial loss.   \n\n\nSo I am curieus how many people expercience withdrawl issues other then on Coinbase and on HitBTC.   \n\n\nDid anybody see problems with Binance and Bittrex?  \n(these are my favorite platforms but like to know if they are safe?)  \n\n\n&#x200B;",1546523137,t1_ed3uaj9,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abx311/list_of_exchanges_to_blacklist_for_failing_proof/ed5d60y/

If you just broadcast both at the same time most likely most miners will only see one or the other transaction so the miners that saw the low fee one will continue mining it.

Bitcoin,ed45ozg,abyt5b,"Cold storage on short notice is a challenge because you don't have any time to get a hardware wallet. That said you still have options.\n\nProbably the easiest option is to generate a wallet on the Bitcoin Core app on an offline computer which will also generate a wallet address that you can send funds to. Use a strong pass*phrase*, you can query DuckDuckGo for how to best make secure passphrases, to encrypt the wallet files. Copy the wallet.dat file to an USB drive. Copy/paste the public address into a text file and save that on the USB drive as well. Delete wallet.dat from the computer. Backup your encrypted wallet.dat in several places for redundancy.\n\nYou can then send funds to the public address and setup a watching only wallet with the public address to keep track of UTXOs but there's no way to send out of the wallet. Improvements to that process can be suggested but it only increases the complexity, for example using a live linux OS to generate the wallet files and storing them in an encrypted db using something like KeePass. You will still be able to interact with your crypto so long as you have the USB drive, you'll just need to copy the wallet.dat file to the appropriate directory and launch Bitcoin Core remembering to copy it back to the USB and delete it from the host machine.\n\nAll that said, the only thing you need to regenerate your wallet is your seed phrase so you can follow the steps to create a wallet offline and rather than saving the wallet file you just delete it and save the public address for sending. Keep a couple Apocalypse proof copies of your seed phrase in different locations to recover access when you need it and setup a watching only wallet to monitor what you send to your public address. You can pick up a Dremel engraver or similar and some metal engraving plates from a hardware or craft store for like 25-ish fiat units and make your own seed phrase backups.",1546474473,t3_abyt5b,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abyt5b/cold_storage_advice_for_noobs_and_intermediate/ed45ozg/

Bitcoin,eelvxa7,abznev,"It should be judged by its technology, its forward looking innovations and the practicality of it achieving its stated purpose.\n\n""Hodlers"" are a virus upon the ecosystem. Often by definition, hippocrates. With one sentence they condemn the current financial institution, and the woes which plague it: disproportionately distributed wealth leading to massive class gaps, the failure of the Reaganomic platform due to hoarding of wealth by the top 1-2% and vast pay gaps. Spit in the faces of the Reserve Banks and deficit spending- without understanding that the purpose of those systems is to ensure growth in an economy, by stimulating spending and creating the accumulation of debt, which in turn drives motivation (or at minimum a need) to work. Work builds infrastructure, creates export which we hope to trade with others and gives our new notes value. A desire to escape the mundane of a life living off unskilled labor leads to motivation for innovation- the more we innovate, the more we can lay down our picks and axes and hand them to our partners in trade who lack the creativity we express as a population.\n\nIs the system perfect? Far from it. It is incredibly flawed. But bitcoin (nor any digital currency) was not the first attempt at a free economy either- there have been many and all have failed within a couple decades.\n\nLook at the Free Banking system in the US in the 1860s, it bares striking resemblance to the cryptocurrency revolution. It's ultimate demise was the unregulated and extreme proliferation of new currencies, each taking small value from one another, poor arbitrage between non-liquid free markets, difficulty of obtaining or setting a single medium of exchange and a lack of backing other than by the power and resources vested in the minting agents themselves.\n\nBack to ""hodlers,"" what is it that you are doing that will eventually lead to demise of the coin? You are hindering innovation, decreasing liquid currency supply, and attempting to profit off the pyramid of difficulty ladders and reward halvings, so that you might get rich without effort nor innovation.\n\nBut you see, what you are creating is not a currency, but a collector's item: no different than baseball cards. Correct in your statement that the more who refuse to sell, the higher goes the price- but that creates a system where the developers, arguably those with the greatest stake in the coin, need not innovate, but simply watch their reserves grow in paper value. Absent this unnatural growth caused by nothing more than the ""collector's phenomenon,"" the holders of the coin would need to find a different pathway to increase its worth- a pathway involving ingenuity, innovation and improvement. But, inherently lazy, without that motivation driven by a lust for more, not present artificiality, innovation slows to but a mere trickle.\n\nThe rest is fairly obvious. If you believe in a true, free currency for all, then it is up to you to contribute. Contribute to the network by mining (even if it's a break even game), or running a full node. More importantly, contribute to the economy by spending, **not hodling.** \n\nDon't think this is geared toward the entire audience of this sub. I see a fairly even split among those who understand the concept and are true supporters, and those who would be better off trading baseball cards for what it's worth.\n\nI implore and encourage any intelligent, well thought out counterargument in rebuttal to my theories laid forth here. I'll take the usual accusations of being some sort of paid employee for the evil block corporations or misdirected insults as further validation to my point.",1548063505,t3_abznev,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abznev/judge_bitcoin_by_yearly_lows_not_all_time_highs/eelvxa7/

When it was created, the technological landscape was so different. Everyone had a PC or a Laptop, now 70% of Americans exclusively use mobile devices for non-work related activities. That number is just going to keep tilting towards mobile devices, leading to more centralization and a network not equipped to run natively on mobile devices. Mining is incredibly inefficient and has become completely centralized among a few major pools. The 10 minute block time sets the limit on transaction confirmation time and it will never be able to compete with other central payment platforms.\n\nI'm not saying Bitcoin isn't revolutionary, but at its core it is just a piece of software. Software can be upgraded only for so long before a new edition must be released.\n\nCertainly taking from bitcoins concepts, and learning from its mistakes, I believe the next revolution could begin. I can't think of a single time in history anyone has ever gotten something 100% right the first time.\n\nI think the only reason there hasn't been development is because the current system is still making a lot of people money on a daily basis (I mean the companies involved.)\n\nI have nothing bad to say of bitcoin, I just think that  with the right motivations and the correct team, something completely new could arise that solves all the pitfalls of the Blockchain 1.0 Cryptocurrencies.",1546532531,t1_ed4rzl0,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abznev/judge_bitcoin_by_yearly_lows_not_all_time_highs/ed5p2i7/

Bitcoin,ed5p3um,abznev,"> But I fail to see how a deflationary currency makes sense and how it would work in a global economy based on debt.\n\nCheck out The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous. \n\nThe economics of an economy based on Hard Money (Bitcoin) would be a different model akin to Austrian Economics. They basically say that money should never be inflated to 'protect' the economy and when boom bust cycles happen they are telling you information about the economy. \n\nIf you artificially protect against this you are not absorbing that information or addressing the underlying issues and the cycle is worse rather than better. You can see this in the data, there have been more volitility and boom/bust cycles since the introduction of unbacked FIAT currency. \n\nIt's interesting stuff, I'm still learning a lot myself.",1546532560,t1_ed55t7z,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abznev/judge_bitcoin_by_yearly_lows_not_all_time_highs/ed5p3um/

Bitcoin,ed53lpb,abznev,"Bitcoin, and the framework that led to it being required and developed, is complex.  Very few people actually understand how money works.

That group of people has grown over time.  The people who use nodes to secure their bitcoin.  Along with them have come the shysters and charlatans. They've hyped up crypto to be more than the people who want financial sovereignty have ever cared about. \n\nThen the hype bursts, but that original group is double its size.  And then it doubled again. It's still tiny.  Probably justifying $250 a coin.  And then a new set of hype merchants try to separate you from your bitcoin.  And then the bitcoin hodlers double again.  All the while these people say you need protect your bitcoin.  Secure your keys. Every time the hype bursts, a new set of salty scammers abandon crypto. \n\nThe actual value in bitcoin, and crypto, is tiny.  These market caps mean nothing.  I suspect that a single one billion dollar buy of bitcoin would double its price at least, and that metric is even more pronounced in alts.  The only people that really matter, as far as i'm concerned, is the hodlers in bitcoin.  They provide the floor in all crypto.  Anything other than bitcoin is mostly a distraction.

So now the whole world knows that all they have to do to steal all your bitcoin is figure out where you put those volumes, and what your password is.  Since you mentioned that you don't store them in your house, we can pretty easily guess that they're stored in the cloud somewhere.  Because if you're too cheap to buy a hardware wallet, you're definitely too cheap to put anything in a safe deposit box.  And you're probably bad at picking and remembering passwords, so the password to those TrueCrypt volumes is probably the same or similar to a password that you use for one or several of your online accounts, one or two of which has probably been compromised at some point.  Not to mention that all I need in order to steal all your bitcoin is infect the machine that you use to decrypt your TrueCrypt volumes - which, even if you use the ""air-gapped"" PC to decrypt them, means you will have to move your volumes back to it on an infect-able medium.  Keyloggers are a thing.  Malware can easily hitch a ride on whatever you use to move those files around.\n\nThe whole reason for having a hardware wallet is to ensure that nobody can access your private keys, not even you - you can only make your hardware wallet sign transactions using your private keys.

Bitcoin,ed4pwpg,abznev,"This looks like it may have been a misunderstanding. When he said ""run your own node"" he was not referring to running a *mining* node, but rather a *fully-validating* node (or ""full node"" for short).\n\nIn the first couple of years of Bitcoin's existence, the word ""node"" was used interchangeably to refer to either of these things. The mining functionality was eventually abstracted away from the validation functionality, allowing ASICs designed solely around hyper-efficient double-SHA256 performance to be hooked up to full nodes (which handle all the rest of Bitcoin's network operation). Since then, ""node"" has generally been used to refer to the non-mining client (which miners, or pools of miners, hook up to).\n\nThe advantage of running a node without a miner attached to it is that you're using Bitcoin without having to trust others; you're *validating things for yourself*. It also helps to preserve financial privacy. Pieter Wuille (a legendary Bitcoin developer) offered [a fantastic explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/3eq3y7/full_node_question/ctk4lnd) about this, if you're interested in reading more.\n\nThe reason why /u/Frogolocalypse assumed you were being disingenuous is that a small and hostile splinter community of anti-Bitcoin extremists (who unfortunately control both the ""btc"" subreddit and bitcoindotcom domain name) have been trying to spread the misinformation that ""non-mining nodes aren't nodes at all, and (somehow) hurt the Bitcoin network"" for years now... this is one of many myths that the Bitcoin community has been working to debunk through grassroots efforts.\n\nHopefully that helps to clear this up, and hopefully you can see why he might have made the assumption that he did. He was encouraging running a fully validating node and it seemed to him like you were trying to imply that if it wasn't a miner, it wasn't a node.

But telling me I ""don't know how USB works"" is insulting and not accurate. Your information is interesting, but your tone really makes me want to say ""fuck you"". \n\nIn any case, when you ""copy the signed version to a usb"", you're putting your trust in the manufacturer of that USB stick. So the security is of the same order of magnitude as a hardware wallet. If a maliciously modified hardware wallet can compromise your computer and steal your coins, so can a maliciously modified usb drive.

Bitcoin,edagtu2,abznev,"I'm sorry.  I thought I was talking to [someone else](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/abznev/judge_bitcoin_by_yearly_lows_not_all_time_highs/ed9oc3c/?context=3).  Mixed up thread.  Guy insinuates I'm a cultist because I want to run a node, and I thought this was extension of that discussion.  Apologies.\n\nBut as to the subject at hand.  By choosing generic devices that never had a specific purpose, and never get used again for another purpose after their usage, you can reasonably be sure that their security isn't breached.  In the case of a device that is specifically designed for managing keys, and signing bitcoin transactions, by compromising the production of that device, or even the firmware upgrade of that device, you are far more likely to be directly targeted.\n\nI'm thinking of it in the ways that i would attack it from the perspective of the state.  I actually expect that this will eventually happen, although years and maybe even decades in the future.  I simply don't trust devices for the reasons I've stated.\n\nIs that your risk profile?  Obviously not.  I'm just explaining the rationale for mine.",1546681818,t1_edadvls,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abznev/judge_bitcoin_by_yearly_lows_not_all_time_highs/edagtu2/
Bitcoin,edbcyu7,abznev,"Apologies accepted. I definitely can see targeting hardware wallets to be more likely to be targetted for bitcoins specifically, but from the perspective of the state, it would make the most sense to only put effort into compromising the most popular devices they can get away with. For example, if the govt was able to compromise Intel's hardware manufacturing process (via bribery, threats, or covert design injection), your air gapped computer could transmit anything it wants via the usb drive (according to the article you sent me). This would be far more effective than trying to compromise trezor or even large companies like Kingston that make usb drives. They could monitor or steal a whole array of things, including bitcoin on air gapped computers (tho not ones on genuinely produced hardware wallets).\n\nSo if the target is only Bitcoin, i think you're right that trezor puts a larger target on you. But if the target is anything and everything someone might want to steal, something with a larger customer base would be much more likely to have this problem. In fact, for your process you need to trust both your pc hardware manufacture(s) (including chip designer, motherboard manufacturer, usb port manufacturer, etc) and the usb drive itself. Plus, you can never use that usb drive for this purpose ever again, or you also have to trust that your non air gapped computer hasn't been compromised (defeating the purpose of the air gap). Is it really feasible to buy a new  usb drive anytime you want to withdraw from your cold storage? With trezor, it's a much simpler device with fewer parts and therefore far fewer manufacturers and entities you need to trust.\n\nI guess it all comes down to who you trust for your hardware. Until we can print our own hardware, this will have to be the case.",1546711568,t1_edagtu2,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abznev/judge_bitcoin_by_yearly_lows_not_all_time_highs/edbcyu7/

That is no longer necessary with Bitcoin. If you have coins on an exchange and want to participate in the Proof of Keys event follow these steps: \n\n1. Download a good wallet. Samourai. Electrum.  Mycelium. Breadwallet. Bitcoin Core. Options across multiple platforms. Hardware wallets such as Trezor/Ledger are ideal.\n\n2. Generate a wallet. Back up your private keys on paper or other medium that you feel secure with. Usually in the form of a 12-24 word seed. \n\n3. Withdraw your coins from any exchange to that wallet. \n\n4. Kick back and feel satisfied with a job well done. \n\nCongratulations. You now hold sovereignty over your coins as long as you keep your seed hidden. ,1546485060,t3_abzrzf,/r/Bitcoin/comments/abzrzf/the_monetary_sovereignty_warcry_proof_of_keys_jan3/ed4iigc/

Bitcoin,ed7olzu,abzrzf,"I get the impressions that your expectations were greater than Bitcoin could actually deliver from a technical standpoint. The issues of scaling a blockchain have been known since Nakamoto submitted his whitepaper to the mailing list. Some merchants got burned due to A) the centralized mining cartels in China spamming the blockchain with high-fee transactions in an attempt to bloat fee revenue, trying to force a contentious protocol change while refusing to activate an upgrade which had broad consensus, and B) several exchanges refusing to optimize their own infrastructure, passing operating costs directly to customers, and attempting to bully the tech community into forced protocol changes. The 2017 fee spike would not have occurred if it had not been for these factors. \n\nThat said, it would be good to adjust your expectations regarding LN too, lest you be let down again. LN is very cool and promising technology, but it is not a silver bullet and has never been promoted as one. Since you're playing the long game, I'm sure you understand that this stuff will continue to take years to develop and deploy.

Bitcoin,edc1ela,abzrzf,"Fractional reserve banking was always a shell game. Plebs would lend their gold to a bank for a return on interest. You could technically withdraw all of your gold. But not practically.\n\nIf enough plebs tried to withdraw in the full amount at once, you'd get a bank note for your gold that you could retrieve on the other side of the continent. You could get on your horse, travel through bandit country and maybe a warzone, maybe lose a horse or family member along the way, just to get where the reserves were held. Or you can play along and spend the IOU, like every thing's fine.\n\nAfter the industrial revolution, traveling across continents became faster, cheaper and easier, but feeding the ponzi became a bit more difficult. Every nation that had a gold backed currency failed in less than a century. America even started banning the possession of gold ingots and confiscating it to keep the scam going.\n\nThank god the sham finally came to an end. Sure, 1 GBP is worth chicken tenders on the kids menu, not a pound of sterling silver. But now that we can admit we have a problem, we can at least hedge with precious metals. Unfortunately precious metals can't be transmitted digitally. That's the one thing banks really made genuine progress with.\n\nBitcoin was invented to be a natively digital P2P currency without a trusted 3rd party. Great idea. 1 BTC=1 BTC, no ifs ands or buts. But if we go on a reserve standard 1 BTC=1 empty promise from a trusted 3rd party.\n\nBitcoin has succeeded as a store of value since the genesis block. The volatility makes it unreliable, but it has succeeded nonetheless. Until it's accepted as payment up and down production lines across several industries, it will be too volatile to be called sound money.\n\nThe easiest way to make bitcoin scale for the masses while keeping the back end decentralized would be to trust a 3rd party (bank or exchange) to handle the velocity. Transactions could even be free and instant. But the catch would be they'd use your money to inflate the supply and abuse the economy.

Bitcoin,ed4x9hv,ac1mam,">Wouldn't an immutable, decentralized 'score board' or open record make this far easier?\n\nIt would...\n\n>What am I missing?\n\nUnfortunately what you're missing is what you asked me to break down for you, so I'll do my best.\n\nBlockchains are not inherently immutable or decentralised.  They require several other aspects for these properties to take shape.  To be immutable, there needs to be some way to ensure that the blockchain can't just be ""rewritten"" and propagated through the network as ""correct"".  Everyone having their own copy isn't enough because you need to be able to prove that additions (new blocks) are also correct.\n\nBitcoin solves this problem through proof of work.  Essentially, you must solve a trivial but computationally expensive mathematical problem in order to make a valid block.  The work doesn't actually do anything else, it is just provable that if you have the results, you must have done the work.  This means that it's not economically viable to ""cheat"" by rewriting chain history.\n\nHowever, people don't secure blockchains out of the good of their hearts.  They do it because they're rewarded for doing it.  This is the generation of new coins and collection of miner fees from transactions.  Without this, very few would choose to expend the computational power on creating blocks and so the network security would be very low.  In the case of real-estate, the only one with an incentive to create blocks is the real estate agency, so anyone who can muster more computational power than them (probably not hard) can rewrite the chain at will.  Obviously, this would be very bad if the tokens represent property!\n\nSome people have come up with ideas like ""proof of stake"" to try to mitigate this, however there are several other large issues with that concept (including ""stake"" being a ""now"" thing and not a ""then"" thing, so history of the chain isn't as secure; only the most recent blocks).  It's also irrelevant for the real-estate case again since the only way it could work would be to ""force"" people to actively participate as long as they own property (which would be their stake).  Someone having their house taken away from them because of a flaw in the blockchain security methodology seems a bit ridiculous.\n\nAt that point, you turn to the idea of a ""private blockchain"" with ""proof of authority"".  That is: whoever holds the master private keys can write/rewrite data at will (ideally with multisig requirements to avoid a single point of failure).  This is functionally no different than a shared database though, and much slower, so you might as well simply *use* a shared database at that point.\n\nTo clarify the ""multisig"" / write-keys / inter-trust part: The main point of a blockchain is that you don't need to trust anyone else since rational actors within the system ensure that it's valid and correct.  For a currency, this should be ""everyone"".  For a property trade, it's only the few participants in that trade.  Imagine a database, cloned across each interested party's systems (or held by a neutral third party, such as Amazon Web Services, Azure, or similar) where writing new data requires being signed by the private keys of each individual participant.  This solves the real-estate need without a blockchain and is significantly more efficient.  Fundamentally though, it's just a digitalisation of the existing process.  All those bits of paper with ink-signatures in the existing system are really just ""database entries"" that are ""signed"" by ink instead of a private key.  Digitising it makes sense, putting a blockchain in for no benefit really doesn't.\n\nI completely agree that the process of buying property is insane in most places right now; but it's not a problem that's going to be solved by throwing a blockchain at it.  Some parts could be interesting such as performing notary actions *on top of* existing blockchains (writing a hash of a contract to the bitcoin blockchain for example, effectively timestamping and locking that version of the document to that time) but it still requires that the underlying blockchain behaves in a way that provides the right incentives for all selfish (and even potentially hostile) actors to *want* to continue securing and protecting the network.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is what is known as an ""oracle"".  That is, if you consider a token in a blockchain to represent a property, how do you ensure that that token really represents that particular property?  How are they ""linked""?  If it's a centralised database in the city/state/federal government, you're back to the same problem as before.  Anyone can change that database and the token you've got on the blockchain is meaningless.",1546500525,t1_ed4w8jr,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ac1mam/who_is_really_going_to_use_bitcoincrypto_besides/ed4x9hv/

Bitcoin,ed4yyx9,ac1mam,I'm blown away by your detailed response. Thank you for taking the time to explain!!\n\nI'll do the heavy intellectual lifting later by researching a few topics you've covered that are still unclear to me. But I understand the basics of why blockchain is NOT a desirable or functional solution to real estate now. \n\n---> Essentially you're saying we still need a centralized point of record keeping as its not in everyone's interest (miners?) to keep updating the ledger. (But in theory wouldn't EVERYONE or at least all property owners want to keep an accurate ledger of all owned properties? In theory? Would they pool resources to have their interests acted upon in the form of paid mining on their behalf in this scenario?)\n\nAn interesting concept... that self-interest is what actually secures the network.

(No incentive to be a miner).\n\nSlightly bigger, in that there's ""no incentive to participate honestly in any way"" (not just mining) but yes, close enough.\n\n>An interesting concept... that self-interest is what actually secures the network.\n\nHonestly, that's *the single thing* that makes Bitcoin incredible and great.  If it required anyone to act against their own self-interest, the whole thing would come tumbling down in an instant.\n\n>I don't understand the cryptography at a high enough level to understand how transactions can't be forged\n\nActually, you don't need to understand the cryptography (as long as you're willing to trust mathematicians at their word; otherwise you do).  Here's a quick breakdown:\n\n1. There is a private key.  It is a number.  Using some clever maths, a public key can be created from it.\n2. A public key is another number.  Because of how the maths works, the private key can reliably generate the public key at will, but the public key can't generate the private key.\n3. Also because of how the clever maths works, a private key can ""sign"" data (alter it in a way) that someone with the public key can look at (alter it differently using the public key) and be sure that the private key was used to sign it.\n4. Alice has a public/private key pair.\n5. Bob also has a public/private key pair.\n6. Alice has 10 BTC.  She creates a message saying that she's giving 5 BTC to Bob signed with her private key and sent to his public key (actually, it gets more complicated here because of addresses, which are hashes of public keys; but it is technically possible to send to a public key directly and we'll use that as the simple example).\n7. Alice sends this message to the network nodes she's connected to and they forward it on around the world.\n8. At some point, it gets mined in to a block by a miner (a different process, see below).\n9. By looking at the transaction (either 'floating free' before it's mined, or in the block after it's mined) anyone can know that it says that it was signed by a particular private key and now belongs to a particular public key.\n10. Because you can't get Bob's private key from the public key, you can't steal it.\n11. Similarly, because Alice only knows Bob's public key and not his private key, she can't take it back.\n12. Because Alice just *signed* the transaction with her private key, she never put her private key on the network, so it's still safe.\n13. Bob has the corresponding private key for the public key to which the 5 BTC were sent, so he now ""owns"" those 5 BTC and can use his private key to create transactions sending it to someone else.\n\n>or how powerful miners (other than a 51% attack) can't just broadcast an incorrect ledger to be accepted (there's a majority voting system right?! In an instance of discrepancy)\n\nNot exactly ""voting"", but it does get compared to it.  I don't like the comparison since it implies a lot of things that aren't true (like that a majority could arbitrarily do anything they want - they can't).\n\nIf a miner broadcasts a truly invalid block to add to the ledger, any node (whether a mining node or not) will reject it since it's invalid according to the rules.  For example, if funds are sent from someone who didn't have them to begin with, or if the block isn't ""built"" on top of previous blocks correctly.  It simply won't spread through the network at all and will never be seen by anyone other than the nodes the miner tried sending it to.\n\nIf a miner broadcasts a *valid* block that appears to build on top of blocks that the node wasn't previously aware of, the nodes that receive it will look at which chain of blocks has the most ""work"" put in to it (based on difficulty of blocks) and go with the longest/strongest chain as being correct (this is where a 51% attack can come in, since someone with that much mining power could generate ""alternative history"" blocks... however for other reasons that I won't get in to here, they are also actually incentivised against doing so).\n\nSo that brings us to the question of ""what does *building a new block on top of the blockchain* actually mean?"".  Here's the process (simplified):\n\n1. There is a defined ""difficulty"" that every node calculates on its own.  It's based on how quickly blocks were found in the past and exists to try to make blocks *average* to 10 minutes each.  That is, if blocks were found faster than 10 minutes on average in the past, it gets harder, and if they were found slower, it gets easier.  This difficulty is expressed as a ""target value"" number, with ""more difficult"" being a smaller number.\n2. The miner collects a bunch of transactions she wants to include in the block (these are ones that were broadcast from people across the network as described above) and builds a simple structure from it along with a timestamp and a *hash value* from the last valid block in the chain (you'll see later where this comes in).  She also makes up a number called a nonce.  This can be any number she wants.\n3. The miner runs a simple hashing algorithm (SHA256) on the potential block.  Hashes are simply numbers.  If - by absolute chance - the hash generated is lower than the difficulty target, it's a valid block and she sends it to the network.\n4. Most likely, the hash is not lower than the difficulty target (it's expected to take quintillions of tries at the current difficulty), so she changes the nonce (and possibly the timestamp) and tries again.  She repeats this until she finds a valid block or until someone else broadcasts a valid block (which she'll now try to build on top of and just discard this one).\n\nImportant notes about this process:\n\n1. You can't know *at all* what a hash will look like before doing it.  This means you have no way to ""massage"" your block structure (including nonce) in advance to get a hash that is below the difficulty.  You just have to keep trying until you get one that fits.\n2. The hash value of the previous block being included in the new one ensures that to change any arbitrary block in history, you also need to change *every* block after it.  This means that changing a transaction from 10 blocks ago requires recomputing 10 blocks after it as well just to catch up (which you'd need to do all before the next block was found).  Even if you did it by faking the difficulty as being very low, nodes would reject it based on it being *less work* than the real chain.\n\n&#x200B;",1546505674,t1_ed4yyx9,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ac1mam/who_is_really_going_to_use_bitcoincrypto_besides/ed50fgu/

If no one was buying or using bitcoin, retailers wouldn’t have a demand for adoption. Any amount of bitcoin or cryptocurrency you purchase is a benefit to the space as a whole toward a different future. It may go up in price, it may go down, but the endgoal is to not worry about the price at all and simply rely on the tech itself to have value.  This is, however, very far into the future. Day trading and futures/shorts is still very feasible because we’re still focused on the price pegged to a fiat amount.

Bitcoin,ed7bhol,ac35ff,"Does anybody know anything about whitelisting on Coinbase? Basically, Coinbase encourages to enable whitelisting because it “helps secure your funds by limiting cryptocurrency withdrawals to only the addresses you’ve added to your address book.” I know Coinbase has had this for at least a couple of months but this is the first time it prompted me to enable it. Surely, anybody who has Bitcoin on Coinbase will tell themselves...why not?...as soon as they see the “secure” buzzword. But, is my Bitcoin not as secure without whitelisting despite Coinbase claiming their security is top notch impenetrable? I haven’t responded to this option but I suspect whitelisting is an unnecessary security layer that Coinbase creates so they can charge you when you want to withdraw your Bitcoin to an address outside of your address book?  If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it. And I think that’s all Coinbase is doing...trying to find clever deceptive ways of trying to nab you for more fees.

Bitcoin,ed5b21p,ac35ff,"Because it's a complicated math cycle that keeps you from going back and changing a block in the past without changing every single future block. Just a small explanation before I dive into how the blockchain works: Hashing is the procedure by which you take any data, put it through a mathematical algorithm and get a specific, much shorter code at the end of the algorithm that is unique. The key factor is that due to the nature of the mathematical algorithm you cannot take the hash and convert it back to the original data, because data was lost in the process to get to that code.\n\nNow here's a very simplified method of how that works. You have 5 blocks, each block containing multiple transactions and apart from Block 1 (the very first block), it will also contain the hash code of the previous block. After hashing each block gets the following hash codes.\n\nBlock 1 = 32\n\nBlock 2 (which contains transactions and the hashcode of Block 1) = 23\n\nBlock 3 (which contains transaction and the hashcode of Block 2) = 54\n\nBlock 4 (which contains transactions and the hashcode of Block 3) = 43\n\nBlock 5 (which contains transactions and the hashcode of Block 4) = 91\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow say that I want to modify a transaction in Block 3 after Block 4 and 5 have already been created. I go and change a transaction in block 3 so it gives me more money but now when block 3 gets hashed, the hashcode is no longer 54, it's 71, because I changed data in that block. Fine and dandy but the problem is Block 4 (which has already been created) knows the hash of Block 3 to be 54, not 71. So for my hack to work I have to change that information in Block 4, which in turn generates a new hash for block 4 which doesn't match what's stored in Block 5. So now I also have to change Block 5, etc.\n\nAs such, you cannot modify a past block without having to modify all of the blocks that come after it. This wouldn't be a problem until you realise a hashcode is not a two digit number, but looks something like this ""0000000000000000001163964a1c98bc52766d24570a3651002f384851057ab1"" and we are not on block 5, but block 556834 at the time of writing.\n\nSo you're best bet would be to change a block that was created very recently, like maybe 2 blocks ago. This is where decentralized comes in. There are tens of thousands of computers that contain THE FULL blockchain. Each block, with each transaction and each hashcode, is replicated identically on all of these computers. So if you change just one, all the other computers will ignore it because it's most likely that you're trying to do something funny. So if you want to change a block in the history, besides having to change all the blocks that follow that block so the information is consistent, you also have to do it on 51% of the computers on which the blockchain is replicated AT THE SAME TIME so that the rest of the 49% of the computers believe your version of the blockchain.\n\nSo in essence, the truthful answer is YES it can be tempered with, but you need space-time bending technology to be able to actually do it.\n\nEDIT: UUuu, gold, shiny, thank you!\n\n&#x200B;",1546520820,t1_ed59v8h,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ac35ff/daily_discussion_january_03_2019/ed5b21p/

Bitcoin,ed5w77j,ac35ff,"That is a wee bit more complicated, but not by much. This is where wallet public and private keys, come in. I'll try and simplify again all the concepts to make it as clear as possible.\n\nLet's start with Private and Public Keys. This is a encryption (not hashing, encryption means I can obtain the original information from the result)  method that says you can only scramble a message with a specific code, and descramble it with a very different but just as specific code, but you couldn't do the reverse. The scrambling code is called the private key (because it's the key that you keep private, for yourself) and the descramble code is called the public key (that's what you give to the recipient, so they can decode your message and read it). Whoever gets a hold of your public key can read the messages you are sending, but they cannot alter and re-encode the message and then push it forward to pretend they are you, because only the private key that you have can encode the message in the correct way so that it can be read by someone with the public key. This is again, done through some very fancy maths.\n\nNow, back to bitcoin. When you set up a wallet you also tell the blockchain what your public key is, but not your private key, that's only for you to know. When you want to do a transaction with Bob, you're not physically giving the bitcoin to Bob, you're just making a request to the blockchain that you want x amount bitcoin to no longer be in your wallet, but be in Bob's wallet, and in order to Authenticate this request (basically to prove that it is you who made the request) you encrypt the request using the private key, which means the blockchain can decode it using the public key. This essentially means that if your request can be decoded correctly and read, it must be YOU who made the request and not some scummy individual.\n\nWell this prohibits someone from stealing your money, but what's there to stop them from creating two wallets and just saying ""I want 1 BTC to go from wallet X to wallet Y"" without having any money in wallet X. This is where the beauty of blockchain comes back into play. A wallet is always created with 0 Bitcoin in it because the amount of bitcoin in a wallet is determined by the transactions that it was involved in and nothing else, so in order for it to get bitcoin, it has to be received from another wallet that already has bitcoin in it. If I claim that I want to send 1 BTC from wallet X, the blockchain will be read back all the way to the Block when wallet X was created and determine if wallet X has more than 1 BTC in it by replaying all the transactions that it has been involved in since its creation. If the total value stored in it is more than or equal to 1BTC, then the transaction is valid, if not, transaction rejected GTFO.\n\nSo it's basically impossible to counterfeit bitcoin.\n\nThe only exception to the above is when a new bitcoin is created by a Miner as a result of mining. When miners mine, and a block is discovered that contains a reward, it automatically assigns that reward to a wallet when writing the new block (usually their own, because they like money :) but there have been instances in the past where someone goofed, didn't assign the newly found bitcoin to a correct address and that bitcoin was lost FOREVAAAAA). It still appears as a transaction in their wallet, but the source of the bitcoin will be a block instead of a different wallet. \n\nSo in short, you can't modify past blocks because it requires bending time and space, and you can't modify current blocks because it requires breaking into other people's wallets.\n\nCracking the private-public key encryption is... well there are some theories that it can be done with quantum super-computing but that's still to be proven and not everyone has access to a quantum super-computer, so your best bet is to beat the living shit out of someone until they give you their private key, or hack into a miner's computer so they send new bitcoin they mine to your wallet instead of their own.  \n",1546537842,t1_ed5s8n3,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ac35ff/daily_discussion_january_03_2019/ed5w77j/

Their initial result is libminisketch, a library that allows one user with a set of elements (e.g. {1, 2, 3}) to efficiently send missing elements to another user who only has part of that set (e.g. {1, 3}). No changes to Bitcoin consensus are required for this—it’s just a different way of transmitting the same information.

It also keeps bandwidth low as the number of connections increases, potentially allowing nodes to make many more connections to peers in order to improve the robustness of the P2P relay network."" \n\nhttps://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2018/12/28/\n\n\nI want to route transactions through MY OWN NODES and not trust other's that are offered as the default in light wallets today \n\nLike they are also MY KEYS I want to route through (good for opsec too) MY OWN NODE\n\n\nWe need people running their own nodes for many other reasons than this I'm sure many who appreciated proof of keys may find ProofOfNode just as paramount\n\nWith the rapid development of small hardware devices using rasp pi ODROID others premade Casahodl NODL and others we have a real opportunity here \n\n\nI'll leave it at that hopefully the message spreads \n\n\n",1546603860,t1_ed7un49,/r/Bitcoin/comments/acgzav/so_i_had_an_idea_i_thought_was_worth_trying_to/ed7x70z/

There is no central bank counting produced goods and services and then printing money based on their assessments. Goods and services produced are a result of credit creation by commercial banks. When more credit gets destroyed (through servicing debt) than new credit is created  (through new loans), then we are a in a deflationary phase. Central banks can only try to stimulate credit creation through monetary policy, but they can't force privates to take out loans. In recessions or economic depressions the government will jump in and start spending programs by issuing new debt, which will indeed lead to printing money, since it is accepted as collateral by central banks or bought outright by them (QE).

Though information has two properties that make it bad for holding. First, it can be duplicated when given to anyone, which means that it keeps good value only once. Second, same piece of information can be discovered even if one holds the information forever.\n\nPeople realize that deflationary money does not create wealth and because of that people will not expect it to be always deflanationary.

Bitcoin,edbn55x,achrif,">There would be no deflation if no one were increasing productivity\n\nAny decrease in the supply or velocity of currency relative to the amount of trade will cause deflation. Hoarding money is deflationary:\n\n>It is agreed that hoarding money, whether in cash or in idle balances, is deflationary in its effects. No one thinks that deflation is in itself desirable. — Hayek (1932)\n\nThis is what allows deflationary spirals to happen. If for whatever reason there is deflation, either due to an increase in the amount of trade relative to currency, or due to a decrease in the supply or velocity of money, this creates a financial incentive to start hoarding money instead of investing it in production.\n\nThis hoarding creates yet more deflation, which creates a further incentive to hoard, which creates even more deflation, all the while productive enterprise becomes more risky and less profitable since more and more people are hoarding their money instead of spending it on goods and services and investing in assets, since assets depreciate in value relative to a deflationary currency.\n\n>So it's self-regulating\n\nSelf-regulating by encouraging parasitic rent-seeking over productive economy is not a good form of self-regulation. If you want to encourage sustainable practices do it by environmental regulations that prevent people from inflicting economic externalizes, not by adopting a useless form of currency\n\nDeflationary currency is self regulation, self-regulating to the point where no nation on earth uses a deflationary mediums of exchange as its primary currency, despite their widespread legality and existence. There are several US states where you can pay taxes in gold and silver, which even takes away the ""but states require taxes in fiat"" argument, but still no one but a few ideologues use it as a currency and even then not as their primary means of exchange.\n\nCurrency is to facilitate trade.

If everyone was just hoarding numbers and gambling, and no one was farming crops, building houses, manufacturing cars then money wouldn't be worth anymore than any other imaginary symbol since there would be nothing to trade it for.\n\n If you are increasing share of wealth without creating anything of value then your increase in wealth is coming at the expense of someone else, which is a parasitic way to make a living, and only a minority of people can live like that.

Bitcoin,edbxy2c,achrif,">So it only deflates when productivity increases, and it only inflates when productivity decreases.\n\nYou're not accounting for the impact velocity has.\n\nIf you bury $1,000 and no one ever finds it, or you burn it, the effect is effectively the same. There is no way for the economy to tell the difference between money that has ceased to exist versus money that has never been spent.\n\nIt's not the existence of money that effects the economy but its continued circulation in the economy in facilitating trade. Just the same was as there being trillions of dollars worth of gold in the oceans doesn't affect the market price for gold because none of it is accessible at present.\n\nIt's not only the absence of $1,000 in the economy that needs to be accounted for, but the multiplier effect of how many times it changes hand. In its lifetime $1 can change hands hundreds and even thousands of times. \n\nIn economics this is described to by the [Equation of Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange). Quantity of money x velocity = price level x expenditure on new goods, although there's a few different ways of measuring/describing it, much like GDP is only one measure of wealth produced.\n\nWhether you half the quantity of a currency or half the velocity the effect is (largely) the same, there will be half as much currency circulating in the economy, therefore if there is the same amount of demand, for half as much currency, the value of that currency will be roughly double (i.e. prices will be half what they were before).\n\nThis is how you can get large deflationary spirals even when no money is destroyed, simply from a runaway feedback mechanism of small decrease in velocity -> small increase in deflation -> small decrease in spending -> small decrease in velocity.\n\nOf course there's a natural limit to the stickiness of currencies and even in relatively mild deflationary spirals people will quickly resort to barter instead of trying to trade with deflationary currency.\n\n\n>Therefore, there is no disincentive to increase productivity, because money will not increase in value without it.\n\nIt's the incentive to hold money instead of using it to create value that is the problem, not a disincentive. \n\nSo long as some percentage of the population is creating new wealth then someone with money doesn't have to do anything to increase their share of wealth since ownership of currency is as a percentage of total wealth. Only people with the largest sums of money (many millions or hundreds of millions of dollars) can benefit significantly in this way (i.e. 4% deflation for someone with $1,000 in savings is $40 a year, for someone with $10,000,000 in savings its enough to never have to work again, or ever decrease their fortune from its original amount.

So by gambling on the overall economy, you also invest in that economy.\n\nHoarding money is not investing in the economy. Everyone else's money increasing in value means everyone else who has value stored in productive assets now gets less at the expense of the people who hold money getting more, which creates an incentive for people to dump productive assets in exchange for holding currency, which is exactly the opposite of investing in the economy.

If someone has neither cash nor assets, or perfectly balanced amounts of cash and assets then it will make no difference to them either way, regardless of how productive they are as any gain/loss in the value of money will be offset by an equivalent gain/loss in the value of assets.\n\n A hobo who was just given $10 would see a net gain from 10% deflation as they have no other assets that could depreciate, and their $10 will now buy 10% more tan it did before. a factory owner who owns a $1,000,000 factory and $100,000 in cash would suffer a net loss, since their cash would appreciate to $110,000 equivalent value, but the factory would depreciate by $100,000, meaning a net loss of $90,000 in real terms\n\nDeflation wouldn't increase the value of earnings.

Bitcoin,eemjjuh,achxc9,"I think this speaks more to its __insignificance__ in the greater scheme of things. \n\n62 Billion sounds like a lot, but to put it in perspective: The US Gov (mostly the Military branches) give out contracts worth an amount averaging just over **One Billion Per Day** (excluding holidays and most weekends; you can find all awards on a .gov website- Google it and it shouldn't be hard to find.) *That means the US (DoD) gives out more than all the Bitcoin's valuation put together in UNDER TWO MONTHS.* That's on an average day too. The larger contracts can sometimes be in the tens of billions themselves.\n\nThe Gov does this to prevent ""hodlers"" of USD- which creates stagnation in the economy, due to lack of spending. Particularly to encourage corporations to invest their liquid reserves- driving innovation; and to encourage individuals to invest their personal funds in new infrastructure, government bonds given at prime interest rates (the proceeds of which are used to improve overall social welfare- and of course the big swinging dick of the US war machine in its greatest capacity.) Either way, this encourages flow of currency. An entity of individual must spend and invest in order to protect their earnings from the inflationary spending of the government. Inflation is often seen as a method of imposing a hidden tax on the populous, but it is a necessary evil, for if the dollar just kept going up, no one would spend and we would eventually see a complete economic collapse.\n\nForget countries or even the hundreds of corporations with a market cap greater than that of bitcoin, while only around 2 or 3 people- there are individuals worth more than the entire bitcoin valuation. When you consider the single individuals with net worth equal to a quarter of its valuation, the number gets much larger.\n\nThere are quite a few buildings that cost about that same price to build- a few cost even more.\n\nIf 20,000 people take out a $300,000 mortgage at 10% APR (sounds high but I guarantee you it's not), due to the reserve requirements and regulations which allow banks to essentially print money and loan (in this case 90% of) it to other banks who can do the same or similar, before being paid a cent back on the initial mortgages- $60,000,000 in ""free"" money will be generated by the banks.\n\nI suggest anyone interested check out the circulating Monetary supply both US domestic and globally. There are so many ways of describing that number and what they all mean. It's quite intriguiging.\n\nBut you will come to see that bitcoin would not only need to reach values that even the most optimistic models aren't predicting, but would need to do so at a rate keeping pace with last year's growth, in order to even make a blip on the international monetary radar.\n\nThe reason no one in the fiat or financial sector seem to be too worried about bitcoin is because it's not threatening to them.",1548089000,t3_achxc9,/r/Bitcoin/comments/achxc9/what_do_you_think_is_it_too_late/eemjjuh/

I don't personally think Apples a good investment. They don't innovate anymore, and their CEO's a joke, but that drop represents a fraction of the company's overall value.\n\nHowever, I think the comparison makes a little sense.

It doesn't make a lot of sense.

I'd say on average, Apple charges 20% more than they should. \n\n20% seems conservative to say the least, and I wish it was only about price. Considering their build processes that makes them next to impossible for an individual to repair their own devices at home is a big negative and speaks volumes for their mindset of what device ownership is. \n\nThe recent conundrum with the iPhone is another example of the mistrust I place in their own hardware and software package. I don't want my os to artificially slow down my phone just because Apple thinks that's the best strategy, as obviously, it's the best strategy for them to get consumers to buy a new product. \n\nYou can argue that Samsung does the same, but I don't have a Samsung phone either as I don't like them either or a lot of the same reasons. \n\n\>  That said, OSX is a fucking excellent OS \n\nIn what way? It only runs on a handful of devices made by 1 manufacturer and a few put-together Hackintoshes. It's certainly more optimized to run better on the devices it is intended to run on, yes, but that still makes it limited in scope. Even the optimization argument fails when you consider the fact that you can make a Linux distro purpose-built for the hardware you need and it will be just as optimized.\n\nThus, so far, it has significant drawbacks for a power-user.

Once they switched to Intel, there's no reason it should be so locked down. I guess I just accept it at this point. I don't feel like it's a deal breaker, but again, subjective opinion.\n\n> I don't want my os to artificially slow down my phone\n\nSo the conspiracy theorist in me wants to believe that they really are being dicks and were trying to sneak in planned obsolescence, but at the same time, their explanation about older batteries makes technical sense to me. I've never really cared a lot, because I tend to get a new phone every couple years, but if I were stuck on an iPhone 6 and saw it slowing down, it would definitely annoy me. I'm not sold on them definitely being evil about it, but I don't know that anyone on either side has enough information to say for sure.\n\n> In what way? It only runs on a handful of devices made by 1 manufacturer and a few put-together Hackintoshes.\n\nThe gauge for a good OS isn't necessarily about how much hardware it runs on. Linux will run on anything, which is awesome, yes. And as you say, you can go nuts with the kernel params and compile a custom one, but most people will never need to, and it really doesn't make a lot of difference anyway (these days). Windows will run on... PCs... but I can't install it on my router. On the OSX side, I just don't really mind... like I said, I've just accepted the situation that certain things run on certain hardware. I have also accepted that a Tesla, despite it costing waayyy more than a Jeep, will not run on trails.\n\n> The newest MacBook Pro, the one with 4 usb-C ports and a touch bar instead of function keys is a flimsy, unsatisfying device that has a horrible feeling keyboard and a form-factor so thin that I'm scared it's going to bend if i put any accidental pressure on it.\n\nHmm, I don't get that impression from it, but again, subjective opinion. I take care of my devices... not otterbox protective, I just make sure to carry them correctly, not sit on them, etc... and I've never had an issue.\n\n> Yes, and I can get it on exactly 3 models of phones, which I don't like, and are overpriced.\n\nApple releases iOS updates for [MUCH more](http://cdn.osxdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ios-12-supported-devices-list.jpg) than their latest phones.\n\n> I'm literally paying more, to receive less features in a form-factor I don't like, with the promise of ""It will run a lot smoother"", until they decide to underclock my CPU through a software update of course.\n\nIf you don't like the form factor, why are you arguing then? Don't buy it. Otherwise, as I said above, I'm not convinced they are intentionally trying to hurt consumers who don't upgrade. If they were, a $60 battery replacement wouldn't return the device to full speed.\n\nIt seems like overall, you just don't like Apple. That's perfectly fine, but your comment doesn't really convince me it's a logical choice as much as a justification for your pre-existing hate.

Not to mention that miners that get the raw materials for all electronic equipments make pretty much nothing while apple makes insane profits.

Correct me if I’m wrong but I highly doubt that Steve Jobs would be happy with what the company is doing if he was still alive.

Their phones have better screens than most, better cameras than most, etc. I don't think anyone can really argue those points.

The record of history is chock-full of great inflations, and still people are swindled into fiat. Of course, a small minority of people will see the patterns repeat themselves. But interacting with people from outside of where I grew up it is hard to imagine that over half of people even possess the mental capabilities to recognize patterns of action rather than simply repeating labels they hear for certain groups, like libertarians. Racist, bigot, misogynist, etc. When people don't even really know what they oppose it's very hard to get them to support the right things. Especially when most of what people who don't seek out information for themselves hear as news reinforces their incorrect beliefs, and since everyone says the same things on TV, everyone else is obviously crazy or retarded. Authority factors into the equation of trust far too heavily in the minds of most people for them to believe actual facts over their favorite, familiar talking heads. Most people probably never even began to learn how to think for themselves, because in general it makes getting through government schools more onerous than it already is. Fitting into the mold is what's taught to kids and ingrained in their parents' minds. Isn't it better to have your kid follow the rules so you don't get called about him refusing to glue macaroni to a piece of paper? Most parents don't see the harm in forcing kids to do entirely useless tasks just because someone says they have to. \n\nThe status quo holds a very strong allure for a reason; generally when things aren't too heinous, you're doing things somewhat correctly. The issue now is that people don't understand that the status quo is unsustainable because only crazy idiots, according to MSNPC and other such news outlets, believe there's anything wrong with an economy that puts up stats like ours is right now. Anyone who doesn't say things they feel comfortable with based on things people say who they ""trust"", (largely, imo, only because they don't want to believe that such scumbags hold so much power over them) is dangerous and a threat to the status quo, which isn't perfect, they say, but is obviously better (based on nothing) than what people who aren't even on TV propose.

If the government of Sweden, however, slowly started to crumble because people voluntarily arranged for the production of the useful things it does without having to pay for the useless, it's not too difficult to see how, for instance, loss of confidence in the central bank might lead to adoption of sound money by the public, thereby constraining the spending power of government to what they explicitly take from people, almost certainly causing lots of programs to be underfunded and therefore doubly shitty, making it worth it for the first time in Sweden for a decent amount of people to pay for something they already pay taxes for.

Bitcoin,ed9sb49,achxc9,"Whether a currency has value or how it performs vs other currencies is one and the same. You cant have $5 that is capable of buying a Big Mac, that is worth €10, but €3 buys a Big Mac also. In the same vein, you can’t have a bitcoin that can buy a Lamborghini but only fetches $200 in the market. The values are set by the assets that people are willing to exchange for them. Therefore, the value of $5 USD isnt a Big Mac because the government says it is, but rather because that’s what people have universally agreed to pay for it. It doesn’t matter if the government says “$5 is now worth a Big Mac and fries,” if you try to swap that for a euro equivalent you won’t get as much euros as would buy you a Big Mac meal in France. So your designation that bitcoin is better because it “earned” its way up is entirely arbitrary — at the end of the day, it’s still a common market that decides prices.",1546655008,t1_ed9rdu0,/r/Bitcoin/comments/achxc9/what_do_you_think_is_it_too_late/ed9sb49/

Bitcoin,edagfge,aci0zt,"Re: channel factories\n\nA channel is really just a cryptocurrency system, just like a blockchain.\n\nA blockchain records transactions, which changes the state of the BTC universe. So for example now I have 5 BTC. I owe you 1 BTC. So I make a transaction. After the transaction is recorded on the blockchain (""confirmed"") the BTC universe now has ""almkglor: 4 BTC, pjohnsilver: 1BTC"".\n\nA channel is very much the same, except:\n\n1. It must depend on some other, external cryptocurrency system. Blockchains based on proof-of-work are also dependent on an external system, which we usually call "" the real wotld"" or ""physics"", but channels depend on an existing cryptosystem.\n2. Only the participants in the channel can safely HODL money in it. That's because on the outer cryptosystem (usually the blockchain) the owners of the funds are the signatories of the channel, i.e. the participants of the channel.\n3. Every participant in the channel needs to be online to update it. This is because they are the signatories to every state update. If one of them is offline, then the state cannot change. Either everyone else waits for them to come online, or somebody unilaterally closes the channel and collapses back to the outer cryptosystem.\n\nThe last point is why channels are only 2 participants; if there were more, it would be more likely one of them is offline.\n\nNow from the point of view of the blockchain, the channel is just an n-of-n multisig address. Nothing special, which is the whole point: all the specialness is kept ***off***chain.\n\nSo at the blockchain level if we had a 5 BTC channel I originally made to you, the blockchain would see ""almkglor+pjohnsmith: 5BTC"". But the two of us would know that the channel cryptosystem has the state ""almkglor: 5BTC, pjohnsmith: 0BTC"".\n\nNow if I wanted to pay 1BTC to you, and we could agree that the new state is now ""almkglor: 4BTC, pjohnsmith: 1BTC"". But the blockchain layer wouldn't know about it: all it would see would be ""almkglor+pjohnsmith: 5BTC"".\n\nThe above is bog standard micropayment channels. Now I heard you like channels, so I put channels in your channels so you can offchain while offchain.\n\nThe key insight is that the channel does not need a ""other, external cryptocurrency system"" that is a blockchain. The outer cryptosystem can be anything that lets you assign money to pubkeys. And in the end, a channel itself just a cryptosystem that splits a fund among the pubkeys of its participants.\n\nLet me pull in my friend /u/renepickhardt. Now suppose instead of making a channel with him and a channel with you separately, I use some new thing called a channel factory.\n\nSuppose I want to make a 5BTC channel to you and a 7 BTC channel to renepickhardt, but with factories.\n\nOn the blockchain layer, all we put is ""almkglor+pjohnsmith+renepickhardt: 12BTC"".\n\nThen we have a cryptosystem rooted from that, which contains the state: ""almkglor+pjohnsmith: 5BTC, almkglor+renepickhardt: 7BTC"". This cryptosystem is the channel factory, and each of the addresses it holds represents a channel.\n\nThen we have two more cryptosystems. One takes the almkglor+pjohnsmith address and starts at the state ""almkglor: 5BTC, pjohnsmith: 0BTC"". The other takes the almkglor+renepickhardt address and starts at the state ""almkglor: 7BTC, renepickhardt: 0BTC"".\n\nAll of that setup requires all three of us to be online.\n\nNow suppose I decide to pay you 1BTC. Both of us are online but renepickhardt isn't. Not a problem! Our almkglor+pjohnsmith channel requires only the two of us to sign off on state updates. The state update doesn't need to affect the channel factory cryptosystem. We don't need renepickhardt to know about transactions between us two.\n\nBut notice the advantage here. A single blockchain-level address now hosts 2 channels. Without the channel factory,  each channel would have required its own blockchain address. This compresses the space needed onchain, and is the main win for channel factories.\n\nIf the channel factory had more participants, then we could have a single blockchain address host dozens of channels. That is an order of magnitude improvement in blockchain space usage! Hence, channel factories are win.",1546681154,t3_aci0zt,/r/Bitcoin/comments/aci0zt/can_we_expect_to_see_solutions_where_new_users/edagfge/

Bitcoin,ed9wc6p,aci0zt,"Over the last couple of days I've been playing around with the latest version of Blue Wallet, which I have to admit is the first wallet I have had success in making both payments and receiving funds via invoices using Lightning. \n\nI like what they're doing because I know that for ordinary folk, having your own node will not be an option. So we're going to see custodial solutions in the channel side of things - which is what Blue Wallet does.\n\nIt's really simple. First you create two wallets within the app - one for Bitcoin and one for Lightning. You fund Blue Wallet with some Bitcoin. Once confirmed you ""refill"" your Lightning wallet from within Blue Wallet. Once that refill is confirmed your Lightning balance is showing and you can spend it. \n\nI tested this using [https://www.lightningslotmachine.com](https://www.lightningslotmachine.com) which I found from a list of Lightning accepting stores here: [http://lightningnetworkstores.com](http://lightningnetworkstores.com)\n\nI purchased 50 spins and paid using the pop-up payment window, which I proceeded to scan from within Blue Wallet. The payment and credit of slot machine spins was instant. \n\nI then tested the withdraw winnings function on the slot machine site, and created a payment invoice within Blue Wallet. Once again everything went smoothly and I received the claimed winnings.\n\nIf you're looking to experience Lightning then Blue Wallet will give you that experience, as well as a taste for how easy it is - not to mention being fast and cheap.",1546658524,t3_aci0zt,/r/Bitcoin/comments/aci0zt/can_we_expect_to_see_solutions_where_new_users/ed9wc6p/

They are all essentially using fiat fractional reserve banking to create and ""lend"" to their own governments for Defense, which is then laundered via black budgets to fund terrorists or ""enemies of our enemy"". \n\nIn the west, we try to separate them as the ""good terrorists"" (freedom fighters) and the ""bad terrorists"", but even moderately-educated Americans realize this stuff is a farce. And worse, every so often, because many of these nation states all tend to look the other way at money laundering that looks like it's hurting ""an enemy"", a worse ""bad terrorist"" comes around to hurt them both because one ally thinks it can't trust another and funded that worse one to prove a point.

Bitcoin,ed8h0mz,acine4,"After some digging, the gist of it is this:\n\n* Alice is going to pay Bob X satoshi\n* Bob has some funds lying around\n* Bob propose that Alice pays him X + Y satoshi instead, but Bob provides the extra Y satoshi\n* Alice forms a transaction which spends her X sats, plus Bobs Y sats, with an output amount of X + Y arriving at Bob's destination address\n\nIn short; its a real coinjoin between two parties, combined with a payment. The communication to coordinate it is like a kind of collaborative payments protocol. \n\nA downside compared to normal coinjoin is that there will not be a high sudoku complexity, due to the lack of lots of equal amounts. \n\nIn their example transaction, you can see\n\n> Inputs: 2M 2M 3.75M 2.5M\n> Outputs: 500K, 9.7M\n\nIt seems clear that it is a unilateral payment because the txfee is all shoulderd by one party, and there is no chance this can be a join. IMO this could be significantly improved by changing it to\n\n> Outputs: 500K, 3.7M 2M 2M 2M\n\nThe four output coins could be then going to the same person in a payment way, or this could also be interpreted like a coinjoin with a very high complexity number. (small amount tweaks needed to hide the source of the txfee)\n\n\n\nArguably, one upside of the transaction as shown is that is will quickly confuse the more primitive kinds of block forensics which will assume this is a simple wallet payment with change. But after just a few of these, the wallet membership count swells high enough for them to know its not a real wallet spend, and then its just a less than optimal coin join to look at, and thus the overt coinjoin is harder to analyze.\n\n",1546620497,t3_acine4,/r/Bitcoin/comments/acine4/samourai_wallet_adds_stowaway_transactions_for/ed8h0mz/

It wont confuse a fancy one though, so I personally don't see it as a good tradeoff.\n\nAn example of how to make it a join+ payment\n\n* Inputs from Alice: 2M 2M 3.75M\n* Inputs from Bob: 2.5M\n* Inputs from Charlie: 3M\n\n* Outputs to Alice: 500K\n* Outputs to Bob: 2M 2M 2M 3M 500K 250K\n* Outputs to Charlie: 3M\n\nAlice is making a payment, Bob is receiving a payment, and Charlie is just tumbling. \n\nWhat this looks like from the outside:\n\n> 2, 2, 2.5, 3.75, 3 ==> 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, .5, .5, .25\n\nIf it was a pure tumble, the only sure link would be the 3.75 -> .25, the rest have multiple paths. the possibility that there is a payment involved makes it even harder to analyze, because now the owner of the 3.75 might not be the owner of the .25, which in this case we see alice paid it to bob, so classic sudoku has failed.\n\nThe original was:\n\n> 2, 2, 3.75, 2.5 ==> .5, 9.7\n\nIts clear that there must be a payment here. If you can color the coins before participation, then you only have two paths to follow. \n\nSo, for the sake of example, if you knew the 2.5 came from ""bob"" then you have to guess whether bob paid 1.95 to alice, or alice paid 7.2 to bob. If the price rounds to an even fiat amount, you can bias the direction; it might be that 7.2 is a likely payment amount while 1.95 is unlikely. Its then more likely that alice paid bob, and the best guess is thus accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",1546625104,t1_ed8k64h,/r/Bitcoin/comments/acine4/samourai_wallet_adds_stowaway_transactions_for/ed8og6l/

Only stablecoins tethered to ""stable"" currencies such as USD or EUR can be actually used as _currency_. Saying otherwise is just closing your eyes to truth.\n\nAnd that's why we have bubbles in crypto. For every ATH there's army of people who devoted their existence in getting their revenge for buying at previous ATH. Guys who bought BTC at $1500 in 2014 are the same ones who dumped it in January and February 2018. As more and more people get burned, you have less and less new ones interested in it. And slowly it all goes downhill.\n\nYou could say, with usage, Bitcoin's price would stabilize. I'd say no. It will forever stay a speculative asset, reaching a plateau at about $100k - $150k somewhere around 2025 - 2030, then it'll be forgotten as new technologies replace it. \n\nYou could say, but USD lost 99.9% of it's value since 1910. That's true, but it took USD about 100 years to accomplish that. It took Bitcoin **bloody 8 months** to lose 85% of it's value and no signs of recovery yet. How's that for a currency? Far worse than Turkish Lira.\n\nYou _need_ institutions, central banks, _big guns_ if you will, to provide stability to an asset and make it a currency. Behind United States Dollar there's a country with a 240+ years old constitution (regardless of who's running the FED). Behind Bitcoin there's only whales, speculators, scammers, Lambo idiots, and people bitching because they bought it too late.",1546681615,t1_ed9x3nn,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ackua3/whenever_you_doubt_yourself_remember_this_guy/edagpt5/

If there's suddenly no sellers, and lots of buyers willing to pay a lot more, prices can move incredibly quickly on very little $ volume\n\nI mean this rarely happens, something fundamentally needs to change. Think blow out earnings reports, or when a pharmaceutical drug gets approved or maybe is unexpectedly found to cure cancer or something.

Bitcoin,eddeohl,ackua3,"(1) Some didn't agree with a protocol change, and now we have BCH-ABC and BCH-SV. Every time there's a non-agreement, we have a fork and a chain split. Basically free money if you don't want to keep the other side's coins.\n\n(1a) Bitcoin does have it's own inflation due to mining. It's about 1-2% annually and slowly drops because of halving. It still remains to be seen if there will be any mining incentive once block reward drops to below 0.5 BTC.\n\n(1b) Due to coin taint, imposed by our all-powerful law enforcement, you will always have UTXOs that are worth _less_ than others. Fungibility is a lost dream with Bitcoin the way it is now.\n\n(2) It's divisibility depends on network fees, which constantly change. Theoretically, even if fees are 1 sat/byte, it's impossible to send less than about 200 satoshis, so that's your minimal division. Two and a half decimal places lost right at the start. As usage grows, there's more and more pressure on the tiny 1MB blocks, therefore fees skyrocket. It's impossible to put world population in an elevator, the waiting line will span across the globe. You will have only 2 - 3 effective decimal places; everything below will be eaten up by fees. Would you pay $1000 to open and close a Lightning channel? I know I wouldn't. That's not how I imagined digital money to work.\n\n(3) Yes. I write an email to my financial manager, saying to relay payment according to invoice 12345 XYZ. They connect with their bank which supports international RTGS, and transmit $1M to the receiver in Japan, who's bank also supports international RTGS payments.\n\n(3a) Yes. I login to my PayPal account, paste email address of the recipient, and send that $50 away, instantly. I don't even have to pay any fees.\n\n(3b) Yes. I open Venmo, WeChat, or Swish if I'm in Sweden, and send that $50 of fiat, instantly, with zero fees.\n\n(4) Then why only 0.0001% of all employed people in the world get their wages in Bitcoin? Maybe because using Bitcoin is a legal nightmare for any company, so there's absolutely no incentive to use it.\n\nAnd betting on something is still speculation, no?",1546767857,t1_edc9lp7,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ackua3/whenever_you_doubt_yourself_remember_this_guy/eddeohl/

People that favour BTC can ignore the forks as if they never existed (or sell them for free money indeed).\n\nRe 3, I think bitcoin does stimulate services like paypal, banks, etc. to implement/continue to offer rapid, cheap money transfers.

Bitcoin,ed946hz,acm33e,"Like I pointed out this system would be entirely customizable. I haven't thought much about how certain things would be implemented but I have thought of your point about too many laws being proposed. I could create an AI that finds key words in many different proposals and brings them together in a way that doesn't get rid of anything in each specific proposal, but joins excess words that are just different ways of saying something already proposed by many people. When you make a proposal, the system would then give you a pop up prompt that connects your idea to another unifying idea already proposed, and if the prompt it came up with is exactly what you said but just stated in a different way, you'd sign off on it and ask it to add your proposal into the already established proposal that unifies the different semantics of different people. This AI would only get more accurate over time as well, and I'm sure an AI like this already exists anyway. The proposals stated the most would be put on the top of a list, with diminishing popularity as the list goes down. In this way, literally every single citizen would have a part in exactly what gets put into law. As for enforcement of things like raising taxes, the blockchain would very easily remedy this, in an even better way than the IRS can. You are aware of the public ledger on Bitcoin so here's how I would propose it works. Don't get stuck up on the exact things I'm saying. Like I said, any idea I'm putting forward could be changed, or certain parts could be omitted, like giving your social security number or something. Here's one idea. Every single citizen puts in their full, legal name, their social security number, and then a random string of 30 characters. You can just spam your keyboard with characters, it doesn't matter. The system then hashes all 3 of these data points into a private key. Every person with the same name would have a different key because of the social security number input and 30 random characters, but even without inputting social security numbers, the 30 random characters would make decrypting of the individual keys into names very difficult (I wouldn't say impossible because you never know). The social security part is only to make sure everyone signing up corresponds to 1 person. The 30 random characters would act as the determinstic value to arrive at your private key, so even if someone got your private key, you could just change it with the 30 character string. Adding social security numbers would add extra security to the system because you would need the 30 characters and your social security number to have control over your private key. Ok, now that I pointed that out, this is how a law such as raising taxes would be enforced. All the public keys would be shown on the blockchain, and all income would be sent to your public key. Once the time for collecting taxes came along, every individual would remove the amount of taxes owed from their wallet. If someone paid less than they owe, this would be clear because the amount of income received would show. If the person refuses to pay, this public key would become sort of an outlaw, and if you are employing this public key user, you would see that they did not pay their taxes, and do whatever you want with that information. In essence, through some mechanism, your public and private keys would be private, so the way to pay someone would be through the way you pay them now: their name and social security number. The only purpose of the public key would be to have transparent elections and transparent laws. The issue of people's income being public knowledge can be easily circumvented. If you wanted a graduated income tax like there is in the US, you could just weigh all values in each bracket the same, and make sure someone is paying the correct percentage of their income, not the correct value. If you wanted flat income tax, it would be even easier because each person would just output the correct percentage of their income, without any reason to know their bracket. Income bracket is already basically public knowledge because you can see each persons material possessions. I don't know how private cryptos like Monero work but the mechanism used by them could also be implemented to have complete privacy, as well as a trust that each person is only voting 1 time.

Bitcoin,edhv2mx,acm9sw,"septem\_151 , conceptually Bitcoin transactions are of the form ""Pay this money (unspent output) to someone with the right Public Key and Private Key"". But it's actually a little more complicated than that. Bitcoin transactions are in the form of a tiny program (script) in a language that resembles ""Forth"" that compares your Public Key and transaction signed with your Private Key to a value stored in the transaction. However the script doesn't HAVE to just do that, it can take many other forms that implement things like Multiple Signatures (MultiSig) etc. Today almost all transactions use one of just a few ""standard"" programs (scripts) that have been nicknamed ""P2PK"" (Pay to public key), ""P2PKH"" (Pay to public key hash), ""P2SH"" (Pay to Script Hash), ""P2WSH"") (Pay to Witness Script Hash), etc etc. In fact they have become so standardized that nodes will no longer relay transactions to other nodes if they aren't one of the standard ones. This makes Bitcoin less flexible and less ""programmable money"" but is much safer from unintended bugs and problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe challenge we are talking about is a puzzle someone put into the blockchain in the form of a custom non-standard transaction script. Anyone who can figure out the script and/or values that will enable that custom script to run successfully can just take the money (about $20) by submitting a transaction that satisfies the script and transfers the money to their own address. The puzzle wasn't that hard and I solved it as many before me have, however since the solution is a non-standard script and no nodes will relay non-standard scripts anymore I cannot figure out a way to submit my solution transaction to the blockchain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suppose one way would be to join a mining pool and try to mine the transaction directly or with the help of the pool.

Bitcoin,ed9b7na,acmdd7,"The top moat maker is in great position to be the Microsoft of lightning.  At first glance this appears to be governance through a strictly capitalist open competition with a sprinkle of altruism to adhere to the BOLT specs. \n\nFinancial gain to support these orgs/companies would be through additional channel fees deducted when wallets are built via easily onboarding centralized nodes (blue wallet, wallet of satoshi) and those building the fee earning large secure pass through nodes.\n\nCasa node product seems the most altruistic here, as there are no payment infrastructure possible from open source wallet in personal node designers.  Other than their possible eventual desire to charge annual fees for their updateable software based node design.\n\nAs one commenter said lightning is a “jungle” and i see it more wild than even layer 1.  Capitalism without checks and balances from governance breeds monopolies and ultimately exploitation via nepotism and cronyism.  All I can hope is that these types of practices are much more difficult in the visible and transparent blockchain world, although when privacy is expanded those potential protective benefits are possibly lost by hiding the trail of dishonest entities.\n\nBitcoin’s open-source base layer design appears to me to be an almost pure uncorruptable example of capitalism.

Bitcoin,ed9xh0s,acny3i,"While McAfee is a showboat, it is important to know that taxes in the US basically never existed until 1913. Taxes (until the last 50 years) were generally earmarked to a war, and then canceled after the war was over.\n\nIn 1913, taxes went from 0% to 1%, with 2%+ rates referred to as a 'Super Tax'. During the world wars, they shot up to 70% (as a high). Also, prior to FDR, there was no social security or medicare tax. So the average American pre-1913, might of never paid taxes to federal government (outside of wars, which we did engage in a lot - but generally on our own soil), and locally paid sales tax and so forth.\n\nI think around 1935 all US military personnel, from all divisions, could fit into a football stadium, and until 1970, you had like 30 times less people held in prisons. Without mass imprisonment, without a large standing military... without extensive social programs, without grand public works... without bureaucratic government, without top down oppression - there is little need, nor the will to enforce excessive tax.\n\n> While I say pay your tax, I also say the tax system in the US is indicative for foreign enslavement - no sovereignty.\n\nAnd I would go on to say it has been this way since the murder of John Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States.\n\nThe US was invaded, their people taken in, and their treasures taxed away, the same as the pharaohs or kings would have done of old. Only this time, we still call it the United States of America, when I would rather call it the colonized states of _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , but I digress.\n\nThe Federal US tax system, which amounts to 40% of wages at virtually all levels (between social programs and federal funding) - is appalling and a disgrace. Our citizens are underdeveloped, and privileges stripped away like as if we need to ask permission for opinating, voting, thinking one way, or feeling another.\n\nSympathy for the people of Syria, who have war thrust upon them, is labeled cowardice, anger toward the child torture system, commonly referred to as education, is considered thoughtlessness, repulsion toward this mockery of social thought rotting our culture is called antisocial, and the desire to want something better for our youths, our family, and our communities in which we live is called bombastic; like the very air has been stolen from our lungs on the day we were born and the sheer foolhardiness of wanting to take in a deep, meaningful, free breath is something only considered by those who jest.\n\nFor we have been made to jest. Made to fool. Japed and joked.\n\nScum and villainy - all those who don't see the way - those who sulk and drink their sours, masterbating over games while losing the real one.\n\nThis tax is a sin. But a sin I bare - knowing, one day, I'll get it back.\n\nThe blood. And the people.",1546659529,t1_ed9j1f1,/r/Bitcoin/comments/acny3i/john_mcafee_calls_taxes_illegal_says_its_been_8/ed9xh0s/

Bitcoin,edalk9o,acqw2e,"1. Nobody can tell. But keep in mind that till 2020 there will be around 35.000.000 millionaires and just less then 14.000.000 BTC. Most will want the own at least 1 BTC\n\n2. 5800$ should have been the bottom. Everything you buy bellow that is a strong buy\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. We will stop going down the day when the last seller sells his BTC at this stupid prices. Prbly we already reached the bottom. But it's hard to tell since news a manipulating the market pretty hard and I wouldn't be surprised to see more people dump for no reason. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. There are whales acumulating BTC at 3-4k$. The day nobody will sell them any more BTCs, they will place price walls. I don't see it as a bull run. It will look like the long flat tetris block that will drop verticaly in just few days. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. \n\nXRP - as much as true crypto guys, with morality in their heads, don't like xrp I don't think there is much we can do here. Maybe it's the most painless transition for common people into the crypto world. And it's a bridge that has to be made for people to reach the wanted destination. That said, I see a big boost incoming for XRP. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLTC - not the most popular opinion here, but LTC has a bright future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETH - 2019 will be the year of stable coins. I'm pretty sure that >70% of them will be built on ETHs platform. I see few trillion $ coming in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. ICO's won't die. They are perfect startups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. Alts will overtake the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n8. No comment on that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9. The 1st will be ETC. A bridge between ETH and ETC chains will do wonders for ETC when gas becomes too high on ETH.\n\nThe 2nd will be TRON. They could reach 6-4th place on cmc easily.\n\nThe 3rd will be Cardano. Not sure yet it the surprise will be good or bad, but surely we will be surprised. They'll make it or break it this year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10. It's hard to find a non content maker media. Because to many people, just like me, have their own opinion and keep talking. Not every red candle means doom, not every green candle means moon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n11. There are too many whales, institutions, etc. on hold. Many more people are now involved, much more people have the information about crypto. 2015, 2016 and 2017 showed the path for the climb. Next spark of hype will bring millions of new investors to the market\n\n&#x200B;\n\n12. Sure... coz cryptos where invented to be ruled by Bakkt...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n13. Like whole this comment, another unpopular opinion... ASIC miners fucked the whole market. If we all kept mining with our humble computers there would be much more nodes, much less centralization and so on... I get chills when I hear that China has 70% of all the hash power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n14. I'm misunderstanding this last one.\n\nBut, logicaly what it means to hit the bottom? \n\nThe bottom should be: ""the price around the worlds average price of the cost of energy to mine 1 BTC."".\n\n That price is a little less coz nobody will build a mining farm in London when mining in Ukrain, Albania, Iceland or Belarus is way cheaper. So the average price of mining 1 BTC in those cheap electrcity countries. Thats anywhere between 4000-6000$.\n\nMaybe there are some form of free energy so people can mine 1 BTC for free or only for the price of the hardware needed, but that should be a whole other topic. And that's why it will be harder and harder to comapre BTC to USD.",1546688504,t3_acqw2e,/r/Bitcoin/comments/acqw2e/do_you_think_this_is_a_list_of_most_discussed/edalk9o/

Instead, you will suck the credit pool to a trickle if BTC loans have to be backed by real BTC on a 1:1 basis.

Bitcoin,edcko67,acr75w,"Thanks for the well thought out response, this is a good point.\n\nI guess the downside here is that it seems this could increase wealth inequality by exponentially increasing early people's wealth at the effective expense of newcomers. Because currently with 3% inflation, $100,000 \* (0.97\^30) = \~$40,000 30 years later, so old money is continuously devalued, but if increasing at 5% a year that $100,000 \* (1.05\^30) = \~430,000 after 30 years. The old money is grown by sitting, but this increasing value of old money kind of exponentiates the difficulty of younger people and future generations to acquire some, since the increasing value of the currency is effectively due to the increasing demand for the currency due to population growth etc.",1546740921,t1_edbdar0,/r/Bitcoin/comments/acr75w/this_is_the_best_bitcoin_advertisement_ive_seen/edcko67/

There is a reason why the gap between the 0.1% and the middle class in terms of their share in the pie keeps growing. Also in your calculations you provide the inflation of %3, but do not include the inflation-adjusted gains (such as CDs, tresuries and municipal bonds, even long term stock market indices). In reality the old money does not lose value since it does not sit idle (like most common folks' savings accounts). What happens is the wages that do not catch up to the inflation melts away as time passes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you are raising however on younger people's opportunities diminishing is a very real and a very scary issue, that exists in both scenarios. I would however assume that at least in a decentralized solution it is up to people's will to fight against this and provide measures (such as higher cost on accumulated money, that is still feasible).

This is due to the fact that socialism is based fundamentally  on compulsion and coercion as a means to an end, whereas Bitcoin is a voluntary system, and therefore anti-authoritarian. \n\nSince Bitcoin and socialism are diametrically opposed, socialists may fight to change Bitcoin into an authoritarian system which can be used for coercion, but I suspect they will come to realize that adopting a more pragmatic political ideology is easier than changing Bitcoin to the detriment of everyone else.",1546703723,t3_act3wl,/r/Bitcoin/comments/act3wl/bitcoin_is_not_a_socialist_project/edb0of4/
Bitcoin,edbmta1,act3wl,"Bitcoin is both for socialists and capitalists. The ONLY goal of bitcoin is to prevent the uncontrolled printing of money by the government, the unilateral seizure of funds, and the unilateral freezing of payments. That's it.\n\nIf people want to get together and share risk, and appoint other people whose sole job is to manage societal risks.... good for them. It works. It's called taxes and government.\n\nIf people want to pool together their money to prevent problems that cause other problems, good for them, it is called risk mitigation.\n\nHere is an example of these types of problems: sexually transmitted disease epidemics. kids too soon epidemics. poverty epidemics. Homelessness epidemics. These are all conditions that are interrelated. Mom fucks random people, unprotected sex, and causes diseases to spread. She gets a kid. She can't afford a kid, so she becomes homeless. Well what does she do? She fucks people for money and keeps spreading diseases.\n\nThe smart solution for the good of all is to step in and break the cycle. Not just for the people who are helpless and trapped in the poverty cycle, but for other people who will be sucked into the cycle, either through their own poor judgement, or the actions of those around them. But who steps in with free housing to alleviate the poverty that is forcing the mom to become a sex worker because that is the only job she is qualified for that makes enough money? Surely not any individual, the cost is too great, and there is very little reward. That is why people pool their money. Taxes are a way to buy stability in our lives. Its a way to buy the infrastructure we depend upon. It's too expensive for corporations or individuals because the rate of return per user is abysmal. You need millions of users, before those intangible benefits start to outweigh the costs. And that is why government exists. It serves as a way to split the cost between all members of society for things like roads, military, etc. And to the moms situation: add in free childcare and free education and before you know it, she will be producing more than enough value to not only pay for the childcare + education investment, but her taxes will pay to prevent another person from falling into the same trap she did.\n\nNow does the state sometimes over reach? YES! and that is wrong! Can the state's over reach be curbed? Well, that is why politics exists. To control the state. However, people are participating in identity politics instead of voting who they know is the right guy.\n\nIf you want to fix/fight/restrict the state, bitcoin is not your answer. The proper answer is to campaign in your local state for things like ranked choice voting, anti gerrymandering laws, and laws prohibiting the large sums of money to be donated by special interest groups to essentially buy elections.\n\nIf we fix the underlying rot that has corrupted politics, and corrupted the state, then we can have common sense laws. We won't be continuously at war. We can push for science, green tech, and liberty from oppressive rules and regulations designed for a pre-token economy. But we cannot do that until we have cut the two major political parties down. They are the corruptors of politics, and Trump and the last two years of the republican party have been the most corruptive of all.",1546717970,t3_act3wl,/r/Bitcoin/comments/act3wl/bitcoin_is_not_a_socialist_project/edbmta1/

Bitcoin,edc22n6,act3wl,"Correct, right now, normal people have no influence in politics. The way to change that is to introduce several measures. \n\n1. ranked choice voting. This breaks the spoiler and the wasted vote effects. By doing this, people in the last election could have voted for one of the third party candidates and still have been able to cast their vote against trump or hillary. If gary johnson had won, think about how our system would have been. And, with ranked choice voting, people could have voted for gary johnson while at the same time ranking trump or hillary lowest (whichever they considered worst. In addition, bernie could have run, and he wouldn't have split the vote of the democratic party. In a way, the ranked choice vote makes party primaries pointless, because although the party can select someone, if someone else wants to run against the party candidate, they can do so without splitting the vote. Lastly, it makes it impossible to run spoiler candidates to split major party votes. If this is done for all presidential and congressional candidates, political party importance will fade dramatically. \n\n2. Outlawing gerrymandering. It is easy to spot gerrymanderring, but difficult to prove it. There is a mathematical proof involved in how many ""wasted votes"" there were per district. Forcing all maps to be drawn by a non partisan party with oversight is a great start to removing gerrymandering. Once this happens the knock on effects of having your party in power will get reduced. \n\n3. Reversing citizen's united. Right now, big political parties make big promises to big companies in return for lots of free money. They shill their party, and corrupt their way to power. By outlawing all corporate donations, and limiting individuals to donate $250 or less, you break the political/money power of the political parties. Once you do that, the party influence will be dramatically reduced. \n\nAmerica needs less political partisanship. It is breaking our unity and our consensus. It has led to cruelty, and many people think of their fellow americans as stupid or as the enemy. It is not your fellow people who are the enemy. It is the people who corrupt public discourse, corrupt public finances, steal votes, manipulate elections and who take donations from foreign states who are the enemy. And to be clear: those specific folks really ought to be marched en masse to the guillotine. They have caused to much suffering and heartache for others to deserve any less. And they aren't the politicians in all cases. They are the people who are pulling the politician's strings. \n\n",1546728150,t1_edbyld2,/r/Bitcoin/comments/act3wl/bitcoin_is_not_a_socialist_project/edc22n6/

Bitcoin,ed71iop,ac3pqx,"The quick answer is the outcome is unpredictable  \nThere would be a chain fork between the nodes running old and new software versions  \nBitcoin node software automatically reverts ""orphan"" branches and applies the correct blocks to remain synchronised with the ""longest"" chain  \nWhen a node sees it has different blocks to its neighbours, it automatically decides which fork is correct  \nThis decision is not a vote. The majority does not decide which chain is correct. The decision is made by calculating which chain is longest - which one has the greatest amount of work. The longest chain could be the one with invalid blocks  \n\nWhat actually happens depends on the nature of the bug  \nA serious bug, if it allows double-spending, or creation of new coins which are not mining reward, would be discovered by the community and the developers and there would be an emergency bug fix  \nWhat happens next depends on whether all nodes upgrade from the buggy version to the fixed version  \nAnother complication is the role of miners. If all miners upgrade their nodes, then they will stop producing invalid blocks, so it matters less whether some non-mining nodes fail to upgrade  \n\nThe above analysis assumes things happen quickly  \nIf a bug creates extra value (double-spend or extra coins) and is not noticed for thousands of blocks, then it could be impossible to unwind the corrupt chain branch and replace it",1546568314,t3_ac3pqx,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ac3pqx/question_about_blocks/ed71iop/
Bitcoin,ed5cb6t,ac3pqx,"It seems that here there is a confusion between CLIENT and MINER. At the beginning of Bitcoin history every client was also a miner, but now they are different. Clients do not produce blocks, miners do.\n\nIf a MINER is using a program that produces blocks which are not compatible with other MINERS, a fork will happen as soon as the first block is mined by a new program. Each miner will look at the blocks of the other chain as mistakes and will go on with its own chain. The general public will PROBABLY consider the chain with 75% of power as the right one, but I am pretty sure that  several people will still consider the other one to be the right one.\n\nIf instead a version of a CLIENT without backward compatibility is released, if it makes a payment to a person using the old client this person won't see the payment. What happens here will depend on the miners more than on the percentage of clients, because even if 75% of clients are adopting the new software if the miners do not mine their transactions, they will never get a confirmation. \nAnd in a case like this I think that the miners will stay on the safe side and mine only transactions with the old protocol.

Also there is a checksum: Only one in 128 word combinations are valid. Turns out the easiest to remember are 12 times the same word and the easiest to type is 12 times a 3 letter word like ""mom mom mom mom mom mom mom mom mom mom mom mom"" but I would recommend ""oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil"" as it is even faster to type as it needs no distinction from a longer word with the same prefix and ""o"", ""i"" and ""l"" are one cluster on your keyboard.\n\n(At the risk that anybody takes the above serious:\n\n* No, please don't use a key you find on the internet\n* No, 12 times the same word is not a good choice\n* No, any combination you chose for your convenience is not a good choice)",1546534769,t3_ac3s5g,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ac3s5g/jan3/ed5s24m/

I criticized saying that it wasn't fair, but then my Fininsh friend next to me said that that was quite common in Finland. Actually, maybe it was in Russia. Can't remember.\n\nBut anyway, you don't actually see that in Portugal. Although with a socialist government, the country is quite liberal when it comes to civil liberties and freedom of expression (not so good for businesses, however).\n\nJust yesterday I was finishing reading this (a little outdated) book by Tyler Cowen, ""Average is Over"", where he clearly points out what is happening in Portugal. Here's that passage:\n\n""A lot more of Mediterranean Europe is going to look like southern Italy and Sicily: somewhat empty in terms of economically successful enterprises on a large scale. It will rely more on tourism and more on retirees and government transfers, but overall the fiscal problems of these regions will worsen and they may lose some political autonomy.""\n\nAnd this is actually happening. Then again, the government is trying to balance this by promoting the country as a place for highly specialized companies to settle (and young human capital is actually coming), while trying to become a key-player on China's OBOR, by developing the much needed deep-water port of Sines (one of the biggest in Europe and underutilized).\n\nBelieve it or not, Portugal has a very good geo-political strategy, set up after the end of the dictatorship, but hardly put to practice (only recently it is openly spoken by politicians, because, you know, we're not relevant in the EU, never were, and most likely never will).

Rising fees will mean that people use Bitcoin less or use it more efficiently than usual, decreasing transaction size, decreasing transaction count, and making it harder to ""clog""\n2. Miners can literally send valid block headers via morse code (a valid block header is 80 bytes) so in a worst case scenario, the pool could open private communication with their major members and skype the valid blocks if they wanted to... lol... but to be honest, pools also use cloudflare and akamai etc. for any and all outward facing APIs... so this again is kind of grasping at straws.\n3.

Also because a decentralized system is not as easier to patch as a single server. Bitcoin is the coin with the most money invested on it so it is understandable that a conservative approach is taken when dealing with upgrades.\n\nBut it's a positive thing imo that other altcoins test the new features, our money is secured in bitcoin, we can invest on alts, and when the bugs are resolved we port them to bitocoin ;))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As for store of value, volatility isn’t store of value, store of value is an asset with low volatility\n\nBitcoin is mostly used as speculative investment today, not store of value so the price in fiat will fluctuate a lot.

Bitcoin,eekwppb,ac74ay,"OP , Bitcoin, like other crypto coins, is extremely volatile and the value of the currency remains unpredictable. News and seemingly unrelated events affect its price greatly, sometimes positively, sometimes negatively. However, if you’d like to take the plunge and get some bitcoin, here are two ways to do that:\n\n**Get paid in BTC**The fastest way to grow your wallet – bitcoin or otherwise – is to start getting paid with bitcoin. If you have an online shop, add a “pay with bitcoin” button to your shopping cart. As an online service provider, you might consider asking your clients whether they’d like to use bitcoin for payment. However, if you have a brick and mortar shop, you could print out your bitcoin wallet’s address QR code and stick it next to the checkout so people will be able to scan it and send you bitcoin instantly. And if you’re an employee, why not ask your employers if they’d be interested in paying your salary in bitcoin instead of fiat?\n\n**Buy bitcoin**You can also buy bitcoin and hope that your wallet grows on its own.\n\nWhen it comes to purchasing bitcoin, keep in mind that past performance is not always an indicator of future performance, and with cryptocurrencies still in their infancy large dips in value do occur. (paxful , atm bitcoin ( use bitcoin atm app to locate one near you)\n\nHow to get bitcoin\n\nSending and receiving bitcoin is a simple process as long as you’ve set up two things:\n\n**An	account on a digital currency exchange.** There are many currency exchanges available online from which you can purchase bitcoin. After you’ve created an account and 	exchanged some fiat currency for bitcoin, the next step is to set up a wallet.   I prefer to use LUNO or localbitcoin.com**A bitcoin wallet.** Again, there are many wallets you can use for bitcoin, and your best bet to 	choose one that fits your needs . Once you’re all set up 	you’re ready to start paying for products or services. Simply 	follow the instructions for your wallet of choice and you’ll be 	trading bitcoin in no time.(coinomi wallet from google play) .When I started 3 years ago I only got Trevon James  video to guide me at 1st  before slowly investing in ICO then later using bitcoin for my usual Blackjack session at Vegascasino.io .

Carrying around passwords to a foreign currency account in your head costs you nothing.\n\nMaybe you should look at how many bolivars are needed to buy a family of 4 groceries in VE right now.

Much easier target for theft. \n\n>what benefits to the world does bitcoin bring that was not there before? They claimed that some exist. I asked what they were.

Allows for global transmissions of payments for low fees with no third party involved. Person to person wealth management/transactions. It's purchasing power cannot be stolen by inflation.

Bitcoin,ed7mxil,ac7hfz,">Let's compare that loss of value in the last year with bitcoin. What numbers do you get? You can't criticise something for 'losing value' then propose an alternative that loses value at a rate 40x higher. That's irrational. It's an argument that makes no logical sense at all.\n\nGo check Veneuzeula's inflation rate. People can use various tools. But if people's two options are Bitcoin and the Bolivar, even with a 80% decline that's still a better store of value with the Bolivar's inflation. \n\n>I carry some around in my mouth right now. I don't notice the weight yet there's easily enough of it to buy more than a year's food & rent in Venezuela. \n\nThat's a strange habit if you don't live in a third world country. \n\n>I literally carry gold around in my mouth right now everyday, hundreds of millions of people do. It is quite literally used for its properties of being practical to have in a human body and effective at preventing bacterial growth. I mean, you literally couldn't make a worse argument about gold than this. It's the opposite of reality. \n\nI mean for when you hand it to other people. Seems impractical. \n\n>It doesn't store capital. If it stored capital, we wouldn't have seen the price drop by 80% within a year.\n\n1 BTC = 1 BTC\n\nYou can keep quoting the 80% drop and ignore the gains from $0 over the last 10 years. Don't buy assets in the middle of irrational climbs. Same with gold or stocks. \n\n\n\n>Prevents confiscations of capital.\n\n>Nope.\n\nYep. If a bank wants to freeze your assets, they can. If police want to extract a bribe out of you. They can. Bitcoin doesn't move without your private keys/permission. \n\n>Why do life savings need to be 'easily divisible'? Do you carry around your life savings currently every day?\n\nBecause spending an ounce of gold is difficult when you can't get change back. The point is Bitcoin is easily divisible. Gold, you need flame, tools, and some basic know how. \n\n>Nope, you have to trust someone or something at the point of exchange for goods or money.\n\nWhat are you talking about? The system of transferring value from A to B is trust-less. Merchant relations is a whole other ball game. \n\n>Nope, there's only enough transactions per second for every person on the planet to use it twice per lifetime, one-in, one-out.\n\nYou have been grossly misinformed. Bitcoin has been scaling. \n\n>New bitcoins are printed literally every 10 minutes or so. Inflation is hardly measurable given an 80% devaluation. Who on earth worries about 1-2% inflation (balanced by interest, in the case of a bank account) yet doesn't care about a 80% loss!\n\nLess are printed every 4 years. Bitcoin's distribution period is temporary and more consistent than any central bank policy which can inject billions into an economy on a whim. Bitcoin's supply is increased slower and slower over time. \n\nOn the other side of the coin we have a guaranteed 2-3% inflation every year (or more) with fiat currencies that compounds over time. \n\n>The network has been shutting itself down all year. The network, fully working, cannot support every person on the planet using it more than twice per lifetime. \n\nThis is not true and you know it. \n\n>I can only assume you haven't read any papers on distributed logs or lived through e-currencies of the dotcom period, or earlier papers on the topic (https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/quick-history-cryptocurrencies-bbtc-bitcoin-1397682630/).\n\nI'm familiar. Bitcoin is the first of it's kind. Previous iterations didn't have all the features and connectivity that Bitcoin does. All of the previous iterations had their own issues. \n\n>""Sound"" money doesn't go up 1000% and down 80% in the space of less than a year each time, I can tell you that right now.\n\nYou're really hung up on that 80% number and the volatility. Go read the book. Bitcoin crashed 80% and it's still 3x higher than it was in early 2017. \n\n>""Sound money"" is actually exchangeable for goods everywhere you go.\n\nI can use Bitcoin anywhere that takes a debit/credit card if I want to. I can buy phone credit. Amazon gift cards. Pre paid cards. Whatever. \n\n>""Sound money"" doesn't have teams of cheerleaders calling for you to not use it, but instead hold it without spending it.\n\nYou can do whatever you want with your own money. ""not using it"" some would call this **saving**. Bitcoin encourages saving because it appreciates in value over long periods of time. HODL it or use it. The choice is yours. \n\n>What times are those? Be specific. Gold and food are universally available for trade. How can something be easier to get than a universally available good?\n\nGo visit Venezuela and find out. They've been raiding buried bodies for gold teeth, empty super markets, people are fleeing the country en masse. It's easier to carry Bitcoin out of the country than gold, and easier to conceal. \n\nYou've clearly read a lot of headlines about Bitcoin but haven't actually pondered the economic context. Again, suggest reading the book above.\n\n\n",1546588471,t1_ed7lz5z,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ac7hfz/happy_birthday_bitcoin_keep_changing_the_world/ed7mxil/

Bitcoin,ed8zmqf,ac7hfz,**Bitcoin scalability problem**\n\nThe bitcoin scalability problem refers to the discussion concerning the limits on the amount of transactions the bitcoin network can process. It is related to the fact that records (known as blocks) in the bitcoin blockchain are limited in size and frequency.Bitcoin's blocks contain the transactions on the bitcoin network. The on chain transaction processing capacity of the bitcoin network is limited by the average block creation time of 10 minutes and the block size limit. These jointly constrain the network's throughput.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28,1546632504,t1_ed8zmj5,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ac7hfz/happy_birthday_bitcoin_keep_changing_the_world/ed8zmqf/

So some peoplein the market who are out to enrich themselves get to outmaneuver and scam them. Although,  one can argue that there is no one that has not been scammed before.

Bitcoin,ed67tm3,ac8t7o,"There are several problems with the Prisoner's Dilemma analysis of bitcoin. A couple simple ones:\n\n1. Like so many analyses, it has an implicit or explicit assumption that demand will keep increasing so that the limited supply means price will appreciate. I've seen no evidence that demand is being driven by anything other than the belief that demand will keep increasing.\n\n2. The whole concept that those of us who are ""no-coiners"" will be ""forced to purchase Bitcoin when much more of the 21 Million Chairs have been filled"" is loaded language that misses the whole concept of what currency is used for. If for some reason bitcoin becomes so widely used that I am forced to use it for some transaction (like buying a house), then it doesn't matter to me whether my house costs 2000 bitcoins or one bitcoin because I will only have wealth in bitcoin for long enough to make the transaction.\n\n3. The whole ""the supply is limited!"" cry seems false, in my opinion. Or at least, it's only true if you accept that there will only ever be one cryptocurrency and it's bitcoin.

Bitcoin,ed6dwwg,ac8t7o,"1. Your use of the word ""combined"" makes it easy to blur the relative importance of the two factors. To my mind, by far the major factor is speculation. The number of people who are using bitcoin because it's actually more useful than the alternative is vanishingly small (though I'd actually be interested to hear how you define ""defected from the banks."")  Regarding me ""pay(ing) a higher price later to acquire btc,"" that's making the same unsupported assumption as I originally objected to, but again, when (if) I need to use bitcoin to make a particular transaction it is completely irrelevant to me what the exchange rate is at that time.\n\n2. ""If fiat currencies continue to be devalued, then late comers will pay a higher price."" This is the straw man of assuming the alternative to keeping your wealth in bitcoin or fiat, and I do neither. The value of a dollar could drop by half in the next 10 years, and it wouldn't affect me much as long as the companies in which I am invested could sell their products for twice as much (which is what we mean when we say the currency is devalued) and thus would have twice as much profit.\n\n3. I'm not making a claim about the utility of the benefits of crypto; in fact it wouldn't surprise me if a lot more people are using it in a decade. But I think the semantic issue is crucial because I am worried that it is enabling self-deception. So many people are hung up on the 21 million ceiling without thinking through the implications of the fact that 21 million is only the hard limit for one specific cryptocurrency, and nothing prevents there from being an infinite number of cryptocurrencies.",1546550165,t1_ed6ap9l,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ac8t7o/convince_me_why_not_investing_100k_into_btc_will/ed6dwwg/

Bitcoin,ed66fha,ac94r0,"You can't do this analysis without factoring in two things:\n\n1. The likelihood of each option. If there is a 98% chance it's going to be worth $2000 and a 2% chance it's going to be worth $38000, then the expected value of your investment is $2720, which no investor who makes many investments over the course of their life would take. Without these percentages, you could use your logic to justify absolutely *every* potential investment. Why not buy penny stocks, since the downside is little and the upside is essentially limitless?\n\n2. The opportunity cost which, despite your post title, you don't factor in. The risk is not just that you lose some money but that you fail to invest in other opportunities which more reliably increase in value. You can't simply use logic on bitcoin in isolation; you have to compare it against other opportunities.",1546545106,t3_ac94r0,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ac94r0/opportunity_cost/ed66fha/

Bitcoin,ed67jes,ac94r0,"Your 2 points are well-received. I addressed the first point when I stated that most of us believe that there is a very small chance that Bitcoin will fail (I acknowledge that it certainly could fall further). I didn't give these events probabilities because I don't know them. But If you forced me to use percentages, I'd probably guess that there is a <1% chance of Bitcoin failing in the next 10 years, a \~25% chance it will fall to $2,000 in the next 6 months, and a 98% chance of climbing to $38,000 in the next 18-24 months. Thus, expected value/return of these three scenarios is very high (I understand I mixed timeframes so methodology is wonky, but you know what I mean). \n\nRegarding the Opportunity Cost, I didn't explicitly state what it would be because it would be different for everyone. However, what I am confident in is that most people are extremely unlikely to find an opportunity that could potentially provide the expected value/return that they would get from the scenario described above. Most people will keep their money in a bank account paying minimal interest, in which case the Opportunity Cost is easily calculated. Some may choose to invest in stocks/bonds/commodities/futures/real estate. Expected returns on those assets are nowhere near a \~8-10x return over the next 24 months.",1546545886,t1_ed66fha,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ac94r0/opportunity_cost/ed67jes/

If he was not Christian I doubt he would be conservative to begin with, but even so I can see you point of how he was basically taken up by irrelevant groups mostly because he ""hits the left where it is weak"". \n\nIn fact he is a hitting a caricature version of the left (which can indeed -sometimes- be found in the unis) but the left itself is left untouched. He's not addressing issues of fundamental disparity (i.e. disparity that is beyond one's control or ""hard work"") as is typical with conservatives, so he's not making a point against the *actual* left (i.e. those concerned with the well being of the dispossessed). Neither do I see a takeover of the left by extreme factions, at least not yet. Maybe his alarmism is what made him popular to begin with, but again, that doesn't make him nuanced, or someone that can hold the interest of the public for so long. \n\n*That* is the part of him that I don't get ""how did he manage to stay relevant for so long"".

It is possible that this was part of Satoshi's original intent when implementing it as a consensus parameter to begin with.\n\nWe should both consider ourselves lucky and be very proud of the fact that the Bitcoin collective has managed to unite behind a scaling path which encourages efficient and optimized chain usage, adheres to Satoshi's design and architecture, and minimizes end-user validation costs and reliance upon counterparty trust.

If most people have most of the transactions on their drive  before a block is mined, a miner or transmitter only has to sent a list  of very short tx ids, instead of the whole block.\n\nSorry, no. Transactions are propagated to nodes so that miners have them to include in blocks. They are propagated to nodes because Bitcoin would literally not work if they weren’t.  Any extra efficiency that can be squeezed out of block transmission based on transactions being well mirrored across nodes using bloom filters or whatever is just a happy side effect.\n\nWhat the \~90/10 *does* mean is that even if you could get all blocks to be transmitted at 1% of their actual size, you would only be saving \~10% on bandwidth.\n\nBy the same reasoning, doubling block size would only require 10% more bandwidth (excluding any advanced block propagation reduction, that would make it even less). Note; they would have to be full too. \n\nIt would only take an 11.1% increase in transaction volume *regardless of block size,* to use the same 10% more bandwidth.\n\nIt also means that doubling transaction volume would require nearly double the bandwidth (90% more), again, *regardless of the blocksize*. (Also when Bitcoin gets into a very congested state, because of blocks not large enough for the demand, many transactions enter the mempool that are dropped before they ever make it into a block, increasing bandwidth for no reason, and probably double if you assume the are later rebroadcast with a higher fee)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",1546682803,t1_ed7w917,/r/Bitcoin/comments/acbwry/scaling_vs_increasing_the_blocksize_a_hddssd/edahciz/

Bitcoin,ed8degb,acc7jf,"I think the discussion if a deflationary or inflationary money is better won't settle.\n\nWe have had a period with hard/sound money and thus we can compare it with the current fiat experiment.\nMost agree that the average growth in wealth was greatest with the sound money.\nFiat can/has enabled a temporary faster, even total, growth but that was/is also a not normal distribution (a few gained an absurd amount).\nThe addition of increasing debt is another effect that causes a temporary increase of wealth but most forget all debt needs to be repaid INCLUDING the price for lending it!\n\nDebt just causes wealth to be consumed or enjoyed now at the cost of more wealth reduction in the future (the cost of lending money). Thus this implies that over the combined period of lending and paying it back the wealth of that person is lower compared than the total wealth if he didn't lend.\nThe wealth distribution over time changed, time preference, but also overall wealth.\nThe effects for the one providing the money is opposite (as should be)...\n\nYes some money borrowed for business purposes does make sense since it can gain more money then the cost of lending it. But if you look at the total amount of money lend only a small part of it is used for that purpose. A lot is used for consuming or government spending and don't get me started on that.\nUnfortunately some of that money used for creating business is only good since the costs of lending are way below average and what I think is sane, combined with the unnatural consuming caused by current inflation and mentioned government spending (again don't get me started on that).\nThis money mis allocation will only be exposed in the next recession.\nBut the effects will multiply the pain.\n\nThe funny thing is, for the banks, most money being lend is created by these banks.\nThis makes it for them a win only fest (remember the few that gained absurt amounts).\nThe secondary effect is that this QE is causing inflation (money being wort less over time).\nThe banks profit from this effect as well since when they create it that money has full value, and by the time the consumer will use it the deflated value will have set in.\nA often overlooked aspect is the effect of inflation on your savings.\nPeople tend to hear to positive short term effect, you loans will be easier paid of if we have inflation, better than the long term effect, your pension will decrease in value.\nAnd these effects increase over time.\nSince normally a loan is for a shorter period than saving for your pension the effects for your savings are just much bigger.\n\nIn the long term it is a no brainer for what money is better, just look up the results ( yes they are quite hidden conveniently).\n\nThe used argument that we need inflationary money to keep growing is popular but not correct. Again check long term overall wealth growth during sound money periods.\nNext we live in a closed system never ending growth is simply impossible.\nAlso growth should not be a goal, I hope happiness, for as many as possible, should be and if that is only measured by growth, materialism, or having more than others it would be quite pathetic (yes I fall for some of it as well).\n\nThe biggest problem is these discussions are about religion.\nWe believe something will work or is better.\nThis can also easily be denied but whenever we talk about money it's only us humans that attach a value to it. There is no natural law that defines the value of something it's a man made metric, usefull or needed but based on faith/agreement.\nIf you think long enough about it the whole term 'intrinsic value' Is absurd.\nValue is a perceived attribute of someting defined by a human.\nAt the moment of a successful trade (exchange of goods or services ) both parties agree only on that moment that the price (in case money is used) or value (in case of only goods or services involved) is correct or match. \nMostly both parties think at that moment they gained something, if you let that sink in it says a lot about humans and once realized most will never look at any future exchange in the same way.\n\nAn other aspect involved is something like moral compass.\nSome are not bothered by it and thus have no issues with gaining power/money/wealth at cost of everything. If we take these people as sample and put them on a pedestal as being successful and admirable no matter their mental state or effect they cause, we get on the current slippery slope.\n\nI feel I'm just getting started but this post is allready getting a mess and way too long.\nI'm just excited we now at least have a usefull/sound alternative to fiat.\nLet humanity decide what is best, we will get what we deserve.\n\nMy bet is made.\n\n",1546618025,t3_acc7jf,/r/Bitcoin/comments/acc7jf/you_cant_beat_math/ed8degb/

Bitcoin,ed6y28w,acc7jf,"I don't know if op is going to respond or not, I hope he does, but the main argument against a deflationary currency is people's desire to save it rather than spend it. Economies rely on money circulation in order to function but if everybody thinks they have more to gain by saving their currency instead of spending it, because it will be worth more tomorrow than it is worth today, that will break down the economy as it will lock up.\n\nBasically, why would apple make a new phone to sell to make profit when they can just sit there and do nothing and make a profit because their currency keeps going up in value.\n\nAs for my take on the mater: the problem is actually looked at the wrong way around. The reason that the currency is deflationary is because the economy is growing. If the economy doesn't grow, there is nowhere for the currency to gain extra value from and as such nobody gains anything, so we reach the same point as we have now where we have to spend the currency for it to actually be useful, just like we do the dollar.\n\nSecondly, people usually save as much as they need to have a buffer, then spend the rest. You can't take money tot the grave with you and you still need to buy food, clothes, a house etc. The only thing this will probably do is end the era of consumerism where we buy a new piece of shit phone and a new piece of shit car every year to every few years because they are made to last exactly their warranty period and thats it.

Bitcoin,ed7yekp,acc7jf,"If the world runs on Bitcoin, why should it go up more than the annual amount of lost Bitcoin? (besides normal fluctuation). We can debate about how many coins will be lost, but I doubt that it will be a lot.\n\nUntil then Bitcoin obviously has enormous room to grow, I'm not talking about a few % every year from today on, but in a distant future where Bitcoin has grown to fit the worlds economy. It's nothing that happens over night, it's more like a process which might take decades. \n\n>I'm all for new technology. But Bitcoin isn't working as a currency now. And it's a decade old. How long before it works?\n\nSorry, but do you actually think that a technology like Bitcoin will transform the world within 10 years? It's a miracle that something like Bitcoin got any value at all. The pace of its growth is just astounding to me. 10 years ago some dude released a piece of software, today it's the hardest money the world has ever seen and a selfsustaining decentralized monetary system used by millions of people and a viable alternative to their dying currencies for many people. \n\n> I don't think Satoshi programmed it well enough to be a useful currency. \n\nBitcoin is an open source protocoll which has been and will be improved as time goes on. The basics are set in stone since day one, but everything from efficiency to usability is not comparable to what satoshi initially released and the future Bitcoin will not be comparable to todays Bitcoin.\n\n> Time will tell tho I suppose.\n\nAgree!\n\nWe don't know how the world looks like in 20 years, so it might be completely false to try to fit a potential future with Bitcoin into todays society and economy. Could be that there will be lots of changes and maybe the world will adapt and change with something like Bitcoin around.

Bitcoin,ed8qzke,acc7jf,"I dont think you know the difference between inflationary currencys and deflationary currencys.\n\nAn inflationary currency encourages consumers to spent money, and discourages consumers to hold/save money.\n\nA deflationary currency encourages holding/saving money (money will be worth mlre later over time), while discouraging spending.\n\nWhy is that so? If the same amount of money is worth more later on, people are reluctant to spend it. If that same amount of money is worth less over time, people are encouragend to spend it.\n\nThe market by itself reflects this perfectly. Products are beeing produced the cheapest way possible with the built-in need to be replaced quickly. If people are reluctant to spent money (because of a deflationary currency), products are desired that would have a better longevity. \n\nThis behaviour is supported and encouraged by a deflationary currency. This topic is very logicly and simple, I'm surprised anybody would not understand this simple thing.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence\n\nhttps://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/g202/planned-obsolescence-460210/",1546626788,t1_ed8oqqk,/r/Bitcoin/comments/acc7jf/you_cant_beat_math/ed8qzke/

This is all the result of inflationary money system.\n\nInflation is a hidden tax on all people.

Bitcoin,ed8rh0i,ace3y8,> Lightning Wallet and ~~Ledger Nano S~~ using closed source hardware wallet?\n\nanswer: you are risking your money.,1546627105,t3_ace3y8,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ace3y8/lightning_wallet_and_ledger_nano_s/ed8rh0i/
Bitcoin,ed8zwjq,ace3y8,We're working on it with third parties. No ETA for the time being.,1546632695,t3_ace3y8,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ace3y8/lightning_wallet_and_ledger_nano_s/ed8zwjq/
Bitcoin,ed8zvak,ace3y8,you seem to be confusing openness of the code and openness of a solution. The code being open is just a small part of the problem if the chip isn't.,1546632672,t1_ed8rh0i,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ace3y8/lightning_wallet_and_ledger_nano_s/ed8zvak/
Bitcoin,ed931o9,ace3y8,> The code being open is just a small part of the problem\n\ncode being open is not a problem. it is part of a solution I agree. They need as well to follow open hardware and release the specs.,1546634904,t1_ed8zvak,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ace3y8/lightning_wallet_and_ledger_nano_s/ed931o9/
Bitcoin,ed94ep8,ace3y8,there's no commercial chip that can be fully audited today unfortunately,1546635865,t1_ed931o9,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ace3y8/lightning_wallet_and_ledger_nano_s/ed94ep8/
Bitcoin,ed9ah5r,ace3y8,ledger still doesn't follow best security practices because of the closed source.,1546640301,t1_ed94ep8,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ace3y8/lightning_wallet_and_ledger_nano_s/ed9ah5r/
Bitcoin,ed9jwrj,ace3y8,The best security practices are to be pragmatic and use the best tool for the job given your threat model. If you include physical attackers I don't see any viable open chip option right now.,1546647831,t1_ed9ah5r,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ace3y8/lightning_wallet_and_ledger_nano_s/ed9jwrj/
Bitcoin,edaap8q,ace3y8,"you are trusting ledger not to add a backdoor, without any sort of community audit of the firmware code. I'm not trying to convince you to not use ledger, it is just my money and I won't put it inside a device that I don't know what it's really doing. simple as that.\n\nYou can trust ledger, if you want, to not act maliciously and it's fine. It's your money and do what you want with it and I could not care less what you do. I don't expect perfect security, no one can offer that, but I have some minimal requirements for my purchases and one of them is the device has to be as open as it can be, and ledger doesn't meet those requirements.",1546672890,t1_ed9jwrj,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ace3y8/lightning_wallet_and_ledger_nano_s/edaap8q/
Bitcoin,edaecwy,ace3y8,"I'm building Ledger actually, you can verify all applications yourself and also validate the kernel as a black box. Multiple researchers have done that and reported issues that got fixed, so it seems auditable with the right skillset.\n\nYou won't know what Open Source code is doing either if you can't audit the chip that's running it, which you can't do.",1546678043,t1_edaap8q,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ace3y8/lightning_wallet_and_ledger_nano_s/edaecwy/

Bitcoin,edbzrik,ace3y8,My point again is that reading the code is a small part of verifying what something running on specific hardware does.,1546726614,t1_edaj39w,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ace3y8/lightning_wallet_and_ledger_nano_s/edbzrik/
Bitcoin,eddkfpc,ace3y8,then by your comments I can tell you don't know anything about software. I'm sorry to tell.,1546774483,t1_edbzrik,/r/Bitcoin/comments/ace3y8/lightning_wallet_and_ledger_nano_s/eddkfpc/
