fw00od,bloodywala,Best way to check seed works. Safely and securely.,"Hi

I have never really checked my seed actually restores correctly. I fear that i have mistyped 1 of the 24 words and years down the line my ledger breaks and i can't restore. Is there an app for android or windows where i can import my seed and confirm? I want to do this in the safest and secure way. Looking for advise on the best route here

üì∑

Bexpress Inc is a South Korea-based crypto company currently headquartered in Paranaque. It was registered to the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2016 and they applied for a BSP license in 2017. The company developed a mobile trading system (MTS) which it claims to be more secure, stable, and convenient versus other exchanges that originally operate web-based trading platforms.

Bexpro told BitPinas that it secures its users‚Äô funds through the integration of HSM Wallet, said to be a secure implementation of cryptocurrency wallets. HSM wallet mentions on its website how it secures crypto trading through wallet authentication to reduce the risk of having unauthorized access to private keys. The same features are also implemented in online wallets.

fvwrxc,69676f72,Mining BTC in Containers: malware,"Cybersecurity researchers have identified a persistent and ambitious campaign that targets thousands of Docker servers daily with a Bitcoin (BTC) miner.

In a report published on April 3, Aqua Security issued a threat alert over the attack, which has ostensibly ‚Äúbeen going on for months, with thousands of attempts taking place nearly on a daily basis.‚Äù The researchers warn: 

‚ÄúThese are the highest numbers we‚Äôve seen in some time, far exceeding what we have witnessed to date.‚Äù

Such scope and ambition indicate that the illicit Bitcoin mining campaign is unlikely to be ‚Äúan improvised endeavor,‚Äù as the actors behind it must be relying on significant resources and infrastructure.

Kinsing malware attack volumes, Dec. 2019-March 2020

Using its virus analysis tools, Aqua Security has identified the malware as a Golang-based Linux agent, known as Kinsing. The malware propagates by exploiting misconfigurations in Docker API ports. It runs an Ubuntu container, which downloads Kinsing and then attempts to spread the malware to further containers and hosts. 

The campaign‚Äôs end-goal ‚Äî achieved by first exploiting the open port and then carrying through with a series of evasion tactics ‚Äî is to deploy a crypto miner on the compromised host, the researchers say.

Security teams need to up their game, says Aqua

Aqua‚Äôs study provides detailed insight into the components of the malware campaign, which stands out as a forceful example of what the firm claims is ‚Äúthe growing threat to cloud native environments.‚Äù

Attackers are upping their game to mount ever more sophisticated and ambitious attacks, the researchers note. In response, enterprise security teams need to develop a more robust strategy to mitigate these new risks.

Among their recommendations, Aqua proposes that teams identify all cloud resources and group them in a logical structure, review their authorization and authentication policies, and adjust basic security policies according to a principle of ‚Äúleast privilege.‚Äù

Teams should also investigate logs to locate user actions that register as anomalies, as well as implement cloud security tools to strengthen their strategy. 

Growing awareness

Last month, Singapore-based unicorn startup Acronis published the results of its latest cybersecurity survey. It revealed that 86% of IT professionals are concerned about cryptojacking ‚Äî the industry term for the practice of using a computer‚Äôs processing power to mine for cryptocurrencies without the owner‚Äôs consent or knowledge.",1586170866,2,1

I dont appreciate getting treated like a criminal for trying to help my DYING father out. The man just lost his wife the day after christmas due to cancer and less then a month ago he had another heart attack killing 25% more of his heart. Through this all he has for income is social security at 1,500 a month. I moved up here from LA to help him with his ranch and the animals along with the finances. when I moved here we both got sick with pneumonia and he just got out of the hospital from that. Plus with the corona virus bs my entire county is on lockdown inside there homes so I cant go to work here. So, I sold my car and tried to invest in to monero so I could take advantage of the current volatile currency market (hopefully) and help him pay the mortgage that has already passed on his beautiful house just had just finished building with everything he has worked for AND his wife had worked for. You guys called me and treated up both like criminals for using your service and take our money? Then have an attitude when we are confused why and not helping us one bit, still keeping the money without a further word!!! I am not USING anybodies information, IT IS MY DYING 73 YEAR OLD FATHER FOR GOD SAKES have a friggin heart you monsters. YOU are the criminals we have done nothing wrong except trusting you with our livelihood.  I am going to post this incident all over social media and contact my father lawyer if you dont just HELP ME! How heartless can you be do you really NEED our little bit of money that bad you would do such a thing?

YOU SEE WHY?????? You kept yelling at me and my father asking why like its any of your business  what we do with our money. I can back up any verify EVERYTHING I have said including why I want to invest into monero and how every single day you hold my money you are killing us. Look at a recent chart of monero and even a 3 year old could figure out why I want to invest in it.
Its gone up 45% in 14 days 5% every single day, Im not stupid or a criminal Im just poor and under some odd circumstantial hard times. Please dont make it worse for us then it all has been and is, People will have a field day with this story on social media and boycott your company I can guarantee that much. All this is just beyond me how anybody could be so misunderstanding and cold hearted.

As long as users do not effectively withdraw their coins, they will not even notice that they are simply sitting on fake bitcoins.

How do we know that centralized exchanges are doing this?

Well, the banking system is currently suppressing the gold price in exactly the same way:

The banks are selling cheap, fake paper gold that they cannot delivery physically. The banks desperately need to suppress the price of gold in order to discourage people from fleeing from paper fiat money into gold.

They are obviously executing the same strategy with bitcoin.

As long as users keep storing their fake, paper bitcoins at a centralized exchange, the fiat banking system will be able to suppress the bitcoin price by flooding the market with counterfeit bitcoins.",1586153581,40,1

fvo7rq,69676f72,7 Crypto Firms Targeted by 11 Lawsuits in New York,"Seven crypto companies have been targeted by 11 lawsuits that were filed in a New York federal court on April 3.

The suits were filed by Roche Freedman ‚Äî the same law firm representing the estate of the late Dave Kleiman in the ongoing dispute with self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto, Craig Wright.

Eleven lawsuits target seven crypto companies

The eleven putative class action suits name dozens of parties including cryptocurrency exchanges Binance, KuCoin, BiBox, and BitMEX and parent company HDR Global Trading Limited, and alleged crypto issuers Block.one, Quantstamp, KayDex, Civic, BProtocol, Status, and the Tron Foundation. 

Many of the company‚Äôs principals are named, including several leading figures in the crypto sector such as Changpeng Zhao, Dan Larimer, Vinny Lingham, and Brendan Blumer.

The lawsuit alleges that numerous exchanges have sold unlicensed securities without broker-dealer licensing and engaged in market manipulation. 

The plaintiffs also argue that many token issuers selectively withheld information from investors to ensure that it would not be apparent the tokens comprised securities until well after the token sale.

Several non-US defendants will need to be served via the Hague Convention due to their location outside of the United States. Disruptions to the judicial system resulting from the COVID-19 panic will also have an impact.

fu52lq,financeoptimum,Paul Le Roux,"Paul Le Roux is a fascinating character, whose story entails drugs, gold, arms dealing, North Koreans, Iranians, elite-level encryption, Somali pirates, women...and more women.

Let's get into it...

**Part 1/5 - The Early Years**

Paul Le Roux was born on Christmas Eve, 1972, in Bulawayo, the second-largest city in what was then called‚Äîby the white minority that governed it, at least‚Äî Rhodesia.

In 1980, Robert Mugabe became prime minister of what would now be called Zimbabwe, ending minority white rule in the country.

Four years later, when Le Roux was 12, the family relocated to South Africa.

Not long after the move, in exchange for washing his father‚Äôs car, Le Roux was given his first computer. After that, a relation of Le Roux states that he became ""completely anti-social.‚Äù

When Le Roux was 15 or 16, in the late 1980s, the local police raided the family home and arrested Paul for selling pornography. After that, Le Roux turned even more inward. 

Although he was an excellent student, he despised the idea of learning Afrikaans, which was compulsory in South African schools, describing it as ""a dead language"" that he ""didn't want to learn.""

At 16, he dropped out of high school and decided to follow his interest in computers, taking a local programming course. 

Family lore has it that after he spent one class explaining some technical fact to the teacher, he got a letter saying he no longer needed to attend. He then completed a year‚Äôs worth of material in eight weeks!

Accounts of Le Roux do indicate that he was exceptionally gifted, and people who worked with him described him as a genius.

After returning from a family holiday to Disneyland in the US, 17-year-old Le Roux decided to leave South Africa, and departed for the UK eight months later to work as a programmer.

He then moved from the UK to the US, where he lived in Virginia Beach.

After six months in the US, he followed his then-girlfriend Michelle to Australia in 1995. The couple married and Le Roux acquired Australian citizenship.

Le Roux frequented message boards and enjoyed trolling Australians. A typical post read:

""All of Australia could disappear into the Pacific and the only difference it would make to the World is the Americans would have one less pussy country to protect.""

His posts caused outrage on the board - someone even changed their handle to fuck@you.paul

Le Roux would later declare that his correspondents had fallen for his ploy:

""Australians are east to provoke and your postings (including 2 death threats, numerous flames, and one guy who swears he has my address &amp; phone number) have provided me with hours of amusement.""

Of course, Le Roux did more than just troll Australian message boards in this period...

Le Roux had started building E4M - Encryption for the Masses - in 1997, releasing it at the end of 1998.

**Part 2/5 - The Turning Point**

E4M allowed users to encrypt entire hard drives, and to conceal the existence of encrypted files (such that prying eyes wouldn't even know they were there).

According to Le Roux, the software was written from scratch, with thousands of hours going into its development and testing.

As well as this, in the [Politics section of the E4M website](https://web.archive.org/web/20010408201122/http://e4m.net/pol.html), Le Roux published a sort of Manifesto, describing how ""governments are increasingly relying on electronic data gathering"" and how ""Strong Encryption is the mechanism with which to combat these intrusions, preserve your rights, and guarantee your freedoms into the information age and beyond.""

In the spirit of the open-source software movement in the late 90s, Le Roux released E4M for free and made the code available for other people to improve.

Therefore, with no income from his two years of labor, he was struggling financially. His marriage fell apart violently and the couple got divorced in 1999.

Le Roux first relocated to Hong Kong, then to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. He married a Dutch citizen named Lilian, and they had a child shortly after.

In 2000, in order to monetize E4M, Le Roux launched [SW Professionals](https://web.archive.org/web/20010405063022/http://e4m.net/) in 2000. 

Based in South Africa, the company offered offshore programming, including E4M customization.

One of Le Roux's clients was an Italian telecoms engineer called Wilfried Hafner, who had corresponded with Le Roux for several years about E4M. 

Hafner had founded a company to create a commercial encryption product that would combine some of the elements of E4M with another piece of software, Scramdisk. The new company would be called SecurStar, and its product would be called DriveCrypt.

Hafner hired Le Roux to build DriveCrypt's underlying engine.

At the time, Le Roux was desperate for money - he drove a beat up car and worked out of a Rotterdam apartment small enough that, on the phone, Hafner could often hear a baby crying in the background. 

Hafner on the other hand was living in the South of France, and Le Roux openly coveted the kind of success that he imagined led to such a home. He told Hafner: ""I am ambitious, I want to have all this.""

However, in the middle of the development work for DriveCrypt, Hafner discovered that Le Roux was still working on E4M and had incorporated some of his work for SecurStar into his personal project. As a result, Hafner terminated Le Roux's contract.

By October 2002, SW Professionals was now defunct and Le Roux was openly soliciting for work on the alt.security.scramdisk forum.

It was around this time that Le Roux received some news that ""shattered his whole world.""

In 2002, he travelled to Zimbabwe to retrieve a copy of his birth certificate.

On the trip, his aunt and uncle pulled him aside to tell him the truth, and it was then that Le Roux found out he was adopted. 

Although many family members had known for years, Le Roux‚Äôs parents had elected to keep him in the dark about it.

It was the ""unknown"" part that hurt him the most.

Shortly after, Le Roux appeared on an another set of message boards - he seemed to be launching some kind of moneymaking scheme that required opening a company based in the U.S.

In 2004, a group of anonymous developers did exactly what Hafner had feared: they released a new and powerful, free file-encryption program, called TrueCrypt, built on the code for E4M.

TrueCrypt combined security and convenience, giving users the ability to strongly encrypt files or entire disk drives while continuing to work with those files as they would a regular file on their computer.

Hafner and his SecurStar colleagues suspected that Le Roux was part of the TrueCrypt collective but couldn't prove it.

As we'll explore in Part 5, TrueCrypt is an interesting part of this story...

**Part 3/5 - Money and Power**

After Le Roux's departure from the encryption world, at least under his own name, he entered the Internet-pharmacy business.

What Le Roux did next was combine two of America's favourite past times, popping pills and online shopping, and the results were sensational. He turned over around $300MM in 4 years.

In 2007, Le Roux moved his family to Manila, where he would base his operations. He also had call centres in Israel. This was a brilliant move by Le Roux, as the authorities were not looking at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as hot-spots for a large-scale organised crime operation...

Le Roux was moving serious volume during this time - his operation was once one of FedEx's largest customers. 

A relative of Le Roux pointed to 2008 or 2009 as the point at which Le Roux snapped.

""I think the money got to him. I personally saw $100 million in his office in Makati. Cash, bud. It was fucking ridiculous. It was in wicker baskets lined up on the side of the wall in his office.""

Le Roux's appetite only grew, and not just in the literal sense (he was known as the ""Fat Man"" in the Philippines): he wanted to be a different kind of businessman, a lord of the real underworld, not just the virtual one.

An Israeli associate of Le Roux tells how ""Le Roux wanted to make more money, fast. Le Roux wanted to diversify, to be bigger. The only way to do that was illegal. He was living inside a movie, you could almost say.""

As well as this, Le Roux was notorious for his sexual exploits - he once wrote to his cousin, ""15-20 a week, sometimes 3 per night.""

A former call centre employee tells how Le Roux approached him with an assignment, which at first he thought was collecting women for Le Roux to open a bar. However, that was not the reason, as Le Roux explained:

""I'm going to impregnate them, and build an army of kids.""

Le Roux asked him to make a spreadsheet to track the women: their names, dress size, age, medical checkups. The operation was given top priority by Le Roux, who even sent his emissary to China to try to find women there.

It is rumoured that Le Roux has *at least* 11 children to 7 different women!

Le Roux's businesses expanded into logging, precious metals mining, gold smuggling, land deals, cocaine shipping, and arms dealing. These activities were spread across dozens of shell companies registered all over the world.

Of course, he needed to launder the money. Le Roux used paid muscle in Hong Kong to swap cash for gold bars, and then proceeded to stash the gold in warehouses in Hong Kong (this totalled around $50MM).

Speaking of paid muscle, Le Roux had plenty: ex-soldiers and mercenaries made sure any problems were dealt with force if necessary. 

Le Roux was closest to ex-British soldier Dave Smith, who would act as the leader of the mercenaries and allow Le Roux to insulate himself and not have to deal with people. In fact, Le Roux once told Smith ""I live vicariously through you.""

However, things took a turn for the worse, at least from Dave Smith's perspective, as Smith stole $5MM worth of Gold from Le Roux. 

Le Roux was furious. He then summoned Smith to his place in the country, and asked him to dig a hole as they needed to stash some gold. However, when he arrived, he was greeted by a South African hit-man. After the hit-man had finished shooting Smith, Le Roux then grabbed the gun and fired into Smith's corpse. 

Le Roux then set about building an arms base in Somalia.

To achieve this, Le Roux called upon an ex-soldier from Europe, code-named 'Jack' to work for him on the ground in Somalia.

At sea, Jack had to bribe Somali pirates.

It was actually *this* activity in Somalia that landed Le Roux on the radar of the DEA, as he popped up in a UN Report on security in Somalia.

The DEA were now on his tail. Of course, his encryption skills came in handy - Le Roux's thick layers of encryption meant that the DEA needed someone on the inside...

**Part 4/5 - ""Well played gentlemen, well played""**

Le Roux was getting more and more paranoid about people in his organisation stealing from him. Without justification, he suspected that his self proclaimed 'Golden Boy' Jack was stealing from him - so he ordered a hit on Jack. 

This was a huge mistake on Le Roux's part, as Jack then called a CIA hotline and went on the run. It was 18 months later that a DEA investigating Le Roux found Jack's message to the CIA. The DEA agent then called Jack. Scared for his life, Jack agreed to turn informant. 

In the meantime, Le Roux then had a change of heart and apologised to Jack for ordering the hit on him. The DEA then asked Le Roux to go back to work for Le Roux - they now had someone on the inside. 

To tempt Le Roux, the DEA devised a sting operation. They knew that Le Roux wanted novelty and excitement. So they fabricated the scenario that Jack had made contact with a high profile Colombian trafficker, and the Colombians wanted to bypass the Mexicans for their meth supply in the US.

Le Roux was hooked. However, the DEA needed to lure Le Roux out of Manila, as his network of corrupt officials would ensure he will never be arrested.

Jack needed to get Le Roux to Liberia (where the DEA had a trusted ally in Fombah Sirleaf, Head of Liberia's National Security Agency). 

Jack achieved this by saying that they needed to meet a cartel representative to finalise the deal.

It worked, and Le Roux was arrested. Initially, Le Roux went into passive resistance - he was a big unit (hence the nickname ""Fat Man"") - and it took around 10 agents to get him on the plane to fly back to the US.

Well he settled on the plane, the first thing Le Roux said to the DEA agents was: ""Well played gentlemen, well played.""

He then said: ""If you're looking at me, then clearly you're looking at bigger things...""

The DEA agents were intrigued: ""No Paul, you're the prize - what could possibly be bigger than you?""

Le Roux responded: ""Nation states gentlemen, nation states.""

He then started to spew out extremely valuable information on North Korea and Iran.

Of course, this wasn't the only leverage Le Roux had...

The enforcers who were once on Le Roux's payroll needed to be held accountable for their numerous murders, and the DEA were desperate to get them behind bars. Le Roux was key in their eventual capture. But that's not all: a crucial piece to this story is Part 5...

**Part 5/5 - TrueCrypt**

As we discussed previously, Le Roux was rumoured to be a member of the TrueCrypt collective.

In November 2012, a man with the online handle Cincinnatus decided to throw a party in Hawaii. The idea arose out of an email exchange with Runa Sandvik, a developer and expert on the online software Tor, which allows its users to mask the physical location of their computers on the Internet. 

After she gave a Tor tutorial on Reddit, Cincinnatus sent Sandvik an encrypted message. Cincinnatus told Sandvik that he lived in Hawaii. Sandvik mentioned that she would be there on vacation the following month and could give a talk on Tor. 

Cincinnatus suggested they host a ‚Äúcryptoparty,‚Äù a phenomenon that had arisen around that time among technology- and privacy-conscious activists. The date was set for December 11. 

Unbeknownst to Sandvik, her fellow party planner was hatching a much more elaborate education scheme. Four days after he contacted Sandvik, Cincinnatus sent an email to the journalist Glenn Greenwald. ‚ÄúThe security of people‚Äôs communications is very important to me,‚Äù he wrote. In a series of emails, he suggested that Greenwald set up an encrypted means by which sources could contact him.

Cincinnatus organized the cryptoparty at a hacker space called HiCapacity, located in the back of a furniture store in Honolulu. 

When Sandvik arrived around 6 p.m., Cincinnatus introduced himself as Ed and told her that he worked at the computer-hardware company Dell. 

Ed kicked off the evening by welcoming the attendees, then invited Sandvik to give her presentation on Tor. When she was finished, Ed pulled out his laptop, plugged it into the projector, and began his own instructional talk about TrueCrypt. In Ed‚Äôs presentation, Sandvik later wrote, he ‚Äúpointed out that while the only known name associated with TrueCrypt is someone in the Czech Republic, TrueCrypt is one of the best open-source solutions available.‚Äù

Six months later, in June 2013, Greenwald and filmmaker Laura Poitras published the first of a series of articles that grew out of their contact with Cincinnatus. 

In time they revealed that *his full name was Edward Snowden*, that he had worked in various capacities at the National Security Agency, and that he had downloaded and handed over a trove of documents from the NSA in an effort to blow the whistle on what he believed were egregious privacy encroachments by the U.S. government. 

**Among them was a document revealing that TrueCrypt was one of a small number of encryption programs that had withstood the NSA‚Äôs efforts to crack it.**

**What Snowden and the rest of the world wouldn‚Äôt know for another two years was that Paul Le Roux, the man whose code formed the foundation of True Crypt, was at that very moment in the custody of the U.S. government. Le Roux was in a bind, facing the full force of a U.S. federal prosecution for any number of his extraordinary array of crimes. The only way out was to spill his secrets...**

I am posting this as lately have been following the developments of COVID19 since nearly New Years, and began commenting on r/coronavirus Jan/feb with this account. 

Thesis:

What assets will not experience a flux of supply during the COVID19 Pandemic? 

Hypothesis: 

The digital asset class (in this case BTC) is the only class of investments which fundamentally will not experience fluctuations in supply as more and more labor is restricted by the virus (except for predictive HALVING). 

All other supplies of physical goods (Farmed, Mined, Coded, Sold, Bought, everything) will have a supply short fall ‚Äî even food :( due to the lack of human labor

Result: 

With BTC having a stable supply chain sans gross amount of human labor, I am quite certain that BTC and ALTs are going to a mass quite major gains during this next four months (I am aware it takes people to maintain mining operations - tho the algo will correct difficulty and supply will return on course if one large miner goes down).

ftypqe,bonsaitree33,"Question about ""paytxfee"" config variable for bitcoin.conf","Hello, 

I noticed that there is an option that you can specify in the bitcoin-core application called ""**paytxfee**"" and the example is given as shown below: 

    #Pay a transaction fee every time you send bitcoins.
    #paytxfee=0.000x

I'm trying to find a clear explanation of what the ""x"" is referring to for this value. 

If i were to use the following commands to estimate a fee for confirmation within 10 transactions, i would get the following: 

 

    $ bitcoin-cli estimatesmartfee 10 
    { 
    ""feerate"": 0.00012265,
    ""blocks"": 10
    }

I could then use the command `bitcoin-cli settxfee 0.00012265` and i would then have set my transaction fee to a value of 0.00012265 btc per kb as my fee -- my question is as follows: 

&amp;#x200B;

If i were to set a value of paytxfee=0.05x, what would this mean?  Would that mean it would use 5% of the value already calculated with estimatesmartfee?  Any clarification would be helpful :)

.... sitting on cash with no assets, let's the central banks reduce the value of the dollar by printing more and make each dollar worth 3% less each year. 

Stocks are limited by each company that issues it. 

Gold is a scarce resource that our early human ancestors decided would be good for currency cause it's rare, heavy and hard to steal. 

USA's central bank, The Federal Reserve, lowered interest rate to 0% and will lower them to negative interest rates. They will charge you for holding money in a savings account cause they want people to spend money and stimulate the economy.

fzhgwf,E-renter,Any day you buy Bitcoin you have a 98% chance of seeing lower prices in &lt;1 year: keep your powder dry,"You know the meme that Bitcoin is about to drop because you just bought? It's actually true.

Data: 5 1/2 years of BTC-USD prices from Sept 17, 2014 to present from [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?period1=1410825600&amp;period2=1586563200&amp;interval=1d&amp;filter=history&amp;frequency=1d](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?period1=1410825600&amp;period2=1586563200&amp;interval=1d&amp;filter=history&amp;frequency=1d)

Methods: Took subset of data with at least one year of follow-up (i.e., Sept 17, 2014 to April 9, 2019). Assumed you purchased at the daily close (i.e., between low and high). From each purchase day, searched all days within 1 year following that date for any lows dipping below the purchase price.

Results: 1634/1667 days = 98.0% chance you will see a lower price than you bought for within 1 year. Only 33/1667 days = 2.0% chance your FOMO pays off and you never see a lower price within the next year.

Conclusion: Keep some dry powder to add when the inevitable drop comes.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Even if you assume you managed to always buy at the daily low instead of the close (best case scenario), there is still an 86.7% chance you'll see a lower low some time in the next year.

Edit 2: not sure why this post is unpopular I actually thought it was a pretty cool little analysis. I'm just proving the folly of going all in balls deep on one go. Data suggest pick up a position you would be happy with but don't mortgage your house then if it drops you can pick up a little more. Or just DCA as crypto guide says.",1586635752,10,0

Minimum wage is around 4 USD per MONTH. One BTC is 885,000,000 Bs. from 600,000,000 Bs. last week. AMA.","This week numbers went up, maybe because scarcity of cash money (Bolivares, euros and USD) we are in total  quarantine since three weeks. Banks are closed and ATM only give less than  1 USD per day.

These   volumes are only measured using Localbitcoin (LBTC) using their API   (Coindance). Big part of that exchange come from Venezuelans that live   abroad and send money to their families, miners, people that get paid in   cryptos (freelancing) and even the own government. It has been STEADY around 2000   BTC per month.

Other exchanges and other trades were done, but no way of measure them.

Today exchange rate is around 1 USD = 110,000 Bs. (Official rate is almost the same)

Minimum   wage (which is earned by a big chuck of the population, not like other   countries) is 250,000 Bs. wage (less than 2.5 USD) + 200,000 Bs. food   bonus (less than 2 USD) PER MONTH.

Biggest   bank note is 50,000 Bs. which is around 0.50USD. You need to use  debit  and credit, bank transfer, cryptos and USD to pay anything.

Here   in Venezuela situation is really hard, some people dont believe that   amount is the minimum MONTHLY wage. I work and earn more than that  BUT now because this COVID situation my wage was slashed 50% (anyway, the amount is really low, I'm sure with that amount I would be   living homeless in Colombia, Peru or Panama for example), usually get   some donations from redditors and do some freelancing work (translating   mostly) and it is really hard to keep up daily.

fxnprk,nsahebltd,Is Trezor taking advantage of COVID-19 and Stealing BTC from your wallet too?," 

Okay, so i wanna start off by saying  I've had TREZOR for over 6 months now and only since Monday i started  taking it seriously by storing my Bitcoins in there.

I purchased the device after seeing an ad claiming it was un-hackable and the most secure wallet on earth blah blah blah,

since  purchased i never transferred more than 2000 in and out of my account  but recently i decided to withdraw my funds of around 1.3btc from  BINANCE into my TREZOR wallet.

it  was in there since Monday 6th of April, but when i logged in early hours  of this morning my Bitcoins was gone! and my transactions... i never  updated my Trezor device in order for my previous wallets to just  Disappear like that. The worst part is i recent moved houses and i cant  seem to fine the piece of paper where i input my recovery seed.

i  just want to know if this has ever happened to anyone? why does this  happen and whats the solution? will i get my money back? as im the type  of person who stores all his money on bitcoin and doesn't use banks -  that was literally everything i had left.

I'm sat here praying that this is just a server error of some sort and it will all be by the afternoon.

TREZOR  if your reading this, i hope this wasn't done on purpose, i hope your  not taking advantage of COVID-19 and i hope you can return to me whats  mine as soon as possible. i got a strong feeling BTC is going to fall  fast soon and i don't want to lose any of what i have!

P.S

Below  is a link of the blockchain search of my account, you can see that  address starting with (3Gyk52T) is mine and you can see it says i have  no money in there, which is weird as i transferred a friend $108 to  account ending in  (1MJfxqp1Z) and at the exact same time it says  1.29863517 BTC was transferred to account starting with (31kZXzJA5) i  don't know if that's one of the other accounts on my wallet as i haven't  memorized it yet but i definitely didn't send my full balance to  another wallet - Furthermore the money is still in the wallet...

How would the economy look and which direction would it go if the government/banks did not have the ability to print money? There are reasons to do it apparently and if the government does not have enough reserves in a Bitcoin economy, how would it handle an economic crisis?

I wanted to get the latest details on this. I haven't touched crypto for a while and getting back into it.

I've searched threads but a lot of the question seem to be from 1-2 years ago and I believe some things have changed since then. Initially I was using coinbase/GDAX and Binance.

I wanted to know what are the best, quickest and cheapest ways to fund one's account and avoiding high fees.

I currently have a verified kraken account. I'm having problems getting verified on coinbase.

I've just looked at their options and they have a new Etana Custody way.

Is it better to do a wire transfer or using Etana custody?

Any information on the latest and how people from the UK using GBP are doing it will be helpful. 

I think I read some people transfer to Euro's and then to the exchange etc. At the moment the only methods I know are Kraken and Coinbase. I read people using Fidor but that method isn't available anymore.

Then I lost all the rest leverage trading over many months, which got worse and worse as emotions took over, and a final deathblow with the corona virus crash.

Now I will soon have the chance to buy back all my lost Bitcoin. It will be my last chance. Last of my money.

This time I would strictly HODL Bitcoin. No alts. No trading. Just do what I should've done since 2018. What would have tripled my original investment. Just buy and hold, and, of course, DCA out as the price rises.

Only problem is I won't be able to buy until summer. June or July if I'm lucky.

What does the community here think about this? Will the BTC price remain mostly sideways for 4-5 more months, as it did after previous halvings and previous big crashes?

Or is my FOMO warranted, and we'll see the price go crazy very soon, soon enough to leave me in the dust with empty bags, just before I had a chance to go back in fresh, and do Bitcoin right?

I'm all about being myself and not changing to suit the fashion, however for a no-coiner, the concept of a new form of money to replace the current economic system may come across as an extreme view, slightly crazy, and unattractive.

How do you tackle the subject of economics if it comes up and you simply can't bite your tounge with your more Austrian economic views?

As an example, I was re-reading The Bitcoin Standard (to pass the time during social distancing while staying home), and was asked ""what are you reading?"". Through fear of goin down a rabbit hole, I simply replied ""it's a book on economics and the financial system that we live in"". What would you have said instead?

My other concern is regarding OPSEC. I don't know in these early days of dating this individual how serious it will get. Do I want to share my views on bitcoin only to be asked ""do you have any?"".

When I looked up at the internet,
The price of 1 BTC exactly before 1 month was 5410$ and the price today is 7103$ 
So if we do the math
$7103-$5410= $1693
If you take the buying and selling commission to be at 8%

So when I brought it for $5410 the 4% commission must have been $216 which I would have given...
$5410+$216 (BTC+Commission)= $5626 (The actual money which I spent for buying 1 BTC is $5626)

I'm selling it today for the market price of
$7103
The commission the exchange takes is 4% so the price is $284 
So the money they give me is 
$7103-$284(BTC - Commission)=$6819
So my ultimate profit is 

$6819-$5626= $1193

Again I would like to point out hat most of our current wealth is created by loading up on debts.
And fore those who keep an eye on those debts know we are literally going to da moon right now.

The only problem with debt is the fact that one day in the future those debts have to be paid back, one way or another.

And if that's not bad enough there is this little thing called: at an interest.

And if you have a printing press that future always seems to be far far away.
But if I am looking out there, I just might reason that the future has just arrived.

And going to pay back all those debts, one way or another  is going to be a lot of pain.
To be honest I see no way the current financial system is going to survive this shit.

 But isnt it true that as soon as a miner finds a block that he broadcasts it to other miners aswell so they stop their computation on that block and move on to compute the next block?

Because I am unable to sell my coins through Coinbase, I think I need to transfer them somewhere else before I can sell them.

g59a5r,xerxes7777,I turned $500 in Bitcoin into $80K XRP back in 2017," 

So I bought Ripple when it was .005 and those days Shapeshift had no restrictions, anyone can shift any Crypto without an ID or anything. I bought about $1k in Bitcoin from a Russian guy in downtown Minneapolis and it felt really strange, like first time in my life where I gave a guy a lot of money and he merely sent something digital to some digital wallet of mine. I've known about Bitcoin since it was $32 but never jumped on it back in 2011. But Ripple managed to help me turn some of my Bitcoin into $80k XRP via Gatehub before it started crashing come December of 2017. One of my friends I've managed to turn $400 into $8K when she got into Ripple at the perfect time before the crash. Same with others at a Starbucks, I told them all to get in fast and many listened and got wealthier.

I even launched and ran [Ripplepaperwallet.com](https://ripplepaperwallet.com/) which was making me $500 before Ripple interest went away and the site became dead due to lack of people not interested in not creating XRP paper wallets.

Something was telling me to spend all my Bitcoin on the XRP shapeshift, but I was too arrogant and dumb and didn't listen to my intuition. Had I shape shifted all of my Bitcoin Balance into XRP when it was .005 I would've come out with about $3Million. Can you guys believe that the only time in my whole life where my higher self or intuition gave me good feeling about dumping all of my Bitcoin into Ripple XRP, I never listened? lol I blew my only chance at becoming Millionaire. But what I came out with was still very juicy and I bought car, vacation and downpayment on a house with it.

The news of XRP possibly getting on Coinbase is what skyrocketed it to $4ish XRP price at the peak, and those days were freaking amazing. I still have screenshot of my highest balance in Gatehub and I was shocked looking at it. It was like totally amazing and a Miracle and my greedy self didn't sell all the XRP at the $80k high it catapulted me to, so I started selling during the crash and got out with a decent amount.",1587446431,16,1

https://preview.redd.it/m6utc42eh3u41.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ce0c4aad1437531d6a0e406f6b17c3d8b8403fd

In 2020, more than ten years have passed since the global financial crisis broke out due to the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States. The collapse of the trust mechanism prompted the birth of a brand-new electronic cash system, the blockchain. Ten years have passed, BTC¬†and blockchain technology have gradually attracted widespread attention around the world, so at what stage is the current blockchain?

BTC and ETH have brought **Decentralized Electronic Cash** and **Intelligent Contract**¬†technologies to the blockchain world respectively. Nowadays, the blockchain technology and industry have been recognized and supported by society, and various application scenarios and business needs emerge in endlessly. We found that the existing blockchain technology can no longer meet the growing user demand. Generally speaking, the current blockchain technology is facing many challenges. The root of these problems is the lack of a unified operating system in the industry.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wqwqtvefh3u41.jpg?width=1845&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e04eaf9d0eabf32257e8dcec379ce0bdea03946a

Existing mainstream operating systems, such as Windows and MACOS of computers, Android and IOS of mobile phones. The emergence of the operating system has a great influence on a new revolution. The emergence of the Windows system has directly brought social development into the Internet era. The birth of the mobile phone operating system accelerated the development of the Internet era, allowing global users to enter the mobile Internet era. What is lacking in the development of the current blockchain is an operating system that can unify standards and realize the interconnection of everything.

Although the emergence of ETH¬†Smart Contract has become the development platform of DAPP, its development concept has no features and built-in functions, which makes it very difficult and costly for any team or individual to develop a blockchain project on its public blockchain. It can be said that the operating system of ETH¬†is designed for programmers at more levels, which makes the ETH¬†platform still has no commercial value after several years, and also doomed ETH¬†to be unable to take on the important task of blockchain operating system.

BTC, ETH, EOS, these digital currencies¬†provide early capital and experimental environment for the development of blockchain technology. However, the lack of an operating system is the key to the commercial value of the blockchain, which is difficult to replace once the operating standard is formed. Therefore, all countries and industries are currently focusing on operating systems, but the results are disappointing.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ewq4c0agh3u41.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f8d09786d1234efc150b0705ba3c30d84bbc692

In the blockchain market, the vast majority of projects only consider short-term development, but they make little contribution to the block chain. The projects that are really practical and laid out in the long-term direction can be said to be very few. This is also why society is paying more and more attention to this industry and demanding more and more.

In such a market environment, AK appeared. The first step is to bring the BTC soul mining model, bringing benefits to the original contributors of the block chain and most believers. Only by better rewarding the society can we realize the leap of self-value. Some time ago, AK just finished bit collision. At this stage, it is handing over the whole ecology to the market, which will determine it, including the direction of value. Only a freely competitive market can benefit most people.

As a member of the CXC public blockchain ecosystem, the support of the underlying technology enables AK to have sufficient strength to build a framework and make a unified block chain operating system possible. If it can be successfully realized in recent years, it can be said that this technology will become a breakthrough in the development of the block chain and bring a brand-new imagination to the industry. This is of great significance to the compatibility of an operating system. Only by better solving the compatibility problem can the operating system realize marketization faster, and the value effect will drive the landing of commercial applications and become the core force driving a new round of value revolution.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tzpskt2ih3u41.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1946d6e756d9a9febfde960851072d09df69d7f6

What AK needs to do now is to deal with the break-in between technology and social needs. ¬†From AK's ecological concept, essence and technology, it can be seen that it fully meets the basic requirements for large-scale commercial use of the blockchain.

In the future development, AK will not only do a blockchain operating system but also form a blockchain operating system ecology to lead the industry to realize the transformation from a computing platform to the operating system. ¬†It supports more terminal devices such as mobile phones, computers and the Internet of Things, and the real inter-link of everything, so that the blockchain technology gradually moves from an experimental environment to a commercial scene, demonstrating great social value.

However, to reach this level, operational compatibility is a direction that consumes a lot of research and development time and cost at every turn. Simply put, it is very complicated. Due to the diversity and complexity of social needs, it is difficult to do the best at the beginning. At present, it can only be done step by step.

The discovery and growth of the value of the blockchain operating system is a higher level challenge, or opportunity, for encrypted currencies besides the currency revolution and asset attributes. ¬†For individuals and teams, unified operating standards and compatibility will undoubtedly reduce the research and development costs and time of many projects and promote frictionless and programmable value flow. ¬†For society, the landing of more blockchain commercial applications will make great changes in business processes and operation logic in many industries, and the improvement of efficiency is only the smallest impact.

The success of this step can directly enable the encrypted currency to rely on the blockchain technology to truly change the economic process, the business logic and the underlying structure of social governance, so as to promote the improvement of the economic efficiency of the whole society and the qualitative change of the social governance structure.",1587441658,1,1

So far this month I've made $129 and counting I used to use this site and Swagbucks but eventually realized I could make more by just putting my time into Grindabuck.

Grindabuck is an online rewards club that allows you to earn rewards by completing simple tasks, taking surveys, completing offers, shopping, participating in contests, trying out products, watching videos, and more. They have a good amount of offerwalls and survey routers, including my personal favorite Your-Surveys (Where I make most of my money). The videos are via Hideout TV.

Grindabuck pays out in Grindabucks, their virtual rewards currency, for each activity you complete. Once you accumulate enough Grindabucks you can exchange them in the rewards store for various Gift Cards and Bitcoin. 100 Grindabucks AKA Gabs is worth $1. They will even start you off with your first 100 Grindabucks for creating your account. (Min. $10 cashout) - Once you start to earn on the site and level up the minimum cashout goes to as low as $1

You can redeem your points for Paypal, Amazon, Bitcoin and more! Also on the side of the home page there's a Live chat with other users and mods so if you have any questions somebody will help you.

To my knowledge the site is only available in Germany, the UK, the US, Australia, and Canada. If your not in one of those places you could still give it a shot, I'm genuinely not sure.

Another perk is they have a great bonus system that gives you a bonus at the end of the month and an extra bonus if your in the top 15 on the monthly leader board.

Bitcoin is a great asset for such an experiment because it has fewer fundamentals than the other stocks or derivatives and it relies more on technical analysis than other assets. Nevertheless, it is impacted from time to time by the news and other events in the crypto-world.

&amp;#x200B;

I am working with TF (tensorflow) + Keras and LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) cells to try and predict future prices.

&amp;#x200B;

If I let the network guess freely, from some point onwards, without feeding the price of the tick before, the predictions look like this:

  


[blue- real price \/ red-prediction \(without feeding price at every tick\)](https://preview.redd.it/f2v5cxzslru41.png?width=1270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29d8189a841c98f79a5053389cee29fb4b7e63d2)

If i adjust it at every point in the dataset (feed the price of the tick before), it is needless to say that the graph of predictions is way more precise:

&amp;#x200B;

[blue- real price\/red- prediction \(with feeding the price of the tick before\)](https://preview.redd.it/h0r91d8elru41.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c6605759c6267fb4dd62ee6f14f3d717ec5cb32)

&amp;#x200B;

There are few steps I would like to take to improve this

&amp;#x200B;

Factor in Technical indicator (BB, Ichimoku Cloud, SAR, etc...

Place a factor for fundamental analysis in the dataset (for example, a score for the positivity of the news at that specific tick (0=bad news for btc, 10=great news)\[/li\]

* Collect data from the order books of the largest exchanged and factor in the order book states at every tick
* Unsupervised learning and K-Clustering to find co-relations between bitcoin and other foreign currency (for example, it might be that there's an inverse relationship between bitcoin and the Yuan (generally when Yuan drops, Bitcoin rises). K-Clustering can find such relationships
* Merging all of the above into a trading bot that aims for around 30%-40% return a year

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone pursue such a goal? If yes, would you like to share the accumulated knowledge/ideas? :D

This is a serious project and currently, only me and two of my partners are involved in it, but we could sure use some more man-power. I'd also like to know if someone would like to fund such a venture and get involved.

g783e4,MicheleXT,"[programming] Is transaction history, address balance checking faster on a local full node or it doesn't make much of a difference?","Let's imagine we wanted to check the balance of about 1000 bitcoin addresses using python or wanted to retrieve and process the transaction history of a bunch of bitcoin addresses for forensics purposes, would it be faster to do this using a local full node (running a local full node and then communicating with it using jsonrpc or some other method), or using a remote node service, like some API, or some third party node? or there is no difference at all?

First view would certainly say that running a local full node is probably much faster, but the obvious thing is that the bitcoin ledger is close to 12 years old, it has a size of 250 GB, and the file on the disk is probably fragmented, but there may be a form of index in the ledger, I don't know. 

But which one is faster?

Wanna mine while watching cat videos go ahead!!! Mine while playing counterstrike? You got it!!! It comes with custom hash rates for every application you choose to run using haramecoins mining (more needy applications get higher hash) . And just like the gorilla who inspired it if the coin was to '' pass away '' (reach 0 usd) it would transfer its self to the crypto of your choice!!! It can do this by reading other prices and stocks of other cryptos. Harambe coin is the coin of the future!,1587691466,1,1

g6z0cv,jesusg16,Two ATH possible after Halving of MAY 2020,"Hey, guys, this is my first post here on Reddit. Just like many of you, I have lots of possible theories concerning the next Halving event. I believe we could see an ATH within the next couple of weeks, but it isn't going to be mind-blowing. The next ATH, which could be a game-changer, I believe, will be aligned to previous ATH. This second event will correlate with previous ATH's, which usually take months. The best way to explain this is by looking at BTC's first Halving (late 2012), as you can see, sorry if I don't post the graph since I don't want to get copyright infringement or something or my post getting flagged sorry I am new to posting on Reddit. Anyways as you can notice right after the first Halving, there was a spike.  To my knowledge, I was still a teen and could careless about around the world around me I can't recall a severe event other than the world ending lol we all know that never happened. That could have affected the price to spike up 2-3 months later now, which at the moment in history, set a new ATH. It wasn't until a year later that BTC reached its ATH after the first and before the second Halving. Now let me put this into perspective regarding the first ATH that I feel could happen.  
First and foremost, we have the coronavirus, which is making investors tremble and are looking for alternatives to preserve their capital. The second was the US stimulus check, as we all know many after receiving their cheque, started buying cryptocurrency.  Not long ago, was there a news story in regards to how many Americans were using their stimulus check to buy crypto. The last is the fall of Petrol prices hitting negatives, although the US Government will provide some type of relief coverage. I don't believe the Oil industry will sustain that long depending on if the virus will prolong the situation further. Now the US hasn't finished sending out checks, which could make the remaining Americans invest in the crypto space which is still in the millions if I am not mistaking. The final part is the propaganda that this event is receiving if I am not mistaken is much more than any other halving event previously experienced... In my opinion, this will create a new short term ATH this will generate so much FOMO. But will die out quickly due to the amount of liquidation that the coronavirus will generate, I believe we are long from over this devastating event. and in the coming months will generate the ATL for this cycle.   
The second and real ATH will take place up to 2 years from the halving if it follows the way BTC behaved in previous ATH's. But its really hard to say since this is the first time external events are going to be manipulating BTC's price.    
In conclusion, COVID-19 will either make or break BTC. this is my theory about what will happen in the coming days. I will most likely be wrong as it is impossible to speculate BTC short and long term prices. I love to speculate and share my ideas about possible outcomes. Pretty much to sum it all up, BTC will replicate the first Halving.   
Again this is my theory I would love to hear feedback and other people's theory as it can all form one giant hypothesis of the coming days and the role of BTC in the coming years.    
Please do not take this as investment advice, and take care as the coming days are going to be filled with volatility. Don't rage, don't get overhyped just enjoy the rollarcoaster.. hopefully, some of us will be riding in Lambos while others are following Reddit posts xD lol.",1587690276,1,1

g91rpi,toneblind88,"What should I do with my $5,000?","I have $5,000 my wife has agreed to let me put into bitcoin. 

I have been dollar cost averaging since August 2019 and I‚Äôve been buying about $100 worth every week. (I‚Äôve used certain price drops to scoop up more outside of my DCA schedule.) Long term, I am very bullish on the price of bitcoin and want to secure a decent stack before we start to see re-tests of the all time high and beyond.

No one knows what the market will do post-halving, but I sort of suspect we will see a sell-off drawn out over a couple of months due to inefficient miners being forced to exit the market. If we see another leg down in the stock market (which I am somewhat expecting as well) bitcoin will not be immune to that either as people tend to go to cash in a liquidity event. 

The opposite could play out as well, where the halving draws attention to bitcoin and people decide, ‚Äúwhat the hell, I‚Äôll give it a shot‚Äù and we begin to see new demand introduced in the market. There is also rumblings across the space about institutional investors sniffing around bitcoin and that could prove to be a major catalyst in the next leg up for bitcoin.

I want to deploy my $5k in the best way possible, and am leaning toward buying $1250 now, $1250 right after the halving, $1250 in June, and $1250 in July.

I would also deploy the rest of the funds if I were to see the price fall to $5000 or below.

Fees increasing drastically would cause the same effect, it would make using BTC less attractive and drop its value.

Long term, to keep up with block reward decreasing by 50% every 4 years we need a combination of fiat price increasing, fees increasing, mining productivity increasing. The price can‚Äôt keep doubling every four years indefinitely. Fees can‚Äôt increase much without hurting BTC‚Äôs price. So for difficulty to at least stay constant, we need mining productivity (hashes/electricity and other costs) to keep rising at a very high rate.

Why is it save to use P2PKH? If you stack your private key, doesn't it gets exposed ? And why isn't it possible to stack anything other than the private key ?

The relevant part here is how time is used as currency. I liked the movie and still think back to it years after seeing it.

Mild spoilers possibly. People have a countdown timer to when they drop dead. They can earn time. Most people barely get by getting some time in the last minute. And on opposite end there are time rich. Which speaks to no matter what the currency is, the distribution of it will not be equal. Of course they live rich and gamble with time, and get bored.

The connection here is how I see bitcoin. It's not as valuable as time, but it is an incredibly valuable asset. It does not need a million transactions per second. It is how I store my wealth. In the movie there is a time hardware wallet sitting in a secure location.",1587970807,0,1

g8t7ii,thejestre,Move Paper Wallet To Secure Long-Term Solution,"Hi, I got into Bitcoin mining a long time ago, eventually sold half my coins and kept half on a paper wallet made from a popular online wallet service.  For a few reasons I want to move this to a modern and secure way to store the coins.  

My idea is to make a VM on my Macbook in VMware of macOS and keep it virtually ""air gapped"" by uninstalling the virtual network card and disallowing copy &amp; paste as well as shared folders.  On this VM install the Electrum software as the main wallet and generate a new public and private key pair.  Export the wallet in encrypted form and store on a NAS as well as AWS S3.  Print the mnemonic (12 word backup phrase?  I assume Electrum can help with this?) and store in a safe at home.  Buy a Ledger Nano X or Nano S and hook up to this air-gapped wallet, so this would basically be a second backup, and could be used to spend the coins without the use of the air-gapped VM.  

Then install the Electrum software on my actual Macbook's user-space, import the public key and the private key from the legacy Bitcoin address on the paper wallet (yeah, long-time old paper wallet...) and send all the coins to the air-gapped wallet address, set up as a watch-only address on this Electrum client.  Basically use this to empty all the coins from the old legacy address to the new address generated on the air-gapped computer.  

Does this sound safe/sane?  Am I missing something/is there a better or easier way?  Any experience with the Ledger Nano X/S and is it actually trustworthy?  

I really appreciate feedback on this.  It has been a \_looooong\_ time and the BTC world has changed a \_lot\_.",1587959954,13,1

In late 2021, 90% will have been mined.  
In 2025, 95% will have been mined.  

For there to truly be mass adoption, there needs to a bit more stability to the price, but also for there to be good liquidity, and if almost all bitcoin that will ever exist is already sitting in the hands of people who are predisposed to hold it long term, then there isn't much to go around for day to day usage.  

I appreciate that as something intended to be store-of-value that's not necessarily a massive problem, but I still feel that the fact that nearly all btc is already mined and sitting in storage can be both offputting to new entrants, and also damaging from the point of view of making it even more artificially scarce not because of a general limited supply, but because of people just hoarding the btc. This would in theory prompt higher prices for those few btc still being actively moved between owners, but that leaves huge scope for market to be crashed if someone decides to sell all at once.

&amp;#x200B;

# NOW let's talk about Bitwala.

Bitwala is directed by four managers **J√∂rg von Minckwitz, Jan Goslicki, Dylan McFadyen, Ben Johnson.**

**Three** of them previously operated a company called **All4BTC**, which many of you may remember.

&amp;#x200B;

# ALL4BTC

All4btc was a service that let you buy anything on the web using Bitcoin.

You copy-pasted in All4Btc the link of what you wanted to buy, enter your shipping details, checkout with bitcoin and lastly wait for All4Btc to buy your product and then ship it to you.

**Indeed** during the brief life of the company a **huge number of users** hardly **complained** that they paid for orders, but no items were ever received. 

**Funds recover was impossible** because customer service STOPPED RESPONDING.

Some user may already find some similarity with Bitwala at this point.

I*n the* ***link below*** *you will  find all the* ***users*** *that ""lost"" their funds with* ***All4BTC.***

[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b7s7wao82qqt2ry/AADG7U8\_kaTwwhLwvmpHjGT3a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b7s7wao82qqt2ry/AADG7U8_kaTwwhLwvmpHjGT3a?dl=0)

***After increasing claims,*** *the three of them* ***decided was time for fresh air.*** *They interrupted all the activities with All4BTC and continued with Bitwala GmbH.*

&amp;#x200B;

# Bitwala GmbH

Bitwala is a platform that provides you a German IBAN to deposit EUR and then buy BTC. The BTC wallet is a multi-signature type. What does it mean? *Multi signature means that the user* ***does not have 100% control over his wallet.***

**So how works** [u/Bitwala](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bitwala/) ?

**Forget** about Bitwala, in reality you are dealing with a German bank named **SolarisBank** AG. Your bank account opened with [u/Bitwala](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bitwala/), is under their control. Bitwala, as stated by their costumer agents, cannot influence any decision regarding the freezing of your funds.

# Below my deposition made with the Berlin Polizei.

&gt;"" Giacomo Vico, myself, on the 15.10.2019, registered on Bitwala and made a **first deposit from PayPal**, for two thousand euro. The deposit was credited and everything \*seemed very good.\*  
On the 16.10.2019 other **four thousand and five hundred euro were transferred** from PayPal to Bitwala.  
The same day the **account was blocked.** No warning or explanation.  
Immediately I tried to stop the second deposit, but it was too late. Emailing instantly Bitwala, a support agent named Brianna, told me that they had no responsibility over the bank accounts, and every decision about them was taken by their bank partner, **SolarisBank** AG.  
&gt;  
&gt;*This last part is extremely poor explained on their website.* [*www.bitwala.com*](https://www.bitwala.com/)  
The day after, 17.10.2019, Giacomo Vico **requested a formal explanation** and provided all the documents proving the ownership of the PayPal. \*No answers from Bitwala or SolarisBank.\*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
So, on the 20.10.2019, after a pile of useless and vague emails, Giacomo Vico **decided to call directly SolarisBank.** He could spoke only with a vague operator, named Jerico and was **denied** speaking with a manager. The operator told Giacomo Vico that he could **only address his concerns,** about SolarisBank, **through** emailing with their partner **Bitwala**.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
**However**, in response, [u/Bitwala](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bitwala/) repeated that **they could not solve the dispute** because they had **no control over** the bank account.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
Stunned by so evident subtle manners, Giacomo Vico, on the 28.10.2019, was obliged to call in his lawyer.   
&gt;  
&gt;Again, SolarisBank was called, in order **to solve as gentlemen the dispute,** but again we were denied speaking with a manager.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Therefore, on the 29.10.2019 my lawyer sent an email to SolarisBank formally **requesting the closure of the account** and the remittance of the funds. **Absolutely no answers.** After calling them again they repeated they could not speak with us and we should address our concerns to [u/Bitwala](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bitwala/). ""

# Two days, later my lawyer opened a Legal Claim with the Berlin Polizei, against two managers of Solarisbank.

# ONLY after this, we received an email from SolarisBank asking for an IBAN to remit the funds.

# Bitwala and All4BTC Structure

**Minckwitz, Goslicki and McFadyen** in 2013 funded the *Bits &amp; Coins Consulting UG*. [https://www.dropbox.com/s/pftmh7vdwrcipqe/gruendungsurkunde\_bitcoinsberlin.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pftmh7vdwrcipqe/gruendungsurkunde_bitcoinsberlin.pdf?dl=0)

**All4BTC was a ‚ÄúBits &amp; Coins Consulting UG‚Äù project**, as it is clearly stated here. [https://www.dropbox.com/s/ywd272czj78b7nd/vertrag\_2013\_juli.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ywd272czj78b7nd/vertrag_2013_juli.jpg?dl=0)

One year later, on the 25.09.2014, they also funded an ""anonymous"" company based in Holland, under the name of *Safaru BV.* [https://drimble.nl/bedrijf/hengelo/30629985/safaru-bv.html](https://drimble.nl/bedrijf/hengelo/30629985/safaru-bv.html)

Then in 2015, J√∂rg von Minckwitz and Jan Goslicki founded **Bitwala GmbH.**

Taking a closer look, we see that **J√∂rg von Minckwitz,** **while** being **director of Bitwala,** was the **head manager of All4BTC** until 17.08.2016, when Dylan McFadyen took his place.

Then on the 24.11.2017, Martin Mischke became the head manager of All4BTC *replacing* Dylan McFadyed, which *became Senior Manager in Bitwala GmbH.*

Lastly three years later Bitwala GmbH became the sole manager of Safaru BV. [https://drimble.nl/bedrijf/hengelo/30629985/safaru-bv.html](https://drimble.nl/bedrijf/hengelo/30629985/safaru-bv.html)",1588232395,1,1

As far as I know, they have my bitcoin, gave me a fake withdrawal on my portfolio that has no detailed information, and basically told me that they have it.

So now you owe several hundred million dollars in taxes, but most exchanges have daily or monthly withdrawals limits. (I know there are exceptions to this but lets say for arguments sake you did this on coinbase).

Can the exchange legally prevent you from cashing out the full amount you need for taxes? Can the IRS penalize you? How does this work, and what are you supposed to do?",1588230038,13,1

&amp;#x200B;

So copy / paste :

&amp;#x200B;

* **Raoul Pal, the former hedge fund manager who founded Real Vision, thinks the fallout from the coronavirus will have immense, far-reaching impacts on the global economy.**¬†
* **The duration and severity of the pandemic is something that Pal thinks hasn't yet been accounted for properly.**
* **Pal thinks a further 20% decline in stocks is on the horizon.**
* **For context, in October, Pal called the Federal Reserve cutting rates to zero and the US having negative rates. In late February, Pal said to buy bonds and that the impacts from the coronavirus would be ""meaningful and real.""**¬†
* [**Click here for more BI Prime stories**](https://www.businessinsider.com/prime)**.**

**""The whole world's f---ed.""**

That's what¬†[Raoul Pal](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/raoul-pal), the former hedge-fund manager who founded¬†[Real Vision](https://www.realvision.com/tv/home), said on the ""[Lindzanity](https://lindzanity.libsyn.com/)"" podcast when he initially learned the [coronavirus](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/coronavirus) was uncontrolled and spreading rapidly.¬†

""The moment the spread hit Iran ... and then Italy ‚Äî that all happened over the span of three or four days ‚Äî I was like: 'time to panic before everybody else,'"" he said. ""It's human behavior function. If the Chinese closed every single border and every city, everybody's going to do it.""

To bring you up to speed, Pal retired at 36 after quitting jobs at Goldman Sachs and GLG Partners. He lives comfortably on a 140-person island in the Cayman Islands and spends his days writing [market research](http://www.globalmacroinvestor.com/), which comes with a hefty price tag of $40,000 per year.

""I said: 'Listen, this is the biggest economic event of all of our lifetimes ‚Äî and it's coming'"" he added. ""And that was, in retrospect, the greatest call I've ever had.""

But this isn't the first time Pal's nailed a prescient call. Back [in October](https://www.businessinsider.com/raoul-pal-breaks-down-terrifying-implications-of-negative-us-rates-2019-10), he said the [Federal Reserve](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/federal-reserve) needed to cut interest rates to zero and warned of [negative interest rates in the US](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/short-term-treasury-bill-yields-negative-coronavirus-pandemic-market-turmoil-2020-3-1029032092), both of which have materialized.

What's more, as the market was topping out [in late February](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-coronavirus-could-cause-major-selloff-raoul-pal-2020-2), Pal expressed his affinity for owning bonds ‚Äî a trade that would've immensely rewarded investors who took his advice. He also warned that the implications from the coronavirus would be ""meaningful and real.""

That was before things really started to fall apart.

Today, Pal thinks the coronavirus will cause ""the largest insolvency event in all history."" And given his track record as of late, that's not reassuring.

""I think the balance of probabilities are that this is a much longer event ‚Äî in terms of economic impacts ‚Äî than anybody is pricing in,"" he said. ""I think it's a huge societal change that's coming from all of this.""

To Pal, the duration of the fallout stemming from the coronavirus is the key factor here ‚Äî one that he thinks investors aren't paying enough attention to. In his mind, those who are a projecting sharp V-shaped recovery in the third and forth quarter are incorrect in their assumptions.¬†

""Isolation is going to be a real event for a significant period of time,"" he said. ""You've got a world that's going to be much more closed, and that's leading to complications in supply chains.""

He added: ""It makes people become more local.""

Pal's prognostication echos that of billionaire ""bond king"" [Jeffrey Gundlach](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/jeffrey-gundlach). In a [DoubleLine webcast](https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1296855&amp;tp_key=6eb12e188d) earlier this week, Gundlach said ""we're going to be getting much more, less-connected to globalization"" and ""we're going to be bringing manufacturing back and thinking about things in very different ways.""

But the changes that Pal and Gundlach highlight don't happen overnight, which is why Pal thinks the fallout could worsen. Every day that the pandemic drags on is one less day without production and consumption. Then that, in turn, heightens bankruptcy risk.

With all of that under consideration, here's how Pal is positioning his portfolio to weather a deeper equity rout. Ideally, he'd like to get to the allocation below.

&amp;#x200B;

* **25% Bitcoin**
* **25% gold**
* **25% cash**
* **25% trading opportunities**

""So I'm now in the point of thinking we've got another 20% downside or so to come before we get the 3-, 4-month bounce of hope,"" he said. ""For the average guy, this is a very, very, very difficult world we're going to go into ‚Äî and I can't sugarcoat it because there is no nice answer.""",1586020592,58,4

Thinking everything would just sync on over because i usually just use the passcode and fingerprint scanner to log into the app to access my wallet but  come to find out I open up the app and its asking for my seed. Which I dont fuckin have because it wasnt saved where I thought it was and wasnt written down. So now there just $500 sitting around that I dont have access to.

The lightning network has been growing, but is far from ready for mainstream adoption, and the growth stagnated a bit during 2020. And the lightning network is of course a crucial aspect for Bitcoin being an effective medium of exchange, and not just a store of value. 

In the case Lightning fails or cant scale, what do you see as the main benefits of Bitcoin over tokenized gold? And what as disadvantages?

The virus is demonstrating the value of alternative and redundant-backup systems for critical infrastructure, such as storing and moving value.

It further supports adoption of many non-currency uses of blockchain technology, such helping people navigate fake news, food supply chain tracking, e-voting, etc.

fulzsh,sudoming,"For cryptos / dApps to work, we need to lose trust in our governments","Disclaimer: I've been trying desperately hard to figure out a usecase for trustless. Am a new researcher to this area.

My main reasoning for basing on government is

1. if you don't trust a company, you can simply switch to another company. Also they are enforced by rules and government. If they break rules, they will get arrested.
2. Only governments have the ability to flout the law, because in essence they are the law. So the only other way for citizens to fight back is turn to one thing that the law / government has no control over, a trustless decentralised thing. (blockchain, ether etc...)

If the above 2 arguments is true, then all major applications for blockchain need to be done in countries where citizens don't trust their government and something the government would naturally want to censor.

Perhaps reason why cryptos like Cardano are looking to Africa for their future. People want a secure future and they don't trust their government.

But one thing i can not find any information  about online is how btc holders liquified their coins during the all time high, especially near the end of the event, around december 2019, when number of ask orders far greater then the bid orders. 

Did they lower the offer at 1-2 or even 3% than the lowest ask order or they just swapt it for other coins. If the later, they surely must know that when bitcoin crashed, the other would follow too due to the correlation in the up trend price couple of months before that. The last strategy I think was swaping to a stable coin like USDT. So can any BTC veteran englighten me in which tatics most of them use during this time?

fvk2rt,peanutbuttercunt,The Problem With Bitcoin,"I‚Äôve been one of the fortunate ones who knew about bitcoin early. I didn‚Äôt understand it and was too ignorant to try and so I‚Äôm sitting here today finally contemplating my first purchase of likely 10BTC.

In doing my due diligence I‚Äôve come across what I see as Bitcoin‚Äôs potential downfall. I want to run my thoughts by you guys, particularly the ones who actually understand the concept of what Bitcoin is and the potential future of it. This might be the wrong sub for that so if there is a more thoughtful sub that might provide me with a more engaging conversation on this topic please let me know.

From what I‚Äôve been learning Bitcoin is not a replacement for currency. It is a replacement for gold. Gold is seen as a store of value. It‚Äôs value is derived from its rarity and difficulty to mine. Upon it currencies are tied and given value.

Not long ago in America we had a gold backed currency. The dollar‚Äôs value was directly correlated to the price of gold. This created a problem. Gold and other hard assets are very hard to trade (illiquid). What happened regularly in the 1800s and early 1900s is volatile spikes due to hoarding and subsequent mass selling of gold. Bitcoin solves this problem. It allows for more liquid markets and in theory enables functional economies (currencies) backed by an ever deflationary decentralized asset. That is revolutionary. 

One of the main concerns to my potential investment is that this is extremely disruptive. Right now you and I are dependent on Fiat. You might argue not but any market place transactions utilizing btc are not being made for the purpose of holding bitcoin 50years from now. It is for the purpose of watching their fiat value increase. All the hodlers in here only reference btc value in dollars. You are slaves to fiat. It makes you feel warm at night knowing your net worth is a little more than yesterday in terms of fiat. So if world leaders ban bitcoin transactions and you no longer can sustain yourself on the transactions of crypto for fear of jail time. What happens to the value? I‚Äôm aware it will still exist. I‚Äôm aware it will outlast any laws regarding it. Long term I think it will survive this main problem but it makes me think this is more of a trading opportunity than an investment right now.

The second and more threatening issue comes from the basis of transactions. This is where I really want your input because I May be misguided here. From my understanding transactions take place via processes solved via electricity (mining). Every certain number of blocks (still cloudy on exact details of this process) the mining capability is halved. We are soon approaching that point as it occurs every 4 years roughly. This will put a lot of smaller miners out of the mining game as they will not be able to justify the cost of electricity for crypto mined (again slaves to fiat). Overtime This is going to essentially monopolize the mining industry. Only bigger and bigger fish will be able to justify being in this game of essentially processing transactions (mining)(again please inform me if my understanding of this concept is wrong). The bad thing about this is they will be able to hold transactions hostage for a better rate of return. Maybe they‚Äôll be nice but if history has shown us anything power will corrupt and we will eventually fall victim to another cycle of corruption with a new face. Right now it‚Äôs banks. In the future it is Miners. If this were to happen it would make bitcoin no different than gold. The only way to trade it reliably would be physical transaction.

Either way, those two problems, the second especially is a ways out. I‚Äôm likely going to go through with buying BTC but it will be to trade most of it rather than hold my savings in a highly disruptive digital currency that is essentially fiat backed by reliance on the electric grid. 

TLDR; the biggest hurdle for btc is to have it 100% backed by a renewable electricity grid that has decentralized control. Then we can start talking about how it‚Äôs a separate currency with standalone value.",1586116347,20,4

fvjebz,PuzzledTea0,Creating a business to survive the next Great Depression,"So, as we etch further and further into the history books it's pretty obvious at this point that we are in for quite the show. I have some questions for you guys and I was hoping for some input.   


First, a little bit about myself:

3 weeks ago I was laid off from a popular sports bar I've been working at for the better part of 3 years. I have been quietly investing in cryptos since 2015 but I certainly don't have near as much as I could have. Mostly because when I first got into it I was scammed out of my money and suffered a hack which saw a lot of my cryptos stolen. 

But I haven't lost hope in the technology and as time draws on, it's obvious to me that a lot of people are going to turn to cryptos during this crisis. At least, I'm certain a lot of people will. 

My dad, a close friend of mine and I all do webdesign, graphic design, photography, logo animations, videography, etc. and we were in the midst of building this business until the inevitable happened 3 weeks ago. 

Going forward we want to be able to offer these services, especially to the crypto community. I'm almost considering solely accepting cryptos as a form of payment because we all know what's going to happen to fiat. I'd figured there's going to be a lot of new entrepenuaers entering the digital landscape looking to market their talents whose businesses will need an identity. Of course, this is all speculation. Everything is happening so suddenly and so rapidly that it's hard to guess where the pin is going to drop. 

I just don't know if it's already too late and we're screwed or if this is a viable option to hold us down while we weather this storm. 

I'm open to all ideas. We're just trying to survive what's surely going to be a very looooong next few years. If you guys have any other suggestions please let me know in the comments below. 

Very much appreciated guys. I hope you're all staying safe and taking care of each other. These are some scary times indeed.",1586113999,5,1

fv8v6s,theg33k3r,Is it possible to change the iOS default Bitcoin app when scanning a QR code?,"Hi all, 

So here's the scenario. Using the default iOS QR scanner, the BRD app opens when I scan a payment address from a qr code that starts with the ""bitcoin:"" label. This seems to be the default in my specific case, but your mileage may vary. I used to use BRD, but moved onto other wallets that I've liked better. This is likely a limitation with iOS, but wondering if anyone's had any luck with changing the default other than deleting applications and leaving the one you want, and then re-adding the old ones. I may end up doing that anyway, but if someone's had luck, I'd be interested in knowing.

Based on my research, iOS doesn't allow you to change default applications, such as in Mac OS, Windows, or Linux. 

You may say that I can just open the application I want and scan from there, and I'd agree that this is a workaround. However, swiping down on the screen without the need to unlock the phone makes for a quicker experience.

Any experience with that?

You must have exceptional academic qualifications from one of the world‚Äôs best universities or have done something that demonstrates equivalent (or greater) talents and skills. 

You should have the following:

* PhD or MSc in a quantitative field (mathematics, physics, engineering, etc.)
* Experience of using analytical languages: Python, R, SQL, etc.
* Extensive knowledge of financial products and markets

A proven track record of extreme failures, whether there are academic, professional or/ and personal, is a plus. 

Your peers recognize you as someone creative. Constant flow of crazy/ sci-fi ideas are a must. If you think that we live in a computer simulation (as suggested by Nick Bostrom in 2003), we are definitely interested in talking to you.

Eventually, not only you must understand the underlying tech of our ecosystem but also believe in its value proposition. You understand and have a practical experience of DeFi tools. 

Ideally, you have already:

* Made a trade on DyDx
* Used Dharma 
* Traded on BitMex 
* Visited IDEX, StellarX, Bitshares and other DEXes
* Heard about TokenSet and Alameda Research
* Read everything you could about the Flash Loan Attack
* Had an opinion about Roger Ver

ft156g,SHIMINA14,Were you affected by the Elon Musk coin giveaway scam?,"Hi guys, 

I was a victim of a scam last year where I ended up transferring 0.05046974 BTC and 0.504 ETH into an account linked from a website that was linked from Elon Musks Twitter account (after the fact I discovered that the Twitter account was fake even though it looked legit as Elon Musks account, same pic, blue tick etc.) 
The scam was giving away 20BTC and 500 ETH, if you sent an amount over to ""his"" account you would recieve double back until the funds were all gone or until the timer ran out. Something like that anyway, the countdown was due to end shortly and so not wishing to miss out I rushed to send over some funds.
It was with hindsight a very foolish thing for me to do, however the good folks over at Coinfirm have opened a case to help reclaim my scammed crypto. 
They are currently looking into it and I'm hopeful of getting those funds returned to me. 
The point of me posting this was to say, if you were affected by the same scam last year on or around the 6th July 2019 then do get in touch with coinfirm to open your own case.",1585752532,19,1

fsyvuh,Latbet24,5G Technology &amp; Corona Virus,"This might be way off topic but I think everyone needs to know that what we think of as ""Corona Virus"" might really be the affects of radiation on the our bodies.  I just listened to a scientist's theory that the radiation is what is really causing our cells to get sick and excrete the sickness into our bodies.  There is so much that doesn't fit their ""bat"" theory and i particularly hate the USA pinning the virus on China.

Now someone has come out with a theory that does fit because it doesn't just kill old people.  It seems to be spreading at an alarming rate.  Wuhan China was the first place to activate their 5G grid.  Other countries like Italy and Spain followed and have suffered the consequences.  Russia has not introduced 5G for public use and consequently are seeing a lot fewer cases.  

What he doesn't say but i concluded is after activating their grid and noticing that people were getting sick in 14 days they tried to dial back the intensity and now people are getting sick in 30 days instead.

Just as quickly as it came on, it will disappear because the authorities know exactly what is making people sick and exactly how to stop it.   All of this is an elaborate scheme to cause massive economic devastation leaving many dead and others barely clinging to life.  Someone really needs to research this.

Finally, to put a bitcoin spin on things,with a clear answer to the world health crisis, I believe this is going to translate into a massive rally for crypto in general even as the world markets and the dollar collapse.",1585744286,7,1

* Said `""NestedWallet""` address would have to be able to send and receive transactions just like any other address.
* It could also generate keys for new addresses, functioning like any other wallet.

The periods I'm looking at are circled in blue. The first one was when the price was trying break $6,700 resistance (red line) over the period of about 4 days.  There was a brief spike then a long table mountain just below the resistance. When it was rejected it dropped, then dropped again before slowly moving back up, breaking resistance with a spike, then doing the same thing on the $7500 resistance for about 4 days. couldn't break through, it's since dropped.  Is there historical data or anything to suggest this could be a repeating pattern and we're expecting another drop before slowing rallying again to the next resistance?

Does forex trade on weekends?

The forex market closes on Friday night at 10pm (UK time) and does not open again until 9pm (UK time) on Sunday evening. However, because the market is only closed to retail traders (not central banks and related organisations), forex trading actually does take place over the weekend. This means that there can be a difference in price between Friday close and Sunday open ‚Äì known as a gap.

Traders need to be highly aware of the weekend forex trading hours and alter their positions accordingly. If you do not want to expose your position to the risk of gapping, you may want to consider closing your position on Friday evening or¬†placing stops¬†and¬†limits¬†to manage this risk.",1586619489,1,0

fz6fa7,emolmos,"History of ""in bitcoin I trust"", from the quarantine","-I remember the first time a chess program started playing better than me. That I trusted it's reasoning better than mine.

-I remember the first time that some sort of database in Excel in a i386 was better at filtering and sorting data than on paper.
I remember the moment I started throwing away paper because I trusted databases.

- I remember the first time that I started trusting wikipedia instead of the information that people told me in discussions about movies.

- I remember the first time that I started trusting imdb valuations instead of valuations (like, dislike) people told me in discussions about movies.

- I remember the first time I started trusting each social media (whatsup, facebook, instagram, reddit, twitter, linkedin, etc) with my photos, ideas, etc.

- I remember the first time I started trusting google ""as I type"" suggestions.

- I remember the first time I started trusting GPS (navigation systems).

- I remember the first time a neuronal network (Google Deepmind) beat stockfish (now Leela, opensource, is doing the same).

- I remember the first time I trusted an ATM to give me money.

- I remember the first time I trusted Homebanking to manage my money.

- I remember the first time I trusted webpages with my credit cards.

- I remember the first time that I trusted websites with my mail.

- I remember the first time that I trusted websites with my cell phone number.

- And of course, I remember the first time I trusted a pendrive or ledger with complete (no human failsafe there if things go very wrong) access to money.

It's a strange feeling, trusting machines.
The first time it feels really unnatural and ""suicide"". But then it works, and then it keeps working.
Most of the time, it keeps improving, and keeps working better and better.
Of course, it's pretty dangerous, because in most cases, there isn't the human person to turn if things go wrong.

As things move faster, and faster, my guess is that people that trust machines (and do it well!!!) will not only earn money, but improve their lives.
And people who don't, will be left behind.

But it will keep feeling unnatural, because it's not us, they're machines. And it will be more and more unnatural.

Yeah, behind bitcoin, databases, stockfish, imdb, homebanking, etc there are developers, designers, testers, people.
But when they are working, when bitcoin processes a transaction or stockfish evaluates a position, or google gives a suggestion, there isn't people involved.
And they keep throwing people, or what people do, out of the ecuation.
And they keep getting better and better.
Faster, nicer, more resilient, more accurate, more accesible, etc.
And I keep seeing people arguing, fighting, scamming (as humans have done for millenia).

fyvm0g,nowitsalllgone,"Anonymous, trust-minimized, no-KYC lending in bitcoin: A Proposal (no implementation yet)","Suppose a borrower wants to put up 1 bitcoin as collateral in order to get $300 USDT now. Within the next month, he may pay $330 USDT to the lender to get his collateral back, otherwise the lender gets it. The borrower wants to do this anonymously, with minimal trust, and no KYC. My thesis is that htlcs can enable a trust-minimized lending contract which meets these conditions.

Our borrower can make an agreement with an anonymous lender along the following lines: the borrower will put 1 bitcoin in a 2-of-2 htlc. This htlc allows the borrower to spend the coin to one of his own addresses after a timelock expires. However, there is an alternate spending condition: before the timelock runs out, the lender may spend the coin using the hash preimage, if he learns it, plus his own key. The borrower, however, does not create this htlc unless the lender provides him with three pieces of data (A), (B), and (C).

(A) is also a 2-of-2 htlc containing $300 USDT. This htlc must be locked to the same hash as the collateral htlc and allow the lender to unilaterally recover $300 USDT when the timelock runs out. However, before the timelock runs out, the borrower must be able to spend the $300 USDT using his preimage plus his key. That way, to transfer the stablecoins is to transfer the collateral, a.k.a. an atomic swap.

(B) is a lender-signed psbt which, if the borrower cosigns, locks the collateral in a third htlc whose preimage is only known to the lender. This third htlc allows the lender to take the collateral when the timelock expires, or it can be spent by the borrower if he learns the preimage.

(C) is a message signed by a non-custodial, information-only escrow agent. The escrow agent never custodies any funds, so he does not need to do any KYC, though he may demand a service fee. The message he signs confirms that he has received some data from the lender which the escrow agent has verified is the data the borrower needs in order to unlock his collateral. This message must also state that the escrow agent will reveal the preimage to the borrower if and only if, within thirty days, the borrower posts a public proof of payment that he has sent $333 USDT to the lender.

If/when the borrower is ready to send the $333 USDT, he must put it in an htlc which the lender can only spend if he or the escrow agent provides the preimage that the borrower needs in order to recover his collateral. If the lender fails to provide the preimage, the escrow agent can publish it on the blockchain. If the escrow agent colludes with the lender and withholds the preimage, the borrower can prove the maliciousness of the escrow agent by publicizing his proof of payment and the terms of the contract. If the escrow agent colludes with the borrower and gives him the preimage without waiting for him to pay the lender, the lender can prove the maliciousness of the escrow agent by publicizing the terms of the contract and pointing out that the borrower never posted a public proof of payment.

By these mechanisms, I belive that non-custodial, trust-minimized, no-KYC lending can be implemented as a second layer on bitcoin. Am I missing anything?",1586575841,4,1

Quantitive Easing does not sound like mass amounts of money being created out of thin air and rapidly decreasing the value of the existing money supply so most people probably couldn't tell you what it is.  Bitcoin Halving does not sound like a reduction in the amount of Bitcoin being created which historically has led to huge increases in the value of the existing Bitcoin supply, so most people couldn't tell you what it is.  I like the term Bitcoin Tightening.  Bitcoin Tightening would refer to the effects created by the Bitcoin Halving as the quantity of Bitcoins paid to miners is cut in half and the new Bitcoin supply tightens.  

Maybe I'm overthinking this, but it sounds pretty good to say Bitcoin's Tight.",1586571482,3,1

From what I gathered. Anyway to the point. He claimed that a very big change is coming and quickly and the current events add up. His claim is that a new technological advancement is coming which I imagine goes hand in hand with 5G. Will change not only the economy as we know it(shit) but the world as we know it. And bitcoin will become the currency. Causing... to put it very mildly, this particular crypto into some impressive numbers astronomical actually. I just wanted to get some insight on this.

One BTC is 600,000,000 Bs. (Bolivares). AMA. Worldwide crisis.","We are still going strong during this worldwide crisis. we are in total quarantine since two weeks. banks are closed and ATM only give less than 1 USD per day, so bolivares in CASH is a no go.

These  volumes are only measured using Localbitcoin (LBTC) using their API  (Coindance). Big part of that exchange come from Venezuelans that live  abroad and send money to their families, miners, people that get paid in  cryptos (freelancing) and even the own government. It is around 2000  BTC per month.

Other exchanges and other trades were done, but no way of measure them.

Today exchange rate is around 1 USD = 90,000 Bs. (Official rate is almost the same)

Minimum  wage (which is earned by a big chuck of the population, not like other  countries) is 250,000 Bs. wage (less than 3 USD) + 200,000 Bs. food  bonus (around 2 USD) PER MONTH.

Biggest  bank note is 50,000 Bs. which is around 0.60 USD. You need to use debit  and credit, bank transfer, cryptos and USD to pay anything.

Here  in Venezuela situation is really hard, some people dont believe that  amount is the minimum MONTHLY wage. I work and earn more than that  (anyway, the amount is really low, I'm sure with that amount I would be  living homeless in Colombia, Peru or Panama for example), usually get  some donations from redditors and do some freelancing work (translating  mostly) and it is really hard to keep up daily.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a  programmer / entrepreneur.

I am and I was attracted to the crypto area and blockchain technology since 2013.

Bitflyer is a product that I and my colleagues are using for a while. 

&amp;#x200B;

**On Bitflyer:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Buy crypto with EUR
* &amp;#x200B;
* Exchange crypto
* &amp;#x200B;
* Issue vouchers with crypto for friends

&amp;#x200B;

The best bit about bitflyer;

I think if you're a programmer, you'll understand that speed is everything. Most crypto exchanges are super slow, but bitflyer is by far the fastest I have used. Trades are excecuted instantly, and I can get the crypto I want instantly too.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a programmer and I am happy to now promote a fresh crypto-exchange, with sound security, user friendly and inclined towards the social area.

&amp;#x200B;

I invite you to [https://oatliveedge.com/](https://oatliveedge.com/) \- I have provided the link without any referral link so I'm not making anything of this. They have finally opened up and allowed registration for free for today.

In Vietnam, there are 116 cases of infection, 17 have been cured and amazingly, there have been no unfortunate deaths. It can be said that we have been controlling the epidemic very well. However, behind that, it is impossible not to mention the efforts of hundreds, thousands, even millions of people silently fighting against the enemy during the peace period. Those are the hard-working doctors day and night on the frontline, the devotion of Uncle Ho's soldiers when isolating more than 20,000 people, the police and medical forces ... weaving around the neighborhoods. residing all over the country, looking for people at high risk to carry out isolation and social safety.

Responding to the call of other countries, each of us can join hands to contribute more resources to Vietnam firmly against the epidemic. Meaningful jobs are not determined by age, income, qualifications or status, but all come from the heart. The most difficult and thorny times are the occasion for each of us to show the national spirit, the solidarity ""corresponding in unison, in harmony with the spirit of the air"".

In that spirit, on March 21, 2020, Nocoro participated in the response, becoming a fund raising organization for the prevention and control of Covid-19. Now, you can contribute to and help fund the world to quickly and easily fight the disease through the Community.

3. Fiat, goverments will lose power but not dissapear.
4. People hoard and don't spend ""good"" money. Bad money displaces good money. Fiat will be used for most transactions (except for killer app).
5. Killer app will mean that bitcoin will displace fiat for an increasing number of operations, but the pace of change will be slow.
6. Family income and savings will begin to be very dynamic. Investing will begin to dominate other incomes and savings (displacing work and services).
7. Speculation will get worse, a lot worse.

fyjfk2,dsgfOG,A few questions I would like to get answers to,"Hello, I will try to keep this as short as possible.

I am from Europe, Latvia. I have bought bitcoin in 2017 when it was much easier to buy it. I used coinbase and all I had to do was just to send them money via credit card. No ID required, no Address asked, just register and start investing. 

Nowadays things aren't this easy.

I wanted to buy deposit money on Kraken, just before bitcoin dropped to \~4,500 euros. The deposit was canceled because Kraken doesn't have a license in Latvia. I went to coinbase pro, tried to create an account there, but I had a lot of problems. I haven't got past my address confirmation. It might sound a bit silly, but I sent them my rent invoice, yes I had my name there and all the things that are needed, but they declined it. I contacted my bank to get my bank statement with my address as well and they declined it. Contacted their support and was disappointed that there is no live chat. Support answered me with some dumb automatic responses like ""Have you written info in the correct boxes"" etc. It even didn't have anything to do with my case. I have tried contacting support a lot of times and they couldn't help me. So I have dropped coinbase pro out of my list of exchange websites. I don't want to trust my money to Coinbase pro if it is so hard to contact them. 

I really liked Kraken, because I have got used to them and their support was really friendly and it is easy to contact them. Kraken is the website I would like to use, but they don't have a license. 

I checked Coinmama and it looks alright, but I don't know anything about them. I will do my research if I will use them, but maybe you could share your experience with them. 

**Here are the questions**

\- Kraken offers Etana Custody. I could use that to deposit euro to Kraken and exchange euro to bitcoin via Kraken. I am concerned that I will not be able to exchange back from bitcoin to euro via Kraken. Even if I can exchange bitcoin back to the euro, will I be able to transfer my money back to the bank if they are not licensed in Latvia?

\- In Kraken, at the moment bitcoin costs 6,240 euros, in Coinmama bitcoin costs 6,600 euros. Why is there such a difference? What makes the difference? 

\- I feel like all this crypto exchange to euro is too complicated. If I wanted to day trade, how could I do it? Are there any websites dedicated to bitcoin day trading? My intention is to buy bitcoin when it is at its low and to sell when it is at its high. 

\- What sites are you using to trade bitcoin? 

\- Maybe there are some mistakes I am already doing?

Thank you in advance!",1586537147,5,1

fyg3zo,slvbtc,Don't underestimate bitcoins potential during the coming economic collapse.,"Many people expect to see gold rise to $20,000 per ounce if there is another deep financial crisis and currency crisis, roughly a 10x gain. Taking gold from a market cap of $10 trillion to $100 trillion. This is a reasonable expectation given the extent of QE and monetary base expansion.

The same people expect silver to perform even better due to its illiquidity even though it was demonetized as a monetary metal many decades ago. They expect silver to see a 30x gain.

What if we apply this same logic to bitcoin...

What if just 1% of the money that is going to flow into gold flows instead into bitcoin? If gold were to add $90 trillion to its market cap 1% of that would be $900 billion.

Adding $900 billion to bitcoins market cap would 10x bitcoins value from here making bitcoin a trillion dollar asset with a value per btc of roughly $100,000.

In other words, each single percentage of golds future market cap that ends up in bitcoin instead of gold adds roughly $100,000 to the bitcoin price.

Now what happens when we factor in two other components. 

1) Gold doesn't have a halving, bitcoin does. If anything the new supply of gold will increase as its price rises while bitcoins new supply will be cut in half.

2) What happens when banks start failing and ATMs and bank cards stop working at the checkout. Will you want a shiny yellow rock or will you want access to the worlds most secure and resilient payment network accessible only by owning the worlds soundest form of digital money.",1586526440,52,1

They dont need to think about security part that much. I dont think we will be able to expect them to write down the 24 word recovery seed.

I think that most people will store their Bitcoin in an exchange or something similar. People dont want to feel that their wealth is stored securely. They want to be able to sleep at night without thinking about losing their hardware wallet or recovery seed.

fy7b42,btcsolutionsca,Thanks for the taxes. We don't give a fuck about your business,"This is an all-too-familiar sentiment from government to Canada's startup (specifically bitcoin-startup) community.

On March 27th, 2020 the Prime Minister proudly announced a $40,000 government backed loan.

""For small businesses, there's a $40,000 loan of which $10,000 will not have to be repaid if they meet certain conditions. There are many things we're doing out there with low interest or no interest loans to help businesses get through this, but the wage subsidy and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for people who lose their jobs are going to be there to make sure that we come through this strongly."" ref

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau holds a news conference while in self-isolation at Rideau Cottage in Ottawa Friday, March 13, 2020. (Fred Chartrand/The Canadian Press)

I, like many small business owners, let out a sigh of relief as we have all seen revenues vanish over the previous weeks following the necessary public health measures put into place. That $40,000 meant one more payroll run. Maybe it made up for the payables or rent that was coming due in 4 days. A $40,000 injection of ""worry-about-it-later"" money would mean breathing room. The equivalent of a pool noodle while wading in the middle of the ocean. Enough to keep you thinking ""you can do this"".

Banking is hard to come by as a bitcoin/fintech startup. We are not ""welcomed into the traditional banking atmosphere with open arms"" regardless of our balance sheets or longevity. Even the bank for Alberta's Entrepreneurs (which promotes their ""blockchain friendliness"") refuses to work with businesses that touch cryptocurrency.

Hi Adam‚Ää-‚Äähope all is well. What is wrong with the markets and BTC as a safe haven¬†? You did mention a few months ago that we will see sub $6k soon and I wasn't sure how¬†‚Ä¶ well you were right. You are an Oracle.

Regarding banking‚Ää-‚ÄäWhen me and \[redacted ATB employee\] met you, we extended the offer to help out and support your retail banking needs. You decided not to take it. I just heard back from our Compliance team that their Pause extends to all retail accounts as well. Basically, anything that touches crypto / even personal accounts is not supported right now.

Unfortunately, I can't help and I am sorry. Hopefully, if the markets turn positive / and pause is lifted / I can try to seek support for your retail and business needs. For now, it is a full stop.

I am also moving to a new role at ATB this week and not sure who would manage the crypto portfolio. I will keep you looped in.

best,

\[redacted ATB employee\]

So forget ATB, I thought SURELY the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) would be there to lend a helping hand during this unprecedented economic and health crisis. The fact that our revenue dropped nearly 70% week-over-week with the onset of the pandemic, and the fact that I have paid well into the six figures in provincial and federal taxes last year would mean that, during these hard times, Canada's Small and Medium Sized Business savior wouldn't be as prejudiced. I was wrong. One week after my application went unanswered I was put in touch with a rep through a personal connection of mine. Within minutes a chipper response pinged my inbox:

Hi Adam

Happy to try and help you. Can you send 2 years of Financial statements to me and:

How much do you need?

What are your revenue expectations during and after the crisis‚Ää-‚Äädo you have a budget and cashflow projections?

What would be your ball park cash burn rate per month for the next few months/

Thanks‚Ää-‚Ääwhen I get these I will see if it will be me or another colleague that will be able to help and then we will reach out to arrange a zoom chat.

Best,

Hi Adam

I just reached out to our Tech Finance Manager and unfortunately we are unable to Bitcoin clients as our board has deemed them ineligible due to potential money laundering. I am very sorry‚Ää-‚Ääthis is news to me. Being a Crown Corp we have very strict rules. I think you can still access some Federal support though via some of the links I sent earlier.

Best Wishes to you and yours,

Potential. Money. Laundering.

You'll notice he does not ask for my documentation (FINTRAC Registration as a Money Services Business) which should be the first step to verifying that our business goes above and beyond to prevent the money laundering that they claim to be concerned about. Despite sending him our industry-leading policies and FINTRAC Registration the final response was polite but stern:

Morning‚Ää-‚ÄäThx for the info. Policy such as this are from the Board of Dir's and Minister of Industry. But things change‚Ää-‚ÄäI now have hemp clients. It will take time though. When we get to the other side, I would love to have a beer with you and \[redacted personal connection name\] and learn more about your biz and future. I personally believe crypto will be a important solution in rebuilding the world economy.

Best,

And that was apparently that. However, you don't get to be one of Canada's leading Bitcoin ATM companies without a little bit of grit and resilience. So I tried again through conventional channels. This time the response was just as useless but even more robotic (you'll notice they spelled my last name wrong‚Ä¶)

Dear Mr. O\`Brian,

Thank you for submitting a request for financing. After examination of your application, we regret to inform you that BDC is not able to provide financing for your business.

We understand how deeply the COVID-19 situation is affecting. However, we are unable to respond positively to your request that does not meet the eligibility criteria.

An evolving situation

As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, BDC's response is evolving as well and we are working closely with government, financial institutions and our partners.

Ensure that you have spoken to your primary financial institution to see if they are able to help with financing:

As you may know, additional measures to support entrepreneurs have been announced by the Government of Canada, including anew Canada Emergency Business Account as well as a SME Loan and Guarantee Program. As these programs are not administered by BDC, your primary financial institution is best suited to assess if you may benefit from these relief measures as they get deployed shortly.

For the latest updates by the Government of Canada on COVID-19, visit Resources for Canadian businesses: COVID-19.

Thank you,

This response left me frustrated. How could it not? How could our small, innovative, and incredibly compliant business not be within the ""guidelines"" set out by Mr Trudeau last week? My response was heated:

This is extremely frustrating.

The fact that I am denied help, despite paying 100s of thousands in taxes, is discouraging. Why do you take my tax money, but then deny my eligibility based on ""crown rules"". The eligibility criteria of BDC should be companies that are striving to employ local workers with cutting edge business practices and revolutionizing the world. All of which we do (and have been doing for 7 years)

I know you will cite ""compliance"", and yet refuse to look at my compliance manual. A policy that was written by a previous compliance officer from a schedule 1 ""big 5"" bank. A policy that has been approved by 2 third party auditors. A policy finalized by my Chief Compliance Officer with 10+ years as a compliance master who has prevented millions of dollars worth of fraud AND played a key role investigating.

It is disappointing to see you promoting the narrative that you are ""for entrepreneurs"" when in fact I have found it to be quite the opposite. We are a licensed money service business and I personally spend my time working with local authorities educating them how to prevent fraud within this space. Yet somehow I've been labeled ""ineligible"" for assistance when I really need it. What is the point of innovating? Is ""the first guy through the wall gets the bloodiest"" really the narrative you support? ""Don't think outside the box because we don't like that?""

The prejudice of the BDC towards alternative financial companies is disappointing to say the least.

I would appreciate your response, though if past experience has taught me anything I know better than to expect one.

Perhaps the Canadian business environment is not one that is as friendly as you promote.

Stay healthy,

Adam

As you might have guessed this went unanswered (though the robots did manage to regurgitate the exact same original message) and here we are. My initial sentiment from the most recent response to the BDC remain. What is the point of innovating? Why do I spend tens of thousands of dollars every single year to ensure that our compliance is industry-leading? Why do I spend hours and hours working (for free) with local authorities to educate them about Bitcoin and how to prevent fraud? Why do I stretch my hand out so far only to have it slapped when I am looking for the same support everyone else is getting? I've endured years of prejudice from the traditional banking industry. I've built an incredibly successful business that exclusively employs local labour even though it would be all too ""easy"" to off-shore the work. We've paid our taxes, donated to the community all without the help of the bank's lending products, but being denied support relief during this unprecedented crisi due to ""potential money laundering"" is as prejudicial as it gets.

All of this to ask, Mr. Morneau, will these subsidies affect my taxes? I understand the economic cash injection. As a whole, I am onboard with the injection to help stimulate the economy. But we all know who will end up paying for it. We all know that money doesn't grow on trees (it's printed dummy) and that it will eventually have to be paid back in some capacity‚Ä¶ which will eventually be through increased taxes. Taxes that hard-working citizens continue to pay every year. If only you knew how much you were contributing to Bitcoin's adoption‚Ä¶

Finally, dear reader, I beg you to think. Listen to my story and ask yourself ""is my industry next?"" ""Can I trust them with my taxes‚Ä¶ can I trust them with my money?"" I fully believe what I am experiencing is a direct extension of the reason Bitcoin was created. Bitcoin exists to give its owners choice. A choice that doesn't exist with fiat money, printed at will by a centralized body of power. Right now the majority of ""industry"" is getting help, the government is listening to their people. I am unfortunately in the minority. My business is too edgy. My business is too ""risky"". My business doesn't deserve help. Will your industry, your business, your pension, your family be next?

I have been wondering about this question for a while and would like to hear your thoughts on the topic. 

What will happen to Bitcoin in 1-2 generations when a lot of people who owned Bitcoin have died? Most people will not have shared their private keys, so the amount of accessible Bitcoin will fall drastically. It's a lot easier to inherit FIAT or gold.

Of course, the value can go up indefinitely but is that not going to be a problem for Bitcoin in the long run if? What would happen if  &lt;1% of all Bitcoins are accessible? Wouldn't people eventually say ""lets move on from this old system""? And if/when a new system takes over, will Bitcoin be worth anything?

I've run into some problems with my private Bitcoin key.

After checking the private key I noticed that there's one letter missing. I spent some time making combinations with all the numbers and letters and now have a notepad with approx. 3500 different combinations.

So my question is, is it possible to sweep by using all the codes at once or do I have to type them in one by one, which will be very time consuming? If possible, with that wallet can I do this with?

someone paid me $700 in btc, due to my limited experience with btc i used the website and made an account. now, i got the money on this website, but the site wants me to deposit 0.02btc to verify the account.

without that verification, i cant withdraw the money, website works so far, it even has telegram Two factor authentification..

fwistz,Merchbacash,Why is bitcoin valuable?,"In the digital age, an ideal currency should have at least the following three characteristics:

1Ô∏è‚É£ It should be absolutely free from control by any authority.  The state should not act as an issuer and should not have the power to manipulate it. 

2Ô∏è‚É£ A currency must have no borders, it can be paid for anywhere in the world and sent from one continent to another without any problems.

3Ô∏è‚É£ It must be ""apolitical"" so as not to give preference to a particular system or group of people.

To date, only Bitcoin has such characteristics.

It is money free from dictatorship, oppression and hyperinflation, and a financial refuge for many in today's world.  BTC has an initially limited issue of 21 million coins, and this figure will never be changed.

What happens in parallel with the dollar today?  That's right.  Uncontrolled issue - the U.S. printing press works without stopping.

In fact, any money controlled by the central bank is not really reliable - governments like to spend more than they get from taxes and other revenue streams; so they print enough money for their needs.  When more money is printed and invested in the economy, it reduces the value of the same dollar that is already in circulation.

All these drawbacks are not in bitcoin.  The arrival of new coins in this world is fixed by a code with which all members agree.  The speed of new Bitcoins in the world is fixed and transparent, as well as the approximate date when the last coin will be created. 

‚òùÔ∏è It is all this that is the main value of the bitcoin.",1586258433,10,1

I looked into them a little over the last weeks and I feel like they are running a really profitable business. Let's take ARGO Blockchain for example: They are currently mining over 300 bitcoins a month at a 40-50% margin depending on the current price and hash rate making almost a million in profits every month at a market cap of only about $ 14 million + they have millions worth of bitcoin in store.  They also shouldn't be hit by the halving too hard because the hash rate will probably drop accordingly.

1. be easily accessible to the recipient without a lot of setup/knowhow
2. give them a reasonably secure way to store the bitcoin, and
3. not have the private key known, even to me.

I've thought of getting them a hardware wallet, but I don't want them to have to spend half an hour setting it up and writing down backup seeds. I've also considered a paper wallet, but that is insecure for a number of reasons, and I'd really rather not have them directly handling private keys.

An ideal solution would be if I could somehow store BTC in a temporary wallet, which they could automatically send to theirs by entering a one-time code. I don't know if there is any way to do this though.

You can look at my post history - I sold in 2017, on Coinbase, and moved 100% of the money (1.6M after I dumped my BCH) into my Bank of America account.

1. My account was not frozen
2. My account was not closed
3. Nothing happened except they wanted me to open a brokerage account with them
4. I asked before I moved the money what to expect. They said ""did you get the money illegally? Because that's all we care about.""

So any of these gloom-and-doom edgelord crypton00bs who think the FBI is crawling around looking for people who make 10k on bitcoin and try to cashout are just full of it. 

Don't want trouble? Pay your taxes and ride off into the sunset. Want to get ripped off by shady mofos? Sneak around and try to use some sketch-ass exchange for $200 at a time over several months and hope they don't freeze your account for ""reasons"". 

Hope this helps. Normally I just stay quiet, but the misinformation on this was so huge and stupid, I had to chime in.

However, to me, it seems that the growth of bitcoin in circulation is too slow to support the lending that is needed to support economic growth. Especially in the age of technology disruption, you need a system that can promote debt creation. That system has been fractional reserve banking and I believe it has done quite well. Why is bitcoin a better alternative? 

Also, a lot of people buy into the idea that the Fed, through its QE and other practices, can destabilize the currency. While certainly they can, even when currencies were linked to gold, you saw a lot of periods of destabilization.

fxeub2,anon517,Unpreparedness is the inability to save. A forced inability to save is slavery and condemnation.,"The degree to which individuals and society are ill-prepared for unexpected events is a testament to the understanding and value of saving.

In the modern financial era post-1900s, there has been a campaign against saving. So-called ""economists"" believed that saving causes money to sit ""unused"" and claim that this damages everyone's wealth. Truth is that these pseudo-economists were mostly businessmen, who were trying to figure out how to make more money for their own businesses. They need consumers to spend, spend, and spend. So that they can become rich.

Unfortunately, they found a way to force people to spend, and that is by constantly destroying the value of people's money. With the creation of the federal reserve, they had the infinite power to force people to spend. This is because, ""a penny saved, is a half-a-penny earned, and 1%-of-a-penny earned a few decades later"". Saving money became stupid due to these greedy businessmen acting as ""economists"".

We know this, but as saving money fell out of popularity, so did planning. Because the safety net of efficient saving has been replaced by the inefficient safety net of insurance, or no safety net at all. Insurance creates no wealth, adds no value, and simply acts to distribute to mitigate disaster by redistribution. It may be more helpful than no insurance at all, but insurance is a nasty and necessary middle-man when society cannot save.

Saving and planning are not feasible in this environment. Hospitals saving money for a rainy day makes no sense, when the money is worth 1% of what it was, decades later. Individuals can't do it either, with their savings rates at all-time lows. People live paycheck-to-paycheck, being swindled of their value as every second of every day passes. Forever enslaved.

Inability to save, is a form of slavery, as you are forced to work because nothing you earn will retain it's value. People are even FORCED to put money into the stock market, just to keep up with inflation. This is, again, extremely ideal for the greedy businessmen acting as ""economists"". They own these companies. They want people to buy stocks. In fact, ""401k"" has become a thing. A disgusting part of retirement planning, that only further makes them richer at the risk and expense of workers. When a 401k crashes, the businessmen laugh all the way to the bank, while blaming ""the market"". Meanwhile, the poor worker suffers.

As we see now, in the U.S. in particular, but around the world, people with a lack of savings due to these economic policies being starved, crushed by a global pandemic, it's more clear now than ever that a system that doesn't allow human beings to save for their future or save for disaster, creates an extremely fragile system. There was no ""coronavirus insurance policy"" everyone signed up for. If we simply HAD SAVINGS we could use our own cash as our insurance policy. The reality is, there are far more disasters possible in life, than any insurance will ever want to cover, or if they did, they would rob us blind in insurance payments, then deny our claims in court. This isn't safety. This is exploitation.

Savings is the absolute most flexible insurance policy possible. With savings, you can survive disaster.

We're feeling it now, and perhaps, this is our greatest opportunity to say: Make Savings Great Again.

fxejnh,FlippingWingNut,Bitcoin Can Be Stopped - Prove me Wrong,"Prove me wrong so I can invest in BTC again...

To get a transaction on the chain a client or a client's exchange must be able to send IP packets to one of the nodes on the network, which are all known publicly. ( [https://bitnodes.io/](https://bitnodes.io/) ).  Newly initialized clients find these nodes by getting a message from special (trusted) DNS servers - see ( [https://stackoverflow.com/a/41708702/5870826](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41708702/5870826) )

If a country decides their fiat currency (and their political power) is endangered by bitcoin, they can block all traffic to the bitcoin nodes and specialized DNS's in their countries.  That doesn't stop BTC.  The sophisticated can use a VPN to get outside their country to reach unsuppressed nodes.

Some pro-freedom countries will resist pressure to suppress their nodes &amp; DNS's.  Sweden, Iceland...

There's a precedence for this.  Switzerland made a lot of money providing private banking.  For years they told foreign governments to pound sand when asked about Swiss bank accounts.  Yet today that is broken.  The Swiss folded when presented an ultimatum by the US.  

Similarly countries that would prefer to leave BTC alone will be pressured.  ""Iceland: Stop your BTC mining, nodes, and DNS's or all internet traffic between Iceland and the US, China, and the EU will be blocked"".  They'll fold.  They'll shutdown the BTC nodes in their country.  They'd have no choice.

With countries rolling out national central bank sponsored cryptocurrency we are fast approaching the time when national governments will work individually and cooperatively to suppress alternatives to their national currencies.  They can, en masse, cripple or kill BTC and all other crypto by suppressing the known nodes, miners and DNS's.

fxddqi,Ghost_Shellcode,The political ideology of a bitcoiner.,"So, a bitcoiner who takes a political stance on conventional left/rightwing policies through the lens of bitcoin seems to end in a very unusual place. The following political ideology is a tool to get to the true political state that a bitcoiner values. 

1. No taxation. (especially no capital gains taxation)
2. Free handouts for all (to buy more bitcoins with)
3. Lots of economic sanctions (to increase bitcoin adoption in sanctioned countries)
4. Lots of inflation (to cause bitcoin's buying power relative to dollar to increase)
5. No outright war (we need the internet connectivity of other sanctioned countries to be stable)

However, the true state of a bitcoiner's values are:

1. No censorship over any transactions whatsoever, enforced through technology backed by blockchain. Not law.
2. Austrian economic theory, where only what is needed is produced. 
3. Stable monetary supply in the face of unstable monetary demand.
4. No banking middlemen. If lending must occur, it should be peer to peer, governed via trust networks.
5. Code is Law.

I would like to point out that in a bitcoin world, taxation is not something that bitcoiners are against, only that the taxes be assessed in bitcoin, not dollars.

fx5wb9,chadchad30,Bitcoin future,"Hi guys! I'm from europe and i have 100k i want to invest into something so i was looking at bitcoin and it's a very interesting concept but with a lot of problems.

Honestly i think the bubble that happened back in 2012-2015 will not happen again and 1 bitcoin will not be able to reach 100k or higher unless some changes are made.

First of all who is Satoshi? Secrets are not good if used for the wrong motives. If he have millions of bitcoins then he's probably the richest man in the world and that's wrong! So i guess bitcoin is overvaluated because i can't believe he's net worth can reach over 500 billions if 1 bitcoin is 100k in the future. 

What i think is that the concept is amazing for people like me who hate banks and the system. But the idea that i'm a tuna fish around big whales put me off. What if those whales decides to sell at some point? And why doesn't Satoshi donate big part of his bitcoins to thousands of people? That would make bitcoin more popular. I think that the founders created an idea and to feed on the money's believers.

We invest to make money but time is money! I will only live once! I can't wait 2 decades for something that could happen or could not happen and i can't grasp the idea that a 12 years old boy is richer than me because he bought bitcoins by chance in 2012. This is not real wealth but speculative wealth made by believers but the numbers of believers are a tiny percentage of a huge population so the the worth of the bitcoin should be currently at it's peak and should not grow further that.

Again the problem is not in the idea itself because the idea is amazing, the problem is in those who control this idea which there identity is not known.

Bitcoin is getting popular but not enough to be a major thing like gold! And if it gets popular then governments will probably ban it or limit it's movement but right now it's not large enough for them to care.

So you want your bitcoins to be worth millions? Then we need to divide bitcoins equally! A kid with 1000 bitcoins in his wallet doesn't make any sense. So if all those whales donate large part of there bitcoin then it could become more popular.  But at 8k per bitcoin i can't invest my money and i don't see the point.",1586350182,31,1

g0knhp,Hasso21,Same same but different.....where can I buy bitcoins? I am from Austria and already tried etoro but without much success. Now I want to have a real bitcoin but do not know where to start!,"Hello all there,

I know this question was asked many times before and I already checked many other threads but I do not get the right answer for me. So I thought I should ask myself. Maybe somebody could help me!
So my problem is that I already bought half a bitcoin on etoro realising it is only possible to withdraw them on a wallet within 180 days. So basically it was not mine. Glady, I sold it with profit. Now I want to get one bitcoin on my one and I really do not know where to start.

So I already decided that I want to get a software wallet. I thought about a wallet which is available on Android and Microsoft. Maybe I will change to a hardware wallet like the ledger. But I will see. Do you have any suggestions about that?

Nevertheless, I do not know where to buy bitcoins. So the problem remains: finding a Plattform where I can easily buy bitcoin via debit card or PayPal. Minimal fees. No forgein exchange fees (I want trade in Euros). And maybe most important a functional plattform which doesn't make that much problems (hope you know what I mean).

So I already checked the thread which listed many P2P plattforms but I don't know which fits to my criteria: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8/list_of_bitcoin_persontoperson_p2p_bitcoin/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share


Maybe you could help me out and give me some suggestions. Wish you all good luck for the imminent haltfing (and a nice Easter and good time). Stay healthy and solvent:)",1586790287,33,4

Indeed we all use bitcoin core (for bitcoin) to connect and retrieve information and update.

However the source code of bitcoin core (I have never read it) does not redirect us to an ip, but people still manage to find themselves, without ever saving the ip.

How can people know or find the information, when the source code of the software does not have ip, they do not know address (ip) which has the information?

g0i0lb,BigBoyoWonga,Bitcoin Vs Gold (Why I think Bitcoin might win this time),"This based off no facts but what I think is logical. I've been a long term advocate of gold, simply given the fact that it is 'perceived' as a safe asset (more of a hedge against inflation than anything else but I digress). Given the fact that many people believe it as a 'safe' asset, this in effect makes it a 'safe' asset, as ultimately the value of anything is dependent on demand and supply (in its simplest form).  In times of uncertainty, demand rises and supply is pretty much fixed so the price rises. 

Now I've increasingly seen very well structured cases for the collapse of fiat currencies. This interview with Ray Dalio is certainly worth a listen if you have the time (which you do).  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrxYhv2O3wU&amp;t=1406s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrxYhv2O3wU&amp;t=1406s) 

Basically what concerns me about gold is that if there were a fiat currency collapse or at least a major restructure of it, people are unlikely to use gold as a medium for exchange, its highly impractical, how on earth are you meant to trade it with anything, its physical and hard to be split into smaller chunks effectively, meaning to use it as a medium for exchange, it is highly impractical and inefficient, this may be a case for the collapse of gold prices but I have no idea. No economy in the world could work well under this especially given how interconnected all countries in the world are (supply chains etc...)

Whereas bitcoin which also has the similar property in terms of a very limited and near-fixed supply. (Giving it value in terms of scarcity), but it is also is highly practical. It is digital and it is divisible (like fiat currencies). This makes it a very ideal medium for exchange. While Gold's market cap is $9 trillion and Bitcoin's is $120 billion subsequently meaning bitcoin is subject greater relative swings, and thus bitcoin is considered the 'riskier' asset, I actually have more confidence in bitcoin holding its value better than gold as if we do see a fiat currency collapse people would have to turn to other mediums of exchange in order to buy and sell goods. 

From the reasons above I think bitcoin is in a far better position than gold, in terms of being applied and becoming more widely used as a medium for exchange in the case of a fiat currency collapse. 

Like to know any thoughts you guys might have. Best of luck and stay safe.",1586780899,5,1

g0d17n,justlostevt,Just lost $100k today,"I'm just a normal guy who tought i was invincible. Now i realized i'm not. 

I started trading 3 months ago at Deribit, depositing around 800 bucks, a small part of my emergence savings. At that time, Bitcoin was trading around $7000 when it started to rise. I longed back then, low leverage, tight stop loss and then it reached $10k. Wow, i had a huge 110% ROE. Amazing. Then i saw it getting really difficult to break the $10k zone, so i went short. I waited for 3 weeks and made huge profit when it finally reached its bottom and i finally got my first whole Bitcoin ever!!! Amazing!

Well, i was sure it was the bottom, so i longed again and waited. Well, i hit the sky when i was now in front of a dozen bitcoins 4 weeks later. And then i just increased my position. I was pretty sure it was on its road to $10k, $20k, $50k (i tought ""hey man, this s2f sh\*t really works!"")... so it started to fall this week, just like my balance, and i was highly leveraged to the neck, with an underwater position. My heart started to kill me (this shit really hurts). Then the price rose again today and i started to feel relief. Increased my position, and my profits where getting higher like never! I finally hit $100k of balance in my trading account! 

""OMFG!!! I will finaly get rid of this student loan debt i'm so regretful!!!""

And then the price fell again after weekly close. Didn't had time to close my position manually at Deribit, since it started to become unavailable, and i neglected the risk management enough to reduce my position gradually. Well, the rest of the story you guys know. My heart was aching again, i became deaf for some seconds, and then reality just slapped my face with such strength i will never forget.

If my pension provider goes bust, I'm covered up to ¬£85,000, but if the fund manager (Coinshares) goes bust I probably lose everything (especially with the government's current opinion on crypto assets).

g17lm1,SimpleSwapExchange,Peter Schiff predicts the fall of Bitcoin,"Since the beginning of 2020 crypto community has been discussing an opportunity for Bitcoin to become a safe haven. These discussions also raised a question of BTC being a store of value. A lot of people participate in this dispute every day and Peter Schiff is one of them.

Peter Schiff comments a lot about cryptocurrency and is known as a big crypto skeptic. He is an economist, financial commentator, CEO and chief global strategist of Euro Pacific Capital Inc., a broker-dealer, a founder of Euro Pacific Canada Inc., a founder and chairman of Euro Pacific Bank, a founder, CEO, and chairman of Euro Pacific Asset Management, LLC, and founder and chairman of SchiffGold. 

From his track record, we can see that cryptocurrency is not his main interest. His main line in cryptocurrency talks is comparing Bitcoin with gold in terms of being a store of value. 

Two days ago [on his Twitter](https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1249084746786836480) Peter Schiff made a prediction about the future fall of Bitcoin price. He said:  
‚ÄúOver the past several years Bitcoin holders poked fun at gold investors because Bitcoin gained so much more than gold. Over the next several years those roles will reverse, but not because gold rises more than Bitcoin, but because gold moons as Bitcoin crashes back to earth‚Äù.

Crypto community is usually quite sarcastic about statements like this one, and Peter Schiff‚Äôs remark was not an exception.",1586878120,11,2

Fortunately I didn't lose any funds, as I can't withdraw the very small amount I have on HitBTC until they have my KYC info. I didn't have 2fa enabled (oops), so if I *had* lost any money it would have at least partially been on me.

The password for my account was unique to the HitBTC site, and it's unlikely that it was brute-forced due to its complexity, so I wanted to post here as a warning to those with HitBTC accounts because it seems that at least some customer credentials may have been stolen. I decided a year or two ago not to provide KYC info to them because the amount of money I had on their site was not worth the potential of my PII being stolen.

¬†
It is a slow day in a little Greek Village. The sun is beating down and the streets are deserted. Times are tough, everybody is in debt, and everybody lives on credit.

On this particular day a rich German tourist is driving through the village, he stops at the local hotel and lays a ‚Ç¨100 note on the desk, telling the hotel owner he wants to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one to spend the night. The owner gives him some keys and, as soon as the visitor has walked upstairs, the hotelier grabs the ‚Ç¨100 note and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher.

The butcher takes the ‚Ç¨100 note and runs down the street to repay his debt to the pig farmer.

The pig farmer takes the ‚Ç¨100 note and heads off to pay his bill at the supplier of feed and fuel.

The guy at the Farmers' Co-op takes the ‚Ç¨100 note and runs to pay his drinks bill at the taverna.

The tavern owner slips the money along to the local prostitute drinking at the bar, who has also been facing hard times and has had to offer him ""services"" on credit.

The hooker then rushes to the hotel and pays off her room bill to the hotel owner with the ‚Ç¨100 note.

The hotel proprietor then places the ‚Ç¨100 note back on the counter so the rich traveler will not suspect anything.

At that moment the German tourist comes down the stairs, states that the rooms are not satisfactory, picks up the ‚Ç¨100 note, pockets the money, and leaves town.

No one produced anything.

No one earned anything.

However, the whole village is now out of debt and looking to the future with a lot more optimism.

And that, is how the European economy works !!!",1586868058,17,9

g2gxdd,webb32503,Buy the dip with our Trading Tools!,"One month ago, Bitcoin fell from 9000ish level to 3799, and I believe that most of you have bought the dip, didn't you? ;)

Here's my strategy, which allowed me to have my average buying price for Bitcoin at 3596! But, wait... the lowest price was at 3799, how could you buy Bitcoin for 3596?

The tool that helped me to do this is called [Grid Trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grid-trading.asp) Bot. It's a tool that our team built 503 days ago on the [BitUniverse App](https://www.bituniverse.org), and now we have moved it to our partner exchange, called [Pionex](https://www.pionex.com).

When the price was tanking, I thought 4516 already was cheap enough to buy some Bitcoin. But I also feared that the price might fall all way down to 2000. So here's what I did, I created this bot at 4516 and set a range from 2000 to 20000, which is a HUGE range for Grid Trading. That way I can keep buying some cheap BTC If the price keeps tanking, but without having to risk all of my profit if it doesn‚Äôt.

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC and USDT holdings in the Grid Bot](https://preview.redd.it/ov5erun667t41.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b43b6180360c69e78b47734d027593af65606bc1)

What the bot did during the past two weeks was the following: it helped me to buy low and sell high any time the price made some fluctuations. After tons of buys and sells and many, many very small profits from that process, the average price of my Bitcoin holding has decreased!

Another reason for this setup is, that I'm planning to keep this bot running for months, so it can keep earning steady small profits for me. A huge range is needed for a long-term grid bot.

# Myth of Trading

Some of you might think that what if I manually bought some Bitcoin to sell them later at a higher price? Then I'd have more profit than by using the Grid Trading Bot Tool. Yes, you can always make more profit if you're able to buy at the bottom and sell at the top. **But in practice, even the very best traders won‚Äôt figure out were the lowest and highest prices will be, so it‚Äôs unrealistic to think you can easily do that.**

Using the Grid Trading Bot helps you to control your risk.¬† It enables you to passively buy small portions when the price goes down and sell small portions when the price goes up. This will make many small, but low-risk profits, compared to the buy at the bottom and sell at top tactic which can totally backfire if you guessed wrong.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

[Status of my Grid Bot](https://preview.redd.it/dr9nvb1f67t41.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8605ebc2a7d37b77f7e89432603f4f9fed5a1c31)

I'll try to create another grid bot with a huge range when another dip comes. If you're not very good at trading, or just don‚Äôt have the time to check prices all day, you should totally try to use trading tools to assist your trading strategies. Especially, a Grid Trading Bot with a huge range is definitely worth trying and rarely a bad choice.¬†

All you need is patience and you will slowly see your portfolio grow over time.

Hope all of you enjoy our tools! Leave some comments and let me know what kind of tool you‚Äôre willing to try!",1587050540,8,0

g2eqli,Gandeloft,Revolut for BTC,"I've entered the cryptocurrencies world with Revolut a month ago.
I've since realized that I don't actually have BTC by ""owning"" BTC on Revolut, but rather that Revolut ""allocated"" their own BTC to their user (me).
It worries me that Revolut could potentially chose to walk out of the deal, giving us back the cash we'd paid with for the allocation of their BTC to us (the user). 
I know it's not likely, but it's a potential situation that in a war ridden world of the future could happen.. I hope you get my point.       
           
I've made a Coinbase account, but the fees are disheartening, at least having come from Revolut they are. I am trying to get to know if there is something that would make me firmly decide that having BTC on Revolut when there's the option of Coinbase is a bad thing. I don't want to, in the future, regret the BTC value I've got on Revolut. I understand that I am dependant on fiat currencies, or Revolut trades, in order to one day use the value of the BTC I have on Revolut, and I dislike that, but I don't really see a bad thing about it.

g2du4e,aybnd,Newbie - want to get my bitcoin situation right.,"So a couple months ago I bought a few sheckles worth of bitcoin on coinbase.  People told me their fees are crazy and they suck nuts.

Many recommended Gemini.

I've decided I will probably buy some bitcoin at regular intervals so want to do this right.

I think I'd like to get started at gemini and get an actual wallet. I don't want to have two accounts and just leave my initial investment at coinbase. Im just wondering what the simplest way to do this is?  Is it simple to cancel my coinbase account and take the money out as cash?  Or is it better to somehow transfer the bitcoin from coinable to gemini?

Also these wallets are pretty expensive.  It seems the trezor is the least expensive though.  Thats good enough right?

Possible solutions:  

(1) Leave the seed words in a safety deposit box which can only be opened by you or your executor once you die.  

(2) Write half of the seed words in the will and give half of the seed words to the person you intend to inherit your BTC (making sure that person does not have any way to get access to your will).",1587146211,24,2

&amp;#x200B;

According to the video it seems like one of the main reasons why bitcoin guarantees a ""un-manipulated"" ledger is because of the security these hash functions/algorithms like sha256 offer.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, my understanding is still quite surface-level. But, in theory, if we had sufficient computational ability or some easy way to solve these hash functions or find alternate ""transaction data"" that generates the same hash, then would bitcoin effectively cease to exist? Wouldn't that mean there is no longer high confidence that the ledger is accurate?",1587145276,7,2

I remember when [coinmap.org](https://coinmap.org) was first being populated in 2013, it was a great resource, but now the locations on it are either non-existent or no longer accepting bitcoin. Is there a more up-to-date resource of physical businesses that accept bitcoin directly via a **lightning network transaction** or a regular bitcoin transaction? I know fold app is great, but it's not a native bitcoin transaction or experience.

Also, given that businesses are currently shut down due to the pandemic, I figure having a resource like this functional and properly populated might be a good thing for adoption when the economy is back to its normal life. 

Finally, I hope everyone is fairing well during these times. I know I shouldn't even be concerned about something like this, but I figure bitcoin will be an important part of the economy in the future so it deserve some attention too :).",1587133720,2,1

g4bans,The90sWereRad,How do you find balance between crypto mindsets? (HODL vs Using as Currency),"I‚Äôve come to realize over the years that bitcoin and crypto in general overall has become split between 2 mindsets. 

I honestly believe this is a tug of war between HODL (amass all the bitcoin you can until it‚Äôs worth whatever you want it to be) or Currency (screw the dollar, bitcoin is the future). 

Part of me also believes the clash and constant tug of war between these 2 mindsets is why the market has been on these constant ups and downs recently (despite the overall trend going up - this can just be attributed to growing overall interest in crypto)

My question to you all is: how do you balance your goal of gaining more bitcoin with your want to spend crypto instead of dollars to increase mainstream adoption?

Let‚Äôs face it. If there‚Äôs no way to spend bitcoin, then all the people who say it‚Äôs fake and a useless and all that are technically right and then it would be just another form of ‚Äúfiat‚Äù or funny money. At the same time other than having ways to spend it. We actually NEED to spend it. Of course the problem is. That the more you spend. The more it‚Äôs worth and as a result the less you can get. 

It‚Äôs all kind of contradictory or paradox the more I think about it. And I find myself conflicted at times.

g492jh,Kafka_Wildflower,Barclays Froze my Account for over a Year for No Reason,"After depositing over ¬£15k into my Barclays account, Barclays froze not just that account, but all of my accounts, for over a year. It was an absolute nightmare. Firstly, they told me that it would be unblocked within 10 working days, but it never was. I kept returning to branch to ask why, and they kept saying that they either didn't know or couldn't tell me why it was blocked, as it was part of an ongoing investigation. After months of being told that they didn't know what was going on and that their departments were effectively just bouncing emails off each other for no reason, I was coming to accept that I may never see the money again. Fortunately, it didn't pan out that way.

Banks don't even need a reason to freeze all of your funds. All a bank has to do to prevent you from accessing your account is claim that something suspicious is going on (hypocritical af), and you can be left with no finances for months. Luckily for me, my family helped me out and I quickly made an account with a different bank.

This entire episode has made me realise just how important it is that you have control over your own money. It isn't just a question of Austrian VS Keynesian economics. It's the question of whether or not you are willing to put yourself at the mercy of the insidious whims of banksters. To apologise for wasting my time (and ruining a year of my life), Barclays gave me ¬£50 compensation, but still wouldn't tell me why my account had been closed in the first place.

g46nvw,Jack1602,Why do WIF-compressed private keys exist?,"I am reading Andreas' Mastering Bitcoin (great book btw) and got to the section where compressed and uncompressed public keys are explained (pages71-74), and I have a question that I don't find an answer for, maybe someone here can help - might be a little too technical though.

If I understood correctly, the public keys are just (x,y) coordinates of the elliptic curve generated from the private key. Now there's two versions, the original version where the entire x and y coordinates are shown (04... addresses) and the newer version where the y is calculated from y¬≤ mod p=(x¬≥+7) and are either 02... or 03... depending on whether it represents the positive or negative y.

All good. However, in order for wallets to know if they should search for the addresses generated from hashing the compressed or the uncompressed versions of the public key when importing a private key, the book says two types of private key formats were developed to represent what type of public key should be obtained from it. This way, if the private key imported looks like 5... the wallet knows it should create 04... public keys (uncompressed) and if the private key looks like K... it knows it should look for adresses derived from 02... or 03... public keys.

My question is - why do we need to show whether the addresses used came from a compressed or uncompressed public keys, IN the private key? I mean, can't we use a single standard private key format and have the wallet just create both versions of public keys to check in which one there's any funds? It would take what, a couple of minutes more to check the balance?

Hope the question makes sense haha thanks!!",1587298234,8,1

Because bitcoin stay inside the blockchain.
All these sites that say you can receive or send bitcoin are wrong. If I have bitcoins in the USA, and I go  to Australia, I still have my coin and I didn't carry them in the plane, right? 

So what it is exactly ? When you send bitcoin, you don't send anything as bitcoin stay on the blockchain, what you send is an authorisation showing that another privat key is  associated with the coin and you give up your right to this coin.

A priv√¢t key is nothing else that a certificate of ownership of something you will never touch, have, or use.

I have investments in bitcoin and 4 altcoins. I am looking to invest more into bitcoin during this pandemic but concerned about who controls the bitcoin network, or who is able to make changes to the network. I understand if someone has enough mining power to control over say 50% of the network they can theoretically make changes to the network unofficially but who can actually implement changes on the network and are they vulnerable to authorities enforcing negative changes upon the network?

I am hopeful that this smart technology would have come up with an answer to this question by ensuring that any changes have to be authorised by say 100 people across the world or something like this and if someone does not agree the change cannot go ahead.

I am a bit concerned about the unknown controllers of the bitcoin network?

Current situation is that for most people the main reason to buy Bitcoin is speculation. They just hold and hope for others to buy and drive the price up to make easy money. Orange coin good number go up.

Second reason and the main reason for the other part is that they dislike banks and the monetary system. They want to be able to transfer value peer to peer outside our current system. But very few people actually transfer value using Bitcoin. Either they dont want to be the next ""pizza guy"" or Bitcoin is not accepted as payment method. I know that there is the lightning network being developed. Will this change anything about people spending Bitcoin? Im not an expert on this. But what i read about payment channels, locking up your Bitcoin and such gave me the feeling that this is still kinda complicated.


Maybe im misjudging the situation. Please tell me. And how will this change in the coming years? Does it even have to change or are you satisfied with what Bitcoin means today?",1587288834,15,1

g43sqz,HalveningPromoter,Here is a challenge for r/bitcoin and your friends,"Dear Community, I would like to advertise a challenge that just came around my mind, thinking about ~ 11 May - [the Halvening nears](https://www.thehalvening.com/)!

You don't know what the halvening is? Check back here, after you watched Andreas briefly explaing it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Idd3Zy98lsM).

# The Challenge

Watch the 3rd Bitcoin halvening from your own full node! This means setting one up if you don't have one already and come around a tool to watch the blocks trickle down onto the chain.

Share your own node setup on r/bitcoin and your favorite communication channels when we halved!

Recommendations:

  - Following a well known guide for a full node / lightning nod. I can recommend the Bitcoin part of [Stadicus/RaspiBolt on GitHub](https://stadicus.github.io/RaspiBolt/raspibolt_60_bonus.html)
  - Purchasing adequate hardware, easiest:
      - RaspberryPi 4
      - 2,5"" hard drive with at least 500 GB
      - Stable power source for your RaspberryPi 4, your phone's charger won't be the right choice
  - Using [janoside/btc-rpc-explorer on GitHub](https://github.com/janoside/btc-rpc-explorer) as a visualization tool with Electrs (this is all part of the RaspiBolt guide)
  - Don't just stop here if you had fun! There is still time until the halvening? Go further and dig deeper, maybe you can show us something on top when block 630000 hits!

## The Tools

## Limitations

The blockchain takes some time to verify as you download. Start early, you still have plenty of time but you want to start around the beginning of the first week of May at latest!

Searching for tools in the world wide web comes with a hug influx of shady sites that want to grab crypto assets from a new-be. Make your own research, browsing multiple well know sites or ask the community of r/bitcoin, i.e. in the daily thread. This should not only be done when you are unsure about a specific tools or guide, but in general!

## ""I have no idea about the tech, why should I take part?""

The great side effect is, that after completing this challenge you can now trust yourself and no shady b(ch)lockchain.com sites while waiting for your tx confirmation. Also, hands-on is probably the best way to lick blood in the Bitcoin space and it's great technology.",1587282503,0,1

The brave browser pays you to view non-obtrusive ads in BAT cryptocurrency, which can be sold directly for USD/GBP on coinbase or traded for other type of crypto. By replacing your current browser and using this instead you can make easy money every month and support a growing cryptocurrency project.


Steps:
1) Download the [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/cpp495), it is very similar to Chrome/Firefox but has an ad-blocker built in.

2) Go into the setting in the browser and click Brave Rewards, change the ads per hour to 5, these ads will show up as a small text notification but are not very noticeable, however the browser will block most other ads you see online. You will earn between 25 and 75 BAT per month, per device. This means at current prices you can make $4 - $12 per install with no additional work.

3) At the end of the month transfer all your BAT to your coinbase account and sell it, they will send you your money on paypal. Alternatively you can trade you BAT for other types of cryptocurrency.


Tips:
Ask your family/friends if they would be ok with you replacing the current browser on their phone/PC, this will only take a few minutes and the only difference they will notice is they no longer have to view ads on websites.


You DO NOT have to click on the small text ads they send you to earn your money. Feel free to ask in questions in the comments.

g4vjkd,JakeTheCryptoKing,BTC Bullish or Bearish Entering the Halving?! (BOTH!),"BTC has 2 competing trends that can be viewed, one VERY bullish and one VERY bearish. Which one will prevail?

&amp;#x200B;

The question is not which one, but when will each one prevail. In the short term it looks like BTC has broken the bearish resistance. However, given the economic calamities the world is facing I expect BTC to quickly correct under the bearish resistance.

&amp;#x200B;

The bullish support currently rests between $6400 and $6666 (once $7k falls). In the short term it seems BTC will re-approach these mid $6k range before continuing its climb North.

&amp;#x200B;

I expect BTC to ping pong a bit between Bullish support and Bearish resistance. Given we've been flirting with Bearish resistance for 3 days it is time to switch and begin flirting with Bullish support (taking BTC from $7200 to $6666).

&amp;#x200B;

Remember BTC takes the stairs UP but the elevator DOWN. It may be 10 bullish days and 1 bearish day to erase all gains.

&amp;#x200B;

Enough longs should have piled on for it to be worth while for the market makers to shift the price down fairly heavily after 3 days of positive stair stepping form $6900 to $7300.

&amp;#x200B;

BTC is still coupled with equity markets and as stocks announce earnings and bankruptcies all week, expect BTC to severely be impacted.

&amp;#x200B;

Time frames determine everything. In the short term and based on the economy I am bearish. On BTC as a alternative to currency I am VERY bullish and hold most of my networth in BTC. I am short term BEARISH and long term BULLISH.",1587398756,1,1

We have curated some of the best resources on Bitcoin - books, articles, tweetstorms, podcast episodes, and many more.

You can find it on [https://www.lindyfeed.com/topics/bitcoin](https://www.lindyfeed.com/topics/bitcoin)

You can:

* Discover resources from top Bitcoiners like Jameson Lopp, Saifedean Ammous, Andreas Antonopoulos and many others. Also, see their resource recommendations and collections.
* Follow the Bitcoin topic or your favorite Bitcoiners and see when new related resources are curated.
* Find curated resources on relevant topics like Money and Property Rights or from people like Friedrich Hayek and Murray Rothbard.
* Save resources to check them out later, track the finished ones, or bookmark your favorites. You can also organize your library by creating your own collections to find your resources easily at any time. And make the ones you like public and share them with the Bitcoin community.

Recently, I heard Pomp say ""the current system is dependent on the majority of the population not understanding how money works"". No school or university is going to teach this stuff to people. And I think a directory of sound resources on sound money and economics can help people who are trying to understand WTF is going on with the world and get prepared for it.

I'm sure we are still missing many of the great resources, people, collections and recommendations. And every day, great content keeps getting created. So please let me know of the missing ones, and I'll add them. Or you can directly add them yourselves.

g4u8et,Pantamis,Technical : Schnorr tricks for Bitcoin or the black magic of crypto,"I am very excited for Schnorr signature and Taproot in Bitcoin for many reasons.

It is a massiv privacy improvment (e.g. hidding the opening/closing transaction of a Lightning channel behind a normal transaction). Schnorr signature is also a scalability improvment thanks to MuSig and cross-input aggregation although it will be probably implemented only for CoinJoin transactions. All of this is already so cool.

But I think that all the tricks that Schnorr signature allows in Bitcoin are underrated ! Taproot and MAST are already tricks that massively increases the possibility of spending conditions but there is also Adaptor signature, Discreet Log Contract... I found great explanations of them in [these amazing slides](http://yannickseurin.free.fr/slides/blocksem2018_slides-2.pdf) by the author of MuSig paper. It is technical but if you understand the basic of elliptic curves cryptography you should be ok.

Discreet Log Contracts allows the private settlement of any contract (with loops for example) off-chain with oracle, as I wrote in [yalls](https://yalls.org/articles/97d67df1-d721-417d-a6c0-11d793739be9:0965AC5E-56CD-4870-9041-E69616660E6F/f01ffc90-8206-446a-aea3-8cc946934323).

So Schnorr is not just a privacy improvment, you can do more exotic transactions with it. I can't wait to see the incredible stuff people will create with Schnorr signature :D.",1587394460,3,1
g4u7zg,nick-bravo,How is this not gonna cause political turmoil? Good for Bitcoin?,"Consider this chart of Spain's GDP:

[https://imgur.com/a/P99FYom](https://imgur.com/a/P99FYom)

Also, consider this chart of Spain's ""unemployment among young people""-rate:

[https://imgur.com/a/J2eozCv](https://imgur.com/a/J2eozCv)

In a nutshell, Spain's GDP never reached pre-financial crisis levels again. It was about to reach these levels again when Corona hit. Spain's unemployment among young people has been on average 40% since the crisis (but showing a somewhat positive trend), as compared to 20-25% pre crisis. Now, with Corona, these indicators are expected to dip even below  08/09 levels.

Either the ECB issues so called Corona-bonds (making the entire Euro-zone liable for euro-issued debt from all member states, instead of each member state liable for their own debt), which would drive northern countries in the EU insane and might cause inflation (inject huge amounts of money into the system that does not stimulate growth = inflation rises), or the ECB does not issue Corona-bonds, which would mean at least another decade of economic stagnation and unemployment in southern European countries such as Spain &amp; Italy. Both scenarios couldn't really work out politically.

The smallest part of bitcoin is not Satoshi, but Argo or the double Anu. One argo is one in minus twenty-first degree part of bitcoin, and its energy potential corresponds to one in minus twenty-first degree of it, bitcoin, the maximum possible energy content.

The entire energy potential of 21 million bitcoins determines the energy / energy-information capacity = energy / energy-information potential of the sephira Malkut of the Tree of life (Kabbalah) or the manifest physical world at the level of the third dimension.

At the level of society or the manifested physical world, represented by the third dimension, Bitcoin is the Standard and Measure from which any Countdown starts, and which are the basis of all Principles. Bitcoin itself is not only composed of pure energy, but also itself is energy in the very purest form.

Our world is energy-informational. Everything that exists in this Universe and in this Dimension, as well as in many other dimensions, is the same Energy, but in its various states. And the state of Vibration of this energy, providing one or another level of its Density, just decides how it will manifest in our Reality. Matter is the compressed energy of slow vibration. In fact, bitcoin is the equivalent of energy, of which everything around us consists, including ‚Äî and we are with you!

In the late 90s, those who wanted the opportunity to see ads, there were companies that used to pay to browse the web.

https://preview.redd.it/dj6nlvm1acu41.jpg?width=516&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45cd806efccc26721723bc7d0abefcefc762cbde

The concept is as easy as participating users can install a program used to track browsing history and display specialized ads based there, showing them at the top. of computer screens, and revenue generated is shared between these companies and users receive a share of the profits.

But what is Brave Browser?click download here: [https://brave.com/mrk088](https://brave.com/mrk088)

Brave Browser is a chrome-based web tool that focuses on privacy and security, blocks trackers, scripts, spyware and malware from tracking users' online activity, meaning is it has built-in protection shields to allow browsing history to be private to you only and to choose what users want to see online.

&amp;#x200B;

The Brave Browser reward program gives users the option to view those ads and is compensated for 70% to see those ads that don't infringe on user privacy. These ads are displayed as notifications and options to view and are based on your browsing history.

Advertising companies pay for online ad spaces and web browsers like Brave that provide content from those people to users, the Brave software team is putting the Browser in the middle of that experience and instead of paid directly to Publishers, the advertising companies that are paying Brave are responsible for providing a portion of it to users and of course hosting a portion of it for them!

g5yjaa,itwtkhaba,Twenty One Community," 

Idea: I think we could make blockchain where 21 coins will be distributed among 21 \* 100000000 addresses generated from genesis block hash. Each address should have 0.00000001 coin.

At start we should have 2‚Äâ100‚Äâ000‚Äâ000 addresses with 0.00000001 coin at each address

We have to change bitcoin source code. All coins must be found in first block.

Coins found in frist block must be sent to 2‚Äâ100‚Äâ000‚Äâ000 addresses. 1 address should have only 0.00000001 coin.

Addresses must be generated like pseudorandom address from genesis block hash without private or public keys. We need hardcode this in source code. 

Mining only needed for including transactions to blocks. Does not imply block reward or comissions and transaction fee reward. 

Transaction fee is zero.

21 coins at all.

Everybody may pseudomine coins with brute force addresses with balances. It's the only way to pseudomine coins. I think brute force is an honest way to distribute coins among users. Every user has equal chanses. No matter how much power, coins, wealth user has. It's only luck. 

Project not seeking the way to resolve transaction problem. This project create really rare asset for value storage. 

We could change PoW to PoS or DPOS consensus. Without rewards or fees. Every wallet may be full node.

Brute forcing addresses is not a waste of time. It's a chance. 

I'm looking for people who will support my idea and help me in developing. Absolutely open source. Developers, crypto enthusiasts, anarhists, blockchain developers we all need this system let's do it together.

I may have missed some points and that would be due to my lack of knowledge and experience in the crypto space.  Some of the terms I use below are from my stock market experience. 

1.  Which crypto currencies should I consider focusing on?  In other words which cryptos are worth trading and investment in? 

2.  Which exchanges can I buy and trade on?  What exchanges are the most reliable in terms of liquidity, fast settlements, transaction safety and transparency, reasonable transaction fees, will move/transfer funds in/out quickly and easy to use.   

3.  When I buy cryptos what is the best/safest way to store them online or offline? This means prevention of loss or stealing. Which exchanges, wallets (soft or hard wallets) are the best and easy to use and understand.   

4.  Any other information that I may have missed out listing here.

However, before that I was already using bitcoin as a medium of exchange since 2012, and really shot myself when the few pennies leftover in my wallet turned into a couple pounds (I'm in the UK).

I definitely believe in BTC and will continue to for the forseeable future but my main question is for the short term is:  


* What will happen to bitcoin if there is a sudden exponential surge in purchases from a tech point of view?  For comparison, many internet providers crashed during the first couple of weeks of the lockdowns due to increased usage of the internet from people at home.

Sudden adoption of bitcoin really worries me because if purchase platforms start crashing again because their servers can't handle the work load, like when coinbase fully crashed during the 2017 spike and nobody could access their btc).  It's going to put people off and devalue it as a medium of exchange.

I don't really understand the tech behind the scalability of the lightning networks and improvements etc, but in my head I've simplified it down to:  


More people using btc = need more miners so onto the next question(s) based on this assumption:

This sentiment is not unique to oil. It goes for all physical assets, including gold. Few traders want to deal with physical bars of gold - they‚Äôre a hassle to transport, store and secure. And if demand for gold evaporates by some bizarre circumstance like the one that pushed oil negative, we might similarly see traders paying to have gold taken off their hands.

What traders want, it seems, is a pure financial asset with all the benefits of trusted value, but none of the messy physicality. What they want is Bitcoin, even if they don‚Äôt realize it yet.",1587532632,28,1

I'm sure that many of you already use a VPN or even use Mullvad yourselves, but as a TLDR, I've always been a fan of Mullvad because they:

1. Use pseudonymous, numbered accounts ([source](https://mullvad.net/en/help/no-logging-data-policy/#numbered))
2. Accept Bitcoin
3. Champion new, open technologies such as WireGuard ([source](https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2017/9/27/wireguard-future/))

However, using a Credit Card or waiting for your onchain funds to confirm before you can start using your VPN ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) really bothered me. So I whipped up a service that allows you to pay for your Mullvad VPN account using Lightning!

There‚Äôs tons of great content out there on Bitcoin and associated ideas, but what I've read all seems to have a similar structure that makes it hard for normies to read:

1. it starts with Bitcoin
2. then shows some aspect of how Bitcoin works
3. then (maybe!) shows how that aspect solves a real problem people face. 

I think we lose 70-80% of people at step #1. The ‚Äúit‚Äôs a bubble‚Äù / ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just never understand it‚Äù / ‚Äúsome internet scammers‚Äù crowd. Then at #2, people start to get bored - they have no motivation because they can‚Äôt see how this connects to their life. At #3, maybe you still have 5% around and interested. 

We can get normies to pay attention if we change the structure: 

1. Start with a real problem people face and care about
2. Dig in to the root of that problem
3. Show how a supply-constrained, globally-transactable, free-market money might solve that problem. 

Then when they approach Bitcoin, it just makes *sense*.

*Processing img w6v3l8n3zxu41...*

**Summary:** Bitcoin was invented by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto as recently as 2008, but it is backed up by a rich intellectual foundation. For instance, The 1776 First Amendment separates church and state, and contemporary American liberation psychologist Nozomi Hayase (2020) argues that money and state should similarly be separated. Just as Isaac Newton‚Äôs study of alchemy gave rise to the international gold standard, so has the anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto's desire for a ‚Äúmodernized gold standard‚Äù given rise to Bitcoin. Indeed, Bloomberg's 2020 report confirms Bitcoin to be gold 2.0. Montesquieu (1774) asserted that laws that secure inalienable rights can only be found in Nature, and the natural laws employed in Bitcoin include its consensus algorithm and the three natural laws of economics (self-interest, competition, and supply and demand). J.S. Mill (1859) preferred free markets to those controlled by governments. Ludwig von Mises (1951) argued against the hazards of fiat currency, urging for a return to the gold standard. Friedrich Hayek (1984) suggested people to invent a sly way to take money back from the hands of the government. Milton Friedman (1994) called for FED to be replaced by an automatic system and predicted the coming of a reliable e-cash. James Buchanan (1988) advocated a monetary constitution to constrain the governmental power of money creation. Tim May (1997) the cypherpunk proclaimed that restricting digital cash impinges on free speech, and envisioned a stateless digital form of money that is uncensorable. The Tofflers (2006) pictured a non-monetary economy. In 2016, UCLA Professor of Finance Bhagwan Chowdhry even nominated Satoshi for a Nobel Prize. 

**Full Text:** 

**Separation between money and state** 

The 1791 First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution enshrines free speech and separates church and state, but not money and state. ""Under the First Amendment, individuals‚Äô right to create, choose their own money and transact freely was not recognized as a part of freedom of expression that needs to be protected,"" Japanese-American liberation psychologist Nozomi Hayase (2020) points out (1). 

The government, banks and corporations collude together to encroach upon people's liberties by metamorphosing their inalienable rights into a permissioned from of legal rights. Fiat currencies function as a medium of manipulation, indulging big business to generate market monopolies. ""Freedom of expression has become further stifled through economic censorship and financial blockage [enacted](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2010/12/07/visa-mastercard-move-to-choke-wikileaks/#4e9994892cad) by payment processing companies like Visa and MasterCard,"" to borrow Hayase's (2020) words. 

**Satoshi is a Modern Newton**

Although most famous for discovering the law of gravity, Isaac Newton was also a practising alchemist. He never managed to turn lead into gold, but he did find a way to transmute silver into gold. In 1717, Newton announced in a report that, based on his studies, one gold guinea coin weighed 21 shillings. Just as Isaac Newton‚Äôs study of alchemy gave rise to the international gold standard, so has the desire for a ‚Äúmodernized gold standard‚Äù given rise to Bitcoin. ""In a way, Satoshi is a modern Newton. They both believed trust is best placed in the unchangeable facets of our economy. Beneath this belief is the assumption that each individual is their own best master,"" as put by Jon Creasy (2019) (2).   

**J.S. Mill: free markets preferable to those controlled by governments**

John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) the great English philosopher would be a Bitcoiner were he still around today. In On Liberty (1859), Mill concludes that free markets are preferable to those controlled by governments. He argues that economies function best when left to their own devices. Therefore, government intervention, though theoretically permissible, would be counterproductive. Bitcoin is precisely decentralized or uncontrolled by the government, unconfiscatable, permissonless, and disinflationary. Bitcoin regulates itself spontaneously via the ordinary operations of the system. ""Rules are enforced without applying any external pressure,"" in Hayase's (2020) words. 

**Ludwig von Mises (1958): Liberty is always Freedom from the Government**

In *The Free Market and its Enemies*, theoretical Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises (1951) argues against the hazards of fiat currency, urging for a return to the gold standard. ‚ÄúA fiat money system cannot go on forever and must one day come to an end,‚Äù Von Mises states. The solution is a return to the gold standard, ""the only standard which makes the determination of the purchasing power of money independent of the changing ideas of political parties, governments, and pressure groups"" under present conditions. Interestingly, this is also one of the key structural attributes of Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs first, global, peer-to-peer, decentralized value transfer network. 

Actually, Bloomberg's 2020 report on Bitcoin confirms that it is gold 2.0. (3)

Von Mises prefers the price of gold to be determined according to the contemporaneous market conditions. The bitcoin price is, of course, determined across the various global online exchanges, in real-time. There is no central authority setting a spot price for gold after the which the market value is settled on among the traders during the day. 

**Hayek: Monopoly on Currency should End**

Austrian-British Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek‚Äôs theory in his 1976 work, *Denationalization of Money*, was that not only would the currency monopoly be taken away from the government, but that the monopoly on currency itself should end with multiple alternative currencies competing for acceptance by consumers, in order ""to prevent the bouts of acute inflation and deflation which have played the world for the past 60 years."" He forcefully argues that if there is no free competition between different currencies within any nation, then there will be no free market. Bitcoin is, again, decentralized, and many other cryptocurrencies have tried to compete with it, though in vain.   
   
 

In a recently rediscovered video clip from 1984, Hayek actually suggested people to invent a cunning way to take money out of the hands of the government:- ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can‚Äôt take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something they can‚Äôt stop‚Äù (4). Reviewing those words 36 years hence and it is difficult not to interpret them in the light of Bitcoin.

**Milton Friedman Called for FED to be Replaced by an Automatic System** 

Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman (1994) was critical of the Federal Reserve due to its poor performance and felt it should be abolished (5). Friedman (1999) believed that the Federal Reserve System should ultimately be replaced with a computer program, which makes us think of the computer code governing Bitcoin (6).[\\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Federal_Reserve#cite_note-:2-12) He (1970) favored a system that would automatically buy and sell securities in response to changes in the money supply. This, he argued, would put a lid on inflation, setting spending and investment decisions on a surer footing (7). Bitcoin is exactly disflationary as its maximum possible supply is 21 million and its block reward or production rate is halved every four years. 

Friedman passed away before the coming of bitcoin, but he lived long enough to see the Internet‚Äôs spectacular rise throughout the 1990s. ‚ÄúI think that the Internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government,"" said Friedman in a 1999 interview with NTU/F. On the same occasion, he sort of predicted the emergence of Bitcoin, ""The one thing that‚Äôs missing, but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A."" (8) 

**‚Äú**Of course, Friedman didn**‚Äô**t predict the block chain,**‚Äù** summed up American libertarian economist Jeffery Tucker (2014). ‚ÄúBut he was hoping for a trustless system. He saw the need.**‚Äù** (9). 

**Bitcoin Computer Code as Constitution in the Buchananian Sense** 

American economist cum Nobel laureate James Buchanan (1988) advocates constitutional constraints on the governmental power to create money (10). Buchanan distinguishes a managed monetary system‚Äîa system ‚Äúthat embodies the instrumental use of  price-level predictability as a norm of policy‚Äù‚Äîfrom an automatic monetary system, ‚Äúwhich does not, at any stage, involve the absolute price level‚Äù (Buchanan 1962, 164‚Äì65). Leaning toward the latter, Buchanan argues that automatic systems are characterized by an organization ‚Äúof the institutions of private decision-making in such a way that the desired monetary predictability will emerge spontaneously from the ordinary operations of the system‚Äù (Buchanan 1962, 164). Again, ""Bitcoin regulates itself through the spontaneous force of nature, flourishing healthy price discovery and competition in the best interest of everyone"" (Hayase 2020).  

Shruti Rajagopalan (2018) argues that the computer code governing how the sundry nodes/computers within the Bitcoin network interact with one another is a kind of monetary constitution in the Buchananian sense. One of Buchanan's greatest inputs is to differentiate the choice of rules from the choice within rule (Buchanan 1990). One may regard the Bitcoin code as a sort of constitution and ""the Bitcoin network engaging in both the choice of rules and choice within rules"" (Rajagopalan 2018) (11). 

**Tim May: Restricting Digital Cash may Impinge on Free Speech**

Cypherpunks are activists who since the 1980s have advocated global use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies as a route to social and political liberation. Tim May (Timothy C. May \[1951-2018\]), one of the influential cypherpunks published ***The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto*** in September 1992, which foretold the coming of Bitcoin (12). Cypherpunks began envisioning a stateless digital form of money that cannot be censored and their collaborative pursuit created a movement akin to the 18th Enlightenment. 

At The 7th Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy, Burlingame, CA. in 1997, Tim May equated money with speech, and argued that restricting digital cash may impinge on free speech, for spending money is often a matter of communicating orders to others, to transfer funds, to release funds, etc. In fact, most financial instruments are contracts or orders, instead of physical specie or banknotes (13). 

**Montesquieu: Laws that secure inalienable rights** **can only be found in Nature** 

In his influential work The Spirit of Laws (1748), Montesquieu wrote, ‚ÄúLaws ... are derived from the nature of things ‚Ä¶ Law, like mathematics, has its objective structure, which no arbitrary whim can alter"". Similarly, once a block is added to the end of the Bitcoin blockchain, it is almost impossible to go back and alter the contents of the block, unless every single block after it on the blockchain is altered, too. 

Cypherpunks knew that whereas alienable rights that are bestowed by law can be deprived by legislation, inalienable rights are not to be created but can be discovered by reason. Thus, laws that secure inalienable rights cannot be created by humankind but can be found in nature.    

The natural laws employed in Bitcoin to enshrine the inalienable monetary right of every human being include its **consensus algorithm, and the three natural laws of economics** (self-interest, competition, and supply and demand) as identified by Adam Smith, father of modern economics. 

Regarding mathematics, bitcoin mining is performed by high-powered computers that solve complex computational math problems. When computers solve these complex math problems on the Bitcoin network, they produce new bitcoin. And by solving computational math problems, bitcoin miners make the Bitcoin payment network trustworthy and secure, by verifying its transaction information.

Regarding economic laws, in accordance with the principle of game theory to generate fairness, miners take part in an open competition. Lining up self-interests of all in a network, with a vigilant balance of risk and rewards, rules are put in force sans the application of any exterior pressure. ""Bitcoin regulates itself through the spontaneous force of nature, flourishing healthy price discovery and competition in the best interest of everyone,"" to borrow the words of Hayase (2020). 

**A Non-monetary Economy as Visualized by the Tofflers**

In their book, *Revolutionary Wealth* (2006), futurists Alvin Toffler and his wife Heidi Toffler toy with the concept of a world sans money, raising a third kind of economic transaction that is neither one-on-one barter nor monetary exchange. In the end, they settle on the idea that the newer non-monetary economy will exist shoulder-to-shoulder with the monetary sector in the short term, although the latter may eventually be eclipsed by the former in the long run. What both the Tofflers' The Third Wave (1980) and Revolutionary Wealth bring into question is the very premise of monetary exchange. The vacuum left over by cash in such a non-monetary economy may be filled up by Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency. 

**Satoshi Nakamoto Nominated for Nobel Prize by UCLA Finance Prof.** 

UCLA Anderson School Professor of Finance Bhagwan Chowdhry nominated Satoshi Nakamoto for the 2016 Nobel Prize in Economics on the following grounds:-

It is secure, relying on almost unbreakable cryptographic code, can be divided into millions of smaller sub-units, and can be transferred securely and nearly instantaneously from one person to any other person in the world with access to internet bypassing governments, central banks and financial intermediaries such as Visa, Mastercard, Paypal or commercial banks eliminating time delays and transactions costs.... Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs Bitcoin Protocol has spawned exciting innovations in the FinTech space by showing how many financial contracts ‚Äî not just currencies ‚Äî can be digitized, securely verified and stored, and transferred instantaneously from one party to another (14).

So before you judge this post, realise this isnt an atomic swap or wrapped bitcoin. This has already been achieved. No, this is real bitcoin trading against ethereum and usdc with order books etc.

I find this to be a exciting achievement because i kind of hate binance and the power centralised exchanges hold.
Bitcoin set the example of users holding assets themselfs. No need for banks. Yet these centralised exchanges more act like banks...and users store their btc there like bitcoin was made to be stored on banks.

If you want to try it yourself, head to http://nash.io/ you can trade up to 1k usd without needing KYC.
Again, you hold the keys here. And the funds are also still yours while they are in the trading contracts.

I can also understand the people who would not like the kyc requirement on the bitcoin community though, but i think its good to bring more adoption to bitcoin.
Also be aware that they are still monitoring the state channels that process these transactions, and therefore for safety put a limit of 1 btc per user on for now.

g8euxt,financeoptimum,Early Bitcoin Bull Chamath Palihapitiya Social Capital 2019 Annual Letter,"First for some context, Social Capital was founded in 2011 by former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya, whose net worth is *not* $1.2BN (it's many multiples of this according to Chamath).

The venture fund invested in a range of companies over the years, perhaps most notably of which was their investment in Slack.

In mid-2018, they closed to outside capital and became a technology holding company.

According to Chamath, this decision was made in order to take a more long term approach and avoid the perils of the short term fee generation game that is prevalent in the venture capital industry.

As always, Chamath provides some interesting insights in the [Letter](https://www.socialcapital.com/annual-letters/2019).

**Part 1/5 - Modern Gilded Age:**

First off, Chamath makes the argument that we are currently in the later stages of a modern Gilded Age.

The Gilded Age was an era of rapid economic growth in the United States from the 1870s to around 1900.

During this period there was rapid economic growth, wage growth, immigration and expansion of social programs.

The major industry of growth was the railroads, and a class division started to emerge with the 1% owning more than 25% of all property and the bottom 50% owning less than 4%.

Chamath argues that there are many similarities between the Gilded Age and today - both economic and societal.

But what came of the Gilded Age?

Well, the excesses and lopsided nature of the Gilded Age ushered in the Progressive Era, which was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States that spanned the 1890s to the 1920s.

As well as addressing the problems caused by industrialising, urbanisation, immigration and political corruption, the Progressive movement also sought regulation of monopolies (trust busting) and corporations through antitrust laws.

Of course, Chamath is not the only high profile investor to highlight the [importance of looking to the past for lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5LqCAtNJJ4).

Chamath highlights the rise of populism and the increasingly loud calls for change.

Therefore, in this context, the last few years seem very much akin to the beginning of the end of our modern Gilded Age and the beginning of a new Progressive Era.

**Part 2/5 - Tech Regulation:**

The question is: which companies will be broken up and when?

Drawing on the comparison with the Gilded Age, Chamath states that the only way to effectively reign in Big Tech is via trust busting.

He expects Big Tech to be broken up within the next 5-10 years, with Facebook being first on the list.

Chamath also highlights the importance of making sure that Big Tech doesn't find a way of helping write the regulations such that they can promote and cement their monopoly.

Moreover, Chamath describes the value created by Big Tech as an increasingly decaying function, while the need for true progress is increasing.

The combined R&amp;D budgets of Big Tech total more than $600BN in the last decade.

""Big Tech promised to change the world and eradicate its evils, but it's clear that it isn't happening as they seem more focused on protecting their monopolies than advancing humanity.""

For some context, the cost of the *entire* Apollo program was $25BN (or around $150BN in today's dollars). However, Big Tech spent $75BN on R&amp;D in *2018 alone*.

**Part 3/5 - The Market:**

Chamath then gives his take on the market, stating that central banks have exhausted their ability to meaningfully manage inflation, in either direction, but that doesn't mean that stock prices won't continue to go higher via unnecessarily cutting rates and flooding markets with money.

""Our simple framework is this: as money gets cheaper, the credit markets continue to expand because CEOs become motivated to artificially boost Earnings Per Share. They do this by buying back stock, seek bad acquisitions, make poor capital allocation decisions or avoid taxes. All enabled by borrowing massive amounts of essentially free money. It shouldn‚Äôt surprise you to know that these decisions also result in ever increasing CEO pay.""

Basically, Earnings Per Share is net profit/number of outstanding shares - so when companies buyback their own shares the number of outstanding shares decreases and therefore the denominator decreases and therefore Earnings Per Share increases.

Now because many CEOs have bonuses that are tied to hitting a certain Earnings Per Share, this leads to an obvious incentive for corporations to buyback their own stock.

It is little wonder that Corporations are the dominant source of equity demand.

In the words of Charlie Munger:

""Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.""

**Part 4/5 - VCs:**

""VCs are increasingly motivated by the incentives of up-rounds, bigger funds and fee-based compensation. The flood of fast money has created a surfeit {pronounced surf-it} of these overnight practitioners with questionable sources of capital and even more questionable backgrounds.""

""Big Tech raised a total of $1.345BN in venture capital before going public of which $1.3BN was Facebook alone. This means that Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google raised less than $45MM *combined* before IPO. Even on an inflation adjusted basis, this is incredible and tells something very important about a raft of today's startups.""

**Part 5/5 - Performance:**

It's safe to say 2019 was a pretty good year for Social Capital.

The returns in 2019 lifted their inception to date performance by more than 350bps.

Since inception in 2011, they have compounded their money 997%, beating the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends reinvested) by more than 3 times.

In 2019, they generated more than $1.7BN in cash and cash equivalents.

Chamath states that liquidity will be increasingly important over the next few years.

""Selling, when appropriate, and generating cash in a thoughtful way seems to be a prudent decision for the next several years.""

In 2019, they completed two transactions:

The first was an investment of more than $500MM into Virgin Galactic, thus creating the first and only publicly traded commercial human spaceflight company.

Chamath is tight lipped about the second company, but describes it as ""an acquisition of a venture backed company that had raised almost $100MM of traditional VC money.""

In the Letter, Chamath compares the first 8 years of Social Capital to the first 8 years of Berkshire Hathaway.

However, [even Chamath agreed that the Berkshire Hathaway comparison was slightly misleading](https://twitter.com/bornaVC/status/1237181119277088768) \- as the ratio of Berkshire Hathaway performance to the S&amp;P 500 was around double the ratio of Social Capital to the S&amp;P 500 over their respective periods.

Nonetheless, still pretty good!

g8ehhd,AussieBitcoiners,Accidentally sent LTC from exchange to BTC address in my Trezor. And was able to recover.,"Accidentally sent LTC from exchange to BTC address in my Trezor. And was able to recover.

If you have done the same mistake, this few lines will help you.

1. Don't be stressed. The LTCs are recoverable, as long as you have got your trezor. If you have sent to another exchange, that would be different issue and will depend on the destination exchange's customer support.
2. Apparently this is a common mistake. That was the reason new LTC addresses start with M rather that 3. I wish there was a hint in the withdrawal page of the exchange, asking me to make sure my LTC address is starting with 3 not M.
3. The solutions I found where involved extracting the private key for the address you have used and then importing that address to a LTC wallet that allows you to import keys. This would expose your private key, which is not good.
4. Better solution is to use Electrum-LTC wallet which is able to use Trezor and with a little tweak you will be able to see and transfer the LTCs without exposing your mnemonics or private key.

Wallet: give a name to your wallet -&gt; Next

standard wallet -&gt; Next

use a hardware device -&gt; Next

Select your trezor -&gt; Next

Put your passphrase if you have one -&gt;

Select p2sh-segwit and override the derivation path of m/49'/2'/0' with m/49'/0'/0' -&gt; Next

Encypt wallet file is ticked -&gt; Next

5. I couldn't find where did I read this solution. I am thanksful of it. And would like to share this so that this solution could be found easier. Please help spreading it.

Now you are ready. Look at the History tab, you should be able to see your LTCs there. Now Click Send and transfer them to a new proper LTC address.",1587908267,1,1

g8d5ts,jackvince000,Could Bitcoin be used as a basis to attach future fiat currencies to it?,"I have recently been doing a little research into the history of money. In particular I was interested in how the currency of today is no longer linked to gold or silver. For the US this was until Nixon completely abolished the gold standard in the early 70s. If the Romans used gold as their coinage, this could be the same as us using bitcoin at the moment (seeing as there is a limited amount of bitcoin) 

With that said, could we therefore see countries create notes for bitcoin rather than gold? I guess perhaps not due to bitcoin being digital so it‚Äôs easy to carry (mobile device), unlike gold was back in the day. 

Although an excuse to do this could then free a country from the bitcoin and therefore allow it to print money from its central bank? 

There is probably lots of gaps in my understanding here but I‚Äôm interested in hearing your views on the topic.",1587902432,5,1

This brought me to find Bitcoin. I have been through all the ups and downs from the last year but one aspect always has me worried about and for Bitcoin. Bicoin is basically  stock which is pegged to dollar price. When you buy something nobody says; ""That will be 2 satoshis."" They say send me $100 *dollars* in Bitcoin.

Now Bitcoin in not the part that worries me. The United States government just printed a shit ton more of money. I do not think that the government will be on the verge of a collapse just yet because there is too much to lose behind the United States going bankrupt. But, what if, they did go bankrupt tomorrow? Surly  Bitcoin will not be far behind due to the fact it is basically rated in dollars. If I am not understanding something correctly please explain but this is the only fault and downside that I can personally see to Bitcoin that worries me.",1587871915,7,1

g872b4,The90sWereRad,Reminder: Check your old emails or apps for forgotten crypto,"After having a conversation with my parents today about bitcoin, I remembered I had once sent myself my wallet info via email to many old addresses, most of which I no longer have access to.

But in my searching I came across emails from an app I once used called ""circle pay"".  
The service as it existed then has since shut down, but they had put whatever I had left in my account aside and when i regained access to my account it prompted me for addresses to send my remaining balances to.

Before you get excited you should know I stopped using the account in 2015-ish and left nothing in there. Nothing but 25 cents. That original 25 cents worth of BTC (0.001xxxxx btc)  was accompanied by an equal amount in Bitcoin Cash AND in Bitcoin SV. Currently worth just under 10$ total.

But imagine if one of you had something in there forgotten like I did. It could be worth sooo much more!

I understand that we can openly share the public key, like the bitcoin address. Because there is no way to extract private key from public key.

 I understand that I have the back up for my private keys. But still don't feel very safe.

I mean, let's say, by any chance, someone stole my back up phrase, then they can easily steal my crypto and I don't even know it until I check my balance. I know I have to keep my back up phrase safe and private, but there is a chance right? 

Other than that, what if, by such a small probability that someone draw 24 random words from BIP39 word list, and it happens to be the same with my back up phrase? I know the probability is very very very low, but still, not 0, right?

I am thinking that, is it possible, in future, crypto like bitcoin, incorporate another layer of security besides private key witness, for example, when anybody move my bitcoin with my private key (I mean the move on blockchain, not within exchange), I will receive an email notification immediately, which has an approval link. Without clicking the approval link, my crypto still can not be spent although it was signed by private key. Just like withdraw from binance or coinbase. Google authenticator is the first layer, the link in email is the second layer. Is it possible in the near future? Or any crypto work like this way please?",1587671196,4,1

And I am sharing this because I want to make peace with myself and go full on on fixing my mistake by raising awareness about this types of scams and would like some thoughts on how can something like this fixed and taken down, if I am not naive again to think that this would be possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Shall we start this fun journey? \*disclaimer: am fully taking this as the most expensive lesson I got and not here to victimize myself\*

1. Found someone on instagram promising 100% returns. -&gt; \*knew it was a scam, still wanted to try\* had some money laying around \*not the case anymore\* . She told me where and how to send, then she came back saying she didn't got the funds. -&gt; later on I checked blockchain and the transaction actually got there.
2. I was cool with this, ok it's a scam, been there done that. I stopped, and here it all started to went wrong. I was told it would work even with a small deposit so around 250$ would do.
3. ""For your benefit and my benefit also, a higher starting point gives better returns"". And so much insistenced. Another 200$ gone and that's when I said this is it. I am already over the 700$ which I was ok with losing.
4. A week later, being given access to my investing account and oh well, it had round 12500$ profit. Oh well, never have I seen so much money in an account and thought, well, I was wrong and this is legit.
5. Withdrawal time: I knew that she would ask for 20% from profit which I didn't mind giving FROM the profit. But that was supposed to be given before, well, here I fcked up big time. 
6. Firstly, I knew I won't send, but oh man have I been persuaded to take a loan for this. Truth be told, my greed was way stronger than the voice of reason.
7. Cool, I succeed the withdrawal. Then a mail I received said there is an inter remit fee to be paid and the money will be release from escrow in 5 hours. 1.8k which I didn't have.
8. At that moment I trusted the so called investor, and even asked for a loan from here, she told me she could give 800 dollars\*\*\*\*, so 1k I paid.
9. Waited and waited for my withdrawal to be processed.
10. Later on, I fcked up even worse with not learning about btc before investing in btc. The wallet id used for withdrawal, changed because I have used it to add money for the fee above.
11. Had to pay another 1k fee to change that address, sum which was negotiated with kindness by my dear investor. 
12. Blockchain scam, this was one of the most hurtful things I have ever been through in my entire life, psychologically speaking. I was asked to give my wallet ID and password. After 2 hours I gave it to them, with taking some measurements and made a promise to myself never to use it again after this \*I know it's stupid you don't have to tell me\*
13. I had the money, in unsable wallet IDs , no private key given &lt; this psychologically killed me, let me say this 
14. When asked about this, \*sadly, just this late have I been snapped back to reality\* that if it's too good to be true, it is\*. they asked for 850 in blockchain for the private key to be activated.
15. This is it.

Let me say that I could've stopped at any moment, but there was that mindset that I have already lost so much\* Let me go through with it. \*maybe it really is legit\*. 

The thing is, I may not be the brightest person in a room, I surely am not, but what I did here, is way below.

\*\*\*\* she didn't really send those money.

\*\*\*\*\* 12k possible win -&gt; 6k + loss and this sum is huge for a middle class not so bright human in the country I live

Now, is there anything I could do? to get some funds back, so that website gets taken down? prvent this from happening to anyone else?

Today and yesterday the Bolivar plummeted, exchange rate was around 130,000 Bs. / USD at the time writing this post it is around 200,000 Bs/ USD. 

53% devaluation in one day.

LocalBitcoin keeps trading around 500-600 BTC weekly. These are really big volumens considering the actual economy and it is only one exchange. The source, I think remmintances from families abroad, some private companies, miners (goverment iself too). 

This week situation has worsened. Today my fathers got in ther accounts their retirment monthly payment. Only 1.2 USD. Yes, you read it right it is 250,000 Bs.

A lot of people don't believe the wages we have here. 

For example, a good wage (like airline pilot) is around 200 USD per month.

The Venezuelan  engineers college suggest a 200 USD per month wage for a starting Engineer, good luck finding a place thay pays that, here you can see (March, exchange rate was aroun 80,000 Bs. per USD) 

[http://www.civ.net.ve/uploaded\_pictures/69\_d.pdf](http://www.civ.net.ve/uploaded_pictures/69_d.pdf)

There is some kind of knowledge about cryptos because the goverment has their own ""crypto"" called Petro. Problem it was a bad proyect and with no trust, its value in their (goverment) own exchanges is less than 15% than the intented value (they did an airdrop, everyone wants to see, no one wants to buy), so they dont know what to do. Their idea was like a stablecoin with a fixed price of 60 USD. Failure.

Most people isnt working because the pandemic, I got my monthly wage cut, it barely last considering I have to help my parents.

g9x7w2,slvbtc,Money is just a social contract and bitcoin is the best way to implement that social contract.,"Money is simply a system used to enforce a social contract between people who do not trust each other using a set of rules to enable commerce and cooperation.

These three rules state;

1) Irrefutably how much value a person holds.

2) A persons value cannot be faked or forged.

3) Transacting that value cannot be reversed or redacted after the fact.

First we used Gold minted into authenticated coinage as this represented a physical way to fulfill these rules. Gold could not be forged or faked or undone or reversed. Its use represented absolute certainty that you were receiving true irreversible value for your goods and services.

Then we moved to fiat, which has been an absolute disaster due to the fact it is constantly faked and forged and inflated and censored.

Then came bitcoin, it also just like gold represents a system used to enforce a social contract between people who do not trust each other using a set of rules to enable commerce and cooperation.

Bitcoin, instead of achieving this social contract and set of rules by using a physical item, it uses a decentralized algorithmic protocol of immutable rules that everyone has to abide by in order to use the system itself.

Bitcoin just like gold cannot be forged or faked or undone or reversed, it also cannot be inflated or censored. Bitcoin is a system that enforces a social contract in order to enable trust between untrusted parties which in turn allows for commerce and cooperation to take place.

It does not matter if this social contract is represented by a physical item like gold or a software protocol like bitcoin so long as it can't be manipulated by anyone. In fact, using an internet based global digital software protocol to implement a social contract is far superior than trying to use a geographically constrained physical item like a gold coin.

Bitcoin is the best method humanity has ever invented to achieve the social contract of value and money.",1588113109,5,1

I thought that this might be of interest to some of you here. The article details the first instance of a computational physics simulation being performed entirely within a blockchain virtual machine. In this case the experiment was a proof-of-principle study using a simple harmonic potential to model the trajectory of a vibrating carbon monoxide molecule. I have also discussed the potential potential benefits of this type of calculation in terms of censorship resistance, reproducibility and provenance in theoretical scientific work.

g9wwze,The90sWereRad,Diversity in your Crypto Wallet (Altcoins?),"We've all heard it before.

Diversity is an important part of any financial/investment plan. It's good to keep your finances spread out to prevent a single loss from affecting you too greatly or a variety of other reasons/explanations.

At the same time, that doesn't seem to translate so well when it comes to bitcoin. At least judging from the r/Bitcoin sub comments which tend to be ""bitcoin or bust"" for the majority.

**I'm interested in hearing what the rest of you think about having diversity in your crypto wallet and how you go about handling that.**

Personally, my main goal is to own at least 1 full  bitcoin again. At the same time I'm trying to play the smart game for the long term, and I have a little bit in BCH and ETH. Especially seeing as how when bitcoin was at it's peak, even if only worth \~20-25% of BTC, BCH was still worth a pretty good amount.

g9tqai,Ghostcarapace3,Some scenarios to crash the US dollar over the next year...,"Scenario 1 (the banksters):

So, the fed has pretty much stated that it is willing to do \*whatever it takes\* to prop up the stock market. At the same time, stock dividends are paying record low amounts. The fed wades into the stock market, and starts buying stocks DIRECTLY attempting to pump up the value. Only problem is that while they are doing this, they are inflating the dollar. This means those dividends are not worth it, and there are better places to put money. (hello staking coins). As a result, stock prices go higher and higher, until the market runs out of sellers. 

The fed is left holding a bunch of stocks that nobody will buy, and the people are left holding a bunch of dollars that are not worth anything anymore. Lose/Lose. 

Scenario 2 (The Politicians):

Covid ends up being used as an excuse to cancel in person voting because \*its just too dangerous\* (which is true) Instead, only mail in ballots will be accepted! Only problem? The postal service has been cancelled! Donald wins via mass voter suppression, and crazy ideas like lindsey graham's treasury default to china go into play. A treasury debt default occurs, the US credit rating is downgraded to junk status, and investors start demanding serious $$$ returns to account for the risk. US dollars are printed to the moon to service the debt. 

Scenario 3 (The petrodollar):

Covid winds up wiping oil out hard. The world does not quickly recover, and oil stops being the major commodity it once was. Oil production crashes after the world runs out of storage, and the decoupling of the dollar from energy causes a major shift in world outlook on the need to not be under us sanctions.

g9tazb,msl2008,Grayscale GBTC BTC Holdings Still Increasing in April,"So I have been following GBTC as a way to gauge institutional interest in BTC.  In Q1 2020, Grayscale attracted $500 million while in all of 2019 it attracted $600 million.

[https://sports.yahoo.com/grayscale-says-raised-record-500m-130346543.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/grayscale-says-raised-record-500m-130346543.html) 

I also follow the Grayscale twitter which updates each day it's Assets under management (AUM).  From there, I believe you can calculate how much BTC it holds by dividing the AUM by the holdings per share and then multiplying it to account for each share equaling .0001 BTC.

https://twitter.com/GrayscaleInvest   


From that I put together this spreadsheet:

https://preview.redd.it/1tiap7k9wlv41.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9089c248c69db2177ab76348ec5374a007a5a68e

What is interesting to me is that from Nov-Dec 31, 2019, the holdings of BTC only went up by 56.  However each month in 2020 GBTC has increased it's BTC holdings by at least 9k a month, including April (from 315k to 324k).  I expected April BTC holdings to go down as funds liquidated but that doesn't seem to have happened.  

This next picture shows the % of newly mined BTC Grayscale bought in 2020.  Assuming demand stays the same, Grayscale will be buying at least 40% of newly minted BTC.  Just one entity that doesn't include exchanges, rich people, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/thoxz7yiwlv41.png?width=561&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=536aed4fe53dea1aed04c886a33a9e08a4b530f7

So from this information, it seems like an easy supply/demand problem.  If demand stays the same, supply gets cut in half, price should go up.  And I feel like Covid-19 has accelerated the interest in bitcoin as central banks around the world have started printing to infinity and beyond.

Not sure if I made a mistake analyzing this information so any other opinions would be helpful.  Just something I put together real quick that I thought was interesting and makes me think bitcoin is attracting strong interest still.",1588100684,45,2

https://preview.redd.it/e3frgp871kv41.jpg?width=737&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42e346ddffc9d9673129c533fb46fd0f20460b2f

## 3 days ago, China launched Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN), which, coupled with the digital Yuan, a pilot version of which was launched in mid-April, will accomplish what Huawei has failed to do -- to infiltrate, monitor and control the entire world in all human activities, e.g. finance, technology, health, insurance, entertainment, social media, voting. The only antidote is worldwide adoption of truly decentralized and uncensored blockchains and Bitcoin. 

## BSN Covers 6 Continents!

## On April 25th, the Chinese authorities announced the launching of Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN), aka ChinaChain. It is a cross-cloud, cross-portal, cross-underlying-framework, global infrastructure network jointly initiated and set up by State Information Center (SIC), state-owned firms China UnionPay, China Mobile and Red Date for deploying and operating various kinds of blockchain applications (1). IOST is the first overseas blockchain network to be taken on board of BSN (2). Now there are already 128 city nodes across the country, and 8 BSN portals including 7 respectively located in California, Johannesburg, Paris, Tokyo, Sydney,  Singapore, and San Paulo. It is going to be applied in all trades, e.g., technology, finance, banking, health, insurance, social media, entertainment, issuing of passports, land registries, tax collection, law, voting. 

## BSN is even more Invasive than Huawei

## Let's face it:- we are headed for a global digital economy. As neither the USA not Europe has yet established such an enormous blockchain infrastructure consortium, China will enjoy the first mover's advantage in the space. While Huawei has been rejected by America and many Western countries for security reasons, BSN is now an even more powerful plan to infiltrate and control the entire world in practically all domains. 

## Virus Implanted?

## According to Bloomberg (April 15), China's Central Bank has just launched a pilot digital Yuan in 4 cities, using blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin. For instance, in Xiang-cheng, Suzhou, all employees will have to download a state-controlled digital wallet by May and all wages will be paid in digital Yuan from then on. Every penny spent by you will be scrutinized and censored by the CCP. And a spyware may be implanted in the digital Yuan wallet and/or ledger so that anybody, not just Chinese but also Westerners, who transact in digital RMB, will be affected and subject to surveillance by the CCP. Now, with BSN, this will not be limited to transactions in digital RMB. Instead, it will be extended to all sectors, all fields, all human activities all over the world.

## Rejection of Libra + Blockchain Advocacy + Covid19

## On October 24, Facebook's proposal to launch the cryptocurrency Libra was rejected by the U.S. Congress. On October 25, Chairman Xi Jinping announced that China will go all-in on blockchain. On November 17, 2019, a China-man from Hubei, carrying the covid19 virus, began to spread it across the globe, according to South China Morning Post. Bitboy Crypto on April 28, 2020 wonders whether all these are just coincidental, or they constitute a conspiracy on the part of China to beat the free world financially, technologically, and biologically (3). 

## What is Blockchain?

## Blockchain, the technology underlying Bitcoin, is an electronic ledger distributed across and managed by peer-to-peer networks. It can exist without a centralized authority or server managing it, and its data quality can be maintained by database replication and computational trust. 

## The First Blockchain 

## The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. 

## A Mutated Blockchain

## The information stored in a normal blockchain is immutable. But the Chinese government favors a unique blockchain called EOS, wherein all transactions and governance decisions are processed and approved by only 21 main nodes known as supernodes, rather than numerous nodes distributed all over the world. Twelve of the EOS supernodes are in China. This makes it easier for the CCP to control blockchains, since the penalty of noncompliance with Chinese regulations is high for China-based supernodes.

## The Only Antidote 

## ""Tomorrow is now"" (Eleanor Roosevelt 1962) . The decentralized, permissionless, and disinflationary Bitcoin is now the only thing in the world that can counteract the digital RMB, and urgent, extensive adoption of uncensored blockchain networks is the only solution to BSN hegemony.

Ever. Approximately 4 million have been permanently [LOST](https://fortune.com/2017/11/25/lost-bitcoins/), bringing the maximum circulating total to 17 million. This total number won't be reached until 2140 due to Bitcoin's [issuance schedule](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply). This is ""quantitative hardening.""

Total number of millionaires (in USD value) worldwide is around 33 million ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/22/12-million-new-millionaires-will-be-minted-over-the-next-five-years.html)).

The factual math is simple: there is not enough Bitcoin in the world for even HALF of today's millionaires to own just ONE SINGLE BITCOIN. Much less all the future millionaires that will be born as the human population approaches [10bn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population).

Bitcoin is SCARCE. Check out the [S2F model](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25) for a good explanation of why scarcity and value correlate. Recently updated to the [S2FX model](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/bitcoin-stock-to-flow-cross-asset-model-50d260feed12) for a model that incorporates more data, and is more accurate. 

Furthermore: If you are able to acquire even one BTC today: Enjoy the feeling. You are an early adopter. And one of a **very** select number of humans. Owning just ONE BTC means that you are--at minimum--in the top 0.2% ([17M / 8Bn \* 100](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=(17,000,000/8,000,000,000)*100&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8)) of the human population in terms of total possible bitcoin wealth distribution. The percentage is much lower than that, of course, given that there are lots of whales out there with 1000+ BTC each.

Edit: And never-mind the idiots that will say something asinine like ""my pubic hairs are limited in number too...does that make them valuable?"" Your pubic hairs have zero network utility, whereas every day Bitcoin proves it has extraordinary utility as (perhaps) the most perfect form of money humans have yet created.

Stack those sats!

That is all.",1588221850,146,1

gap31n,theanxiousbandit,Should you buy or should you sell?,"The truth is that there's no right answer.

If you're a first time investor, only put it what you can afford to lose. Especially when the market is overbought due to market sentiment. 

For everyone else, evaluate your individual risk profiles. If you can afford to take a higher risk, by all means, stay in the market. If you can't, pull out.

Don't tank all your savings into this. Just don't. No matter what anyone tells you.

If you decide to pull out and BTC rises, don't beat yourself about it because you did what you thought was right.
Similarly, if you stay in and it tanks, don't beat yourself about it.

BTC could hit 13k levels in the near future. It could also correct to around 8k levels and stay here for a while.
Whatever you do, don't just go with the flow. Evaluate your risk profile and make whatever decision is best for you.

gama4m,The-Animus,Which of these buying options is best for maintaining anonymity?,"I want to make my first bitcoin purchase and have been trying to do my own research but would like to confirm with those more knowledgeable and experienced than me regarding remaining anonymous.

Here are a few of the ways I understand that you can remain anonymous, either completely or at the very least the end wallet being used to purchase things with BTC.

1. I buy from a BTC ATM. The ATM I would use requires sms verification so I'd have to either:
1.A - Buy a prepaid phone so my normal phone number and therefor name aren't attached to the transaction. Downside to this would seem to be the markup fee, the time spent physically going to do this, and that it would probably make sense not to take my normal phone with me otherwise it could show i was at that location at the time the machine was used.
1.B - Buy it using my normal phone number and then use a mixer/coinjoin to transfer it to a different electrum wallet that uses a tor proxy to keep my IP hidden. Downside again is the markup fee, the time spent, and the additional cost of mixing the coins.

2. Buy from P2P marketplace by either:
2.A - Cash through the mail. Downsides seem to be markup fee, potential of cash being lost in the mail, or the person taking the money and not giving the BTC.
2.B - Bank Deposit. Downside again the markup fee, the person taking the money not giving BTC, but also it seems like more banks require ID even to deposit cash into someone else's account so might not be anonymous anyways unless I then mix into a different wallet.

3 - Buy from a normal exchange using a credit/debit card or bank account and then use mixer/coinjoin to transfer it into a different wallet.

I'm not really familiar with how much it costs or how complicated it is to do a mixer/coinjoin type thing. The markup fees for the others seem to typically be in the 7-15% range. So if mixing is relatively cheap it seems like avoiding the markup by buying directly from an exchange and then mixing would be better value while still maintaining end wallet anonymity.

Is this more or less accurate? Opinions from those more knowledgeable would be awesome.

Thanks for your help!",1588209994,5,1
gam2t5,s_kardos,2020 and beyond...,"The crypto niche is filled with small market cap coins and projects which can be easily manipulated by these group of scammers. An uptrend in the digital heists of virtual currencies has left many cryptocurrency investors wondering if they have any options for tracing illicit bitcoin transactions and recovering their stolen funds. The short answer is that '*it‚Äôs nearly impossible and difficult*‚Äô. The long answer is that ongoing developments in the regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrency may offer victims more recourse going forward. Those who have fallen victim to cryptocurrency heists either through mismanaged exchanges or hacks have the option of filing a complaint with the FBI‚Äôs Cyber Crime Unit or several anti-graft / law enforcement agencies. There has been precedent for people coming together to sue the wallet provider/exchange after they've lost their coins. If the victim can argue that there was negligence on the part of the wallet provider rather than the hackers getting access to the victim‚Äôs wallet through their own (the victim‚Äôs) system, then they'll have a case.¬†¬†An obstacle in going this route is the lack of emphasis placed on recovering stolen bitcoin; till date, there is yet to be sufficient legislation on illegal infiltration and access of an exchange or electronically siphoning digital currency. Broadly speaking, law enforcement agencies remain undecided as to whether or not stealing digital currency constitutes a ''CLASS A'' crime but the good news is that there are individuals and cryptography agencies out there that do a good job with bitcoin and other cryptocurrency recovery, using a permanent divergence in the blockchain network called 'Hard Forking' which makes previously valid blocks and transactions invalid, or vice-versa. I did not believe this to be possible till [Crypto Assist](mailto:jpcolerangle@cryptoassist.us) recovered some bitcoins stolen from my PC on [March 24 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/g15e9d/i_ran_out_of_stock_on_march_24_2020_and_had_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Even many advanced cryptocurrency users can recall an incident when they failed to double-check their transaction details and they accidentally sent funds to the wrong recipient, or sent the wrong amount.

So for that to happen. Bitcoin would have to reach $150,000 per bitcoin. And that to me just seems farfetched. 

So basically my viewpoint is... Bitcoin is no different than any other single stock. Performing at maybe 20-30% returns over the next 10+ years (cumulative growth) with some occasional crazy spikes of 50-80% profits and losses. But if that's the case, why not throw it in an Index fund and forget about it? Less stress, less memes, seems like a happier life to me. 

Any thoughts?

fyrnwy,Shaggidy,Bitcoin‚Äôs (PoW) Overlooked Advantage,"The overlooked importance of a cryptocurrency‚Äôs distribution method.
 

Often the confirmation method and it‚Äôs efficiency is considered and promoted as the biggest advantage to competitors of a decentralized asset. This is true with some use-cases but as an overall asset that promotes economic freedom without over sacrificing increased inequality the distribution method plays the key role.


Inequality

Economic freedom increases as central control decreases. With any increase in economic freedom there is a period of inequality due to slow redistribution when holding outweighs usage. 


Centrally Controlled Distribution

Ripple is an example of a cryptocurrency that uses a centrally controlled distribution method with a top down approach to adoption. By controlling distribution and expecting XRP adoption to occur through investments by wealthy financial institutions they are providing those with the deepest pockets the first opportunity to buy and save their assets rather than redistribute. This significantly increases long term inequality among the assets distributed because the wealthiest are less likely to sell to cover expenses making redistribution a slower process. This distribution method increases inequality similar to the Cantillon effect. This process resembles the distribution flow of fiat money.


Proof of Stake Distribution Method

POS normally starts with an ICO giving the wealthy first chance at accumulating large amounts of the future released cryptocurrency. After distribution, those invested are actually rewarded with newly distributed coins providing incentive to hold rather than redistribute. This is the ultimate case of a distribution method that promotes economic inequality by rewarding the rich for not selling which naturally increases demand until the wealthy are willing to redistribute at a highly inflated price.


Proof of Work

PoW has a bottom up distribution method with a built in mechanism that promotes redistribution through incurred costs during the mining process. Often the energy used to mine cryptocurrencies is used to portray a flaw in the system. But, the energy used to produce PoW cryptocurrencies costs money and those expenses encourage redistribution. POW is incomparable to any other distribution system among cryptocurrencies because it not only enhances economic freedom, it does it while reducing the amount of time it takes to lessen inequality. 


Tech or Asset?

When analyzing a cryptocurrency you can‚Äôt just look at the efficiency of the validation method. With technology this is an important characteristic, but when evaluating an actual asset the distribution model is possibly the most important factor and is often overlooked.",1586561659,0,1

""..the whole of economics can be
reduced to a single lesson, and that lesson can be reduced to a single
sentence: ***The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but
at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups***.

Nine-tenths of the economic fallacies that are working such dreadful
harm in the world today are the result of ignoring this lesson.
Those fallacies all stem from one of two central fallacies, or both: that
of looking only at the immediate consequences of an act or proposal,

fylj7c,CryptigoVespucci,Bitcoin overview from a wild Q1 - TLDR: Still standing,"With clear skies ahead, halving abound, and momentum from an 84% rise in 2019, Bitcoin started the year on a tear. In the first 45 days of 2020 Bitcoin rose more than 45%, reaching a high of $10,362. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs fate soon changed as fears of the coronavirus began impacting financial markets globally.

Amidst the broader market sell-off, Bitcoin found itself not immune. The long hailed, albeit weak idea that Bitcoin would remain uncorrelated in a time of crisis was shattered, as Bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with the S&amp;P 500 reached all-time highs.

**Black Thursday**

The liquidity crisis was so severe that Bitcoin experienced one of it‚Äôs worst single day declines ever. In what will now be remembered as Black Thursday, on March 12, Bitcoin plummeted as much as 50% to its lowest point on the day.

The sell-off was so violent that [**cryptocurrency market structure broke**](https://multicoin.capital/2020/03/17/march-12-the-day-crypto-market-structure-broke/) due to a cascade of large liquidations on derivatives exchanges. On BitMEX alone, a total of $1.6 billion of leveraged long positions were liquidated, wiping out nearly all the leverage in the market. At one point in the crisis, there were only $20 million of bids remaining on the BitMEX order book between Bitcoin and $0. BitMEX was forced to go into ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù due to the crisis.

https://preview.redd.it/imaf9ixe91s41.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de668941de320aad38b742e64bb584e28630cca2

The turmoil was felt throughout the Bitcoin mining economy as well, which experienced its own deleveraging event. With mining revenue halved overnight and the prospects of a Bitcoin halving rally uncertain, many miners found themselves overleveraged, uncompetitive, and mining at a loss. In the days after Black Thursday, as much as 23% of hash power went offline at its lows.

https://preview.redd.it/x8ezg8bh91s41.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba9b35f3e08ed1f1641cb99eb7c4b9189e9eced6

The hash rate crash caused Bitcoin‚Äôs daily average block times to spike over 15 minutes per block, leading to Bitcoin‚Äôs [**2nd largest downward adjustment ever**](https://messari.io/article/a-historic-difficulty-adjustment).

https://preview.redd.it/vrranyoj91s41.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e9180ce0913c446e863cc38cc167cd69fc2dfa0

All the above action was great for exchanges. The spike in volatility led to some of the highest Bitcoin trading volumes ever in both spot and futures markets.

The near-term outlook for Bitcoin is as uncertain as it's ever been; however, Bitcoin may also be the best positioned it's ever been for a rally. The silver lining of Bitcoin‚Äôs Black Thursday is that it flushed nearly all the leverage out the system, leading to more healthy investment and mining markets. Furthermore, [**according to CoinMetrics data**](https://coinmetrics.substack.com/p/coin-metrics-state-of-the-network-30a), most the selling came from younger UXTOs, indicating that the majority of the selling was driven by short-term speculators, rather than long-term holders who remain convicted in the face of recent volatility.

While Bitcoin‚Äôs correlations with the broader markets have been disappointing for some given the price direction, the phenomena marks perhaps the first time Bitcoin has responded to the broader macroeconomic environment - a key milestone along its adoption curve. With central banks flooding the world with money, modern monetary theory taking center stage, emerging markets in the early stages of currency crises, and [**moral hazard**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moralhazard.asp) entering public consciousness again, Bitcoin may be having its moment.

Ok so I‚Äôve been reading threads and trying to learn, but I could not find anything that answered this question. As per Many recommendations here, First I download cashapp as the place I was going to buy my bitcoin then I need my wallet where I‚Äôm going to store my btc and I download BRD. These looked like the two simplest options for people just starting out like me. I haven‚Äôt bought any btc yet, just creating accounts etc and poking around, trying to learn. 
I notice BRD also allows you to buy btc, but that is almost never discussed in these threads. Is there any benefits over buying it in cashapp or some other place then moving it to BRD instead of just buying it in BRD and storing it in your wallet there?

fykz5r,AdmirableWallrust,Best way to self implement accepting Bitcoin on a website?,"We have an e-commerce website and would love to accept Bitcoin payments without going through a third party payment solution. What would be the best way to do this? (We have good very IT savy guys in the company and good knowledge on how Bitcoin works without being crazy experts). What is the best solution in terms of safety / usability when it come to linking a payment to a customer?

We have thought of the following possibilities:

a) Have one address in a hardware wallet that receives payments and tie a payment to a customer via the exact amount of BTC deposited

b) Generate one address per customer. What we don't like about this, is that the private keys would have to be on the server generating them, thus being more vulnerable to attacks. It would obviously be beasier to link a payment to a customer though.

c) Some other possibility we havent thought of?

fsqpvh,Cramson_Sconefield,Bitcoin vs Gold,"With central banks around the world debasing their currencies by printing money out of thin air, I have been giving increasingly more thought on converting my assets into hard money. The debate that rages on in my head is which is the superior hard money. Gold, the standard for hard money that has withstood the test of time over millennia, or Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs first decentralized cryptocurrency. Here are my thoughts.  

**Intrinsic Value**

Gold is often toted as being superior to Bitcoin because gold, unlike Bitcoin, has intrinsic value as a commodity. That is, there is gold demand for purposes outside the functions of money. Gold is used in a variety of industries such as dentistry, electronic hardware, aerospace, jewelry, glass-making and more. This means that gold will have value whether or not gold is being used as money. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no intrinsic value. If people do not accept Bitcoin‚Äôs monetary functions then it has no value.  

However, if we accept Bitcoin as money, then the fact that it has no intrinsic value is a significant positive. A money founded on something of intrinsic value will always be subject to supply shocks. For example, imagine that demand for gold has been increasing steadily as the aerospace industry expands and gobbles up more gold. Then one day, our brilliant scientists come up with an alloy that renders the functions of gold in aerospace obsolete. The value of gold begins to drop rapidly as we no longer buy gold for aerospace and begin to melt down the existing gold components. The value of gold will always fluctuate based on the demand for its monetary ***and*** intrinsic properties. Bitcoin has the luxury of not being subject to intrinsic volatility.  

In summary, I have some fear of people abandoning Bitcoin as money and as it has no intrinsic value, I could end up with nothing. However, the fact that it has no intrinsic value means that Bitcoin is resistant to supply shocks, making it a superior money with little chance of the demand dropping to zero.

**Confiscation**  

To me, the threat of confiscation is a real one. The United States, Great Britain and Australia have all passed legislation in the past [forbidding the ownership of gold](https://goldsilver.com/blog/gold-confiscation-history-myths-and-real-solutions/). Citizens were required to exchange their gold for government paper. In the United States, failure to comply could have netted you a 10 year prison sentence.  

Today private ownership of gold is allowed, but I am not positive this will remain the case. The political climate is becoming dangerous. The wealthy (and wealth creation itself) are increasingly demonized and cries for socialism and wealth distribution are growing ever louder. This coupled with an imminent economic collapse make ripe conditions to destroy wealth, through both inflation and confiscation.  

Already I have concerns. If I convert my savings into gold and try to fly from China to the United States, will the government harass me or potentially even confiscate my gold holdings in the future? Even now, the US Customs and Border Protection state that I have to *declare currency and monetary instruments in excess of $10,000*, failure to do so may [result in seizure](https://clearitusa.com/u-s-customs-cash-limit/). With Bitcoin I have no concern. No government can go through my bags and find Bitcoin to confiscate. As far as my understanding of Bitcoin goes, there is no, or very very little, risk of confiscation. Please correct me here if I am wrong.

**Divisibility &amp; Distribution**

In terms of divisibility and ease of transfer, there is no debate that Bitcoin is infinitely superior. I am looking into making my first purchase of gold and damn is it a pain in the ass. If I wish to purchase it online at a place such as Schiff Gold, I would need a couple of months, at least, before I could hold my tiny gold bar. They suggest that I store any gold I purchase in their Singapore vault, but then I don‚Äôt feel like it is truly my gold and would have to pay storage fees. If I wish to purchase it here in China, I need to set up an appointment at a bank, and as much as I love China, I hate the idea of handing over my info to state run banks to make a gold purchase. Also I‚Äôm confined to purchasing units of 10g, 20g, 50g, 100g, 1kg. There is no easy way for me to purchase a value amount that is perfectly suitable for me.  

All this being said, to me gold has one large advantage and that is its history and global distribution. Central banks around the world have massive gold reserves and it is common for everyday citizens to hold a little gold in wedding bands and other jewelry. Everybody knows and understands gold has value. It may be quite sometime before Bitcoin can achieve the same status. Already countries such as [Russia and China](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-russian-and-chinese-central-banks-will-keep-buying-gold-2019-09-13) have been increasing their gold reserves, undoubtedly preparing for an event where fiat money collapses and the world goes back to a hard money standard. Clearly the bet of these governments is a gold standard. And why not? It is what the world used for thousands of years and governments around the world already have large gold reserves.  

At the end of the day, I still choose Bitcoin. I choose Bitcoin because I believe the power of the people will always be greater than the power of the government. Governments can try to maintain power by going back to a gold standard and confiscating the gold of citizens, but if people choose Bitcoin over gold, then it will not matter. Money and power will have become truly decentralized.",1585707650,29,6

I have found a few useful websites to get the ball rolling, but I would still appreciate a recent list as some either don't list as many wallets as I would like, or don't have enough data about them.

* [https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) \- A nice wizard lets you specify what you are looking for and ranks wallets on several metrics of quality, but is missing a lot of wallets I've seen recommended in other places.
* [https://www.weusecoins.com/](https://www.weusecoins.com/) \- One of the first website mentioned on the [r/Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/) sidebar lists some wallets not listed above, but they barely provide any info about them.

The poor cannot be reached with handouts because they work irregular jobs paid cash under the table. If social unrest breaks loose, it will soon generalize. Chaos is contagious. Therefore, it will break loose pretty much everywhere at the same time.

Furthermore, it will be virtually impossible to restore the old order. Too many people will have a vested interest in not allowing the old order to be restored. When the old order collapses, its fiat currency will very soon collapse too.

With BTC, you taking your coins off exchanges makes an irrevocable change to the network, where by nature of the code and the record of the blocks, that exchange cannot send BTC out to other people's wallets if the blockchain doesn't say they own it anymore. Thus, they can't BS anyone in terms of actual supply or ownership, and if they do, eventually they will be exposed if they can't produce people's holdings for transfer to private wallets.

ft8d5f,trakatan,I have just received this email from my bank.,"It's a new fintech bank, but regardless, I never thought I would get such an email from a bank, not even in my wildest dreams. This is so bullish:

Hey ---------,

Great news, our Cryptocurrencies feature is now available for ------- Standard users. We‚Äôll also be making our Gold feature available to Standard customers later in April, so keep an eye out.

**Here‚Äôs a little background**

During a recent presentation, our Head of Crypto, Edward Cooper, reminded us that cryptocurrencies came about as an alternative to real money during the times of quantitative easing and currency devaluation following the 2008 financial crisis. Given the recent economic upset, we are starting to see quantitative easing and currency devaluation happening again right now.

We had planned to make this official later this year, but in light of recent events, we‚Äôve decided to give all -------  customers the opportunity to explore different ways of diversifying, including through crypto, right now. Plus, we‚Äôll be inviting Standard users to explore our Gold feature later in April.

By the way, if you‚Äôd like to read about quantitative easing, the Bank of England has a page all about it.

**Pricing for Crypto on Standard**

For now, we‚Äôll keep our Crypto pricing exactly the same for Standard customers as it is for Premium and Metal users. This means a 1.5% flat fee per trade for everyone, so that you can have a chance to try it out. In May, this flat fee will increase to 2.5% per trade for all Standard users (but stay the same for Premium and Metal users).

If you‚Äôd like to try our Crypto feature out now, head to the -------  app, tap your main balance, tap ‚Äú+ New‚Äù and choose ‚ÄúCryptocurrency account‚Äù to get started.

**Pricing for Gold on Standard**

Gold pricing for Standard users will incur a flat fee of 1.50% per trade once it‚Äôs available. (Premium and Metal users will still be able to trade gold for a flat fee of 0.25% per trade.)

**Capital at risk with Crypto**

The price or value of any cryptocurrency can rapidly increase or decrease at any time. It may even fall to zero. Unlike normal money, no bank or government can stabilise the value of cryptocurrency if it changes suddenly. For full details of the risks of our Crypto Services, and the terms and conditions, visit our website.

Hello, there! Ive been seeing some Coinbase posts &amp; comments so I decided to try it out. Its incredibly simple &amp; straight forward to buy &amp; sell crypto off of coinbase pro and then transfering the proceeds to coinbase. Problem is, getting those proceeds into a non US bank account.  Withdrawals for Canadians off of coinbase seem to be paypal only. 
For instance, if I buy &amp; sell crypto, and end up with a sum of USDC (lets say 500 USDC). 
Withdrawing using paypal would mean getting charged by both coinbase and paypal a total of nearly 8% of the 500 USDC just to get it into your bank, that is you made from selling &amp; buying crypto from the site. 

The only other option I see would be sending the USDC to a wallet, but then you'd have to find what kind of wallet allows you to e-transfer or wire these to a Canadian bank. 

Any Canadians on here who use Coinbase have any tips for me? Cheers!",1586453908,15,1

My question is where do I go from here? I stated on my last tax return that I did not buy crypto in 2019 but that is not accurate. I have bought but have not sold any, so I dont believe I owe taxes yet anyway (Aside from sending some to bovada for sports betting, and Im still not sure how that works). Just wondering if you guys have any info on how I could go about correcting this? Do I just email the IRS? Or do I just wait til 2020 tax season and try to clear it then?

Then he goes on to explain to his questioning GF about how all these ""Druggies used stupid internet tokens made by nerds so they can get drugs delivered to their house."" 
Im sitting there with my best poker face. Like, okay, sure. Silkroad was kinda a growing pain, but dont shit on my Bits bro. He goes on to ask what the value of a BTC is...
Neighbor :""What are they worth anyway? Couple cents of something?""
Me *coy as ever*: ""Umm, well actually man, they are worth a little under $7,000 a piece now... But just a bit ago was over 11k.""
Neighbor: ""Seriously? What kind of moron would buy a stupid Bitcoin for that much? Just buy stocks, they are so cheap right now!""

Me *pensive*: ""haha, well, I mean it has outperformed the entire market and is a safe haven more reliable than gold, so, there is that...""

Neighbor: "" Wait, you dont actually believe this crap do you?""

Me: ""Actually man, I do..""

"" yes, we take the market cap, and divide it by the circulating supply.... See, their are only EVER going to be 21 million.""

fw2zh9,nothing_works4me,How I synced on a 2013 ultrabook in a few days,"Note: I don't know exactly how long it took because I didn't do it in one go. I guess it was like 4,5 days doing it only at night. At some points(2015Q3, 2018Q2) it slows down and ETA goes up to 16 weeks or something.

The main bottleneck is IO. My 2013 mobile i3 has enough processing power to sync, I only used 3 threads and most of the time only one was close to 100%.
The two directories that need to be written and read from intensively are chainstate and blocks/index. I pruned to 2GB and chainstate didn't go much over 3GB during the entire process. blocks/index is like 100MB.

The best solution is to move chainstate and blocks/index to a ramdisk. If you don't have enough ram the linux kernel has a thing called zram. Zram creates a compressed swap(cache) file in ram, this effectively increases your ram size at the cost of a bit of processing power and access speed(of the compressed part). On my machine I can net a bit more than 1GB of extra ram. That's right, with linux you can download more ram!
The second best solution is to leave chainstate and block/index on a sdd. From what I've tested it should take up between 5 whole days and 2 weeks.

With regards to config, I didn't see much benefit in increasing the db cache over the default 450MB in bitcoin-qt. If I recall correctly, smaller prune sizes make chainstate larger.

After the initial sync keeping up to date is very easy on resources. You can catch up a week in a few minutes. At the moment bitcoind is using 400MB but I'm still working on bringing that number down.

Remember: If you want safety or if you want to help the network you need o run a full node. A full node is a node that verifies all transactions. A pruned node is a full node.",1586194290,6,2

Thanks [u/symbiotic\_bnb](https://www.reddit.com/u/symbiotic_bnb/) for having banned me from your board [r/binance](https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/) [r/BinanceExchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/BinanceExchange/). However I will reply on other boards to let everyone know about your abuse.

You wrote:

&gt;""Risk Control."" This can mean many things, and most often it simply means that we have identified unusual activity on your account that may indicate a third-party has gained unauthorized access and withdrawals were suspended to protect your assets.

Nice. So I remember the steps done:

1. Last year opened my Tier 0 account (Non verified, just Email, 2FA set)
2. on same day deposited 0.21BTC
3. 3-4 months later back, I login to my account from a new machine, but same country. I m asked to verify email, I receive code, login successully, same 2FA.
4. I sell some of assets, then I withdraw you cancel it for ""Risk control"" and force me to upgrade my account??? why???? seriously???

**If you dont want people to use Level 0 accounts (unverified with KYC, 2 BTC limit), then just don't offer that option!! force everyone from scratch to submit KYC. Simple!**

**Don't allow people to use the service, then randomly you force them to provide verification. We have a right of** [r/privacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/) **!**

And now if you force me to verify my account to be able to withdraw my funds, it's my right to choose HOW I verify it. Regardless if my son, brother or sister or whoever does it for me, its verified! End! Now I know you will call this ""illegal"" but what you are doing is as well illegal in this case! Don't try to find bs reasons for that behaviour.

Your forced me to verify my account, so my account has been verified, as my screenshot is showing. Don't create new reasons to keep my money by asking things I can't provide.

When you ask me to provide video recording of how I load btc in my account, 4 months back, how sick is this? It sounds for me as a torture to find ways to keep money of people. A kind of trap.

You comment:

&gt;Case in point: is there a particular reason why someone else attempted to KYC your account a day before your attempt? Typically, legitimate customers do not cycle through various individuals for their KYC attempts. It's interesting that you made no mention of this anywhere, given how obvious it is that this is cause for concern, especially considering that the other individual that submitted KYC for ""your"" account has been involved in malicious activity on our platform.

First, what do you mean here with ""legitmate customer""?? I was using, as your system allows, an unverified account, which was more than enough for my needs. So what is then ""legimate customer""?? So do you mean now, all your users who don't have level 2 verified accounts are not legtimate? interesting point...

Now about the verification which has been done after your ""illegal"" action to force me to upgrade the account to be able to access my account, only because I changed the machine.

Indeed 2 verifications have been done. The first verification has been rejected by Binance because the passport was not the latest updated passport of my country. Though the passport is still valid, binance verification rejected it. So what option did I have from that moment? I spoke with customer service and they couldn't help.

So what should I have done from that moment? Just abandon my hard earned money with binance for this? Even the drive license was rejected. It's a lot of money. So I asked my friend who had a newer passport to verify the account for me. And the account was verified successfully!

If you call this ""illegal"", then you are not different at all, you are exactly the same! You lock customers in a wheel while having their money, then forcing them to upgrade to level 2. This is illegal! Then you again you complain when the account is finally verified!

Next you start asking what customers can't provide to have a way to keep the money.

&gt;That said, Binance has no interest in ""stealing"" anything from any of its customers, but we surely aren't going to allow bad actors to freely operate on our platform. You may simply respond to the ticket from here forth.

really? so you are the good actor and I m the bad actor right? Congratulations! :-)

Sorry this does not give you the right to keep my coins. If so, it's simply called SCAM. You don't like me? No problem, give me my money, and close my account.

Don't find pretexts to keep the money for you.

**Imagine that this exchange is doing this shit every day, randomly to customers, customers who don't want to provide their KYC (and it's their right! don't call them bad actor! You are Superman!) will simply abandon their money, do you know how many boost revenue is it for them? Nice way to make money** [u/symbiotic\_bnb](https://www.reddit.com/u/symbiotic_bnb/) [r/BinanceExchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/BinanceExchange/)

&gt;For any normal customer reading this, support is extremely busy due to recent market conditions and new interest pouring into the market and some tickets may take longer than intended to address, but that doesn't mean that there is any ill intent behind the delay. If you go an extended amount of time, such as 3+ days, with no response to your ticket, you may speak with the live support on our website and request an update.

Sorry but I have been patient enough! After I opened the ticket, your CS was fast enough to reply and make insane and unethical request. Since it has been 12 days, that I sent different emails, no response. Now you found better excuse! When you contact live support, they said ""in few hours you will get answer"".

&gt;If you are unable to provide anything that customer support asks for, all you need to do is respond to the ticket and explain what you are unable to provide and why you are unable to provide it. There are procedures in place for nearly every situation, support does not simply give up after the first step if a customer is unable to provide something that is not always guaranteed to be known.

Objection! I already replied, 12 days, no single answer from your team. What other option did I have?? See the screenshots I posted earlier, its clear enough!

&gt;Posting on Reddit is the last stop once all other options have failed. Keep in mind that you do not need to embellish or over-exaggerate your situation to get assistance. Simply be reasonable and you will receive the same in return.

Exactly! All other options to solve this issue directly with you have failed! I have to tell my story here. And see, you replied fast.... 12 days you / your CS didn't reply to my emails.

You asked me to be reasonable? I think I'm very reasonable. Treat well your customers and with respect if you want to get the same in return. Simple life's rule.

**You can scam me if you want. I expect you to release my money and close my account. This is the correct way if your company is serious.**

The answer to every single on of your questions here is answered within my comment. People that come to our subreddit, over-exaggerate their situation, and spread FUD, especially by way of ridiculous conspiracy theories, are not welcome. Respond to the ticket as your were advised and we aill proceed accordingly with verifying the details of your case.

## The Gods of the Copybook Headings

By Rudyard Kipling 1919
```
AS I PASS through my incarnations in every age and race,
I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market Place.
Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall,
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all.

We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turn
That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn:
But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind,
So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind.

We moved as the Spirit listed. They never altered their pace,
Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market Place,
But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come
That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome.

With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch,
They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch;
They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings;
So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things.

When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace.
They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.
But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe,
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: ""Stick to the Devil you know.""

On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life
(Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife)
Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith,
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: ""The Wages of Sin is Death.""

In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all,
By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul;
But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy,
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: ""If you don't work you die.""

Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew
And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true
That All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make Four
And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more.

As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man
There are only four things certain since Social Progress began.
That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire,
And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;

And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins
When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins,
As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn,
The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!

I was ""awarded"" 0.71 BTC which, converted to USD, is around $5,000. Immediately I figured this was too good to be true, but Googling that website didn't really pull up any scam alerts so I signed up.

I didn't give them any personal info, just essentials to log into the site with, and when I put in my code and wanted to withdraw the money, [this message popped up](https://imgur.com/adWBPWD). Immediately this tipped me off that this was a scam - I had to give money to get my own money? Oh okay so I'll just give you around $300 and never hear from you again. That's how I took it.

I showed this to a friend, and he said that's not it works ever and it doesn't make sense. He compared it to ""when scammers would tell me i had to pay then a delivery fee before they send me $800,000.""

So, to anyone out there who got the same message, all signs points to this being a scam. Just trying to help the community out is all.",1586710320,21,5

However, I see a recent update which mentions a new deadline in July 2020. If I missed the 2018 date, does that mean it is too late to recover the bitcoins I had in my wallet on Mt. Gox?

Bitcoin is no better than any other financial asset these days. It‚Äôs controlled by whales and exchanges and nobody (other than criminals) use it for its original decentralized purpose. The exchanges are the new banks and again we are just a cog in the machine. 

But then you realize the new system that‚Äôs in place has a huge interest in the price appreciating. It‚Äôs cyclical and that bull market is simmering. There are SO many stories for bitcoin and crypto right now. Again bitcoin will rise, eth will as well and as always new alts will follow. 

It‚Äôs kind of sad that bitcoin is far from the days of its original purpose but greed will always persist. We just have to make the most of it now.",1586838870,1,0

If someone tries to steal your FIAT money, the bank will refund your money. But if someone steals your Bitcoin, no one will refund you.

I used this spare time to learn as much as possible about the security of Bitcoin and came to the conclusion that it was not secure at all. In fact, you play the lottery all the time with people trying to make your private key.

I'm a Python programmer and in 30 days I've created 3 programs that can very easily become bitcoin killers.

Not sure what to do with them. Bitcoin has no owner, so it is not a crime. But there are people who have invested their money in Bitcoin and I really don't know what to do.

What would you do if you had a program that, in 1-2 years with 500,000 - 1,000,000 users, could bring Bitcoin down to $0. Old addresses are becoming less secure and new ones are in increasing danger.

They recently changed this in a scummy way: You are still able to click the same thing to accept the risk of skipping two factor authentication. I thought it would be like before but it wasn't. I was able to deposit, but when I tried to withdraw, they said two factor authentication is required to withdraw.

Kraken didn't change the initial message and instead lulled users into thinking they could both deposit and withdraw, but only deposits are allowed.",1586296501,8,1

Told myself that I'd only invest $3000 and cash out if the value hits $3100, i.e. $100 profit.

So far I've done 3 trades like this! Making $300 profit. So it's 10% on initial $3000 in 2 weeks.

Yes, I could've waited and held on for price to get higher but remember that making a profit target is key.

After that I will either sell as the price fluctuates, hodl, or invest in new equipment. Now my question is, is this worth it at all or is there a more profitable option?

g3pssf,WorkingLime,"Venezuela update. Last week 505 BTC (DOWN from 681) were traded using LocalBitcoin which is around 420,000000,000 Bs. (Bolivares) (ATH, last week it was 417,000,000,000 Bs.) Minimum wage is around 3,5 USD per MONTH. One BTC is 948,000,000 Bs. from 885,000,000 Bs. last week. AMA.","Hi guys, it has been steady around 2000 BTC per month. It is both ways, using Bolivares to BUY Bitcoin and selling BTC to get Bolivares. In my opinion, there are some miners here, there is people that get Bolivares and want to exchange them to BTC, the own goverment, people that get paid in BTC or USD and use LBTC to get Bolivares.

Banks are closed and ATM only give less than  1 USD per day.

These    volumes are only measured using Localbitcoin (LBTC) using their API    (Coindance). Big part of that exchange come from Venezuelans that live    abroad and send money to their families, miners, people that get paid  in   cryptos (freelancing) and even the own government. It has been  STEADY around 2000   BTC per month.

Other exchanges and other trades were done, but no way of measure them. 

Here   in Venezuela situation is  really hard, some people dont believe that   amount is the minimum  MONTHLY wage. I work and earn more than that  BUT now because this  situation my wage was slashed 50% (anyway, the amount is really low,  I'm sure with that amount I would be  living homeless in Colombia, Peru  or Panama for example), usually get   some donations from redditors and  do some freelancing work (translating   mostly) and it is really hard  to keep up daily.

AMA Ask Me Anything, any question!

g4s449,financeoptimum,The Fed's Losing Battle with Technological Deflation,"**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**

First off, let's set the scene.

The stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.

Economic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.

The correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&amp;P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.

Why?

Well, it is the Central¬†Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.

In doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion is US history.

However, this is not a particularly¬†meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:

‚ÄúThe central issue is we‚Äôre developing into a plutocracy. We‚Äôve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they‚Äôre rich because they‚Äôre smart and constructive.""

The reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.

Now, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history. 

*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.

We are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.

In fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.

Inflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.

Deflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.

That's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.

Well, no.

If you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.

As the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt.¬†

This is why central banks fear deflation so much.

However, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**

The increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.

[Throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. This is *not* a new phenomenon.

All technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create ""supply side shocks"", meaning that they allow for more intensive¬†use of resources¬†and thus higher production. With more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall.¬†

In the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.

It is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: AI

According to Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder and CEO of The Blackstone Group who has a net worth of $17.6BN, ""This is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology""

Moreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [Zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idUKKBN21K1C7) of exactly this. 

Old legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it.¬†

As an example, if you folded a piece of paper 50 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 50 times, it would reach the Sun!

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 3/4 - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY:**

The question is: how does this play out?

In the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, not¬†who is President for 4 to 8 years.

In reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. We have seen [what happens when a President doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91RZko5Gw)...

One could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:

1. Divide and Conquer and

2. [Order from Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx7PnMtCeY)

As we have seen many times in the past, herd psychology is [worryingly easy to manipulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M26-B44qQIs)...

Speaking of the censorship, in his book Antifragile, Nassim Taleb discusses the anti fragility of information.¬†

Information feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.

A fantastic example of this process is what has happened in the last week with London Real: they were banned on LinkedIn and David Icke's interview was censored. Now, regardless of what you think of this particular channel or your thoughts on David Icke and the theories provided, censoring information in this way *actually spreads it more virally*.

It's fascinating to observe how many views the videos regarding the bans and censorship have relative to the others. And the [impact this has had on subscribers](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/londonrealtv).

It is always easier to blame a bigger enemy (or create a new one) rather than to admit it's a structural problem. 

Therefore, you avoid short term pain...whatever the cost.

The real question is [if and when this situation will lead to social unrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4GMUamUjT8)...

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 4/4 - INTELLECTUAL CAPITALISM:**

The depth and width of jobs impacted by AI will continue to increase in the future, now this will not necessarily happen straight away.

However, our transition from commodity capitalism to intellectual capitalism in inevitable and the people and nations who fight against this trend will be on the wrong side of history.

From a practical investment perspective, and disclaimer this is not investment advice, network effects are a crucial aspect to consider moving forwards.

Essentially, this means that the value of the network¬†increases with each additional user - all of the tech monopolies have exhibited this property.

An asset which could in time demonstrate very strong network effects is Bitcoin.

[Looking at the market cap relative to other asset classes](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/), Bitcoin provides an asymmetric investment opportunity.

Only time will tell...

g4qbud,heavenswordx,Controversial opinion: Tether is causing BTC price to remain artificially low,"Contrary to popular opinion that the tether printing machine has been the primary cause of BTC price being pumped up, BTC price would actually be significantly higher in USD value if tethers did not exist:

1. The 6.4bn worth of Tether is USDT that is floating around the markets and not used to buy BTC (i.e. these are as good as the trillions of USD floating around the economy that's not in BTC). For every person that bought BTC using USDT, there's another user that sold his BTC for USDT. Thereby the net value of BTC remains unchanged. 
2. USDT is increasingly used as a base pair for trading of alt currencies on exchanges like Huobi Global, where USDT base pair trading volume has been significantly higher than BTC base pair trading volume. This indicates that instead of stacking more sats, the number of traders looking to stack more USDT is increasing. When these traders have no positions, the default position held is USDT instead of BTC, which again reduces the amount of value in BTC, thereby depressing prices.
3. While anonymity of BTC has frequently been cited as dirty money used for criminal activities, USDT is actually a significantly better token for such purposes for stability. Even druglords would prefer to have a stable fiat value and it is highly unlikely that they subscribe to the BTC narrative. Hence, the amount of illicit funds that might have been stored in BTC is now drained away into USDT instead. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it still depresses the value of BTC.",1587378245,2,1

On the pc that broke I have a good ammount of bitcoin in a wallet stored on my external Seagate SSD. An ammount that do not wish to speak of however an ammount I do not want to lose. However I plug this external SSD into a windows laptop and when I open up the wallet it says no bitcoin is in there anybody have any idea why?,1587359917,22,1

g4mpwx,nullc,"In the US, lost your job, and selling long held Bitcoin to pay your bills? Watch out for estimated taxes and underpayment penalties.","Some people here are in the unfortunate position of having been furloughed or recently lost their jobs due to the pandemic, but in the highly fortunate position of having well appreciated Bitcoin holdings that can be sold to pay your living expenses.  In the US this situation presents a minor tax risk in that you might not be expecting.

The IRS (and many states) require that you make payments through the year which total either 90% of your tax obligations or 100%* of last years taxes (* 110% if your AGI is over 150k). If you don't meet these requirements and owe $1000 or more in taxes there is an underpayment penalty of roughly 0.5% per month under paid plus interest (recently around 5% but it may drop to 3.25% due to the federal funds rate changing).  When you have an ordinary job payroll tax deductions mostly take care of meeting your obligations, or at least getting close to them.

However, if you lose your job and start living off selling Bitcoin you'll owe taxes on your capital gains and you won't have payroll withholdings. Any time you have large capital gains the same sort of risk exists but the combination of gains plus having lost your payroll withholding create an increased risk of large penalties.

To address this you're supposed to make quarterly tax payments.

Perhaps you're unable to do so. A tax penalty isn't the end of the world.  Maybe because of the pandemic they'll wave or lower penalties (they have done so in the past when changes in taxes left many people under-withheld)-- I wouldn't count on it, it's better. Regardless, better to be forewarned so you can incorporate it in your planning!",1587359516,30,1

g4kwsm,brianddk,[How-To] Crafting an offline TXN with the trezorlib python API,"With the rollout of the new 0.12.0 Trezor API, I thought it might be time to update some of my old `offline_txn` scripts.  The following is about 80 lines of python that will craft and sign a ***VERY*** simple transaction on Testnet.

The new rollout also comes with some new tools.  The [build_tx.py](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/python/tools/build_tx.py) that is useful in conjunction with the `trezorctl` `sign_tx` command.

Both of the methods below will produce a signed TXN that can then be imported into Electrum using the ""Tools -&gt; Load transaction -&gt; From text"" command.

Note: u/Crypto-Guide has a [good walkthrough](https://youtu.be/-DBf8aoVemw) for installing `trezorlib` in Windows if you haven't already done that.

## Example of using `trezorctl btc sign-tx`

This example uses the `build_tx.py` script to build JSON to feed to the `sign-tx` command.  You will need to download the [build_tx.py](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/python/tools/build_tx.py) file from github.  It is not automatically installed with the `trezor` package.

```

g4jsi9,PurseV2,Paxful.com and staff willfully allowing nigerian scammers to launder money," 

The bulk of paxful trades are gift cards by nigerians and indians. Has paxful staff never questioned how nigerians manage to get usa giftcards considering they do not sell giftcards of such in nigeria. Paxful boasts high volume trades of giftcards bought in the usa from nigeria users yet they do not wander how the nigerians get their cards?

These nigerians scam USA residents through various methods such as online dating scams. They target vulnerable people and Paxful help them to launder thier money. What kind of business model is this? After trading on paxful for less than a month I have realised this. The owners have not realised this in the 5 years they have been open?

I have collected proof and I will be reporting this to news outlets in the near future. From nigerians uploading images of the chats they have with these vulnerable people accidently to them putting their paxful display picture as the person they have scammed.

Paxful is willingfully doing so. They know the source of the giftcards are from scams. Many articles written by Paxful acknowledge the nigerians and indians get their gift cards from ""shady sources"" but still allow them to be traded on the platfrom. Paxful claims to not allow gift card brokering (the selling of giftcards when you are not the original purchaser). However in their articles they acknowledge usa giftcards cannot be bought in nigeria, most of their trades are from nigerians trading usa giftcards.

Paxful ask for something simple in the event of a disagreement , for a picture of the card with trade chat in the background. Not one of the trades I was involved in a disagreement in was nigerian able to provide the information requested. This is because they cant! They cant ask their victims to do this for them as this would make their victims aware of the scams. Surely if it is a legit money transfer from a USA citizen to a Nigerian the Nigerian could ask their USA counterpart to log into their Paxful and provide the requested information.

I am calling for the investigation of Paxful staff and its CEO Ray Yussef. Many of your staff will be arrested when you are caught. Paxful staff you should consider leaving your job. Going to prison for a company that is making you participate in illegal money laundering will not be worth the prison sentence. I will be forwarding this story to many news outlets. I have collected evidence from trades I have done. Even if I myself am incriminated I will be happy that I have managed to hinder these scammers from bringing misery to hard working people's lives.

YOU CAN DELETE THIS POST I WILL SIMPLY REPOST ON ANOTHER REDDIT ACCOUNT. THIS WILL ALSO PROVE PAXFUL IS WILLINGLY DOING SO. IF MY CLAIMS ARE NOT TRUE AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE YOU WILL ADDRESS THE CONCERNS I HAVE MADE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO BURY IT.",1587346562,58,1

I compared this snippet of code to what `txn_id` was produced by Electrum and the `blockchain.com` TXN decoder:

1. Take in TXN in hex
2. Convert the hex to binarray
3. Double hash binarray
4. Reverse the resultant digest because of endianness
5. Display in hex.

`t0` is my legacy testnet TXN and `t1` is my segwit testnet TXN.

Thoughts?

I‚Äôm going to make a confirmation to request if this request is legal, or illegal. I‚Äôm pretty sure this unorthodox request for documents in order with old my verification is enterly illegal.

 	Hi Jacob, 

I‚Äôm sorry, what kind of verification is this and if feels as though this may be evasive in paying the due balance.

I will get this, but as we are on lockdown, I will have to do it shortly. Why is this being requested? 

This seems entirely unreasonable.

When email was first introduced, people didn‚Äôt understand it, and didn‚Äôt want to accept it. They say it could never replace regular mail. Yet today, mostly everything is tied to email in business, personal relationships and commerce. Were the naysayers of email wrong? No, the post office didn‚Äôt go away. Regular mail still exists. However email has become a new normal (the phrase we all hear often lately). So why is bitcoin any different? It has the revolutionary tech and a following behind it, but everyone who either doesn‚Äôt understand it or hates it can only think about one thing and that is ‚Äúit will never replace USD (or insert your government currency here)‚Äù. That‚Äôs ok, maybe USD is just the next post office. (No disrespect to the post office I still use it, but I also use email and Bitcoin).",1587097189,4,2

Would now be a good time to introduce merchants into being able to accept crypto? I‚Äôve been doing more thorough research since I‚Äôve had more time off and learning about how to set up merchant services to accept bitcoin. Im still learning the ins and outs and thinking of other things that merchants might inquiry or be concerned about. Im thinking not only would help spread the adoption of bitcoin but also be something I could turn into a business. I already got some good input from some merchants who would like the idea of being able to but I wanted to input from the experts do you think this would be a good service merchants would like what things do you think they would ask or be concerned about.,1587097055,4,1

g2rihb,Kinolva,How many seconds of human life is a satoshi worth?,"This is a fun question to ponder. 

Here's one approach to an answer (there are, of course, many others). Note: I work with the human population as it currently is, and the current global human average lifespan as starting points. This therefore doesn't account for growth in human population, nor for possible growth in possible average lifespan, because as in the movie ""In Time"" lifespan is determined by money, and with BTC, we are talking about a bounded monetary system, and thus a bounded number of total ""human life seconds"" possible within an ecosystem. (Sidenote: This means that--if such a ""pay by the second of life"" system were ever implemented--BTC would be a perfect form of population control. Interesting. Hadn't thought of that before).

So. Here goes:

Today, the average global human lifespan is 72.6 years. \[[source](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy?time=1770..2019&amp;country=OWID_WRL)\]. Call it 72 years.

With the (approx) human population of 8 billion, that is a total of 576 billion human life years lived, assuming all 8 billion people live the average lifespan, and no new people are added to the equation. (ie: 8bn x 72 years)

This is a total of 210,240,000,000,000 human life days. (ie: 576bn x 365)

For a total of 5,045,760,000,000,000 human life hours. (ie: human life days x 24)

For a total of 302,745,600,000,000,000 human life minutes. (ie: human life hours x 60)

For a total of 18,164,736,000,000,000,000 human life seconds (ie: human life minutes x 60)

If each of these seconds had to be purchased with a finite amount of available money (ie: BTC is bound to 21M coins, but approx. 4M are lost, so call it 17M coins, eventually), it would look like this:

17M bitcoins = 1,700,000,000,000,000 total satoshi available.

Divide this into the total number of human life seconds: and we get:

1 Satoshi = 10,685 seconds = 178 minutes = 2.96 hours.

1 Bitcoin = 1,068,500,000,000 seconds = 17,808,333,333 minutes = 296,805,555 hours = 12,366,898 days = 33,881 years.

So. Ownership of one bitcoin equals a long fucking life. Congratulations. Owning one BTC puts you in the METH category.

So like a time capsule but with the password to my bitcoins. Have it set to a password that you will not remember, like 14 characters or something. 

Choose a date maybe 1-2 years in the future and bang send it off. No matter what I can‚Äôt access the bitcoin until this time expires. I have paper hands and always end up cashing in my cryptocurrency.

Well the previous time you went to see the adult porn webpages, my malware was triggered inside your pc which ended up recording a eye-catching footage of your masturbation act by activating your web camera.(you got a really weird taste by the way haha)

I have got the entire recording. If you think I 'm fooling around, just reply proof and I will be forwarding the recording randomly to 5 people you know.

If you send this 'donation' (we will call it that?). Right after that, I will vanish and never make contact with you again. I will get rid of everything I've got in relation to you. You may proceed living your ordinary day to day lifestyle with zero concern.

I have no idea how reddit works so I‚Äôm not sure how many people will see this but I hope you‚Äôre all healthy and making the most out of your quarantine. I just made this account for the purpose of getting some advice about cryptocurrency. I‚Äôve been interested in them for a little while but I‚Äôm still 16 and I know most places to buy bitcoin require you to be 18. I know that I could have my parents help me out but they‚Äôre not motivated as I am and I really would like to learn this myself. Anyways, I have very little knowledge about crypto currency‚Äôs so my questions are: which cryptocurrency should I invest in right now, how should I purchase it, and where should I store it. My mom doesn‚Äôt want me working at my fast food job because of the virus so I just want to find ways to make money from home so if any of you guys have advice on that too I would also greatly appreciate that. Also I heard of a site called bustabit.com where you can basically gamble bit coin, if anyone has any experience with that site what would you say about it?",1587077514,15,0

g27plu,Kinolva,FYI: There aren't enough BTC for HALF of today's millionaires to own JUST ONE. Owning ONE bitcoin puts you--at minimum--in the top 0.2% of the human population in terms of total possible Bitcoin wealth distribution.,"There will only be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins. Ever. Approximately 4 million have been permanently [LOST](https://fortune.com/2017/11/25/lost-bitcoins/), bringing the maximum circulating total to 17 million. This total number won't be reached until 2140 due to Bitcoin's [issuance schedule](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply).

Total number of millionaires (in USD value) worldwide is around 33 million ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/22/12-million-new-millionaires-will-be-minted-over-the-next-five-years.html)).

The math is simple: there is not enough Bitcoin in the world for even HALF of today's millionaires to own just ONE SINGLE BITCOIN. Much less all the future millionaires that will be born as the human population approaches [10bn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population).

Bitcoin is SCARCE. Check out the [S2F model](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25) for a good explanation of why scarcity and value correlate.

Furthermore: If you are able to acquire even one BTC today: Enjoy the feeling. You are an early adopter. And one of a **very** select number of humans. Owning just ONE BTC means that you are--at minimum--in the top 0.2% ([17M / 8Bn \* 100](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=(17,000,000/8,000,000,000)*100&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8)) of the human population in terms of total possible bitcoin wealth distribution. The percentage is much lower than that, of course, given that there are lots of whales out there with 1000+ BTC each. 

Edit: And never-mind the idiots that will say something asinine like ""my pubic hairs are limited in number too...does that make them valuable?"" Your pubic hairs have zero network utility, whereas every day Bitcoin proves it has extraordinary utility as (perhaps) the most perfect form of money humans have yet created.

Stack those sats!

Anyway I wanted to give some to them, so I encouraged my daughter to get Breez and Fold because she wanted to spend some of the money.

So she installed them and I sent a small amount to the wallet to test it.  Now, if you go to the ATM, $100 would not be unreasonable to put into a wallet.  It's fairly normal, since dining out might cost $15, etc.

After sending the money from Coinbase phone app (the send link is nearly impossible to find now, but that's another story), Breez returns the following error message: ""Amount too large.""  Eventually, they follow up with, ""Breez will make the funds available in 48 hours.""

I found this to be very untrustworthy and a complete turnoff.  I'm doing a very normal thing and I have a 48 hour hold? I thought Lightning was supposed to be fast. Coinbase sends USD to my actual bank account faster.  And how is $100 a large amount to put into a spending wallet?

I've been in the space since 2013.  If this is the best we have, then bitcoin has a LOOONG way to go, because that was a horrible experience that would turn me off bitcoin forever if I wasn't already a HODLer.

I definitely won't be recommending Breez to anyone anytime soon.",1586994483,3,0
g23ohc,brianddk,Quick Review of Trezor's trezorctl cli v0.12.0 with Firmware 2.3.0 / 1.9.0,"^TLDR: ^Walk ^through ^SD ^Protect, ^Self-Destruct, ^Passphrase-Cashing ^and ^TXN-Signing

Great new changes rolled out so I took a few minutes to load the changes up and walk through my impressions.  I did this (and most everything) in the console, so it might frustrate some users, but I find it the best combination of control and convenience.  Here's a quick run through.  If you don't have `trezorctl` installed, you might want to start there.  The installation in windows is still a little squirrely so I'll call out some steps for the Windows folks just as an add on.  Most can skip that part.  Also note that the bits decorated like `""{}""` or `""${}""`, are just meant to get your attention.  You should fill those bits in with the proper text for your config.  The lines ending in `\` are simply line wraps.

###Install for Windows
Assuming you have nothing installed, its easiest to just start with the [Chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/install).  Once done, enter the following from an Administrator terminal:
```
choco install vcbuildtools python3 protoc
refreshenv
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
pip3 install protobuf
pip3 install trezor[hidapi,ethereum]
```
You may also need `libusb-1.0.dll` version 1.0.23 or later.  You can [download it here](https://github.com/libusb/libusb/releases/download/v1.0.23/libusb-1.0.23.7z) and extract the file from the `MS64/dll` directory in the archive.  Simply put the dll next to `trezorctl.exe` and everything should start working again.

###Upgrade for existing installs
If you already have Python3 and `trezorctl` installed, the following commands should get you up to date with version 0.12.0
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
python -m pip install --upgrade trezor[hidapi,ethereum]
```

###Install the Firmware
In case you like to verify the FW fingerprint manually, you can get the published fingerprint from [releases.json](https://wallet.trezor.io/data/firmware/2/releases.json).  This is a sample command for Trezor T, but a similar command can be run for Trezor v1.9.0 for Trezor 1
```
fw230_fp=""212929f63fe1393e2ff57e06537a38cff281e3cfb3a4e17235079e2f08871e6c""
trezorctl firmware-update --fingerprint ""${fw230_fp}"" --version 2.3.0 
```

###Recover your seed (if upgrading T1 from 1.6.1)
You won't need to do this step, but I include it in case someone is on a fresh or wiped Trezor
```
unixtime=""{current_unix_time}""
trezorctl device recover --pin-protection --passphrase-protection \
                         --label ""TT 2.3.0"" --u2f-counter ""${unixtime}""
```

###Get the Device ID
For some of the new features it is good to record the device ID.  You'll need to pick it out of the data
```
trezorctl get-features
device_id=""{previous_output}""
```

###Turn on SD Protection
This is one of my favorite new features.  This will use the SD card to encrypt your Trezor firmware.  Once enabled the a file is created on the sdcard in the location `trezor/device_{$device_id}/salt`.  The `salt` file is a normal binary file and can be copied and moved to other cards.  This should be treated as a secret in the same way your PIN is a secret, but it doesn't contain any wallet seed data.  If you want to make a backup copy, you should encrypt the backup with GPG, or 7-Zip AES.  The SD card will be required to unlock the Trezor T, but once unlocked you can (should) hot-remove the SD card and store it away from your Trezor.
```
trezorctl device sd-protect enable
```

###Self Destruct PIN
Some other HW wallets will wipe the device on failed PIN retries, but Trezor simply increases the PIN delay on retry.  The self-destruct PIN provides a way to wipe your FW with a specific PIN.  I suggest you pick one that looks complex but isn't.  Spouses birthday, last-half of your phone number, something like that.  Once enabled, if anyone ever enters the self-destruct PIN, the device is erased.  Good for those nosy TSA or CBP agents.  Also good against the [$5 wrench attack](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png).
```
trezorctl set wipe-code
```

###Passphrase Caching
One of the laborious things about using `trezorctl` in the past was passphrase prompting.  Although the underlying python API would maintain state so long as a connection was open, the `trezorctl` utility was mostly stateless as far as passphrase was concerned.  With the addition of session tokens, you can now feed the FW your passphrase and get a session token back.  The token only holds context while the device is unlocked and they cannot be reused after the device is removed.  But they do allow us to make some series of commands simpler.
```
trezorctl get-session
session=""{previous_output}""
```

Once you've retrieved a session token, you can feed it into future commands using the `--session-id` global parameter.  Here's an example of a simple series of commands that will sign a message.  This is something that requires access to your private keys in FW, so the token really is global.  But as soon as you unplug your trezor, the token is invalid, and there is no way to derive your passphrase given the token.
```
derivation=""m/44'/1'/0'/0/0""
trezorctl --session-id ""${session}"" get-address --coin ""Testnet"" \
                                    --address ""${derivation}""
address=""{previous_output}""
trezorctl --session-id ""${session}"" btc sign-message --coin ""Testnet"" \
                                    --address ""${derivation}"" ""Test Message""
signature=""{previous_output}""
trezorctl --session-id ""${session}"" btc verify-message --coin ""Testnet"" \
                                    ""${address}"" ""${signature}"" ""Test Message""
```

###Offline TXN signing
Finally, no FW review would be complete without the obligatory offline TXN signing.  This has been around forever but I haven't toyed with it for a while.  The current method takes in a JSON formatted unsigned TXN, and spits out a signed TXN in hex format.  It's all [exhaustively documented](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/python/docs/transaction-format.md).  I ran a TXN through Testnet with no issues.

Here I create and copy a signed TXN to the clipboard
```
trezorctl --session-id ""${session}"" btc sign-tx txn.json | clip
```

Then you can simply paste the hex (clip out the non-hex) into Electrum to view and broadcast the TXN... Very nice.

##Conclusion
Really nice FW release with a great set of features.  If you haven't played with `trezorctl` or TXN signing before, now would be a good time to start.  With the new SD Protect feature, the threat of phisical attacks are finally mitigated.  Even though passphrase may protect the crypto TXNs, there are still features like U2F, FIDO2, WebAuthn, and TPM that don't use the passphrase.

I've been thinking of ways we can get people excited and interested in Bitcoin, especially leading up to the Bitcoin halvening (mid May):  


* Paying for people to learn about Bitcoin, gifting a course (like MasterClass gifts)
* Sending Bitcoin (sats) to friends and family members
* Inviting them to virtual conferences, or streams about Bitcoin
* Bitcoin workshop livestreams like Andreas Antonopoulos

Any others? What about a fun game people could play to earn Bitcoin?",1586985797,28,3
g2109v,Guilty_Pea,Ergo use case: ‚Äòhot potato‚Äô monetary policy,"*As the next financial crisis takes hold, it‚Äôs clear that conventional monetary policy is at its limit. Smart contract platforms like Ergo enable more innovative, targeted implementations of economic stimulation that the conventional banking sector cannot achieve.*

Conventional monetary policy is a hammer. It works as far as it goes, but if all you have is a hammer then every problem starts to look like a nail.

When the Global Financial Crisis hit over a decade ago, central banks did what they were used to doing. Cutting interest rates means it‚Äôs cheaper to borrow money, so there‚Äôs more cash in the system that can be spent and will circulate in the economy ‚Äì paying for goods and services, funding employment and allowing life to continue something like as normal.

That, at any rate, is the theory. It‚Äôs what central banks do in recessions to stimulate economic activity. When times are better, they raise interest rates to make it more expensive to borrow money and prevent the economy from overheating (including asset bubbles).

## The outer limits

This is a blunt tool, but it works, up to a point. In the 2008 crisis, the problem was more severe ‚Äì so severe, in fact, that interest rates were slashed to zero. Banks were still afraid to lend because they didn‚Äôt know the quality of the collateral they were offered in return, those notorious mortgage-backed securities.

So the central banks undertook a programme of Quantitative Easing (QE). This entailed creating huge amounts of cash that didn‚Äôt exist before, then purchasing various assets from the banks. The idea was that the central bank would take on the risk and the assets, and commercial banks would then use this gift of liquidity to lend to small businesses and individuals, allowing them to continue operating as before.

It didn‚Äôt work. Little of that newly-created money went to small businesses. Instead, banks used it to shore up their own balance sheets and make their own finances safer, investing only in low-risk assets rather than risky SMEs. Ultimately that cash filtered through to assets like the stock market and property, making the wealthy even more wealthy while the poorer were priced out of the market.

## Helicopter money

Today, as we experience the greatest financial challenge of our lifetimes ‚Äì greater than even the Global Financial Crisis ‚Äì central banks are considering even more unorthodox approaches. One of these is ‚Äòhelicopter money‚Äô. This involves cash being simply airdropped directly to citizens, either in the form of tax breaks or as money straight into their bank accounts. America has discussed giving $1,200 to every adult. Other nations are exploring the same idea.

But there‚Äôs a problem with this, too.

Just like the banks, ordinary citizens are worried about their finances. So instead of going out and spending (where ‚Äògoing out‚Äô is even possible), they pay down their debt. That newly-printed money goes nowhere.

That‚Äôs really as far as central banks can go. But a platform like Ergo can offer different types of money, with different conditions attached via smart contracts, incentivising different behaviour in different circumstances. And that enables a whole different range of monetary policy tools.

## ‚ÄòHot potato‚Äô money

In normal times, banks seek to maintain an inflation rate of around 2%. This means money is worth less over time. So instead of saving it all, and seeing the value of their savings fall, citizens have the incentive to spend it and circulate it within the economy.

Too much inflation, of course, is a bad thing. Get money printing wrong and you have hyperinflation like Venezuela or Zimbabwe, and your economy collapses.

But what if we kept inflation low, but created a limited amount of a special class of money that had to be used quickly if it was to retain its value at all? We‚Äôll call this ‚Äòhot potato‚Äô money, because it has to be passed on fast.

Using a blockchain and smart contracts, this would be a simple matter of creating a new token that could be freely transferred and traded, just like any other token. And it could be backed by reserves (held with the central bank, commercial banks or any other entity). But the difference would be that it has to be spent within a month of receiving it, or those tokens are locked, their value is lost to the holder and the funds that back them are freed up to return to the reserve holder.

So this would be regular money that people had to spend: use it or lose it. If they hoard it, it becomes useless. And we can ensure that it is not used to pay down debt by including conditions that ensure it cannot be used by the banking sector. Of course, Ergo‚Äôs Sigma protocols can be used to figure out what has been spent, where, without knowing individual spending habits ‚Äì enabling even more targeted stimulus.

This idea likely has far-reaching implications ‚Äì and possibly unintended consequences. What would the result be, for example, of creating different ‚Äòclasses‚Äô of money that were only semi-interchangeable? Would this introduce unwelcome, even dangerous friction?

This and other questions would need to be explored further. What‚Äôs clear is that central banks are already experimenting with unconventional monetary policy and are fast reaching the end of the road. We can continue that experiment with better, more powerful and targeted tools.",1586985575,0,0

My name is Isa and I‚Äôm the newest member of the BitcoinTaxes team. I‚Äôve been working with Sal ([u/Sal-BitcoinTax](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sal-BitcoinTax/)) in the production and distribution of new episodes of the Bitcoin Taxes Podcast. We typically share our episodes on a few different cryptocurrency subreddits. If this is against any rules here, please let me know and I will take down my post.

Our newest episode of the podcast is out today. This week‚Äôs guest is Matt Metras ( [/u/BitcoinTaxesMe](https://www.reddit.com/u/BitcoinTaxesMe/) ) who was on the podcast back in January - a lot has changed in the world since then. Matt is an EA who is super knowledgeable about crypto and crypto taxation.

In this episode, we discuss the IRS tax deadline extension that was issued as a result of COVID-19. We talk about how the pandemic has affected the crypto space, and our roles in it. Matt also shares his experience with the 2020 closed-door crypto IRS Summit, and relays which topics were focused on and which were neglected.

Enjoy the episode, and feel free to let us know if you have any questions.

## The IRS Crypto Summit (25:35):

Matt attended this summit on March 3rd in Washington DC. It was an invite-only event and although it was not focused on the personal side of taxation, it was discussed. The main focus was the business side of taxation. Of note, an organized central repository of tax transaction information to develop a standardized form for cryptocurrency reporting was discussed. Matt shares his views on the use-case and practicality of something of this magnitude.

In addition, Matt shares with us which topics were glossed over or not even brought up during the summit.

## The Impact of The Coronavirus on Crypto Tax Rules (35:11):

Prior to the coronavirus, it seemed as though we were finally making progress on receiving crypto tax guidance. Matt shares his thoughts on how the coronavirus could play both a positive and negative role in affecting that progress.

## Avoiding Scams (41:20):

The coronavirus has shown the goodness of humanity, but it has also given bad actors more opportunities to scam victims. Matt shares some cryptocurrency scams he has encountered in his line of work.

## The BCH Halving (51:25):

The BCH Halving occurred this month ‚Äì Matt gives us a quick rundown about what a halving is, why it occurs, and what it means for crypto traders and enthusiasts.",1586982046,3,1

As the buyer, why would I use BTC over a credit card?  There is very little protection.

The main issue is that I cannot do a charge-back.  If I pay for a good/service and the seller does not fulfill his end, I cannot request a charge-back on the payment.  As much as we can hate on banks, the chargeback feature provides great protection for buyers and keeps sellers honest.  There is no such mechanism in BTC.

Also for most major credit cards, you get like 1% cashback.  Certain credit cards like the Amazon credit card gives you a whopping 5% for purchases made in certain places.  There is no chance such a reward system can exist for BTC since it's decentralized.

I just don't see why, from the perspective of a buyer, I would use BTC to buy anything.  As the buyer I have no built-in protection against fraud.  If I was given the choice between paying with BTC or paying with a credit card, I would 100% use the credit card.

Purely judging from the perspective of a buyer seeking protection, BTC seems to be a worse solution.",1586980340,24,6

**I truly believe crypto and bitcoin will play a major role in our history.**    


Let's look back at last April to last June.  


***April 1st 2019***\- bitcoin price : ***$4,105.36***

***June 1st 2019*** \-bitcoin price : ***$8,573.84***  


**Fast forward to now.**

**A)** Halving around mid May \~ less than a month

**B)** Biggest Financial crisis we have seen, debt-based banking system / fractional reserve banking imploding +inflation

**C)** Millions of people looking for alternative

As of October 2019, there were 46.8 million millionaires. Those are just the ones on paper. Imagine the fact that not even every millionaire in the world will be able to own just 1 bitcoin.  


I imagine what our parents‚Äô generation and finance majors did with the stock market in the two decades between 1980‚Äôs to 2000‚Äôs is akin to what the people in their 20‚Äôs and 30‚Äôs now will do with bitcoin and cryptocurrency in the next two decades.  **There will only be more advancement, more adoption, more infrastructure, more developers, more liquidity, etc  In order for this growth to occur, we need to band together for the common good of advancing the space.**  That's why I made [de-fi.co](https://de-fi.co)

I have a US Passport - no valid drivers license  
completely new to cryptocurrency trading  


I am attempting to make my first purchase of Bitcoin.  I intend to use USD fiat to make my purchase. I've outlined my experience thus far, and hope that I can receive some feedback as to what I can do to speed this up a bit.

# Attempt #1

  
Initially signed up for Kraken.  The verification process involved sending a utility bill, along with a photo of my ID, and a photo of myself holding the ID and a signed letter.  They accept a passport as a valid form (thankfully).  First was the ridiculous task of trying to get a photo of myself holding the passport in one hand (without my fingers covering any part of the id, which was almost impossible considering I needed to hold it a certain way to keep it open) and a signed letter in the other hand, all the while keeping both arms and hands FULLY in the frame, not cover any part of my face, not cover the documents with one another, have the content of the documents completely clear and in focus and without any glare (the passport is basically a reflector).  Needless to say this took me about a day.  I also had to use little bits of duct tape to hold the passport flat on the table for the other photo.  I submit the photos, wait a day, and then I am told that I need to re-take the photos, that they weren't clear enough.  Well, I did this 2(two) more times before finally being accepted.  (I made sure the resolution of the image was preserved at 4000X3000(ish).  3 days later, here I am ready to fund my account, and the only option they have available is WIRE TRANSFER!  I had to look up how to wire transfer, and apparently it involves going in to your bank, which is something I'd like to avoid if possible.  I think they are only doing drive through service anyways. So at this point, I am frustrated.

# Attempt #2

I hear about Coinbase.  I signed up, and it was so quick and easy! It allowed me to add my bank account using my online banking credentials,  you know like how it should be in 2020, and I was ""verified"" in minutes.  I was curious as to whether or not I could add a debit card in order to make instant purchases.  I went to ""link new device"" and noticed that Credit/Debit was available for making small deposits.  I added the card (also quickly and painlessly) and then went to make my purchase.  Not until the point where I enter the amount of BTC I wish to purchase does it tell me that my spending limit with this card is **$0.00 per week.** Hmm.. that's nice. That's ok, I'll just use my bank and wait the 3 - 5 days.  \*goes to make purchase with bank\* -- NOW it asks me to ""complete the verification process"" by providing a valid ID.  Sigh, ok. But wait.. use a valid drivers license or state ID only... passports not accepted for US customers.  Ok, I've had it up to here with this.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, what I'd really like is to find an exchange which is relatively easy to register with/get verified with.  If they require identification, they would have to accept a passport. I would prefer if they supported normal ACH bank transfers, or any other form of funding of USD that doesn't entail doing a wire transfer.  I suppose that if I have to just go ahead and contact my bank to figure out how we're gonna do this wire transfer, I will go that route.  But if anyone has some helpful information and can point me in the right direction, I would be grateful.

The Zeitgeist for bitcoin was that when the dollar eventually fails, or is shaken, the world will move in droves to bitcoin in order to escape to a deflationary lifeboat in inflationary times. As a thought experiment, let‚Äôs take for granted that the average citizen is not going to have the financial + technological literacy and/or liquid assets to be able to convert dollars into either bitcoin or gold in any serious amount in the middle of a financial crisis. 

Let‚Äôs also take for granted that neither can be used with ease as a means of exchange for goods and services in supermarkets and shops etc in the near future, thus dis-incentivising them from doing so even if they were capable of doing so (Yes I am aware of rare use cases for both, I‚Äôm talking in general, today). 

That leaves us with only those who are financially savvy/have brokers and/or central banks, hedge funds and large financial institutions left who are left looking for said lifeboat. They will be moving sums of money around orders of magnitude greater than will ever be put into crypto currency at current adoption rates. 

&amp;#x200B;

Given that bitcoin adoption is sparse and volatility high it can not be considered a predictable, reliable store of wealth at this point in time. It might well prove to be, but governments, brokers and hedge funds don‚Äôt invest in financial instruments that have the potential to explode in value when the aim is to divest from volatility. They just want to protect their assets for long enough to weather the storm. If this is the case, it is reasonable to presume that governments, brokers and financial institutions will do what always happens in times of crisis; fall back on safe, tried-and-true investment strategies, namely: buying gold. 

Bitcoin could very well be worth ten times what it is now in a decades time. Maybe a different crypto will emerge and take it‚Äôs place. It could well ‚Äúmoon‚Äù in the next year. But I think this will be entirely down to the fact that it is acting as a speculative asset and not fulfilling it‚Äôs use case as evidenced by it‚Äôs first field test during an economic crisis since it‚Äôs inception. The idea that the world economy is going to jump on to the blockchain in the short term if we see a dollar fall in value doesn‚Äôt seem like a feasible response.

 There might be big pumps and dumps, but I don‚Äôt think there will be widespread institutional and societal adoption any time soon. Given that this is often touted as the reason it will be worth so much in the future, given that it is going to disproven if there is a serious crash in the medium term and the reaction is a flight to gold not bitcoin and given that it‚Äôs value is currently a function of it being treated as a speculative instrument we could very well see bitcoin plummet in value along with the dollar. If bitcoin isn‚Äôt functioning as a currency, it is only functioning as a store of value until adoption or innovation bridges the gap.

Maybe this crash will come too prematurely for bitcoin to capitalise on it‚Äôs potential. If it can‚Äôt be seen to better this use case when compared to gold by institutions who can‚Äôt afford to gamble on the outcome, it will lose to gold. If it loses to gold, it could collapse having been shown incapable of meeting any of it‚Äôs purported functions. It will be seen as neither a store of value, a safe heaven in inflationary times nor a means of exchange. If that happens, the only value it will have is the belief that it can overcome these obstacles at some point and do so before a more agile competitor takes it‚Äôs place or it‚Äôs reputation is damaged irreparably. 

I believe in crypto, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs tulip mania. But I do think this culture of pumping your life savings into it on the ASSUMPTION that it is going to go up if there is a crash is short sighted and wishful thinking. If I am wrong I will be delighted to see a world where central banks are replaced by a more democratic and equitable monetary system. I just don‚Äôt see how it can happen for a long time and think the value of BTC will fall significantly in the meantime, long before people currently invested in it can wait before they have to cash out and put their savings to work.",1587504679,97,4

Bitcoin is the foundation of existence, the Standard and Measure of everything! This is where any Countdown begins! Bitcoin is pure Energy i.e. that is what everything is composed of, including you and me! Bitcoin is the lowest projection of Erzanil, the energy standard of the Higher Plans. The mining process is nothing more than filling the generated bitcoins with energy!

There is no scalability problem for bitcoin, i.e. restrictions on the number and speed of transactions, as it is the foundation of the FIELD structure, not the NETWORK!

Bitcoin has NO relation to money, nor to cryptocurrencies, nor to anything else. He is the Measure of the value of everything and everything! Not the value of bitcoin is measured in dollars, or anything else; and the energy component of the dollar or any other attribute of society in bitcoins!

Bitcoin is the basis of the Energy Settlement System, which in the future will replace the actual money and the current banking monetary system! It is the latter, at the expense of the loan interest that generates unsecured money that creates energy imbalances in society leading to global crises and the subsequent inevitable death of any civilization!

A separate question is what Bitcoin has turned into and how it is used now.

Gold is just an ordinary metal. On top of that, it‚Äôs no longer in short supply. It, like other precious metals and stones, is already mined using technologies for the transmutation of chemical elements, i.e. using bacteria!

BITCOIN
This is an explanation why the Feds recent actions are illegal. Its from John Hussman's new post which also talks about the spread of SARS-COV-2 and stock market valuations and internals.

--------------------------------

**Both the Federal Reserve Act and the recent CARES Act places very clear restrictions on the types of assets that the Federal Reserve can purchase, and the conditions that must be satisfied in order to purchase them.** Congress went so far as to include a section in CARES to emphasize these requirements ‚Äúfor the avoidance of doubt.‚Äù

Put simply, **Fed purchases under the Federal Reserve Act are restricted to assets that are explicitly guaranteed as to interest and principal by the U.S. government, or that has a claim to sufficient collateral to avoid losses to the public.**

The securities that the Federal Reserve is legally allowed to purchase are:

a) Section 14 open market purchases of securities that are fully guaranteed as to interest and principal by the U.S. government or a foreign government;

b) Section 14 purchases of ‚Äúcommercial bills of exchange‚Äù arising out of commercial transactions. What are those? See the definition in Section 13(2), which defines commercial bills of exchange exactly as they‚Äôre commonly understood: arising out of commercial transactions, secured by agricultural products, goods, or merchandise, with a maturity of less than 90 days, and specifically prohibited from ‚Äúcovering merely investments, or issued or drawn for the purpose of carrying or trading stocks, bonds, or other investment securities, except bonds and notes of the government of the United States.‚Äù

c) Section 13(2) discounting (i.e. prepayment) of commercial, agricultural, and industrial paper (again, bills of exchange);

d) Section 13(3) emergency lending to individuals, partnerships, and corporations, restricted to discounting notes, drafts and bills of exchange, and contingent on collateral (‚Äúsecurity‚Äù). Section 13(3) also requires that these activities must be for ‚Äúthe purpose of providing liquidity to the financial system, and not to aid a failing financial company, and that the security for emergency loans is sufficient to protect taxpayers from losses.‚Äù

e) Section 13(4) and 13(6) lending for payment of sight drafts for agricultural transactions, and bankers acceptances which typically arise out of merchandise transactions.

That‚Äôs it. **The menu is very specific: either government securities, or those that are backed by a pledge of collateral ‚Äúsufficient to protect taxpayers from losses.‚Äù** This principle is consistent with the U.S. Constitution: only Congress has fiscal authority. The Federal Reserve does not. If this is not taken seriously, the Fed could purchase whatever security it wished, at whatever valuation it might choose, and the American public would be on the hook for any losses.

**On April 9, the Federal Reserve announced the creation of the ‚ÄúSecondary Market Corporate Credit Facility‚Äù (SMCCF), that would leverage $75 billion of CARES funding from the U.S. Treasury to buy as much as $750 billion of corporate debt and ETFs.**

**The initial allocation from the Treasury covers $50 billion for ‚Äúprimary‚Äù lending (directly to companies), and $25 billion for ‚Äúsecondary market purchases‚Äù of outstanding corporate bonds from investors. That Treasury funding is fine. Congress allocated the $75 billion in Treasury funds as part of the CARES Act. Every dollar provided by the Treasury acts as a Federal guarantee for the equivalent amount of corporate obligations that the Federal Reserve purchases.**

**The problem is that the Fed intends to leverage these funds 10-to-1 without taking actual collateral pledges from the underlying companies. This exposes the public to outright losses in the event that declining market prices or corporate defaults reduce the value of these bonds by even 10%.**

As a result, the newly created SMCCF is either a Ponzi scheme at public expense (if the Fed plans to allow portfolio losses to exceed 10%) or a 1987-style portfolio insurance scheme (if the Fed plans to liquidate securities into a falling market in order to cap its losses at 10%). **Section 13(3) requires updates every 30 days on the ‚Äúvalue of collateral‚Äù ‚Äì that‚Äôs going to be an interesting dance if we break the March lows. In any event, even here, the SMCCF is already illegal.**

**Uncollateralized junk bonds are being treated as their own collateral.**

What makes this so brazen is that when Congress approved the CARES Act, it wrote the terms and conditions section like a children‚Äôs book, ‚Äúfor the avoidance of doubt‚Äù ‚Äì to prevent exactly this sort of abuse of public funds. Specifically, here is section 4003(c)(3)(B), which limits how the $500 billion of 4003(b)(4) funding provided for businesses, states, and municipalities may be used:

**4003(c)(3)(B) FEDERAL RESERVE ACT TAXPAYER PROTECTIONS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS APPLY. ‚Äì For the avoidance of doubt, any applicable requirements under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, including requirements relating to loan collateralization, taxpayer protection, and borrower solvency, shall apply with respect to any program or facility described in subsection (b)(4).**

CARES Act Section 4003 and Federal Reserve restrictions (violated)

**Has the Federal Reserve taken collateral pledges from the companies underlying these ‚Äúloans‚Äù? Has the Federal Reserve ensured that ‚Äúthe security for emergency loans is sufficient to protect taxpayers from losses‚Äù? Nope.**

**Instead, what‚Äôs going on here is that the Fed is treating the SMCCF as if it is a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù in itself. It is then treating the corporate bonds and ETFs purchased by that vehicle as if those unsecured bonds are the ‚Äúcollateral.‚Äù**

**Yes, that‚Äôs right. Uncollateralized junk bonds are being treated as their own collateral.**

Of course, that‚Äôs also why **Section 13(2) of the Federal Reserve Act was written to prevent this sort of thing, prohibiting discounting of corporate securities ‚Äúcovering merely investments, or issued or drawn for the purpose of carrying or trading stocks, bonds, or other investment securities, except bonds and notes of the government of the United States.‚Äù**

The whole operation is a hand-waving attempt to the purchase of assets that are wholly rejected by the provisions of 13(3), and may ultimately be impossible to close without a loss to the Fed, which is a loss to the public, which is fiscal policy, which belongs to Congress, not the Fed.

Again, it‚Äôs fine for the Federal Reserve to use the $75 billion of Treasury funding as ‚Äúcollateral‚Äú that confers a federal guarantee on $75 billion of corporate loans and security purchases. Those funds are part of the amount that Congress, in its singular constitutional role, has allocated for public support for corporate lending.

**In contrast, additional purchases to ‚Äúleverage‚Äù that funding are neither secured by non-financial collateral, nor have security sufficient to protect taxpayers from losses. They are illegal, both under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, and under Section 4003(c)(3)(B) of the CARES act, which ‚Äúfor the avoidance of doubt‚Äù specifically invokes 13(3) ‚Äúrequirements relating to loan collateralization, taxpayer protection, and borrower solvency.‚Äù**

The newly created SMCCF is either a Ponzi scheme at public expense (if the Fed plans to allow potential portfolio losses to exceed 10%) or a 1987-style portfolio insurance scheme (if the Fed plans to liquidate securities into a falling market in order to cap its losses at 10%).",1587488906,6,1

g7if4d,FreedomAndRedemption,Bitcoin will NEVER work for daily transactions,"1. There is no security. Someone can walk away with your coins and never provide the service. There is no such a thing as a chargeback. 
2. Legally, you can't do anything about it if someone steals all your coins, because the coins aren't even attached to your name. Unless it's centralised, but that defeats the point of bitcoin.
3. How would you even do things such as returning an item?

g7gyob,acesdeuces155,Bitcoin creates money out of thin air,"First it's important to understand the concept of an asset split or fork. 

While I understand a fork and a split aren't **exactly** the same thing, it's still the same concept monetarily. 

When a stock AB valued at $2800 splits (which is the same thing as a fork) 7:1 you now effectively have 2 stocks, Stock AB and Stock B. Right? 

The original value of stock AB must decrease in value to account for the value of the new stock B. So after the split (fork) Stock AB is worth $2400 and stock B $400. But the overall value of the position remains $2800. 

****In other words you don't get free money just for owning a stock during a split.****

Do you or don't you agree? 

Am I explaining that wrong? It seems like it should be common sense. Money has to come from somewhere. 

On August 2, 2017 Bitcoin hardforked (split) into Bitcoin Cash. For every 1 Bitcoin you owned at the time you received 1 Bitcoin Cash.

The night of the fork Bitcoin was valued at $2800. So if you went to sleep with 1 Bitcoin @ $2800, you woke up with 1 Bitcoin @ $2800 and 1 Bitcoin Cash @ $400. 

$3200 total. 

Wait what? 

***Where did that extra $400 come from? *** Where did the original value of Bitcoin Cash come from? 

It didn't. 

Again, the important thing to understand is you don't get free money just for owning an asset at the time of a split. That's exactly what happens every time Bitcoin splits. 

***$6 billion was created out of thin air when Bitcoin forked into Bitcoin Cash and no one but me and few others ever asked questions. ***

Which part of this is ***not*** OK don't you understand? 

The exact same thing happened with Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin SV. Every time a cryptocurrency forks money is created out of thin air. 

Do you know why Coinbase will *never* release Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Gold to their customers? If their customers were to immediately sell back into fiat they would effectively be giving away free money.

Generally its not a good idea for businesses to give away free money.",1587763455,15,1

g7fwxr,acesdeuces155,Why do you continue to ignore Tether?,"I don't understand how you can ignore the problems with tether.

Tether and Bitfinex are currently involved in a lawsuit. Tether has openly admitted its not backed by anything.

Most of you understand what Quantative Easing (QE) is. The Fed counterfeits money that has been created out of thin air and uses it to buy stocks and thus artificially inflates the value of the stock market. (And yes I understand it's more complicated than that, but for simplicitie's sake that's basically how it works).

You also understand why QE is a gigantic problem.

Yet tether is being used for the same purpose... There is no difference between QE and tether. 

Tether = QE

QE = Tether 

It is more or less the exact same thing... Fake dollars are created out of thin air and used to artificially inflate the underlying asset. 

QE bad. Tether good. 

Why doesn't it bother you?

But that's not all.

On any given day up to 67% of total market market volume is tether trading. On an average trading day tether trades 6x-10x its market cap.

Today, for example, total market cap for tether is $6.4 billion while it's trading volume is almost $47 billion. That's 7.34x. No other crypto is anywhere close. 

Do you know what wash trading is? Do you understand the purpose of wash trading? Hint: it's for more than just fake volume. 

The total market volume of the Cryptocurrency market today is $129 billion. Tether is $47 billion. 36% of the total market volume.

Tether, let me remind you, has openly admitted its not backed by *anything*. 36% of the Cryptocurrency trading is based on absolutely *nothing* but imagination... 

Yet somehow you'll still find a way to ignore that fact and pretend the price is organic?

Nothing about the Cryptocurrency market is real. 

I'm sure someone will try to explain the ""real"" trading volume...while simultaneously ignoring the reason exchanges are wash trading for fake volume in the first place.

Do you know why there are now 5,392 cryptocurrencies? They're (whoever they is) wash trading these obscure cryptocurrencies and artificially inflating the price with tether wash trading. Once the price has been artificially inflated (pumped) they can then sell into Bitcoin (and anything else).. and no one notices.

Very few (if any) people are actually trading the 3,841st ranked cryptocurrency. It's fake. 

Basically obscure cryptocurrencies are a backdoor method for artificially inflating the price of Bitcoin.

Harry Markopolis tried for 9 years to tell us about Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme. He repeatedly wrote to the SEC giving them lists of ""red flags"". He was ignored. The title of his book is ""No One Would Listen"".

It's the exact same scenario. I can point out a dozen more red flags but you won't listen. You'll ignore it as as FUD. 

Have you never noticed that literally ***everything*** negative said about Bitcoin is FUD?! 

You'll downvote this right away and find a way to convince yourself I have no idea what I'm talking about. 

Despite the numerous warnings by Markopolis, Madoff's scam only fell apart when banks froze credit and stopped lending to each other.

 It will be the exact same thing with Bitcoin.",1587759975,2,1

g84okb,giantsIV,An Outsiders Take On Bitcoin Price Prediction,"Hello everyone, I've never really visited this community before but I was hoping to share a few ideas with everyone!

&amp;nbsp;

First off, I've never purchased bitcoin nor have I really had any other ideas about it other than 'man I wish I got in on that early.' Being quarantined has made me expand my research into areas i've never really touched before and i've made a decent little discovery that hopefully a few of you can appreciate.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't feel know how to define my career other than a trend finder. Anywhere from finance to microeconomics trends, one of the things I like to do when finding stocks that will break out is using [Bollinger Bands](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp). They great for seeing the upper and lower sides of a stock. I also like using a 5 day [exponential moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp). None of what i do is new it's basic really. I like finding stocks that have an EMA that hugs the upper Bollinger Band with consistency. [Here's an example using Amazon](https://imgur.com/e2gANVL). I like to follow that EMA hugging the upper Bollinger Band until the inevitable separation of the two begin and the stock price begins its downfall. This has shown to be no different with Bitcoin. [Here is the chart of Bitcoin leading up to its first big burst.](https://imgur.com/a/xjyROQN) Notice the pink line and how close it is to the upper band. Had I seen this way back then I would've been in on it in a second. 

Did you see how when the price shot up the upper band and pink EMA line began their separation? [Let's take a closer look](https://imgur.com/a/w2T0N7d)

We can see that BTC had been trending upward but then suddenly in late November there was a dramatic upturn, this won't be that last time we see that. You can see the EMA get tighter with that upper band. Around that time the price was approximately $8,900 roughly half of what the eventual top price would be of the boom.

&amp;nbsp;

Quickly deep separation begins and price begins its free fall.


&amp;nbsp;

[Lets fast forward a year to early 2019.](https://imgur.com/a/JGi7YVk) The EMA had dove below the Moving Average and then we see the curve back trending upward. 

[Now lets take a closer look at the daily charts](https://imgur.com/a/l9jLSln)


There it is again. The EMA hugs the upper band after a dramatic upturn in mid May. The approx. price around this time is $6,700 roughly half of what the top price will be at the boom. 

And then history repeats itself. The separation begins and the price begins its free fall again.


&amp;nbsp;


[Going back to this chart](https://imgur.com/a/JGi7YVk) and looking towards the right we can see where we are now. It'll be interesting to watch going forward if that EMA begins its upward swing again. Im excited to follow it and hopefully you are too!!

Good luck all!",1587861048,23,1

You do understand that bitcoins current value relies on having something like the dollar to base it against right?

If everything was suddenly valued in bitcoin we'd end up in the exact situation we are currently in.Prices would rise, but the value of held currency would stay the same.

For example, gas could cost 1 btc one day and 3 btc the next. But you will still only have 1 btc. Theres nothing for you to value it against or convert to in order to ""protect"" your money. Therefore the whole idea of bitcoin or crypto only works as long as it is not the ""standard"" we base everything off of. The dollar, the euro, the whatever (to some extent) needs to continue existing for bitcoin to continue appreciating in value. Just like gold. Nobody wants to carry gold so we have currency and assume it is worth x amount of gold.

Obviously now it's all based on fiat so everything else is worth x amount of dollars. The cycle will go on and on.

We are just lucky and riding the wave of bitcoins beginnings until the cycle starts all over again.

Meanwhile, yes I'm still going to continue exploring bitcoin and crypto in general.",1587848380,5,0

As a psychiatry resident nearing the end of training, I've seen the direct and indirect negative impacts of economic slavery on mental health and resigned myself to a feeling of learned helplessness as I could do little about it - so this is especially important to me.

I looked at  Phemex, Bybit, or Deribit but I don't know anything about trading derivatives. And I don't want to trade bitcoin. 

My goal is buy more tezos with borrowed money. Kraken is too expensive. Binance forbids US residents and they do KYC even if they say they don't for small amount. Kucoin does not look reliable but at least 6 times cheaper in margin interest compared to Kraken. Kraken charges margin interest every 4 hours. Kucoin charges the same amount in 1 day. I don't want to use coinbase because they report to IRS and is a tax nightmare for me.

g9lc17,HalvingGame,Introducing The HalvingGame.com: Put your money where your mouth is!,"**Introducing The Halving Game, a fun platform about anticipating the Bitcoin price.**

Can you predict the BTC/USDT price on Binance at the time of halving on May 12?Then make your bet and win your share of the pot! It‚Äôs 100% anonymous, no email address required.

**How does it work?**

Everyone makes one or more bets with their own price prediction. At the time of halving (when block 630,000 hits), those bets within a +/- 2.5% range (target zone) around the Binance price will be paid out their share of the pot. For example, if the price at the time of the halving is 10,000 USDT, you would have your bet(s) placed between 9,750 USDT and 10,250 USDT (-2.5% to +2.5%). The minimum bet size is 1 bit, or 100 satoshi.

**Weight factor**

The weight factor spices things up even more and rewards older bets over younger ones, i.e the earlier you bet the greater your weight factor will be. For example, if you bet 14 days before the halving, the weight factor of your bet is 14.0. If you‚Äôre in the target zone, your share of the pot will be your bet multiplied by 14, so be quick because a bet only 7 days before the halving will have a weight factor of just 7.0. On the last day of the game, each bet only counts 1x.

**TL;DR:** Bet as early as possible to get the maximum output.

**Payout calculation**

After the halving, the pot is distributed to those players whose bets are within the price range. The formula for the payout is:sum of my weighted bets in target zone / sum of all weighted bets in target zone

**Service fee**

We‚Äôre charging a modest fee of 2% to operate the service and provide support. The service fee is deducted at the time of payout.

**Good Luck!**

The game starts today, 14 days before the halving and bets will be allowed until block 629995, 5 blocks until the halving.

g9ir6f,21btc,It is very unlikely that the price of BTC is below 1 million USD if Bitcoin survives until 2040.,"If you accept the fact that the cost of producing 1 BTC doubles over night at every halving event, and think it is reasonable that the power consumption of the Bitcoin network goes from that of Switzerland (today) to that of South-Korea (10x),  and eventually to that of Russia (20x) from where we are today. Then you end up with a 5 million USD to 10 million USD BTC production price in 10 - 20 years from now. 

7700 \* 2 \* 2 \* 2 \* 2 \* 2 \* 2 \* 20 = 9,856,000 =&gt; approx 10 million USD. If not as much as Russia but as much as South-Korea then multiply by 10x instead of 20x =&gt; 5 milllion USD.

And this is the production cost, not the spot market price. Conclusion: If Bitcoin survives another 20 years. It is very unlikely for it to be below 1 million USD. 

Remember that in 2032, instead of 50 Bitcoin per 10 minutes, you have 0,78125 BTC per 10 minute reward globally. And in 2040, approx 1 BTC will be mined per hour!!!

If 1 BTC is mined per hour in 2040, and the BTC network power consumtion is of that of South-Kora, how much does it cost to power South-Kora for 1 hour?",1588059168,16,1

g9e9zj,UncoloredShoes,My 2020 BTC Mining Experience,"Hey everyone! 

So I wanted to share with you all my BTC mining experience through 2020 and hopefully shed some light and answer some questions for those thinking about getting into it. 

So in Nov 2019 I got really interested in the idea of using mining to accumulate BTC and leverage my investment property (I have a two unit building. I live on the second floor and rent out the first floor). After lots of research and DD I was convinced to give it a try. In late December ending up purchasing a Bitmain S17 miner off eBay for $1,900 with the goal of having it operational by the start of 2020. I had (2) 220v outlets installed in my basement near my work bench for $330 and I was ready to roll. 

Let me say that the initial setup and start up period was quite difficult. It was tough to find good resources to assist so it was mostly a trial by fire experience. It also doesn‚Äôt help that Bitmain is a Chinese company. 

I also learned very quickly that these miners are extremely noisy and emit a high frequency sound due to the fan speed. This became a big issue right away because the sound was noticeably loud not only in my tenants apartment but I could also hear it upstairs in mine! The complaints started almost immediately. I thought I was screwed. 

I attempted to install insulation and some sound panels in the ceiling of the basement but that barely made a dent to the noise levels. After several more attempts at sound proofing, I ended up making a sound proof box below my work bench out of sound panels ordered off amazon. I kept the front open with a door and the back vented. This helped the sound levels tremendously. I also ended up purchasing (2) larger computer fans which I placed at the front and back of the box for increased air movement. Keep in mind that the hotter the miner, the faster the fan speed on the machine. 

From an operating standpoint, I purchased a WiFi extender with an Ethernet port for the miner which has worked pretty well. Although I did have frequent disconnections especially at the beginning. This was rough because when the miner disconnects the fan speed will increase to 5000rpm and is very noisy. It also takes a minimum of 5 minutes to reconnect to the agent and settle the miner down. That doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot of time until you and your tenant are forced to listen to a high frequency pitch for minutes on end. 

I went with BTC.com for my miner pool. I am currently running the agent software on my laptop upstairs in my apartment. A designated desktop computer would definitely be ideal here, but currently I don‚Äôt have it setup as such. Again a lot of troubleshooting up front on getting the miner to sync to the pool but the pool seems OK now. 

I am currently running the miner on low power and am producing roughly 43TH/s daily. This equates to a payout of about .005 BTC every 7-8 days. My plan is to set the miner on either standard or turbo mode in the summer once the house AC units are running and the noise is less of a factor. 

My electric costs going into the year were .071kw/hr. I think they may have increased slightly though more recently. 

So through end of April (4 months) with extensive trial and error and extended downtimes in the beginning, I have been able to generate approximately .076 BTC (about $600 for those counting at home). Obviously you need to deduct electricity costs to get your true profit. Here is a recap of my total costs to date

Miner: $1,900 
Electric upgrades: $330 
WiFi extender, comp fans and Ethernet cords: $125
Sound Panels: $130
Total all in: $2,485


For me I‚Äôm less concerned about the current profitability and more focused on where I see BTC going in the future and being able to consistently accumulate outside of regular purchases through an exchange. For instance, I see that same .076 being worth $7,600 in the next two years. That‚Äôs a $100,000 price target btw. 

It‚Äôs also been important for me to maximize the up time of the miner and squeeze as much out of it as I can before the halving next month. For now I am planning to continue mining after the halving unless BTC price falls below $5,000 then I may go offline until price can recover. 

All and all, if you are interested in getting into mining be prepared to spend lots of time learning and testing workable methods once you get started. Also be prepared to deal with the noise levels and friends thinking your crazy. BTC mining is much more extensive than plugging in an ASIC and forgetting about it. For most people, purchasing BTC through an exchange is more than sufficient to accumulate BTC. Certainly less of a headache! I will say though that through all the trial and error this year, I am happy with the position I‚Äôm in now and think I am at a point where I can manage the miner well and keep it going consistently.",1588038730,52,1

ga64aq,Baseme6,Worries about no more miners,"Hi everyone,

I'd like to begin by saying that I am new to crypto so I might not clearly understand the whole situation, 

I've noticed that no one is really worried about there being less and less miners for bitcoin. With the halving of bitcoin the amount of money that miners profit off of mining is a fraction compared to what they pay in electricity bills, etc. My concern is that as of now mining isn't really worth it and that at a certain point we may see a major decrease in minors simply because mining will end up costing them rather than profiting them. 

Is there something that I'm missing? Why does no one seem concerned about this fact, I mean, if there happens to be a decrease in miners, then transfers will not be verified and the system would simply no longer work?

Please correct me if I'm wrong as I'd like some clarification on the matter, 

Thank you!",1588151466,17,1

I have also set up a SEPA account sending 6 euros and I have heard nothing so can't do big transfer from this account.

I have emailed with all the verification coinbase requested and heard nothing.  I have tried to unlink my debit card as well and put it back and now it won't let me put it back.  Nowhere to contact anyone. No one calls me back on email.  What a nightmare.  How can anyone operate when the customer service is so bad.  Coinbase if you are out there please get in touch.  I need you to verify the 6 euros from my SEPA account.  I sent this last Friday.  Then I can actually buy some bitcoin although that will take another few days.

ga47m5,Dvorak1911,PSA : NEVER EVER SELL BITCOINS with PAYPAL (F&amp;F too)!!!,"https://preview.redd.it/o7cmdgft7pv41.png?width=890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e9c57fd662418a38b6316fec67c9fc40b4fcabf

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, I wanted a little discount when buying electronics and sold my Bitcoins for Paypal F&amp;F. I received the Paypal money at an discounted price and bought the electronics successfully.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jcuo5l5w7pv41.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02755ac2e12c7434c10199e098e2613544cb29f8

https://preview.redd.it/jf1txedx7pv41.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=717f6c9fbb7ebd46d2d6dcf924cc8848f74011ee

https://preview.redd.it/at6t361b9pv41.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c8a1a268ed933045a7d70257872f2f66085b39a

&amp;#x200B;

However, After 2 weeks, the buyer opened up a chargeback case on me. Paypal asked me for clarification, and I sent my Paxful invoice, chat logs and the screenshot from the scammer confirming that he sent the money through Paypal.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I lost the case after 90 days and Paypal just closed the case without notifying me in any ways. I noticed it when was too late. Now I am stuck with paying the money the scammer had scammed elsewhere. I requested Paypal for the clarification about the case and information about the buyer to open up a police report on him, but I got no answer back from them.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, even the Friends and Family (F&amp;F) payment on Paypal is NOT SAFE! The buyer confirmed me that he was sending money through Paypal F&amp;F and it was true. Yet, he was able to issue a chargeback and take back his money claiming it was an ""Unauthorized Payment"". If the F&amp;F payment is issued through card, the buyer can chargeback you whenever he wants claiming it was ""Unauthorized"".

&amp;#x200B;

NEVER EVER Sell your Bitcoin through Paypal.

If the buyer has malicious intent, he could abuse the Paypal's system anyway he likes. Paypal will just sit around and give him free pass even though there is an ample evidence supporting the seller.",1588141270,30,1

My family member just sold his house in china and wants to buy a house in Australia. but china currency capital controls are very restrictive. Does china go after people buying lots of btc using rmb?

gahv8q,omnamahshivay,How are crypto gains taxed?,"Apologies if the question is too broad, but I wanted to better understand how governments may track and tax gains from bitcoin. I understand that taxation is dependent on where you live and your countries tax body. 

Therefore I want to consider a hypothetical scenario where the country has capitals gain tax.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets consider the first scenario, this one is straightforward -

I buy 1 BTC when it's priced at $6000, hold it for 2 years and sell it at $10,000. I purchase and sell the coin with the same broker, who gives me a cost basis and I report and have this taxed along with my other investment assets.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets consider another scenario, this one is potentially more complicated -

I buy 1 BTC again when it's priced at $6000, I then transfer this to one or more bitcoin wallets, the government doesn't know who owns those wallets. After a couple of years, I withdraw cash from an ATM using a BTC debit card which one of those wallet providers gave me.

How does the government track these transactions and know that I owe tax.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly let's consider another case which is a modification of the second case -

Instead of withdrawing the money, I instead spend the BTC to buy goods and services (I pay the sales tax due), in this case is their any capitals gains involved? If so, why? Is this case not analogous to me buying store credit in terms of a Gift Card at say Amazon, waiting for the prices of an item to drop and then using the store credit to buy the item.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not looking for advice or suggestions on avoiding paying taxes, I'm simply trying to understand -

1. How crypto is taxed (what is a taxable event)
2. and If one can avoid Capital Gains when they spend crypto?",1588194777,15,1
gahuie,DoItSolutions,Cost of manipulating liquidation price in leveraged trading," 

What is the downside / cost to adding and removing position size to affect liquidation price?

Scenario: You have 1,000 contracts short on an asset at $10,000 price at 2x leverage.

The estimated liquidation price is roughly $20,000. Price rises to $18,000

You add 1,000 contracts short at $18,000 price (still 2x leverage)

You now have 2,000 contracts at an average entry of $14,000

The new estimated liquidation price is now roughly $28,000.

You instantly reduce your short position by 1,000 contracts (still $18,000 price).

You now have 1,000 contracts short at an average entry price still at $14,000

The estimated Liquidation price is still up at around $28,000

Summary:

1. You now have a much higher price where your short trade becomes profitable (14k instead of 10k)
2. You now have a much higher price to hit before liquidating (28k instead of 20k)

Assumption: There must be a cost involved in making this happen.

My questions: Are the following true?

1. When you reduce the position from 2,000 contracts to 1,000 contracts, you are realising a previously unrealised loss on the 1,000 contracts that the position was reduced by.
2. Your loss would be equal to the loss of placing a 1,000 contract short trade at $14,000 and exited at $18,000.
3. This works out to about %40 loss on 1,000 contracts ($4,000 move from $14,000 towards the $28,000 liquidation price)

As I've been trying to educate myself on the nature of crypto, one scenario keeps popping up in my head. I understand that scarcity and trust are the two major factors that dictate BTC's value. Taking this into consideration, indulge me on the following scenario. Considering that exchanges are the focal point of the market, and many of the newcomers are likely storing their BTC on said exchanges' wallets, what happens if these exchanges get hacked in an extreme way? A majority of crypto holders are then depleted of their coins, as exchanges are not backed in the same manner as banks. As a result, one of the main factors (trust) is diminished and a majority loose their faith in crypto and BTC's value is greatly reduced rendering the coins that are stored even on cold wallets useless?

My grandpa had zero clue that the underlying asset has a minimal storage cost; as well as the ability to send fractions of it at the snap of a finger.

I showed him how to download Green wallet on his iPhone and sent him 50,000 Satoshi. Explained the divisibility, explained the proof of work concept that makes (essentially) every transaction older than 6 confirmations ""immutable."" 

Him and I talked about concept of ownership for atleast an hour after that. And how he's always felt at the behest of his broker or accountant or banker as far as getting his money out when he wants. 

I'm sure my grandpa will never truly be able to see the full concept of Bitcoin in fruition, but he's now equipped with the knowledge enough to pass along his private keys for actual Bitcoin he owns.

g68jbf,imgonnabeatit,Government Digital Currency and the Fall of Bitcoin,"**Governmental Digital Currency**

If Bitcoin is the future, do you really think the world powers are just going to sit on the sidelines and let it take over? I would say.... no. The government, assisted by the big banks, are going to create their own digital currency with regulations and policies -- not because they're greedy bastards who want to keep the rich, richer -- but because the government believes they have that obligation, for the greater good and protection of the public. Same reasons they regulate the Internet. And cars. And drones. And radio. Technology has always become the shadow of Government. But this time -- technology is threatening the mechanics of the US economy. So don't expect history to change. In fact, prepare for it. Slowly and surely the Government will seep it's way into this new technology. And the reason why this is almost a sure guarantee is because the first super world power that develops their own regulated digital currency is probably going to the strongest currency, and possibly, be the strongest world power. That's why it's a race. Look at how Netflix started and quickly became the #1 streaming platform. And now you have basically every fricken other website imaginable trying to being a streaming site (Disney, HBO Facebook, Youtube, etc). It's almost amazing how digital currency mirrors the story of online streaming. Bitcoin, of course, is Netflix.

**Cool Rich Kids Always Take Over (Usually)**

It's kinda like when you're the nerdy kid in high school and you develop ""this cool thing"" that spreads throughout your nerdy friends. Then, throughout the other students. It catches on, fast, and soon the rich, popular, and beautiful people will get it on the game and make it their own. Soon nobody will even remember the cool thing you started and the credit for making it amazing will go to the rich and popular. And they'll get all the glory. Like how you write a book, and Hollywood takes it over. Or how you develop a new product, and some business buys the patent and makes millions. Or how you create a new digital currency and... oh wait... that hasn't happened yet.""

**Bitcoin Predictions and Involvement of the Fed**

I predict in the next 15 years or so, the major governments ( China, US, ""the Euro"" and Russia) will develop their own independent digital currency to be used within each country. And this will be REALLY bad for bitcoin. The only thing that will keep it afloat is a revolution.

**Bitcoin Crash Once Big Players Leave**

Honestly, with this economy, I feel like there's going to be a major crash once people need money to pay for essentials. All it takes is the bigger players to pull out and bitcoin will crash hard. This will create a mass panic from everybody and soon bitcoin will go down to $1000 - $2000. Probably why it needs to be regulated in the first place. You can't have a currency that is a fricken rollercoaster otherwise you'll go into a supermarket and... one week it'll be $5... next month it'll be $1,000. 

&gt; ""Grandma: Welp... guess I'm not getting milk this month. I'll just wait until September to buy milk.""

**Summary**

Anyway -- sorry for the rant. Obviously you can poop on my thoughts, Triumph style. But I don't think my prognosis is too far-fetched. I do believe in digital currency although I don't fully understand it, hence why I'm skeptical. We're kind of already there anyway as most banks don't even carry cash. I hope we can both agree that bitcoin is not a guarantee in either direction, worthless or priceless. The future is the only thing that holds the answer. 

Sorry for any typos or un-backed facts. I'm just initiating a conversation. 

**TL;DR:** Everything I say is from my butthole, but maybe my farts smell good to some of you. Do you think Governmental Digital Currency is inevitable, and how will it impact Bitcoin?",1587586674,23,0

By level on August 13‚Äì14, 2017. the exchange rate of one bitcoin amounted to 4000 USD, while its real equivalent was about 215 000 USD. In other words, at that time, one US dollar was worth ‚Äî it contained 0.0000046511627907 bitcoins and at that time, at the end of the issue, each bitcoin would ‚Äúswallow‚Äù 797 313 000 797. 00 USD.

What are you dealing with right now is not real Bitcoin, but its surrogate, which is controlled with the help of iodams. Yodam, in its first principle, is an incorporeal conscious highly intellectual energy-informational entity, artificially created to control mental and / or astral projections of certain processes taking place at the level of the manifest physical world or society. To imagine this, look at your shadow on a clear sunny day and do any manipulations. For example: slowly raise your hands up, this will correspond to an increase in the course, down = fall, etc.

Despite all the laws of the free market, when the bitcoin exchange rate changes, the rates of all cryptocurrencies proportionally change, i.e. his forks!

And ask for verify to lv 2

And withdrawal suspend also due ro risk trigger !

I though its happened coz this time i use VPN .. the last three time i withdraw i used real Ip 

I open ticket , and after 51 hr i receive mail from support ask me for

a) You must appear in the video, and hold your ID document.
b) Please make sure the video shows your whole login process from the sender platform, website URL, and withdrawal records like transaction ID or hash and date. if you are using stargazer wallets, nano ledger or any other personal wallets, please show us the wallet address or public key in addition to Transaction details like Hash or TxID.

And i replied

Since iam new in this field and I am not allowed to buy bitcoin or crypto currencies via Internet using visa or bank and it is illegal same all of Arab country and u can ask for that .

there are WhatsApp and Telegram groups that include sellers and buyers - buy and sell currencies outside exchange hand by hand OTC

I bought it OTC 

Therefore, your request for verification is almost impossible, as I cannot access the account of the sender of the transaction. how it would be? Even chance to meet him again is not guaranteed. Assuming I met him, do you think he will allow me to make video of his personal account and details?

And told them i can access with same devices i loged in and withdrawal  before and same IP

And next day i send email to support to check my accoun to see my login history that  i loged in same ip same device and give him the transaction i did it in this day buy and sell with detail to make sure iam the account holder

When checking, I found that [there are still countries without Bitcoin nodes!](https://bitnodes.io/) 

So, I thought I would have a look around to see why this might be. These countries with few or no Bitcoin nodes are either not heavily populated, lacking in infrastructure such as electricity or internet or less economically developed. An example of such a country is Chad although there are many more!

Chad is a country in Africa with an average income of $740 annually, a life expectancy of 53.71 and 0.5 mb/s internet speed. It could be argued that countries like Chad are those who need Bitcoin the most. Now, I personally think that it would be hugely important for Bitcoin nodes to exist in as many countries as possible and I have a proposal to make to this community. With the average internet speed of 0.5mb/s, it would take over 50 days to download the entire blockchain. 

I think that it would be completely possible for a few people here to pool together and afford the hardware needed for a full node. We could then download the majority of the blockchain on to a HDD and deliver this to them so that they would not have to spend weeks downloading. The perfect place for a Bitcoin node would be a library or university or school and the PC could even be used for educational purposes with a nice big Bitcoin sticker on the side :)

Let me know what you all think. Obviously this would have to be done after Coronavirus has resolved but now is the perfect time for planning and talking this through. Thanks for hearing me out!",1587585398,5,2

As already mentioned, Bitcoin is the lowest projection of the energy standard of the Higher Plans erzanil. In its first principle, it was intended to replace the modern banking monetary system to SES ‚Äî the system of energy-informational-energy settlements / mutual settlements.

The latter was necessary for the further simultaneous transfer of all people to the three chakra system (ordinary people call it Ascension) and to prevent, therefore, the coming uncontrolled creation of new virtual worlds and the ensuing massive virtual slavery among equals!

Bitcoin was intended to equalize the energy imbalances at the level of society and the consciousness of planet Earth proper, which were created by the modern banking credit monetary system, as well as money, gold, other similar assets, and primarily banks. It is banks that produce unsecured money through loan interest that generate and accelerate all inflationary processes / energy distortions and, as a result, economic / energy crises.

The Erzanil projection or real Bitcoin is controlled/manage starting from the level of the eighth dimension or the first Higher Plan, which corresponds to two additional chakras that appear after the Ascension.

Only an ascended person has the appropriate qualities and can control bitcoin. And then not every person. The total number of erzanilles existing at higher levels corresponds to the total number of their lower projections, i.e. 21,000,000. Being located vertically in descending order, it is an archetype of the new human energy structure.

The act of encrypting is the only possible means that guarantees the digital enjoyment of the right to privacy, which gives us the power of anonymity and selectively reveal ourselves to the entire world and the right to freedom of expression, which gives us the power to reveal any knowledge to the entire world.

The right to encryption gives us the power to provide privacy to freedom of expression. These rights are not negotiable, they do not admit weighting between them or against others. They are fundamental to freedom in a digitally open society.

The power of these rights is only conferred to those who defend them through practice and their use, in accordance with an anarchic and autarkic contract of social adherence, that extends to the entire world and to a digital society, which knows no borders, therefore that the state is not necessary; where trusted intermediaries are not recognized, so the transfer of property and value only involves the beneficiaries; where operation and progress require the active participation of each of its members, so any type of government finds no use.

This social and economic revolution, inherent in a permanently digital society, integrates its followers, in a single individual act, free and secret in the act of encrypting.
Exercising the right to encrypt, is an altruistic act and of common interest, by permanently encrypting all digital interaction, we become immune to any type of: slavery, violence, discrimination, repression, coercion, discrimination and xenophobia.

A digitally open society that does not permanently exercise its right to encrypt will be condemned to live a dystopian reality and enslaved to a neo-feudal economic system.",1588023731,13,2

g99t5f,Bklyn2DTLA,How I Lost 100.00 Just Like That.,"It's not much but its something to me or probably to anyone who has lost BTC. I also assume there is no way of getting this money back, as it seems to just be lost.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to get 100.00 from the ATM, so I downloaded this wallet [BTC Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet&amp;hl=en_US) which I have used once before and didn't have any issues. So, I installed the wallet, went to the ATM inserted my cash, scanned the QR code and now 4-5 hours later, no deposit at all. Again, I've done this process before so it wasn't a error on my part or was it . . . .

&amp;#x200B;

This is the only thing I can think of, I downloaded the app, scanned the QR code but it was the old address and the app hasn't regernerated a new sending address and sent to my previous address from the 1st time I used the app months ago and bc of that my coins are now attached to a old address somewhere out there in the void.  I make that assumption, bc The recieving address isn't listed and a new recieving address is now in the address book.

&amp;#x200B;

I curious if all my assumptions are right or what esle could have caused this lost transaction ? I  see everything on [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com)  the hash, the date, the to to the from and the amount, and in red unconfirmed.

&amp;#x200B;

Its frustrating to see whats yours and I don't have any way of getting whats rightful mine to me. All I have in a 100.00 piece of paper. If anyone knows how to resolve this issue or if I just lost 100.00. I never knew it could be so so easy to just lose 100.00 just like that.

&amp;#x200B;

PS - Any suggestions on a better wallet to use here and there ?? I don't want this to happen again. ",1588022715,53,2

g96nzf,Pantamis,Decentralized identities with Bitcoin and ION layer 2,"Bitcoin blockchain is by far the most secure blockchain. The blockchain can play the role of a trustless decentralized timestamp server and combined with layer 2 networks it will help to solve a thirty years problem: decentralized identities.

Let's say you want to talk to Bob that you don't meet and probably never will (Snowden as true extreme case, or any store website). You ask him online a public key to communicate privatly with him through encryption. You received a public key, how can you be sure that this public key is really Bob's public key ? Can you trust this public key ? The answer is no because you can't trust what you see online (what if your/Bob's computer/social media account/private key are compromise ?). 

There are two solutions: 
* meet Bob personnaly so that he gives you a public key 
* get his public key with the signature of someone you trust enough when he say he got Bob's key and check the ownership more or less physically (Certificate Authorities) 

The first is implemented in the ""web of trust"" settings of PGP. ""Web of trust"" scale very badly, people must organize key signing party's to sign public keys with their master key. When surfing on the web, we need to trust the signature of Certificate Authorities to be sure to be on the good website. They are central point of censorship and they can be maliciously by signing the public key for an identity that don't own the private key. 

But our good blockchain can save the day. Let say you found all the public key that pretend to be owned by Bob. There can be several public key owned by Bob but there is one you are sure is a good one: the one that was the first created. Indeed, you may assume that no one knows the existence of Bob before he was asked for a public key the first time to get an account on any website. So what we need is a trustless decentralized way for Bob to prove that he created one public key before any other public key that can associated with him. And you can already do that on Bitcoin blockchain with an OP\_RETURN transaction or [here for free](https://opentimestamps.org/) ! 

Once this is done Bob can now create an identity. It is an object (a kind json file) containing the anchored public key of Bob at the root where he can add stuff by sending an operation message with a signature. Each file's operation are anchored in the blockchain for time stamping. This timestamping allows to prove that the last state of the object was made before a certain date. But Bob also add the hash of the previous operation in the message so that we keep the order of operation. This build a kind of separate blockchain stored in a decentralized broadcast network in layer 2 of Bitcoin. This is what ION network of Microsoft does as explained [here](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree/blob/master/docs/protocol.md).

Bob can add to the object several public key for recovery in case he loses the master private key or other stuff where he is susceptible to be asked for his approuval, he can also revoke keys. The applications are wonderfull :

* Bob can add the public key of its Lightning node, allowing anyone to privatly talk with him through Lightning's messaging apps like [Whatsat](https://github.com/joostjager/whatsat) and make almost perfectly anonymous donations. 
* Imagine a state, bank or insurance do the same and create his own identity. Anyone (merchants, guardian, administration) may ask to Bob to prove his name or that he is currently underage/solvable/insured. Bob can ask a one-time usage signed certificate by the state/bank/insurance public key of this for Bob's public key without more informations than needed.
* An university can provide one-time usage certificates for its students when they need it for a job ...

&amp;#x200B;

But very strange things happened today (the amounts of transaction will be rounded):

27 APRIL 2020

7 a.m. - on my wallet about 0.05 bitcoins. I make a transfer using API to 0.035 bitcoins. And instead of getting the change 0.015 bitcoin is sent to some unknown address.

This transaction was fully automatic and I didn't notice the 0.015 bitcoin missing. And I didn't see the problem until  the 10:00 a.m. actions.

&amp;#x200B;

10 am - I charge my blockchain.com wallet with 0.45 Bitcoin to start the working day and make transfers to clients.

I need to make a transfer to 0.02 bitcoin. I do it through site directly  [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) \- specify the recipient's address and enter 0.02 bitcoin. Clicking send and after a second I see that my wallet becomes 0 bitcoins. I open the transaction and see that 0.02 went to the right address, 0.43 went not to the change, but to an unknown address. I look at the transaction before that and see that at 7:00 a.m. the same thing happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately write to tech support and describe the situation. I haven't heard back from them in six hours already...

&amp;#x200B;

12 o'clock in the afternoon - I make an expirement and refill my wallet with 0.013 bitcoin and transfer 0.012 bitcoin to my other wallet. And again - I do not receive change, and the amount of 0.001 Bitcoin is sent again to the same unknown wallet. And again, the interface of the site says that I allegedly indicated two recipients. The transaction was made through the site.

&amp;#x200B;

6 p.m. - I make one more extra and record video. I refill my wallet with 0.0006 bitcoin. I open the application on my phone with authorization in the same wallet (the phone is connected to a cellular network, not to wifi as on the computer). Send 0.0005 bitcoin to your wallet - this amount is gone right, and 0.0001 bitcoin is sent again to an unknown wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

In all 4 cases, the unknown wallet has the same address.

The support of [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) is already informed. All addresses and transactions have been sent to them, as well as video proof that the problem is full on their side. 

&amp;#x200B;

From [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) I expect a response to me and the refund sent through their fault is not a purse that I did not have access

&amp;#x200B;

Hey r/bitcoin! I'm Lixin, longtime bitcoiner and creator of Cobo Vault.

I come from a background in the electronic hardware industry, and experienced one of my products being featured in Apple Stores around the world. Back in 2018 Cobo CEO Discus Fish, who also co-founded F2Pool, invited me to help build Cobo‚Äôs hardware product line. As we had strong ties to miners in China, we naturally designed the 1st gen with them in mind. In China, mining farms are nearly always built in very isolated places where there is very cheap wind or water electricity. When we built our 1st generation Cobo Vault hardware wallet, we needed to maximize the durability of the device in addition to its security. We used aerospace aluminum rather than plastic and made it completely IP68 waterproof, IK9 drop resistant, and military standard MIL-STD-810G durable for the mining industry. 

Things changed last year when I went to Bitcoin 2019 and talked to lots of hodlers in the States. I found that 95% of them don‚Äôt care about durability. I asked them if they were afraid of their home being flooded or burned down in a fire. The answer is - yes, they are afraid of these things, but see them as very low possibilities. Even if something were to happen, they said they would just buy another HW wallet for 100 dollars. From these conversations, it became more and more clear we should design a product around a normal hodler‚Äôs needs.

Our 2nd gen product compromises on durability but doesn‚Äôt compromise on security. 

Most hodlers share some needs with miners:

1. Hodlers want a more air-gapped solution so we kept QR code data transmission between your hardware wallet and the companion app which is also auditable.
2. A Secure Element is the strongest wall of protection from physical attacks. We are the first hardware wallet - also maybe the first electronic product with SE - to have open source SE firmware. 
3. A battery can be a significant weak point. The 2nd gen continues the legacy of detachable batteries to prevent corrosion damage and will also support AAA batteries in case your battery dies someday.
4. The 2nd gen also keeps the 4-inch touchscreen so you don‚Äôt need to suffer from tiny buttons and little screens anymore. Human error is one of the biggest reasons people lose their assets.
5. We kept other features like the self-destruct mechanism and Web Authentication, which prevent side-channel and supply chain attacks.

If you'd like to read more about these features, check out our [blog posts](https://medium.com/cobo-vault/second-gen-hardware-wallets-feature-support-c0aaf00a4216).

Aside from the legacy of the 1st gen, our 2nd gen product will have:

1. Open source hardware wallet application layer and Secure Element firmware code. With the open source firmware code, you can see: random number generation, master private key generation, key derivation, and the signing process all happen within the SE and your private keys never leave.
2. At the Bitcoin 2019 conference half the hodlers I met told me they own multiple hardware wallets which they use on the go. We added a fingerprint sensor you can use to authorize transactions without typing in your password. No need to worry about surveillance cameras when using your hardware wallet in airports.
3. We will also support PSBT (BIP174) to be compatible with third-party wallets like Electrum or Wasabi Wallet in case people have need of using Cobo Vault with their own node or coinjoin. Multisig between Cobo Vault and other wallets will be realized to prevent single point failure with any brand of hardware wallet.
4. By sacrificing the durability, we successfully controlled the price under 100 USD for the basic version. 
5. BTC-only firmware version for people who want to minimize the codebase for less of an attack surface.

We truly appreciate the support from the community and are giving away free metal storage Cobo Tablets with every purchase of our 2nd gen for a week! Add a tablet to your cart and place your order before May 5th, 8 AM PST to claim your free metal storage. Find us on Twitter u/CryptoLixin and u/CoboVault- any suggestions or questions are welcome!",1588172600,21,1

One of the main issues is one I've been struggling with for over 4 years and it's the issue of whales dominating, influencing, and controlling the btc ecosystem and having everyone else at their mercy.

I was wondering what people smarter than me can tell me to suggest that this won't be as problematic later as some people fear.

I understand that the larger the overall marketcap gets the less overall strength a whale possesses to move the entire market, but those with huge sums of btc will still be able to make a splash big enough to move the price up or down whenever they want, no?

Some of these discussions are simply sad to read as many people are so blind and don‚Äôt see anything wrong with the current system  :(

I‚Äôm absolutely NOT encouraging any trolls or spamming to go ahead..... just simply look at some of the articles these days and answer if needed
