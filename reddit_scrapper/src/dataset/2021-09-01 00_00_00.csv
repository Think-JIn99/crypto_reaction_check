ph6lmk,Cedarplankton,Symbiotic relationships?,"Hi guys,

I‚Äôm a big believer of Bitcoin, and it‚Äôs potential revolutionary impact. 

I‚Äôm not looking to shill here at all, I‚Äôm just looking to broach contact between communities and trying to gauge what your feelings are in regards to merge-mined projects. 

If you‚Äôre not already familiar with the project, Syscoin is a fork of BTC. It‚Äôs merge-mined with BTC so it‚Äôs existence thoroughly depends on it. It was the first sha256 to implement segwit and taproot, and the devs are constantly committing all of BTC updates. 

It has a higher hashrate than BCH, and potential TPS has been tested by white block. They‚Äôre currently implementing a smart contract layer of their own based on Ethereums. 

Syscoin is unique, but relies on BTC for bitcoins security as their is no other better crypto for that. 

There just doesn‚Äôt seem to be any love by the btc community although SYS is heavily related to Bitcoin. They can exist mutually together as both can really benefit from each other. 

What do you guys think?",1630680397,0,1

By definition it's value goes up over time as long as it is being used and utilized. That means it will never stop going up, even In 100 years.

ph4wfb,Ambitious_Hope2055,Argument against the adoption of Bitcoin by El Salvador as its official FIAT currency:,"Bitcoin is way too volatile to be a Fiat currency. It fluctuates within a margin of 30%. How can you budget government spending if in 1 month your tax revenue is worth 30% less than it is now. How can someone who barely survives on $300 a week, afford food, water, shelter, clothing for his or her family if that $300 is now worth only $210 for that month maybe even less. How can a country who is so undeveloped, where most people don‚Äôt have access to the internet, actually adopt an internet based currency? 95% of the chamber of commerce are against the adoption of bitcoin and the majority of people of El Salvador are also against it too. Nobody wants it because it will make El Salvador even poorer. It is one of the poorest countries in the world already. 

Also, why would you want to support a decision that is made by a new president who abolished the constitution and congress and has become a ‚Äúbenevolent‚Äù Dictator in order to improve the lives of his people by adopting Bitcoin as the official currency against the wishes of his advisors and people. President Nayib Bukele, says that one of main reasons why he wants to adopt bitcoin is to increase ‚ÄúFinancial Inclusion‚Äù. He states that ‚Äúonly one million El Salvadorans pay taxes, the rest deal in cash.‚Äù So what is his definition of ‚ÄúFinancial Inclusion‚Äù. To get the rest of his people to pay taxes and increase tax revenue? Does he think those who pay in cash want to pay taxes or want to be ‚Äúfinancially included‚Äù. It‚Äôs fucking laughable. You think the 5 million who don‚Äôt pay taxes are screaming and begging to be ‚ÄúFinancially Included‚Äù. ‚ÄúPlease sir, I desperately want to be Financially Included! I really want to pay taxes!‚Äù

Let‚Äôs face it, this is a dictator actively consolidating power and wants to increase his Piggy Bank by adopting bit coin and increasing taxes. He doesn‚Äôt care about the volatility because a loss of 30% of tax revenue from an additional 5 million taxpayers is negligible on comparison to the tax revenue collected now from 1 million tax payers total. 

HE CLEARLY DOES NOT CARE ABOUT HIS PEOPLE ONLY GAINING POWER. TO SUPPORT BITCOIN IN EL SALVADOR IS TO SUPPORT A DICTATOR AND FURTHER DISENFRANCHISE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  

I understand the excitement and drive to have a country official adopt a cryptocurrency. It‚Äôs an exciting technology and I do think it is the future, but not until we solve its innate volatility problems. 

I would recommend if a cryptocurrency must be adopted by El Salvador that they create their own blockchain and decentralized ledger; and issue its cryptocurrency to its people and let the microeconomics of a small supply and isolated currency help maintain a stable value.

ph32i7,dsmlegend,Simple seed splitting scheme for improved redundancy and security,"I wanted to share a series of simple seed splitting schemes that might be helpful to those who find the reasoning behind it appealing. The schemes allow for splitting the 24 words (or 24 + password) in such a way that a minimal quorum of parts is needed to obtain the full set of words. Particularly, 2-of-3, 2-of-4, 3-of-4, 2-of-5, 3-of-5 and 4-of-5 schemes are shown. And no, I am not talking about Shamir SSS (more on that at the end).

First, let me explain why it might be desirable to split your seed and store the parts it in multiple locations. If you store your seed in full (not split), you run the risk that, if a copy is compromised, your funds are essentially immediately compromised. If you store only one copy, the number of opportunities for compromise is minimised, but you have no redundancy in case your only copy becomes inaccessible for any reason. If you store multiple copies, you do have redundancy but now each copy must be fully secured and there are more opportunities for compromise.

By splitting our seed according to one of the schemes below, we obtain a degree of redundancy, whilst also relaxing the risk associated with one (or more) of the parts being compromised.

**Instructions:** 

\- Pick a scheme and write each set of numbers on a separate piece of paper. 

\- Write down the indicated words according to their true position in your seed, next to its respective number on each paper. It is very important that the words must be correctly **numbered** when written down.

\- Double check and do a few test, simulating losing an allowed number of parts (eg. 'lose' 3 sets for the 2-of-5 scheme), to see if the full complement can be recovered.

\- Distribute sets among safe locations. Except perhaps for the 2-of-n schemes, it is probably quite safe to store with a friend or relative because any single part still has a huge amount of entropy missing.

**Schemes:**

Just a quick example to illustrate how this would work. Say you picked 3-of-4. If you lose set B but recover the rest, you will find that all numbers 1-24 are present among the recovered sets. It is so constructed that ANY combination of the sets can reconstruct the original list, so long as the minimum threshold is met (eg. any two sets for 2-of-5). 

It is important to realise that each additional part below the quorum threshold does provide some progress towards recovering the seed, which is relevant if an attacker has access to good or great (as the case may be) computational resources. This table should help you to make an appropriate judgement call, depending on your circumstance:

The cells indicate the number of words still missing if a portion of the parts (indicated in columns) are compromised (more is better).

||ONE|TWO|THREE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2-of-3|8|0|n/a|
|2-of-4|6|0|n/a|
|3-of-4|12|4|0|
|2-of-5|5|n/a|n/a|
|3-of-5|10|2.5\*|0|
|4-of-5|15|7.5\*\*|2.5\*|

\* average, at least 2 | \*\* average, at least 7

For the high-profile millionaires among us, this might not be for you, and you may want to put the effort into using a variant of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme (I may do a separate post on that). Yes it is more secure - no need to flex your opsec awareness muscles here. The advantage of this simple method here is that it can be created and recovered by hand.",1630667494,11,1

ph29m4,NoobInvestor0,BTC vs index funds?," I posted the following post on r/Bogleheads and i got downvoted , but i am curious what your perspective is , being on the opposite way of thinking when it comes to investing

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Hello , i know that this post is going to be controvational and that i will get downvoted but before starting to yell at me take into consideration that i am posting this to learn stuff , listen to your opinion and i am not advocating that crypto is better. I have never invested in my life and i will months later after a lot of reaserch

So after a lot of reaserch i found out that UCITs ETFS are tax free in my country , so i figured out it would be a good idea to YOLO all my savings (4k , i am 20 years old) on VWCE (international market index fund)

Before making sure to check all the last details in order to get ready to invest soon in the future , i was like alright i have heard many people saying that bitcoin is the future , and i have done some reaserch regarding how it works and stuff and i honestly believe that it will go well in the future so i was like alright imma check past performance

And holy shit guys bitcoin is up almost 400% the last year while vwce is at +27% , and bitcoin is +7600% up the last 5 years while VWCE is only at +36%....

Dont get me wrong , i totally understand that past performane is no way an indicator of future performance , but as it stands for now it seems that bitcoin will keep rising , so , providing that i am 20 years old with 4k , would it be a good idea to YOLO all my savings on bitcoin , wait 2-5 years and then withdraw all (probably massive gains) , and then invest all in on VWCE?

Yes i understand that by doing that i might lose a lot of money , that its way more risky than VWCE but providing that i am 20 and i cant handle some risk , and that the probability of bitcoin going up is much higher that going shit and permenantly staying down , is not plausable for now , why dont you guys think that crypto is a better option for the next several years (5 , 10?) , and THEN switcing to index funds after the crypto trend dies?

It is said that crypto could die when quantum computers come because they will be able to hack blockchain but until then , why not jump on the wagon?""",1630663854,13,1

ph2809,mrginopalacca,Today I boarded a billionaire to Bitcoin,"I had a meeting today with a VC billionaire. Somehow we started talking about Bitcoin. He was interested, but also kind of suspicious. He told me that he called his private banker months ago about Bitcoin, and then he was redirected to some broker lady that wanted to sell some shares in some company buying into some Bitcoin. He felt it scammy and stayed away.

As he was genuinely interested, I told him to forget about ""brokers"", ""investment managers"" basically everything and everybody circling him and wanting his money. I told him that Bitcoin is available directly to him if he wants and that he does not need the help of suited monkeys. Referred him to try Coinbase and Bitstamp as first steps. Promised him to educate him further on self custody when he is done with the first purchases.

Today he is proceeding with his first purchases.

I think I did my part for the day. And this is the thing you all need to do. There are plenty of wealthy people out there, genuinely interested in Bitcoin. But they do not have the proper angle, the proper contacts, the proper knowledge. They are geniuses with money, but simply do not understand the crypto world, they do not know anyone honestly advising them how to approach. They easily fall into the trap of suits, ending up on the wrong side of the game. All we need to do is to stay humble, and gently assist them. Once their trust is there, real money flows into our ecosystem.

I have kept some funds on exchange, self custody wallets, etc. Having Bitcoin is cool but nothing comes close to what I felt a few days ago when I tested lightning.

Lightning has come a long way, from a complicated tech for noobs (set up your own node, open channels) to get a self custody app and get going in 30 seconds. To my surprise, I didn‚Äôt even need to register a username nor email address to have a Swiss bank account in my phone. This is the future!

Within 30 minutes and a few conversations on Reddit, I manage to use my lightning wallet to send a few cents to 7 people in 4 continents, free, at the speed of light. I don‚Äôt even know who they are, I sent them satoshis, they send some back. It just worked.

Now, with that excitement I continue the experiment with a few of my friends, I sense a lot of hesitations:

- What‚Äôs a satoshi? It‚Äôs sounds foreign and scary!
- I read in Guardians and Reuters today, most people in El Salvador don‚Äôt want Bitcoin, they don‚Äôt understand it, it‚Äôs too complicated 
- I read that it‚Äôs super bad for the environment, using tons of energy for no application at all
yada yada

I was surprised at their reaction until I search on Google for myself and see the MASSIVE FUDS attack at El Salvador and Bitcoin going on traditional media nowadays.

A: If you said bitcoin or SWIFT etc. you'd be wrong. This is adapted from Wikipedia's description of FedWire. Bitcoin is basically FedWire with a few improvements, namely:

It's open to everyone
It's censorship free
It doesn't keep banking hours
It's capable of level 2 upgrades

What's the significance of this? Currently bitcoin has an annual turnover of $2 trillion so there's an upside potential of 300x to 400x for BTC demand, based on existing demand for FedWire. (That's 30,000% not 300%). If you factor in the additional utility of BTC plus a bit extra for Western Union then I'd say 500x is being conservative. That's just using it as a settlement system, it doesn't start to take in the value of it being a worldwide money. Because price is demand/scarcity times utility, that implies a price of $20MM a bitcoin.

So apart from some more up-to-date figures where's the flaw in this logic?",1631445108,3,1

pmqr39,ShotBot,"Just a rant about people who say: ""Satoshi has 1 million coins"" or ""Satoshi has never sold his coins""","I think it needs to be said that we don't know for fact that Satoshi has 1 million coins. The  ""1 million coins"" is more of a meme at this point than anything. There's no way to prove which wallets were his, and Satoshi's only confirmed wallets are the genesis block wallet and the wallet that sent Hal Finney the first transaction.

The meme came from a 2013 blog post called the ""Patoshi pattern"". The Patoshi Pattern is just a blogger's observation that in the first few years there was only a handful of miners. All of them were running crappy consumer grade hardware except for a single dominant miner that was running higher quality server grade hardware, and that miner has yet to ever spend their coins...or at least they haven't spent  coins from *wallets associated in that time period*.

There are 8 billion people in the world and there is nothing that suggests that the dominant miner must be Satoshi. For all we know, Satoshi could have mined 50 coins or 5 million coins. Just because a wallet mined during 2009-2011 doesn't mean that wallet is owned by Satoshi, and just because Satoshi disappeared in 2011 doesn't mean he necessarily stopped mining in 2011.

People who say that ""Satoshi never sold coins"" have no proof either. Even if those Patoshi  coins are Satoshi's, it doesn't mean he hasn't sold any Bitcoin. Satoshi could have sold Bitcoin mined from later periods/mined from different machines.",1631444735,12,1

A couple of comments caught my attention of ppl saying BTC would bring, with time, anarchism, and would bring the current monetary system down. 

I always were more of the impression people in the Bitcoin community in the early days were more of libertarians, that had surely read about Austrian economics, and that saw that this separation between money and Estate that Bitcoin can bring, would reduce the power of the Governments across the world and give it back to each individual, who could then take decisions at a personal level in their own best interest. And that, at a whole, would be for the best interest for everyone. 

But I don't see that taking governments down (anarchism) is in any way a goal in the road to hyperbitconization: I see governments still having their role (building roads, hospitals, public schools), but I think they would have to answer to the people in a much bigger way as today. Because in order to do all that, governments need to collect taxes. And in a world where the currency that is being used cannot be traced back to the individual, it remains a decision of the individual to pay those taxes or not. Ergo: people would only pay taxes for things that really make sense

What are your thoughts about this? Libertarianism or anarchism? If you think anarchism could come, how does the organization of communities/regions/countries would look like?",1631428664,24,1

I see a lot of people talking about Bitcoin overtaking fiat and taking power away from governments. On one hand, it's really exciting to be a part of that movement. But on the other hand, I imagine governments will fight like crazy to maintain their power and ability to create money. 

To what extent will governments go to maintain power over their people? 

How would this change power dynamics between nations?

I'm picturing a loss of infrastructure and a lot of military conflict. Are there any resources that go over some of the potential scenarios?

I like to think I'm a fairly open-minded, reasonable guy, and I don't like to use buzzwords. But this video seems like *blatant* FUD. However, I've only recently got into Bitcoin and would love some help dismantling the video's arguments, particularly the following points:

1. At 1:10 and 3:56 the narrator claims that ""wealthy investors are promoting Bitcoin"" and drawing people into a ""Ponzi scheme"". This focus on the ""wealthy investor"" seems divorced from reality. Somewhere I read that 95% of crypto holders are retail investors, can anyone find a source on that, or am I just pulling that out of my ass?
2. At 5:30 they claim ""If Bitcoin ever were to be widely adopted, it would consume many times more energy than is produced in the world today"". The video does not cite a source for this claim, does anyone have more info on this?
3. At 6:05 the narrator again claims that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme and has ""no benefit to society."" He also previously mentioned that Bitcoin transaction use spiked in 2017, and since then it's been mainly used as a store of value rather than a medium of exchange. Does anyone have counterpoints to this, especially the ""no benefit to society"" part?
4. If you guys notice any more stuff I missed let me know.

Hello Everyone, First of all, let me briefly tell you about what is happening in my country (Yemen), and how Bitcoin is helping to change people's lives for the better.

My country has been at war since 2015, the two main parties to the conflict are Ansar Allah group (Houthis) and the Saudi-led coalition. In addition to that war, the Saudi-led coalition has imposed a land, sea and air blockade on Yemen since then.

Consequently, Yemenis are now facing the worst humanitarian crises on earth, according to United Nations reports, there are about 22 million Yemeni people in urgent need of food, including 2 million children suffering from malnutrition. For more information you can check my profile.

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, a while ago I received donations in cryptocurrencies (90% were BTC), although I am still working on obtaining a permit from the relevant authorities to distribute the aid more widely, but I could not wait because people here desperately need this aid, as well as due to the decline in the cryptocurrency markets, so I have I decided to distribute aid to 15 families, as support for El Salvador, and also so that people would know the importance and strength of Bitcoin, as it was able to break the siege and reach areas that fiat currencies couldn't reach, so thanks to it, I was able to help people and alleviate their suffering.

And not just this sub, but other crypto subs, stop checking the price, or just leave social media all together.

I'm still a relatively new hodler myself, I started getting into bitcoin early this year and managed to buy a lot of btc (a lot is relative of course) during this year's peak in April after tons of people talking about ""buying the dip."" Then, the price dropped of course, and I had a heart attack. I almost sold everything, which would have given myself a huge loss for no reason. Bitcoin's volatility, which was completely new to me, also gave me a lot of anxiety over my investment.

Now, the price is almost back to where it was a few months ago. I'm very glad I didn't make a rash decision, but the thing is it doesn't even matter where the price is. What really helped me stop worrying about any of this was just turning off reddit for a few months, or at least not looking at any crypto subs. After a while, you just stop checking the price and you can come back to these subs (which are great platforms for discussions). Hell, you might even completely forget you own any bitcoin at all.

It's easy to be anxious about your statoshis or bitcoins when you're new to the incredible volatility of any crypto, I was in the same boat only half a year ago. If you buy btc, you believe in it, it's value, and there's so there's no point in worrying about what the price is today, or what a bunch of people are telling you to do on reddit. If you're struggling with hodling it, leave the sub for a bit, then come back in a month, or a year, or whatever, and you might be pleasantly surprised.",1631198480,9,2

Brazilians are known to love a pyramid (Ponzi) scheme, and in 2014 Glaidson Acacio dos Santos (a former waiter in a beach town in the state of Rio de Janeiro) founded a company GAS Consultoria to invest in cryptocurrency.

The investigation conducted by the Federal Police (Brazilian version to the FBI) discovered that the majority of the funds raised - over 1.2 billion BRL (around 200M USD) - was deposited to his bitcoin account in a big exchange (Binance? Coinbase?).

And, the curious part - his victims recently protested over his arrest claiming that GAS was not a scam or Ponzi.

There are several other use cases for this technology and blockchain shows a lot of promise for a variety of useful applications.

**Supply chain.**

Walmart uses blockchain technology to optimize its supply chain.

Their challenge was to trace the path of every farm or agricultural field that their products originate from, which could give insights to make better business decisions.

Their approach was to work with IBM to develop and integrate Hyperledger fabric blockchain into their supply chain ecosystem.

The results that Walmart achieved by this is that they could increase the tracing duration of the origin of their in-store products from 7 days to 2.2 seconds.

**Smart contracts.**

Ethereum which was introduced as a blockchain in 2013, is used as smart contracts across various industries. A smart contract is a set of computer-made rules which can be verified, negotiated, and enforce execution, all in a digital form.

(1).
5 - 6% Correction To the 47k &amp; 48k support levels.. Which might hurt some of our Altcoins Trades. (Short term)
(2).
A bullish retest of the 51k - 52K - 53K resistance price levels &amp; then we head for 60k.. Won't Happen Fast, But Surely &amp; Slowly We Will see 60k..or even Beyond.
(3).
BTC might stay ranging between 49,500 &amp; 50,500 for atleast 4days.... This will help make Altcoins pump hard and then we can all wait for massive corrections ahead of the new week incoming.
(4)
If BTC eventually hits 60k, there maybe a massive -50% correction down to 24/25k....Due to the massive Bearish Futures price Gap caused by Wall Street Institutional Traders (CME).
But if retailers &amp; BIG institutions buy BTC more &amp; more, then 100k or 200k isn't TOO far away. (LONG TERM)

Taking from that above concept, being able to create a blockchain that run in a LAN environment for the most part is easy, as getting access to the IP of a device over a local network is pretty simple and sending data between the two is straightforward. For the most part, online tutorials can show how that can work. 

What I don't understand is how to create or convert an existing blockchain that runs in a LAN environment to one that can accept nodes from outside a local network? How do you make a blockchain be accessible globally, and not just accessible within a local wifi network? 

How exactly does that initial connection get established to a given blockchain and what happens when that new node needs to be¬† indoctrinated? 

I've been looking all around to find information that talks more deeply about the actual communication between nodes and how the actual network layer works, but I've come across very little. 

I've also looked at the source code of bitcoin to see if that could give me any clues but it just left me more confused.

pixd9n,vikramgoel68,Understand Hash Functions the simplest way.,"**Hash functions** are mathematical functions that take an input of any size and give an output of a fixed size which is known as the hash (or digest). Their main objective is to protect and validate data integrity. It is a part of the consensus algorithm that is used in that particular blockchain. These hashes or digest which is the output of the hashing function are primarily used for comparison and not encryption.

**How hashing is used in blockchain?**

In a blockchain network, the data of the transactions which is stored in the blocks will have to be hashed, to validate the integrity of the network. The input in the hash function will be the transactional data that takes place inside the network, then the data is hashed and then stored in the block as a string in a fixed size depending on the type of hash function that is used. The hashing function of a blockchain network depends on the consensus algorithm of the network.

Crystal Elephant Farm (CEFA) gives you all the consistency, variety, and flexibility you need to profit in crypto today. CEFA is the evolution of DeFi ‚Äî one token, eight ways to profit.

Like its DeFi cousin, CETO, every CEFA transaction is taxed 10%. But look what gets done with it:

6%: reflection rewards back to holders

\*\~0.75%: rewards to CETO Blockchain Family holders

\*\~1.2%: burned to Fertilizer Bag account

\*\~4%: proportionally distributed and compounded into CEFA holders‚Äô accounts

4%: automated liquidity on PancakeSwap

\* 2%: BNB

\*2%: CEFA

Creates CEFA-BNB Liquidity Pool (LP tokens FERTILIZED/burnt)

Unlike some of these fly-by-night tokens with ridiculously high token supplies, CEFA‚Äôs modest 100 million total supply promises 20 years‚Äô worth of monthly airdrops to holders, dividends to the CETO Blockchain Family of existing tokens, locked liquidity with burnt LP tokens (can‚Äôt rugpull if there are no rugs!), and robust yield farming with plenty of staking opportunities for your tokens.

With every transaction earning rewards, dividends to CETO, providing liquidity, and burning the token supply, CEFA is designed for scarcity and longevity.

How to acquire the most Bitcoin on a limited budget,"I originally wrote about this on substack, if you'd rather read this there, here is the link - [https://thefinancebridge.substack.com/p/bitcoin-regular-investing-vs-smart](https://thefinancebridge.substack.com/p/bitcoin-regular-investing-vs-smart)

*Read Time: 12 mins*

For a long time now I've been fascinated with the idea that I can outsmart the markets.¬† The key to investing is buy low, sell high right? Sounds easy, and actually it is as I'll show you through this article, but is it the best way to 'stack Sats'?¬† *(Sats, or Satoshis, are the equivalent of 0.000000001 Bitcoin)*

I wanted to run an analysis of what I'm describing as 'Smart Money' buying (buy the dips, sell the highs), vs regular investments i.e. taking a small proportion of your salary each month and investing it regardless of the price (this is known as Dollar Cost Averaging (or Euro or Pound depending on where you live)).

I will point out that I'm not a trader, and I never will be.¬† I just don't have the attention span, knowledge or inclination to sit in front of a computer all day watching chart patterns form.¬† I will acknowledge that the best traders can seemingly see the Matrix and make more Bitcoin this way, but this article is for the rest of us.¬† Those that are more likely to lose Bitcoin by trading in this way.

First let's set the scene.

## What is Dollar Cost Averaging?

Let's say you have a lump sum of $1000 to invest and you want to put it in Bitcoin, what are your options?¬† Well, you could put it all straight in.¬† The short term effectiveness of this strategy is ultimately timing and largely luck.¬† Bitcoin is subject to wild price swings, oftentimes thats good and it goes up, but it just as frequently goes in the opposite direction too.¬† On any given day you could find that your $1000 becomes either $1500 or $500 depending on which way the price has moved.¬†

An alternative, lower risk method, is to break down your $1000 into, say, 10 lots of $100, and invest over a period of time, perhaps weekly or monthly.¬† This is called Dollar Cost Averaging because the dollar-cost of your Bitcoin gets averaged out over a number of purchases rather than in a single payment.¬† This reduces risk in the short-term because you're not trying to time the market, and if the price of Bitcoin goes down you can buy more for your money (although the opposite is also true).

In this analysis, I chose to look at possible scenarios where I had a set amount each month to invest. Let's say my salary comes in monthly, and after all my expenses I have $100 left to put into Bitcoin.¬†

With the goal of owning as much Bitcoin as I could, would I be best simply buying $100 every month regardless of price, or could I save the $100 each month and delay buying Bitcoin until there is a 'dip' in the price?

Let's first determine, what a 'dip' is, and how 'Smart Money' invests.

## Introducing the Mayer Multiple

The [Mayer](https://twitter.com/TraceMayer) Multiple is a simple, yet elegant, way to gauge the current price of Bitcoin against its historical price movements (in this instance using the 200 day moving average, which is simply the average price of Bitcoin over the previous 200 days).¬† It highlights when the price of Bitcoin is either overbought or oversold.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Bands - \(Source: https:\/\/checkonchain.com\/btconchain\/mayermultiple\_pricing\_usd\/mayermultiple\_pricing\_usd\_light.html \)](https://preview.redd.it/3sngscsvxtl71.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=087359c48454c07fd40540d1a9671d559bcb7858)

In the chart above, I'm using 'resistance bands' as defined by [@\_Checkmatey](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_) to overlay the probabilities of a price move higher or lower.¬† It's based on historical prices and how many days (out of Bitcoin's entire history) it has spent within those bands.¬† For example, the 'Strong Buy' line is defined as such because the Bitcoin price has only ever been that low for 10% of its history and so probability suggests the price will move higher.¬† On the flip side, when the price rises to above the 'Strong Sell' line, it has only ever been that high for 5% of its history, so there is an even stronger probability that the price will go down.

The green squares are what we will describe as 'Generational Buy' opportunities as they typically only come around once or twice per cycle (every 4 years) after a crash in Bitcoin price. You'll notice there was a bonus 'Generational Buy' opportunity in March 2020 as a result of the Covid pandemic crash, we'll come back to this.¬† The red square is what we'll call a 'Blow-Off ' top and is a very strong sell signal in this context.¬† Throughout its history, Bitcoin has typically gone through 4 year boom and bust cycles, where euphoric price rises end in near catastrophic collapses before regrouping and repeating to new highs.¬†

Knowing that no-one can predict the exact top or bottom of the market we'll use 4 key price bands to test our 'Smart Money' ideas:

* 'Generational Buy' - 10% chance of price going lower
* 'Buy the Dip' - 20% chance of price going lower
* 'Sell local top' - 10% chance of price going higher
* 'Sell Blow Off Top' - 5% chance of going higher

Armed with a way to consistently measure buy and sell signals, can we use this knowledge to time the market and acquire more Sats as a result?

## Buy and Hold (HODL!)

Firstly, let's assume that we never sell our Bitcoin, we only buy.¬† I just want to accumulate as many Sats as I can over a period of time.¬†

If I have $100 to invest each month should I just dollar cost average and buy each month or can I use the the 'Smart Money' ideas we just learnt about to time the market?

Here we are testing:

1. Investing $100 at the end of the month, regardless of price
2. Saving $100 every month and waiting until the next 'Generational Buy' opportunity presents itself before investing
3. Saving $100 every month and waiting until the next 'Buy the Dip' opportunity before investing

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I built out the above calculator to test out the different theories described throughout this article. Historical price data was downloaded from [https://au.investing.com/crypto/bitcoin/historical-data](https://au.investing.com/crypto/bitcoin/historical-data) up to 26 August 2021.

When you look at how could I have maximised my Bitcoin holdings over the previous x number of months one thing was very clear:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Over virtually every time period regular investing is king.¬† If you want to hold the most Sats, dollar cost average is your best friend, by far!*

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of observations:

* 'Generational Buy' opportunities come around very infrequently, in fact there have been none over the last 12 months.¬† If that is what you are waiting for you'd still be sitting entirely in cash!¬† If we actually look at the previous cycle (2014-2018) you could have gone for 3 years without an opportunity arriving!
* 'Buy the dip' strategy is the least effective, it does beat Dollar Cost Averaging over the last 4 year period, but only just.
* Over longer time frames, 5 &amp; 7 years, the difference in returns is staggering.¬† By regularly investing every month, like clockwork, you'd have over 2 times the number of Bitcoin by not trying to time the market.

There is an anomaly though.¬†

I'm really intrigued by the fact that 'Smart' buying beat regular investing over a 4 year period.¬† As we mentioned earlier, 4 years is the typical length of a Bitcoin cycle.¬†

Are there clues here that will allow us to beat the market? Or allow us to trade differently based on where we are within the cycle?

Let's take a look at the previous cycle to see.

## Timing the Cycle

As we mentioned earlier, Bitcoin has historically followed a 4 year boom and bust cycle and so it's really interesting to see that, so far, the only 'smart money' strategy to be more effective than regular investing is over a 4 year period.¬† In this section, let's see if there is a way to change how we invest over the cycle to maximise the amount of Bitcoin we can accumulate.¬†

We'll use the 3 strategies from above to evaluate the 2014-18 cycle covering 3 periods:

1. Peak to Peak - 2014-18
2. Trough to Trough - 2015-19
3. Mid-cycle to Mid-cycle - 2016-20

&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Bands - \(Source: https:\/\/checkonchain.com\/btconchain\/mayermultiple\_pricing\_usd\/mayermultiple\_pricing\_usd\_light.html \)](https://preview.redd.it/3nwk1y78ytl71.png?width=1496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c5539acc413097220f3992d85ba357fd0c334aa)

Once again, over every time period regular investing wins, by a SIGNIFICANT margin.

&amp;#x200B;

The challenge with timing is that once the cycle enters its 'bull' phase as marked on the chart below it never dips back below either 'buy line' again until after the cycle finishes, so the time out of the market sitting in cash is what kills the returns when you try to time it.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Bands - \(Source: https:\/\/checkonchain.com\/btconchain\/mayermultiple\_pricing\_usd\/mayermultiple\_pricing\_usd\_light.html \)](https://preview.redd.it/9qa3nh9gytl71.png?width=1538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=613483a66c24837ed8b5a7f7386741c46e378dde)

When we think back to our first chart from earlier, why then did the 4 year 'Smart Money' approach outperform the regular investment strategy when all other time frames favoured regular investing?

COVID-19.¬† During previous cycles 'Smart Money' was only presented with one 'Generational Buy' opportunity per cycle.¬† This current cycle was already unique because it provided two during the bear market in mid-late 2018, but normally that's it, you have to wait until the next cycle for another opportunity.¬†

The Covid-19 Pandemic caused a sharp sell-off in all markets, an event referred to as a 'black swan', which is impossible to predict.¬†

This provided 'smart money' with an unexpected mid-cycle buying opportunity, which raised returns over that 4 year period.¬† If we were to ignore that event, regular investors take a clean sweep in superior returns across all buy and hold time periods, as below.

&amp;#x200B;

[Performance adjusted to ignore the Covid-19 crisis dip](https://preview.redd.it/j5afyzejytl71.png?width=1701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e555272da0deda8e054e5f280527a22192ced53a)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Whilst we can't ignore the fact that Covid happened, as a primary strategy, relying on a black swan event is far from ideal.¬†

It does highlight the impact of timing though.¬† If you have additional savings, or you want to invest a lump sum *and the timing happens to be right*, you can make outsized gains by investing when the 'generational buys' present themselves.

## Buy low, Sell high!

Ok, so I get now that the best way to accumulate Bitcoin is to regularly invest, perhaps supplemented with a lump sum if a 'Generational Buy' opportunity occurs.¬†

What about the sell signals though?¬† If I sell at the top, then hold to buy back in at the bottom, could I increase the amount of Bitcoin I hold over time?

There are 3 scenarios here being compared to our core 'buy regularly and hold' base strategy.¬†

* First is to sell the 'Blow-Off' tops and wait for the 'Generational Buy' opportunities to buy back in.¬†
* Second is to use the more frequently occurring 'Local Highs' to sell and buy back in at the 'Buy the Dip' levels.¬†
* The third is a combination of the 2, 'Buy the Dip' but wait until the 'Blow-Off' top to sell.

&amp;#x200B;

[You can play with the calculator here - https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1ruGaZHhHth6KoS1WV5rM9yYUUU3R0yTM7j3Awuk0gUs\/edit?usp=sharing ](https://preview.redd.it/wq96ricmytl71.png?width=1801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=232db5b251f71cee7eca842fe303ee0f2dc81f41)

*It's worth noting initially that there are certain time frames that don't make sense to evaluate here with every strategy, which is why you see gaps in the table.*

Observations:

* Strategy 2 appears to be the most successful over the short term allowing you to more quickly stack Sats.¬† As we've already discovered though this is due to the Covid-19 black swan event, and over time this strategy falls away in performance significantly.
* Strategy 3 is a relative dud and doesn't outperform the other strategies over any time period
* Strategy 1 is the best performer over 7 years, but significantly underperformed regular investing over 5 years.¬† I suspect this is due to the amount of time spent out of the market, waiting for the next buy opportunity.
* Regular investing, whilst not top performer across all time frames only narrowly misses out when comparing the amount of Bitcoin accrued

**The major omission here is that I haven't taken tax into consideration.**¬† In most countries, selling your Bitcoin is a taxable event to Capital Gains Tax.¬† I don't claim to be a tax advisor, so you should do your own research into how this may affect you, and if in doubt speak to a professional.¬† If you do live in a high-tax environment though you will need to evaluate whether this strategy works at all.¬†

## Conclusion

The best way to accumulate Bitcoin over the long term is to set aside whatever you can afford each month, buy regularly and hold.¬† Let time do the rest.'Smart Money' signals will present additional opportunities for you if you have surplus savings and can accelerate growth, but should not be relied upon as a primary investment strategy.

Whilst it may be appealing to wait for dips and feel like you're getting a discount, history has shown that the dips don't come frequently enough and the opportunity cost of being left out of the market is far more damaging over the long term than buying at a price that may be a short term high.¬† Likewise, taking profits at the highs or trying to time tops is a similarly fruitless exercise and can often leave you holding less Bitcoin than you would've by just holding and waiting.¬†

There is a cautionary tale in the data for strategy 2 (Buy the Dip, Sell Local Highs) detailed above.¬† There are 3 seperate periods within the 7 year trading timeframe where that investor held more Bitcoin than they ended up with.¬† They traded down over time by trying to be smart with their buying and selling activity.¬† The impact of taxation further negates the effectiveness of this strategy. For me in Australia, the amount of tax payable on sale means that regular investing and not selling is the only strategy that makes sense.¬† You will need to evaluate if this is the same for you, but I strongly suggest that it will be for the majority.

Turns out the 'Smart Money' techniques are pretty dumb as a primary strategy.¬† A strategy that I have fallen for myself many times, by the way.

The best strategy is the simplest and the most accessible, so stack Sats and HODL.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;TLDR; The best way to accumulate Bitcoin over the long term is to set aside whatever you can afford each month, buy regularly and hold.¬† Let time do the rest.¬† 'Smart Money' signals will present additional opportunities for you if you have surplus savings and can accelerate growth, but should not be relied upon as a primary investment strategy.

*This should be considered for information purposes only and not as a recommendation to invest. Do your own research, understand the risks and make decisions that are right for you.*

pske3n,MajesticallyReckless,The Mindset of $tar Coin .,"Coming from an entertainment background, we saw a need for an alternative pathway to success in industries such as entertainment; our solution was to create a community of driven and gregarious individuals, but also an exclusive form of payment to be utilized amongst said community. Holding this token offers entry to exclusive events, direct connection to celebrities and entrepreneurs, networking opportunities and once in a lifetime experiences typically reserved for the elite.

The inception of Bitcoin back in 2008 paved the way for currencies like ours to blossom and improve on the established tracks of this new economy. While Bitcoin is still the industry leader, Binance Smart Chain is a clear contender for the most future-proof cryptocurrency seen so far. Utilizing that as the basis for $tar Coin has allowed us to delve deeper into why we needed to create this currency. As part of an ever-evolving digital economy, it was important for $tar Coin to stand out, which is why our idea of utilizing the coin as an entry pass to an exclusive platform and app was implemented. Coin owners will have access to experiences, celebrities, opportunities, events, and connection pools that have yet to be seen in the cryptocurrency realm, as well as being able to ‚Äúmatch‚Äù and networking with other members on the app and at events. By creating this coin we aim to create for our future users an incredibly valuable community with which to build their respective business and network with like-minded individuals, all while having exclusive opportunities to enjoy A-List experiences.

We encourage all token holders to commune, network, edify one another and to trade tokens openly. The $tar Coin community is meant to be a family and we desire to uplift all members, see them uplift each other, help each other and better each other.

Since there is a country that already has Bitcoin as legal currency, shouldn't we be able to exchange fiat into Bitcoin in our banks? Shouldn't we also be allowed to do international transfers from our online banking apps in Bitcoin, the same as we can do them in foreign currencies?

psg8va,EvgenMamedo0,The Mindset of $tar Coin,"Coming from an entertainment background, we saw a need for an alternative pathway to success in industries such as entertainment; our solution was to create a community of driven and gregarious individuals, but also an exclusive form of payment to be utilized amongst said community. Holding this token offers entry to exclusive events, direct connection to celebrities and entrepreneurs, networking opportunities and once in a lifetime experiences typically reserved for the elite.

The inception of Bitcoin back in 2008 paved the way for currencies like ours to blossom and improve on the established tracks of this new economy. While Bitcoin is still the industry leader, Binance Smart Chain is a clear contender for the most future-proof cryptocurrency seen so far. Utilizing that as the basis for $tar Coin has allowed us to delve deeper into why we needed to create this currency. As part of an ever-evolving digital economy, it was important for $tar Coin to stand out, which is why our idea of utilizing the coin as an entry pass to an exclusive platform and app was implemented. Coin owners will have access to experiences, celebrities, opportunities, events, and connection pools that have yet to be seen in the cryptocurrency realm, as well as being able to ‚Äúmatch‚Äù and networking with other members on the app and at events. By creating this coin we aim to create for our future users an incredibly valuable community with which to build their respective business and network with like-minded individuals, all while having exclusive opportunities to enjoy A-List experiences.

We encourage all token holders to commune, network, edify one another and to trade tokens openly. The $tar Coin community is meant to be a family and we desire to uplift all members, see them uplift each other, help each other and better each other. The founders have committed to locking 2,205,000 tokens of the 6,000,000 minted to encourage both sustainability and trust.",1632221191,0,1

pseh1d,mimblezimble,How will Bitcoin fare in the context of rapid depopulation?,"Because of rampant insulin resistance and resulting degenerative diseases -- For example, 90% of the USA population has abysmal readings on their hba1c blood tests -- the population in the West, including the United States, has developed a situation diametrically opposed to herd immunity.

Therefore, instead of the herd naturally suppressing the circulation of epidemics, the herd now actively attracts them.

In that sense, overcoming covid-19 is probably quite pointless. The herd will simply attract and spread the next pathogen. And then the next one.

Population aging, i.e. the consistent increase in average age, is a very related problem in the West., since degenerative diseases are much more widespread in an old population.

Therefore, such population will not just simply get older on average.

At a certain point, such population may reach the point of no return and start dying off rapidly in a continuous explosion of new, successive epidemics. Hence, such population may very well rapidly fall off a population cliff. In that sense, the current Covid epidemic is merely the starting point of such wider, accelerating population culling process.

From our current experience with Japan's real estate market, we know that even a currently still mild population decline has rendered pretty much all real estate outside the Tokyo metropolitan area worthless. The same situation occurs in Eastern Europe and and many parts of Southern Europe. You can often buy houses for just one dollar in these areas. Therefore, real estate is pretty much doomed as a financial asset.

Concerning Bitcoin, it is not clear to me what the impending population collapse will lead to.

Will Bitcoin manage to hold value throughout the oncoming depopulation Armageddon?

pseato,networkninja10,Chainalysis: Bitcoin is not a hedge against inflation,"According to the analytical company, there are currently no statistics that could accurately indicate the correlation between the rate of the first cryptocurrency and the depreciation of the US dollar.

At the moment, statistics cannot confirm that Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation. Kim Grauer, head of the research department at the analytical company Chainalysis, said this in an interview with Cointelegraph. According to her, many people invest in the first cryptocurrency to protect themselves from risks, however, there are no statistics yet that would confirm a significant correlation between the bitcoin rate and inflation in the United States. Grauer added that in some countries with high inflation and local currency devaluation, local residents use cryptocurrency as a store of value. Grauer cited Venezuela and Nigeria as examples. In 2019, the inflation rate in Venezuela reached 10 million percent. Against the backdrop of economic instability in the country, the introduction of crypto assets has accelerated. On September 20, the American publicist, economist, and trader Nassim Taleb argued that Bitcoin could be interesting only for speculative purposes. According to Taleb, those who call the first cryptocurrency a means of hedging financial or any other risks are ‚Äúfraudsters with information‚Äù. - The bitcoin rate dropped to almost $ 40 thousand. - ""Cleaning up the market.""

I got into bitcoin about 10 years ago but have never been too intense about it, I invested in a lucky amount of coins back then and have done pretty alright by holding.

But now, despite the fact my interest in bitcoin has always sorta been on the back burner other than the fact I got lucky by buying them when they weren‚Äôt that pricey, my friend‚Äôs interest is in the driver seat with the pedal to the metal. No matter what I try to discuss, it‚Äôs like 3 degrees of separation before my friend drives it back to bitcoin. It‚Äôs becoming brutal. I don‚Äôt want to be rude about it and we are such good friends that we are essentially brothers and we fuck around with each other all the time, prank each other, and like all friends have had a number of fights (not physical) that we always overcome and are closer and better friends afterward because of it, but this topic no matter how much I let him know I‚Äôm tired of talking about it and would like to talk about something else, he acknowledge, apologizes, conversation about whatever other topic resumes and then inevitably he‚Äôs back on bitcoin.

pscl3s,cruelintentions1,No real info.,"I'm newly invested into bitcoin (last year). I've been through lots of volatile swings just in the past year. Have known and been interested in bitcoin since my computer wiz brother told me about it years ago. I was still a kid then and didn't really have capital to invest. Something in the back of my mind told me to stop passing it up, especially since I now had something I could throw into it. I spent the next three months back in probably October last year reading everything I could. I knew the concept, but none of the fundamentals. Hell, I still have so much to learn and understand about bitcoin. Within those three months it went from I think 15-16k to the 20k range and I was like fuck it's already taking off without me. After the new years my big ass ape brain said just wait, the new year, new tax season, there's gonna be a sell off and I can buy the dip. Well it didn't dip right when the clock struck midnight, but weeks later I was able to snag some 19k sats. Waited to see what was going to happen, lots of fud, lots of this is the top, lots of bears saying it's gonna crash all the way back down. It never hapones. I bought again at 28k again in the 30s. I told myself ok you're being overzealous and trying to catch this rocket that's not there. Skip ahead, I've held. So many times have I cursed myself for not taking profits and entering back in on these large swings. There is no way to time it though. I've had some intuitions that if I followed I could have made some good gains, but that's all it was though. Today was a crazy big dip. However, I just entered into this world last year and am still up insanely more than I could ever imagine having my money parked in the bank.

['CHINA BANS BITCOIN... AGAIN' - MEME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3zlqHdmPQs)


China's central bank re-published a September 15 memo on its website addressing the country's Bitcoin ban, prompting a widespread Bitcoin sell-off and price drop on Friday morning.

China has banned Bitcoin (and every other crypto) many times in the past, and each time it has a smaller effect on the Bitcoin market, both in terms of percentage down and time duration.

Apparently this time it was only 7% down and lasted only a few hours before it started to recover from panic selling by new people who don't know this story. It used to affect for months and the drop was as much as 50% of the Bitcoin price.

With the big economic real estate crisis they are going through, they don't want people to have avenues out of China for their money, and Bitcoin is the only way people can get their money out of the centralized global financial system. 

That system is concentrated in the power of a few who decide for the whole world, enriching more and more those close to the hose of trillions printed out of thin air and impoverishing populations, making the gap between rich and poor more marked, where a few individuals own more wealth than half of the world's population combined. 

Bitcoin is the way to fix that, where the field is level for everyone and there is no barrier to participate in this new decentralized financial system, all you need is a cell phone and internet access.

The CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) or China Digital Yuan.

Through this new CBDC (USA and other countries are planning the same) they want total control over money and therefore over their population. Centralized digital money under their total control, combined with the Orwellian ""social credit scoring"" program, will effectively have all citizens under their thumb, with no way out of total authoritarian centralized control.

If bitcoiners were to adopted an unofficial fixed exchange rate, they can reduce bitcoin volatility, and thus ease it is use as a unit of account.

Similar to the exchange rate of currencies in a runaway inflation, some of these currencies are more volatile than bitcoin. 

Because there is no central bank, bitcoin can't have an official exchange rate, but an unofficial exchange rate could be adopted, by calculating the average cost needed to mine a single bitcoin.

This could be achieved by evaluating bitcoin intrinsic value (ie: hashrate, block reward and difficulty adjustment) and extrinsic values (avarage electricity cost).

From economical point of view, if a buyer shouldn't pay more that the cost of mining a single bitcoin  that he can mine itt himself, and miner wouldn't sell the mined bitcoin for less that the cost of electricity.",1632488463,6,1

Now I found the .bin file (240 bytes) with the private key and the password to encrypt the file. With current version of the wallet I can't open the file, failure notice:

""Could not decrypt bytes

Bad password?""

I am absolutely sure, that the passwort I entered is correct. In my opinion there are two options:

1. I have to try it with an old android version but I don't know how to do that.
2. Maybe it is possible to decrypt the file another way.

Can someone help me?

pwgg1j,DreiDcut,Softwareidea: automatic intentional double spent as insurance,"Hey, i just got a simple idea to prevent stolen BTC trough known seed:  
 \- you have BTC on a cold wallet  
\- A software holds a signed transaction with a very high fee (no private key, just the ready transaction)  
\- the transaction is supposed to send the BTC to a secure (paper?) wallet  
\- the software watches the mempool  


\- if the software is active and detects any transaction on the adress, it releases its own transaction (double spend)  
\- the transaction with the higher fee will be confirmed  


This works only with a fixed amount/UTXO  


if you would apply this on a hotwallet, maybe with whitelisted adresses, the software has to know the private key

This means that Bitcoin can offset it is carbon fingerprint by buying 1.6 billion dollars worth of carbon credits (600 Million dollars if we substrated the renewables), this constitutes 0.001% of the total bitcoin Market cap, and about 7% of bitcoin mining revenue.

**- 1000 x 1 trillion = 1 quadrillion**  


**21 million x 100 million sats (1btc) = 2.1 quadrillion Sats**

2.1 Quadrillion sats is way more than enough to be the world reserve currency and replace every fiat currency in the world or be used to back all the fiat ever printed. With the lightning network this is all possible.

Details: Gensler used examples of the types of funds traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and a 1940 investor protection law as reasons for his support for a Bitcoin futures ETF.

Recent History: In August, Gensler originally stated his support for these types of specific financial instruments for investors.

Background: A Bitcoin futures ETF is a derivative product that would allow investors to get some exposure to Bitcoin without having to actually own any of the digital coins. This idea has some support in the crypto world, but some critics are against it because they want to own the actual coins.

Final Thoughts: Many companies have applied to have a Bitcoin futures ETF. Some analysts believe that approval for at least one could happen in a few weeks.

I first learned about Bitcoin in 2012, but started buying towards the end of the 2017 bullrun.  My father was a coin collector since he was a kid, and even though he was now in his 70s and physically not well, he was still very intrigued by crypto and virtual coins. 

My Dad was a technology enthusiast his whole life. He worked in healthcare but tech was his passion. I can remember he bought a 1.0 Megapixel Olympus Digital Camera when it first came out, and the first CD-R on the market (I think it was a 2x Plextor). The first Betamax and VHS players, and was always building his own computers. He was never great with money, we always seemed to be in debt, but he loved his tech and we had fun!

Anyway, I made a couple small BTC purchases through a centralized exchange and told my Dad about it in early December 2017. He was excited! My Dad texted me that evening with an article, saying that I should probably purchase a hardware wallet. That was my last communication with him. 

I planned to go see him the next morning for lunch which was our usual Saturday activity. I got a call that morning at about 4:30 AM from the local police dept that my Dad was found unresponsive in his car and had been transported to the local hospital. He usually left at 4 AM to drive himself in for kidney dialysis 3 days a week. 

I jumped in my car and sped to the hospital; on the way there, I called and asked to speak to someone in the ER. I identified myself, and asked about the condition of my father. They said they couldn‚Äôt tell me any info on the phone because of HIPAA. I said ‚Äúfine, let me speak to him.‚Äù Silence on the other end. And at that point driving towards the hospital, I knew he was already gone and it broke me. When I walked in, they tried to sit me down and I said ‚ÄúI already know, just let me see him.‚Äù I was devastated. I took a deep dive into crypto the following weeks to learn as much as I could, and it was a good distraction looking back. 

The point of my story: my Dad left me a small monthly annuity when he passed, not a lot, but something. I never really got the chance to sit down with him and discuss crypto in depth. It‚Äôs something I daydream about often. I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to discuss it with anyone else in real life except him, still can‚Äôt, so here I am on Reddit. I decided to DCA the exact amount of the annuity every month into crypto from January 2018 onward. I tell myself that it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm investing in crypto with my Dad, and that gives me some comfort. DCA works quite well by the way it you‚Äôre patient! Give it time! It works! 

BTW, Don‚Äôt count out all the boomers out there folks, there‚Äôs a good chunk of them that do/would love this tech and see how amazing it is given the right conditions and guidance. Let‚Äôs be inclusive.",1633007968,129,1

**Why crypto?**

1. apart from supply and demand, what determines our value?
2. what do we have in our hands if a cryptocurrency goes into the dead-red?
3. A big argument of crypto is that it is decentralised. But isn't it a two-sided coin? Who determines our value? Is it good to put such great power in the hands of a ""Team"" we don't know?
4. Kind of an understanding Question: Can't Charles Hoskinson wake up and raise the max supply?
5. the more widespread crypto becomes, the more black market payments run on it. What will this problem look like in the future?
6. what if we are a huge bubble?

Don't get me wrong. I love crypto and the technologies behind it. It is incredible what is being created. Fucking LOVE IT!  
However, cryptocurrency may well face a lot of resistance. What if we get banned in America too? What if others follow suit?

For me, as an investor, it is important to keep these points in mind. I have an answer to the above points, but it is still needed more Arguments.

pqnh1g,TheOneTrueDoge,Understanding the right fee to choose,"Hi all,

Found an old hard drive with BTC on it, been out of the loop for 7 years or so.

When trying to transfer some of the BTC through Bitcoin Core, the transactions say 0/unconfirmed and are no longer broadcasting to nodes.

I believe I picked a good fee, but am worried that nothing will happen since it's been 48 hours for one of them.

I have googled the problem and just want a few pointers if you don't mind.

1: If I want to resend the first transaction, do I do something in the ""Command Line"" options?  

2: Can a transaction be unconfirmed forever?

3: I looked up fees and I'm unclear on the satoshi/vB vs. a flat fee which I can add in the Bitcoin Core options.

Apologies for the newbishness, just kind of panicking since I thought I had made a nice bundle but can't seem to move the funds at all.

pqmr77,964O,As someone who invests in gold I want to ask what is Bitcoin?,"So as the title says I would like to know what is Bitcoin and if there is a fundamental basis or value to Bitcoin because my perception is that both gold coins and bitcoin to a certain extent for some people have overlapping goals but come from different perspectives regarding strategies to achieve those goals or rather solutions to problems.

&amp;nbsp;

Like if someone asks me what is the fundamental value of a 1 ounce gold coin I can explain it as such. That gold is a store of wealth and wealth being the ability of a human being to consume goods and services and the basis of wealth is water (I would say oxygen but its difficult to measure so we have to use the next best thing possible, right?) because is the basis of human existence and not only that but the basis for the metric system of measurement regarding weight and liters which in return derived from a meter which is derived from one 10-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the equator whic bisects the centre of the Paris Observatory building in the 14th arrondissement, and is marked by a brass strip laid into the white marble floor of its high-ceilinf Meridian Room, or Cassini Room. This metric system of measurement is used in most countries except the United States of America and two other countries if I stand corrected and this measuring system forms part of the International Standards if Organisation of distance in meters, weight in kilogram an liquid in liters.

&amp;nbsp;

Now even though water is more precious to human existence than gold it's difficult to store it in abundance due to the nature of water which can turn into a solid liquid and gas then we would say food is more important to human existence but then again the nature of foid makes it impossible to store for long periods of time so we have to use the next best thing which people over centuries have decided to be gold it could have been platinum but gold it is, maybe it can even be bitcoin in the future who knows. 

&amp;nbsp;

So water which is a commodity and gold which is also a commodity both have a weight which can be measured in the metric system or the imperial system for the American folks and therefore the measurement of wealth being the ability of a human being to consume goods and services are measured in the weight of gold.

&amp;nbsp;

The goods we all consume consist of a single or multiple commodities take a house or car for example such as copper, steel and glass which are extract from the land just as water and gold are extracted from the land which means that even though gold is the measurement of wealth all wealth is extracted from the land by the labour of man.

&amp;nbsp;

Regarding services it might be difficult to measure because it depends what value in time in efficiency that sevice brings to person buying but it atleast has to atleast continue the existence of the person providing the service over a period of time and this is once again measured in gold or rather a troy ounce of gold per month which in turn is the equivalent of 31.1 grams. Now it is also interesting to note that there seems to be a certain amount of correlation between the price of Gold in Euros and the minimum wage in western european countries but I cannot state this as a fact though.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway so if it's possible I would like to have a understanding of bitcoin because I find it a interesting concept which I don't yet understand. Thanks for the explanations in advance!",1631972859,31,1

pqm4jx,chironexfleckeri5,Memorzie your seedphrase (Tutorial),"  

Dear Bitcoin hodlers, 

&amp;#x200B;

today I would like to teach you something that you probably haven't tried yet. As another crypto enthusiast you must have come across the topic of security of your seed phrase. Hopefully you are already using a state-of-the-art hard ware wallet or cold storage. We can access our coins on the blockchain via a private key. Since the BIP39 update in 2013, we no longer have to deal with complicated and unwieldy private keys, but can generate the private key from a seed phrase. The seed phrase consists of 12 to 24 words, which are randomly selected from a 2048 long list of words. When creating a crypto wallet, we were asked to write down this seed, not to share it with anyone, or to lose it, otherwise we risk losing our access to the coins for good. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working hard on the safest way to store the seed phrase and eventually taught myself a method to store the seed phrase in my memory, probably forever. Just imagine that the apartment where your seed phrase is stored is no longer accessible due to natural disasters, war or political persecution and you need to flee the country and can‚Äôt take your seed phrase or hardware wallet with you. By memorizing it, you will never lose it and it can‚Äôt be compromised. 

Please be aware that this is only a backup method and that you do not throw away your written seed after remembering it. You can have an accident or illness that can negatively affect your memory. That is why the written down way of the seed is still one of the safest. 

&amp;#x200B;

The memorization method works so well, it took me only about 30 minutes to memorize my 24-word seed. And I would not describe myself as a bright light. I am talking about the method of loci. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method\_of\_loci ) . With his method you try to store the seed words one after the other in a so-called ‚Äúmemory palace‚Äù. It works as follows: you imagine a place or building which you know well, this will be your new memory palace. I for example think of my former school buildings. As soon as you have chosen a familiar place, imagine that you are in a certain spot in your memory palace. At your starting point you will place (mentally!) your first word. This can be in pictorial form or you write it down on a wall and associate sounds, smells or objects with the word. Mentally you start strolling through the different corridors of your memory palace in which you place your seed words in the correct order one after the other. You will soon realize that once you have built up your memory palace, you will simply have to mentally walk the same route again and thus recover your seed phrase. In the first month I would advise you to remember your seed phrase daily. After the first month I would recommend to repeat it weekly. After a few months I would repeat it quarterly. 

&amp;#x200B;

This method is so incredible easy to apply and makes hodling a lot safer. Give it a try and let us know how fast you were able to memorize your seed. Make Crypto hodling safer, spread the knowledge and help adaption!

Bitcoin ~50%, ETH ~20%, ADA ~15%

I expect something around 10 to 13 trillion dollar market until the end of the decade. A market in a constant evolution and adoption. 

Africa and Asia playing an important role in this increasing adoption, with people realizing crypto is the only way of becoming free and independent of the government. I don't mean the world will be free and everybody will live in Alice's Wonderland, but it's is going to be notorious how crypto can be essential to everyone.

In the most developed countries, things are going to be divided. Crypto is important, but the government are still controlling most part of our lives.

pqlpub,rampitup55,Thoughts on all this endless legislation?,"We've all been expecting this for years now. As crypto gains popularity and looks like it will one day threaten the dollar, here come the government and bankster scumbags to try and stop it. Good thing crypto is designed to resist all this. It looks to me like they can pass all the laws they want, and have all the little meetings they want, and there's nothing they'll ever do to stop the advance of Defi. 

Except for one little thing, which they haven't done yet, but may eventually: They could make the banks turn off any dealings with crypto exchanges. Of any kind. If they won't let people leave bitcoin and get back into the dollar, well, that kind of squashes the rest of the adoption we need to fully push the dollar into  the background. And have bitcoin finally become the world's most used currency. (or some other real crypto but my guess is it would be bitcoin as it's the most popular)

What if they do that? What if they pretty much outlaw bank transfers of any kind when it comes to crypto? Can't buy, can't sell. Can't sell a bitcoin and go get you a new car. Can't sell several and pay off your house and live debt free. Now you just have a nice internet money, that you can't ever exchange for dollars when need be. What do we do then?",1631968897,40,1

pqjf1y,wanna-buy-bitcoin,Easy explanation on why you should be your own crypto bank and why you shouldn't write your seed backup on paper.,"Some months have gone by  since I started building a new product called BSafe card. I will  explain what the product offers in plain terms regardless of your  background experience using crypto (Bitcoin, Ethereum ...).  


Usually  when you make any crypto wallet using centralized exchanges (Coinbase,  Binance, Etoro... ), the exchanges themselves gain control over your  funds, and protect them on your behalf using varied security measures  (normal passwords, 2FA, phone...). However, they are also in charge of  your private keys.  


If you got lost there with the ""private keys"",  don't worry, this paragraph is for you: Any cryptocurrency wallet out  there either centralized or not, is composed of two elements: a public  key, and a private key. The public key is comparable to your bank  account num, (that you can share to receive transfers); however your  private key has full power to gain control over your funds (the golden  rule is that you don't share it with anyone).   


So the problem  with leaving your private keys on centralized exchanges comes in two  flavors: first when you use a centralized exchange you are not the owner  of your private keys, in fact, you can't even ask to access to them.  Secondly if you are clever enough to decide to withdraw your crypto to a  personal wallet (where you will have access to your keys, both public  and private), you become fully responsible about the security of your  funds; In fact at that moment you become your own bank.   


Once you  are the owner of your keys, you are not exposed to the exchanges being  hacked and your funds disappearing overnight, yet you have the  responsibility to never forget your private key (don't worry about the  public key as it gets generated using the private one). So, the question  that comes to mind now is: How hard is it to remember a private key?  Well, it's not easy. A private key normally looks something like this:  


""KygHWnoiPFaoRfkGWz8aEcrjGee...""  


Cryptographers  have tried to give a better way to remember this long sequence of  characters by converting it to a list of words (normally 24), which is  in fact easier to remember and identify than the string you've just  seen, as it would get converted to something like: TABLE, BIRD,  COMPUTER...  


I really hope you are following along, because now is where it gets interesting.  


Chances  are high that you would think about getting those words written on  paper and saving them in a secret place. Of course if what you are  managing isn't an amount that you wouldn't mind loosing (at least at  current prices), maybe the pen an paper is a good solution. However when  you are managing amounts of money that could affect your financial  stability you have to find other ways to do it. This is why I created  BSafe Card, a 304 type stainless steel card, along with a tungsten  carbide tip pen.

pqjcvo,Reckless_Satoshi,Stealing Sats from the Lightning Network Custodial Services,"# Stealing Sats From Other Users: Attacking Lightning Network's Custodial Services.

The Lightning Network (LN) is a truly groundbreaking way to move value around the globe. The number of users and LN enabled services is exponentially creeping up. Many services are opting for offering a free or fixed transaction fee, yet the real lightning network fees are neither free nor fixed. Instead, they are cheap (mostly) and variable (according to the payment route). I conducted a small research project to figure out whether the discrepancy between real routing fees and service's transaction fee can be exploited for a profit, and if so, how large the damage could be (spoiler: it is bad).

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure-1: u\/Reckless\_Satoshi wearing a hoodie, which indicates he is up to something](https://preview.redd.it/cmawpdpid8o71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d6cc6241c9861ca6016937710301f1e111e43f3)

Whom did I attack? Well, here the complete list of offended services **Bitfinex, OKex, Muun, WalletOfSatoshi, LNMarkets and Southxchange**. If you are reading this to make a 'quick sat' I am sorry to disappoint you, I am publishing these findings only after the susceptible services have been contacted and flaws fixed :)

## Cheap, but not free. A simple attack.

Simple, deposit funds into a custodial service then withdraw the funds, done. Congrats for your profit! I am sure you are thinking -""Those sats were mine anyway, right? How does this qualify as an attack?"" Well, I forget to mention we also need to place a node that will be routing the payments between the custodial service and the receiving node. The routing node will collect a fee, hopefully the fee will be big enough so there is a net profit (i.e.,*withdrawal\_fee + deposit\_fee &lt; routing\_fee\_collected*). If a positive net return is possible, then it is just a matter of optimizing the size of the fee collected and the transaction speed rate to see how big the damage could be. It is easy to see how this attack must be feasible on any service with free withdrawal fee.

How do you place a node in the middle? Well, the sending node is in charge of selecting the route. A priori, it seems unlikely that the sender will select a very expensive route. However, there is a case when the sender will certainly have to send the payment trough our routing node. We will connect our receiving node to the Lightning Network only with a single channel to our routing node. Therefore payments, if they arrive at all, must always be relayed by ourselves.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure-2: Our receiving node is only connected to the Lightning Network through our routing node. Green arrows represent revenue, red arrows are costs.](https://preview.redd.it/81200hkqd8o71.jpg?width=2524&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd794f86d3330c8e6b758d3847b83fd2b110624d)

In the case depicted in Fig-2, our routing node is directly connected to the custodial service. This is ideal to optimize the attack: the deposits have no cost, HTLCs will settle quickly, and we avoid the limitations set by other routing nodes using [CircuitBreaker](https://github.com/lightningequipment/circuitbreaker) (payments fail when a few HTLCs are pending). If the attack is successful, having a lot of inbound liquidity from other nodes is key. The channel to the custodial service will quickly become unusable as we have stolen the liquidity to our side. Therefore, you want to *desuturate* it by circular rebalancing. Once we free up inbound liquidity from the custodial service, the channels to our liquidity providers will be saturated, we can chose to close those and move the profits on-chain or we could *loop out* (not sure which process is less costly: we are making free BTC, does it even matter?)

This is one of the simplest attacks. In fact, the only LN attack I can think of, but also I am just a newbie in the process of learning. I assume there is people out there much more capable of conducting this research. Who knows, maybe there has been sizeable loses in the past that remains undisclosed.

## 1. Bitfinex

Bitfinex has a fixed 100 sat withdrawal fee. However, it is obvious that some withdrawals requests might cost to route more than that. I was curious to see if withdrawals that are more expensive would be processed at all: and yes, they are processed. It is my believe, after a bit of tinkering, that Bitfinex would execute any withdrawal where payment routing fee is below 10 000 ppm (1%). I gave a try to withdraw 100K sats and collected 1000 sats in fees on the middleman node.

Making a net profit from Bitfinex is possible (at least net positive 900 sats per deposit/withdrawal cycle), however withdrawals might quickly get halted as there is a ""processing"" step on their end probably rate limiting transactions. Bitfinex's API does not seem to support yet withdrawals for the symbol 'LNX' (these require an invoice instead of an address). So while it is possible to profit from Bitfinex, I didn't go the next step to script and optimize the attack. In any case, I filled out a report with their security team before making this public. Their site explicitly indicates that they might no reply to a report if they were already aware. As I received no reply I assume it's safe for this insight to go public.

## 2. OKex

The fee charged by OKex seemed to be strictly equal or higher than the cost to route the payment. There is no way one could make a net profit from OKex using this attack.

## 3. Muun wallet

I do not know exactly how Muun works behind the scenes. It is not strictly a custodial service, but it has definitely some sort of custodial component to it. It might be maybe some sort of hybrid: possibly a parent node (named [Magnetron](https://1ml.com/node/038f8f113c580048d847d6949371726653e02b928196bad310e3eda39ff61723f6)?) with private channels to each user's wallet (but do not quote me on this). Their super easy to use LN enabled wallet allows you to withdraw all the way down to 0 sat balance without having to pay the final fee for emptying the wallet. This, in turn, allows you to collect a net positive fee for every withdrawal that empties the wallet. As this is a smartphone app and there is no available API, I did not go through the extra complexity needed to test where are the limits of cheating Muun.

## 4. LNMarkets

LNmarkets is possibly one of the coolest LN services out there. The use of LNURL qrcodes to login, deposit and withdraw makes it the most LNish experience out there. It truly displays what the LN is capable of, in addition, their API documentation is simply superb. Unfortunately, their effort also made it very easy for me to script and optimize the attack. Since the service had a free withdrawal fee, it was indeed profitable.

According to some quick testing, LNMarkets is willing to route to you any payment as long as the fee does not exceed 10 000 ppm (1%). The maximum deposit/withdrawal amount is 1m sats. As you can see, theoretically one could expect to make a net profit of \~10K for every deposit/withdrawal cycle. Each cycle takes around 20 second (this will greatly depend on whether the nodes are behind TOR or Clearnet). Using two threads, that makes for a profit of about \~4 million sats/hour .

At 4 m sats/hour the full outbound liquidity of LNmarkets would have been stolen in 80 hours (totaling 3.3 BTC, LNMarkets is open about their outbound liquidity [on their own site](https://lnmarkets.com/node)). The script ran for 6 minutes, collecting about 450K sats in fees before some failsafe halted platform withdrawals for all users. About \~2 million sats were locked into the platform, for a net loss of \~1.5m sats. However, LNMarkets guys have been exceptionally cool about this and returned the sats to me. They certainly did not have to, but I appreciate it and shows they strive to build a healthy community.

LNMarkets is now charging the routing fee to the user. It is a fair and sustainable solution, although it muddies the user experience. The beautiful thing about lightning is that if the users wants often and free withdrawals, they can just open a channel to LNMarkets for the price of a single on-chain fee.

## 5. Southxchange

Southxchange LN withdrawal fee is free. I tinkered a bit to find the maximum their node would be willing to pay for a successful routing. I think it was about 50 sats flat as maximum, but maybe it was higher. Even when I was withdrawing 1 sat, their payment was sent with 50 extra sats for routing. That's an effective 50 000 000 ppm (5000%) fee being collected!

It was possible to deposit 100K sats and then withdraw 1 sat a time. Of course, 50 sats is a negligible amount. However, their API works flawlessly and I noticed there was no request rate limit. I wrote a simple python script able to generate local LN invoices and submit them to the exchange to process the withdrawals. It reached top speeds of up to \~300 withdrawals per minute (200 ms per withdrawal), simply wow! That makes for \~15K sats per minute. I did not optimize further the script, as the channel was already near being maxed out (current maximum pending HTLCs for a channel is 483 and they were taking long to settle). In addition, my RaspberryPi was getting CPU limited, I believe due to encrypting/decrypting the onion packages. It would have been possible to improve the attack speed by a lot with better connection and some parallelization (more accounts / more machines / more routing nodes).

Without any further optimization, at a rate of 900K sats / hour the full outbound liquidity of Southxchange would have been depleted in \~50 days (assuming there being 10 BTC or \~1/6 of the node capacity). I stopped the script after one hour as there seemed to be no limits or failsafe whatsoever. A malicious attacker could have definitely withdrawn most liquidity in hours.

After the attack, Southxchange has opted for rate limiting withdrawals for the user (1 every 10 minutes), but they are still free. In my opinion, this is not the optimal solution. It affects the experience of legit users that need frequent withdrawals: in-and-out quickly, minimizing exposure to custionals, this is what lightning is about. Yet, this solution also fails to prevent future attacks, as you can still get around this limit with many accounts. Instead, I would suggest charging the withdrawal fee to the user: you gotta pay what things cost. If the user wants free withdrawals, they can *'go premium'* by opening a channel to the exchange's node.

## 6. WalletOfSatoshi

WalletOfSatoshi charges the user the exact fee for the routing. It also does hold a reserve of 0.3% balance in case of unexpected high fee. This is the most conservative take together with that of OKex, in turn making these two services the least user friendly.

If a service has free withdrawal, users are more compelled to take their BTC into self-custody between operations (it is free, why wouldn't you?). So, I am not totally sure of what I am about to say, but I have the feeling that custodial services with free transaction fees might be artificially increasing the number of transactions, therefore subsidizing nearby routing nodes. This might induce weird incentives for the creation of channels and the deployment of liquidity; hence, affecting how the lightning network grows. Yeah, sounds far-fetched, but even if tiny, there must be an impact (no idea if positive or negative impact).

# Conclusions

* Although LN transaction fees are negligible, they are not zero. While lightning allows for almost free transactions it also allows for extremely fast transfers: negligible amounts add up to worrisome amounts very quickly. If you build a service where withdrawals are not rate limited nor the fee is translated to the user, you will run into problems.
* This is one of the simplest attacks anyone can think of using LN, yet surprisingly, many services are susceptible. I believe that if an actual smart and malicious actor had performed it, he could have withdrawn a big chunk of the outbound liquidity of some of these nodes.
* By attacking ourselves the LN and publicizing the findings, we make stronger the Lightning Network and its services. Maybe soon we will be reading sensationalist headlines such as ""The Lightning Network has been hacked"" every time a custodial service using LN is exploited. It is in our hands to prevent FUD to spread also over the amazing lightning features.

Finally yet importantly, I would like to apologize for the disruption caused to the service maintainers and thank them for their excellent sportsmanship. It has been a great deal of fun to learn how these futuristic services work.

I'm sharing code to replicate my findings on [GitHub Reckless-Withdrwals](https://github.com/Reckless-Satoshi/reckless-withdrawals). So far, only LNMarkets, I will not share yet Bitfinex and Southxchange as I am not 100% confident that they are exploit proof after their fix.

Let me know in the comments if there is any LN enabled service that I should test. I went for all of the big ones already but I might make a second round :)

pqiqdf,Lenaweston,Ten Reasons Bitcoin is a Terrible Investment.,"1. Bitcoin isn't really scarce
First of all, bitcoin is only as scarce as its programming dictates. Whereas physical metals, such as gold, are limited to what can be mined from the earth, bitcoin's token count is limited by computer programming. It's not out of the question that programmers, with overwhelming community support, could choose to increase bitcoin's token limit at some point in the future. Thus, bitcoin offers the perception of scarcity without actually being scarce.

2. It has a utility problem
The king of cryptocurrencies also has a utility problem. To date, only 18.51 million bitcoin tokens are in circulation, with an estimated 40% of these held by small group of investors. Even considering the fact that fractional token ownership exists, roughly 10 million to 11 million tokens in circulation aren't going to go very far. For context, global gross domestic product was $81 trillion in 2017. Meanwhile, bitcoin has approximately $114 billion to $125 billion in tokens freely circulating and not held tight by investors. There's minimal utility here. 

3. There's a low barrier to entry
Bitcoin may enjoy first-mover advantage at the moment, but the barrier to entry in the cryptocurrency space is especially low. All it takes is time and coding knowledge for blockchain -- the digital and decentralized ledger that records transactions -- to be developed and a digital token to be tethered to the network. There's nothing unique about bitcoin's underlying blockchain that other businesses couldn't one-up.

4. Few (if any) tangible means to value bitcoin
Another beef with bitcoin is that there's no tangible way to value it as an asset. For instance, if you want to buy shares of a publicly traded company, you can scour income statements, its balance sheet, read about industrywide catalysts, and listen to management commentary from recent conference calls and presentations. In other words, you can make an informed decision.

With bitcoin, there is no tangible data for investors to wrap their hands around. There's transaction settlement times and total circulating token supply, but neither of these figures tells us anything about the value or utility of bitcoin.

5. Fiat currencies may work on blockchain
I believe investors are also placing their faith in the wrong asset. Over the long term, blockchain technology is where the real value lies. Blockchain can be used to reinvent supply-chain management and expedite overseas payments. But when folks are buying into bitcoin, they're gaining ownership in digital tokens with zero ownership of the underlying blockchain.

To build on this point, companies are also testing blockchain that's tethered to fiat currencies. For example, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) was awarded a patent in July 2018 ""for linkage of blockchain-based assets to fiat currency amounts."" This implies there may not be any need for a made-up digital token to be used at all on blockchain networks.

6. Blockchain is years from being mainstream
A sixth issue is that blockchain is still years away from gaining real relevance. Three years ago, when blockchain companies and cryptocurrency stocks were the hottest thing since sliced bread, it was expected that blockchain technology would be quickly adopted. Little did investors foresee the Catch-22 that would arise. Specifically, no businesses are willing to make the costly and time-consuming switch to blockchain without the technology being broadly tested -- yet companies aren't willing to make this initial leap to test the technology and prove its scalability.

In short, blockchain is years away from being a mainstream technology.

7. Fraud/theft is a serious issue
By no means are cryptocurrencies the only asset to be hacked by thieves, but there are serious fraud and theft concerns that accompany bitcoin. For instance, novice bitcoin investors may not understand the need to store their tokens in a digital wallet, thereby leaving them susceptible to theft by hackers.

Additionally, it's been hypothesized by numerous blogs and publications that North Korea has turned to bitcoin mining and theft to funnel money into its isolated economy. Bitcoin is commonly viewed as the ""currency"" of choice for criminal organizations. 

8. There's no regulation
Bitcoin is also an unregulated asset. Though this lack of regulation is actually a selling point for today's crypto investors given that it provides some degree of anonymity, it's bad news if something ever goes wrong. Since the majority of cryptocurrency trading and transactions occur outside the borders of the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission is very limited in what it can do if your digital tokens are ever stolen.

9. The tax situation is a nightmare
If you think preparing your federal income taxes stinks now, try preparing them after investing in and/or using bitcoin in any transaction. The Internal Revenue Service expects you to report capital gains and losses tied to investment activity, as well as gains and losses associated with purchasing goods and services.

For example, if you bought a single bitcoin token at $11,000, then used a fraction of your bitcoin to buy a new smartphone for $1,000, you'd have to calculate the value of your bitcoin used at the time of the transaction and recognize capital gains or losses relative to your cost basis. It's a gigantic headache.

10. All bubbles eventually burst
Last, but not least, all next-big-thing investment bubbles eventually burst. No matter how excited investors are about bitcoin and its underlying blockchain, history suggests it won't be enough to match lofty expectations.

Mind you, we've already witnessed multiple 80%-plus declines in bitcoin throughout its history. Extreme volatility is a given with digital currencies like bitcoin, and history would suggest that significant downside from its current price is a near certainty as well.",1631954192,19,1

This new protocol (named **Inherited IDs**) would completely replace the proposed Eltoo protocol, and greatly improves it by allowing multiple Lightning channels to be opened (or modified) with a single on-chain transaction, saving thousands or millions of transactions.

This can be implemented via a Bitcoin soft fork.

The proposal appears well thought-out and sensible at first glance, but perhaps my brain just isn't big enough to pinpoint any flaws in the proposal...",1631934838,80,1

Background: Fidelity filed an application for a Bitcoin ETF in March. This was part of a push to go into digital assets.

Bigger Picture: About a dozen other financial companies have submitted similar applications to the SEC. All of them are still pending. The SEC does not appear to be moving towards approval anytime soon.

Experts Weigh In: In August, an analyst with Bloomberg predicted that the SEC will approve of a Bitcoin Futures ETF as early as October.

Final Thoughts: A Bitcoin ETF or a Bitcoin Futures ETF provides a way for more investors to get exposure to cryptocurrency investments.

&amp;#x200B;

What to do (first) with BTC or even ETH if I want to use PancakeSwap ?

&amp;#x200B;

Using MetaMask, I can send token back and forth between BSC and ETH blockchains. No problem.

But when I connect MetaMask to the PancakeSwap website, I cannot swap tokens from BSC that are *not* BEP-20 tokens.

&amp;#x200B;

So what's the use of that famous ""interoperability"" of cross-chain transfers with a DEX like PancakeSwap, after all? That's not true DeFi, is it?

&amp;#x200B;

Fine, my tokens that are *not* BEP-20 won't get lost when I send them to BSC - but I still cannot directly swap them from MetaMask; only CAKE or BNB work.

So do I really have to swap for BTCB (Bitcoin BEP 2) tokens on a **CEX** like [Binance.com](https://Binance.com) **first** before I can go over to make actual use of ""my Bitcoin"" on PancakeSwap...?

pooykt,andreaarmanni,Why is no one talking about the upcoming Taproot network upgrade?,"If we look back at 4 years ago, within the 3 months preceding the last #BTC network upgrade the price of BTC traded between $930 and $978. As May drew to a close, the price of bitcoin climbed above $2,000 for the first time and surpassed $3,000 just weeks later. Those price milestones were often accompanied by subsequent turbulence, including a drop of $300 within one hour just a day after the $3,000 line was first crossed. üôåüèΩ

By the first week of September - 15 days after the turbolence around the network upgrade (Aug 24th) the global crackdown on unregulated ICOs Bitcoin and the pending closure of China's ""Big Three"" exchanges - Bitcoin exceeded $5,000 and continued its bull run towards $19,783

History doesn‚Äôt always repeats itself, but IMO there‚Äôs a high chance that a similar trend happens before year end. We are seeing increasing long-term hodlers, an OBV about to reach new ATH, ATL #BTC supply, FED tapering and SEC regulations unlikely to come before 2022 and most importantly the new BTC upgrade coming in November! 

If history repeats itself this year we could see #BTC and #Altcoins reaching levels never seen before. 

My bet is that BTC will top around $250K, ETH will end up at around $15K and DOT will peak $210

This run will most likely end with a 70% crash for BTC and 80% for Altcoins before Q4 ends!

pooqlj,Keep-panicking,Help needed with Trezor passphrase system,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I bought some Bitcoin and ETH beginning of the year and put them on a Trezor T.

&amp;#x200B;

I never touched this account until two days ago. When I connected to the wallet, the funds were gone. From what I red so far, it could be two things : either the Trezor Suite update I downloaded when I connected wiped the account, or the passphrase I used was ""incorrect"" (=not the one I used to set up the account).

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I don't remember setting a passphrase for the account, but I guess I did because the option is ticked. I tried a few variations of the only passphrase I would have used, with no results (still no funds in the account and the history of the account said they're never been any deposit, or connection prior two days ago).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm stupid AF and should have been more cautious when I set up the account. That said, does anyone knows if there's a way to recover the wallet without beeing sure of the passhrase ? like, could I try to recover the wallet with my seed phrase and try different passphrase combinaison ?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit : I'm stuck with the way passphrase and hidden account works. When you set up a passphrase, they say ""Your old accounts will be accessible with an empty passphrase"". The way I understand it is that if you don't enter any passphrase, I would access my original account. This seems to be incorrect because, as mentionned in my post, when I connect with no passphrase, I get the same empty account (no transaction history, no funds).

&amp;#x200B;

Would you happen to know if, when I set up a passphrase for an account, does it create a NEW account (a ""hidden"" one, if I'm correct), or does the original becomes a hidden one, which can from now on only be accessed with the passphrase ?

&amp;#x200B;

For example, let's say I have a freshly created account (A) with funds in it. If I set up a passphrase, which one of these is true :

&amp;#x200B;

\- a new account (B) is created with no funds in it. This new account B is accessible without the passphrase (not hidden). The original account A with funds becomes hidden, only accessible with the new passphrase, or,

&amp;#x200B;

\- a new account B is created. This new account is hidden and only accessible with the passphrase. The original account A stays accessible with no passphrase.

&amp;#x200B;

Or am I completely wrong ?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much for taking some time to help, it means a lot to me (I have a considerable amount at stake). May the god of bitcoin be with you always.",1631707332,9,1

pon17a,INTER5TELLAR,For the Golden Cross Doubters,"Look.  
I'm not saying TA is perfect.

But history is history. 

Whenever Bitcoin has a golden cross on a daily timeframe, a pump has either begun or is about to begin.   
On some occasions (See March 2020 in the right 1/3), aggressive moves to the downside temporarily negate them with a death cross, but then are reconfirmed as golden crosses and a pump continues.

I DCA regardless. I trade with a tiny bag of USDT, too.

You do you.

All I'm saying is, whether you do or don't believe in it, history says there is a very good chance we will be rocketing soon.

pomzht,shenmadoushifuyun,Bitcoin Possible Origin (Satoshi?),"I was looking at old cryptography articles when I stumbled across this from 2008:

https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-85230-8_24

What struck me as interesting is the author cited and thanked Nick Szabo (creator of bitgold) for discussions on OpenPGP-based financial instruments. 

I then did a search and found this paper from 2005:

https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-75993-5_3

The author identifies several key features for creating an optimal digital currency, namely, stressing digital currency should be anonymous, peer-to-peer, irreversible, etc. I also found a link to an open-source software that the author actively created from 2002-2005/6 called ePoint, which abruptly stops development around 2006/2007,

https://web.archive.org/web/20060614121353/http://epointsystem.org:80/

https://sourceforge.net/projects/epoint/files/epointpgp/

In brief:

-Highly trained cryptographer and coder (see Sourceforge link)

-Actively was developing a digital currency from 2002-2005/6, at which point the project stopped

-Publishes article in 2008 advocating for OpenPGB-based Instruments (and claims to be developing new technology)

-Collaborated with Nick Szabo (created bit-gold) and references his work in publication and lecture notes (see bottom) 

-Location in Europe, impeccable English, interest in Eastern philosophy

But since there are some big whales pushing that average up, I'm curious to know what is the median Bitcoin holding, I'm assuming it's way less than the average. 

Looking [at this table](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html), it seems that  51.28% of Bitcoins addresses hold less than  0.001 BTC, but I'm assuming a lot of those wallets belong to single entities, so grouping those wallets by entity would bring the percentage of entities holding less than 0.001 BTC way less that 50%. 

So using that table, we can assume that the median Bitcoin holding by entity is between 0.001-0.01 BTC, or less than 500USD.

Like most here I am a techie sort of person and have enjoyed the journey so far, in fact have found both the practical use as well as the underlying technology to be absolutely fascinating. In spite of the enormous (and frankly scary) amount of positive hype I still haven't decided if it's a suitable investment vehicle for me, but it sure is... fun.

But that's me, and stepping outside of myself and trying to be objective it seems that the process of purchasing and using even one of the easier-to-understand cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin can be almost hilariously complicated. Again, not for you or me but certainly for the greater public who can barely utilize a smartphone much less figure out exchanges, hot and cold wallets, the multiple and *critical* security issues, etc. 

Sure, there is Coinbase and other simple-to-use sites, and unfortunately outrageous fees to match. You can get past that of course by going to places with (initially) scary UIs, but again I think of what the average non-technical person might make of all this and it seems like it is a very significant barrier to widespread adoption. Without some huge sea change in safety/usability for the non-technical user I don't see how crypto is going to be practical for widespread use among the general population.

I can see one argument being that gold was always centralized and not easily used for transactions so thereby it was easy to basically outlaw. Is that the answer? 

Another issue that's related to me is if for example one country stays on the Bitcoin (or gold previously) standard and another country goes off. The second country could print endlessly and finance war against the first right? At least temporarily and maybe long enough to ""win"".

I have read that if a transaction isn't confirmed, it'll be eventually reversed by the miners and coins will be returned to the address from which it was sent. But apparently this can take some time - some say even days? - and it depends on the altruism of the miners as to when they do it.

**news.bitcoin.com - 3 days ago on August 29th 2021**

**By** **Jamie Redman**

**The pseudo-anonymous bitcoin analyst called Plan B gave his 704,000 Twitter followers an update on the notorious stock-to-flow (S2F) bitcoin price model. Plan B stressed on August 27, that the ‚Äúnext months will be key‚Äù as he believes the bitcoin S2F model ‚Äúpredicts $100K by Christmas.‚Äù**  


**Plan B is a popular figure in the bitcoin world as the pseudo-anonymous analyst is well known for his stock-to-flow (S2F) price model. In basic terms, the model quantifies the commodity‚Äôs (bitcoin) scarcity and then divides it by yearly issuance (the flow).**  


**For quite some time now, Plan B and many other S2F fans have insisted that if the model is correct, BTC could one day reach $100K and in the future, possibly a million U. S. dollars per coin. However, in June and July, bitcoin (BTC) prices pulled back a great deal, after reaching a value of more than $64K per unit.** [https://news.bitcoin.com/plan-bs-stock-to-flow-bitcoin-price-model-predicts-100k-by-christmas-s2f-creator-discusses-time-model/](https://news.bitcoin.com/plan-bs-stock-to-flow-bitcoin-price-model-predicts-100k-by-christmas-s2f-creator-discusses-time-model/)",1630513534,6,1

-  He mentioned that a lot of people don't have bank accounts, and they will sell things on the street etc, and that they get proper fucked when trying to bank. 


-  I asked him if he thought it would actually be widely adopted, or if it was just a niche thing that some people will use. He thinks it will become widely adopted fast, him and all of his family are really eager to start using it. Especially so he can send money back home without the outrageous fees.

In the last few months in my country, we are having to jump through a lot more hoops when out and about due to COVID - QR scanning etc. I am relatively neutral on that - so be it. However, I just became a lot more aware about just how much I was being tracked. First I became aware of how I was being tracked and targeted for advertising due to using retail loyalty points, then I realized how much my phone (through Google) was tracking me - and then I switched on about using credit and debit cards.

In an instant, I just decided I wanted none of it. Over the course of about 2 weeks I deleted my memberships to loyalty schemes, then learned all the Google privacy settings followed by removing my data/photos/files (which I now self custody on hard disks in my home). I then deleted that Google account and set up a new 'burner' one (as I'm not ready for an open source phone OS!)

Then - I went to the bank and withdrew enough physical cash to use for about 2 weeks of my purchases. It just felt so liberating. I was worried that with COVID tellers would treat me like a leper as I made purchases in the supermarket and paid with cash - throwing notes and coins at me to return change - but no, it's been fine and just like the old days. I could be wrong but I just feel like I'm seeing lots of others doing it where I hadn't noticed it before.

So the reason for my post: anyone other Bitcoiners realized anything similar? I feel like I'm practicing self-custody - and it feels good.

On a side note - just wondering if anyone realizes just what the implications would be to the whole financial system and Bitcoin if everyone started doing this... ;) ;) ;)",1630640048,8,1

2019 was ‚Äújust move on‚Äù

2020 was ‚Äúyou still at it?‚Äù

I never gave up though, bite my lips and keep putting whatever i could into crypto, and continue to explain macro monetary concepts etc to family and friends

It was not until when Bitcoin climbed to $30,000 when people started to speak to me in a different tone. ‚ÄúOh so that Bitcoin thing can you tell me more about it‚Äù

At $50000 ‚Äúyou are a genius i should have listened‚Äù

At $60000 ‚Äúmay you please lend me some money?‚Äù

Yet i dont care/mind peoples opinions too much nowadays, i just continue to explain to the ones who want to listen and learn. For the ones who jeer and throw dumb comments i just find them comical as I know I am now worth 50x their net worth and they will most likely continue to slave at those $12 an hour jobs until they invest in Bitcoin (or win the lottery, which ever is easier).

&amp;#x200B;

You're tired to waiting for 100x 1000x Potential from a token?? Now you can have this real potential, playing to our crypto BSC lottery. This is the first Cryptocurrency Lottery with recorded draws every day, to give people a chance to get rich.

&amp;#x200B;

Lottery algorithm:

&amp;#x200B;

üß≤ The lottery starts by accepting BNB transactions. Anyone having a Binance Coin wallet can send a fixed amount of 0.1 BNB to the contract‚Äôs address (0xf9512328E8a39D1715DC06D3a78d0975F0176896).üß≤

&amp;#x200B;

üëç The players send BNB directly to the contract address and their Binance Coin address is registered. A user can send more transactions of 0.1 BNB, having more chances to win.üëç

&amp;#x200B;

üë®There is a manager, the account that deploys and controls the contractüë®

&amp;#x200B;

üë®‚Äçüíª At some point, if there are at least 3 players, he can pick a random winner from the players list. Only the manager is allowed to randomly select the winner.üë®‚Äçüíª

&amp;#x200B;

üèÜ The contract will transfer 85% of contract's balance to the winner‚Äôs address and 15% of contract's balance to the manager. After that, the lottery is reset and ready for the next round.üèÜ

&amp;#x200B;

‚è∞ The manager will conduct polls to determine the lottery registration period (May be 1h, 2h, 3h, 1 day...).‚è∞

pgqsqf,jzia93,Is Bitcoin going to screw us all in the long term?,"""Inflation is a bad thing"" 

You hear the above on a daily basis in the crypto community. ""Inflation is theft by central governments"", ""Inflation is forced taxation upon savings"", ""Inflation is monopoly abuse of central bank and central government's control of the money supply"". For the most part, we're agreed. Something to consider though - is it a necessary evil?

When we think of bitcoin, we think of the current community: predominantly made up of technologists, bankless individuals, pioneers. What we're seeing increasingly more of though, is the potential future of bitcoin. Banks have started to take notice, institutions have started to take notice. Billionaires have started to take notice. What does this mean?

It means that, over time, bitcoin as a scarce asset is susceptible to becoming oligopolised, that is to say, concentrated in the hands of a few mega wealthy individuals and institutions who are able to hoard the digital gold at this relatively cheap stage.

I said susceptible, by the way, this is not a certainty.

We have imagined a vision of a new decentralised monetary system as a great equaliser, but I ask you to consider if bitcoin may be leading to a new age of wealth inequality?

Consider Michael Saylor's compelling case for buying and holding the one example in human history of a financial asset that cannot be inflated away, cannot be stolen in war, can be transferred instantly and is completely secure. Michael has said it himself: you never trade such an asset, you leverage against it. In the process, your wealth is safe, indefinitely.

But, is that fair?

We look at the top 1% of society and resent their collective negligence in equitable tax contributions. Likewise, we look at capital distribution and see that over 50% of all assets are locked up amongst that same select few. They rent, they don't sell. Appreciating assets allow these people to continue to gain liquidity and accumulate more wealth and, as yet, we have found no way to reliably recompense society.

Inflation, however, doesn't care about any of that.

Inflation treats you, me, Jeff Bezos, Michael Saylor, Exxon Mobil and Goldman Sachs as equals. Inflation takes our assets and applies an equal taxation on everyone's wealth, exactly proportional to the size of their assets.

Inflation mediated through central banks is then used to finance government spending and here, I agree, egregious abuses of power have made us seriously question the legitimatacy of such a policy. But ultimately, government spending is used for important things, even if it is wasteful along the way. Spending does pay for schools, roads, defense, hospitals. Spending is appropriated and, yes, we need to fight that, but there's a reason why Michael Saylor sees Inflation as the devil: because as a multimillionaire it disproportionately affects HIS ability to shield HIS assets from any degree of regulation.

So back to bitcoin.

The new economy denominated in bitcoin has no inflation. It has the opposite. The rich become completely isolated against any form of wealth redistribution even if their wealth was a pure product of their circumstances: Jeff Bezos' great great great great grandson will never work a day in his life but will still be as wealthy, if not more, than the original creator of Amazon.

Oh and by the way, this has happened before. A lot.

Look at pre WW1 ancien regime France, look at the established monarchies of England, Russia, and Europe. These dynasties lasted hundreds of years and, in a major way, represented an extreme income inequality that was facilitated due to a fixed inflation of zero percent. These dynasties persisted because no redistributive mechanism existed to move existing capital back into the collective.

To some extent though, Pandora's box has been opened. We do not have an uneducated society, and we have democratic institutions in place. The digital economy is, by it's very nature, more egalitarian than the nation state. However it's worth considering that inequality, especially long term inequality, typically predates conflict, as evidenced by the ""Pre WWI"" comment above.

So with Bitcoin, are we in the process of transitioning to a new world order, not of equal finance and opportunity, but of a landed bitcoin gentry that cannot be unseated?",1630616817,91,1

pgpuyh,throwaway29801A,"Check your self before you wreck your self, that ego is bad for your health","In my group of friends, I am probably one of the dumbest. I have noticed a trend of the friends that have a chance to do well and those that don't. The irony is the ""dumb"" ones are in a much better position that the ""smart"" ones. Things to note:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Check you ego. Jesus christ the egos on people are out of control. Don't be afraid to say ""I don't know"" or ask questions. Seek out knowledge. Pride has no place. 
2. If you made a lot of money in your work, much is due to timing. For example, mortgage broker in 05, solar over the last few years. Your paycheck is not 100% result of your brain power.
3. Your skills in the old world need to be updated or you will perish. Everything will be digitized. White collar ""managers""-your job will be replaced by code in 5 years. Understand this.
4. Your parents told you that you were smart but that's not that true. If it was true, you'd have what you wanted (smart=getting what you want in life). 
5. Brain power is overrated. The smartest man in America is a farmer.
6. This is all about asset accumulation and you should do everything in your power to accumulate assets over the next 5-10 years. This means cutting costs and living like a poor person if you make $200k. 
7. Make money to get assets, don't be right-#5. You are making money to buy assets. Money is a tool. This means if you own a business, and you don't like an employee but she makes you money each month, shut your mouth/swallow your pride and take the money. I know business owners whose pride has cost them $30k+ a month. They would rather win. This means if you are an employee, do what you need to do in order to keep making and advancing. There is no place for ""winning"". Hint: nobody cares.
8. Risk aversion aka ""playing it safe"" is extremely risky. Tesla, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Bitcoin, Housing...are you listening? Cash is garbage (but I do believe that having some cash for security is fine). Your bank account will make you feel safe-you are wearing a smallpox infected blanket and you are saying ""i'm warm"".
9. Stop competing with the joneses. The thing that matters most is time.
10. Stop being jealous of people...can't state this enough. If you are a jealous person, get some therapy. You're ngmi.
11. All wealth can be destroyed by abuse of drugs and alcohol.
12. If you are over 40 and less than 2 million us trash tokens, you are very behind. The good news is you have a chance to catch up. If you are under 2 million trash tokens and buying luxury goods and bottle service, you are ngmi.
13. If you believe you are smarter than most of the people you know, that's a signal for two things: you have low self esteem/like being the top dawg, and #1-ego. Stop.
14. If you talk over people, you aren't listening. Every person can teach you something.
15. If you don't have a 5-10 year plan, you are gambling. Gamblers generally lose. Most traders will get rekt. Stay away from leverage especially in bitcoin.
16. If you find yourself making fun of people, refer to #1 and #5.
17. If you are in the same position +/- that you were in 5 years ago, you are making massive mistakes. Own them. Refer to #1.
18. Understand the responsibilities of marriage and children. Can't believe this is true, but I know many men who get married and have kids because they see their friends doing it. Fomo is real.
19. Think about how many hours you spend watching tv/netflix/listening to sports radio/instagram. Compare that to how many hours you spent working out your mind and body.
20. Smile and nod: In 5 years bitcoin will be $400k-1m. People will still say tulips, mock it, and make fun of you. They will then go out with the same friends aka ""their circle of smart people"" and try to hit on 30 year old women with low self esteem. You will be in your lake side home with your wife. And you won't make fun of them. You will feel sorry for them. You're gmi.",1630613950,60,1

plo5n4,xXTobyyXx,Food for Thought - Bitcoin is Inevitable,"The modern financial system is based on fiat currencies that derive their value from supply and demand, and the trust people have in the issuing government. A fiat currency's supply function is unkown as a central authority (the central bank) has the power to change the supply at any given time; there is no scarcity. Fiat's total supply continues to increase over time, devaluing the currency in the long run, and history proves this repeatedly. It is only a matter of when and not if a fiat system fails. The problem for the layman is that their purchasing power decreases year after year unless their annual wage increase is higher than annual inflation, which is not the case for the majority‚Äîthe value stored in fiat continuously declines in purchasing power and the layman's standard of living declines year after year.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin attempts to remedy the aforementioned problem. Bitcoin's supply function is predefined in its source code; there will be 21 million Bitcoin in total; currently, 900 new Bitcoin are issued (mined) per day, and this number halves every four years, until all 21M Bitcoin are mined. As fiat currencies devalue themselves over time, a rational person is assumed to seek a better store of value, ideally a scarce asset that is truly independent (a property enabled by Bitcoin's decentralization). Thus, it seems inevitable for value to shift from fiat-based derivates to Bitcoin in the long run as one continues to devalue itself while the other does not. 

&amp;#x200B;

A counterargument would be that other assets can achieve similar results, for example, bonds, commodities, stocks, or real estate; let us take a closer look at each of these. Bonds currently yield negative interest rates, and there is counter-party risk as you trust the government and its fiat currency. Commodities like gold are expensive to divide, move, and secure; you cannot easily divide a gold bar, gold is also heavy and expensive to move around, and finally, it is expensive to secure. If the cost to secure gold is low or free, it cannot really be considered secure as a thief could steal it; truly securing gold is exponentially more expensive based on the quantity, think Fort Knox with all the equipment, space, and guards. Stocks expose the investor to counter-party risk; if the company goes bankrupt, the investor loses the majority of their investment, stocks are also artificially inflated by the fiat system; for example, current interest rates for savings accounts are low, meaning there is no incentive to store money in the bank; thus a lot of money is stored in the stock market, the value of shares in terms of fiat may be increasing, but the real value of the company is likely fluctuating at a different rate than shown by indexes. Finally, real estate has historically been a great store of value; however, it does suffer from some shortcomings such as maintenance and upkeep costs, it is relatively illiquid, it is poorly divisible, and it is immobile. Bitcoin solves a lot of these problems as it requires no maintenance, is relatively liquid, one Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million single units of value called Satoshis, and it can be moved easily by either storing it on a small physical device (USB Stick or Computer) or sending it digitally, it can thus escape changing legislation and move freely to favorable tax areas.",1631290377,6,1

Since there are 24 words and each word has 1024 choices, are there only 1024\^24 of possible combinations? Or are there unlimited possible combination of private keys because of the existence of passphrase?

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, my 24 words + 1 passphrase can NOT generate the same private key compare to another person's 24 words passphrase alone, right?

&amp;#x200B;

What about the private keys generated before the BIPs introduced the 24 words and passphrase?

For example, will Satoshi's BTC private key also corresponding to a 24 words?",1631290359,9,1

[https://youtu.be/QYLDcjn\_6QA](https://youtu.be/QYLDcjn_6QA)

&amp;#x200B;

Dear people of El Salvador.

We, Icelandic Bitcoin enthusiasts, are excited about the imminent Bitcoin revolution in your country.

The people of Iceland are all too familiar with the consequences of inflation and unsound money. Our inflation rate reached 70% in 1983. Three of our largest banks went bankrupt in 2008. Unsound money enables those who control or stand closest to newly printed money to profit tremendously at the public‚Äôs expense. This caused the 2008 financial crisis.

Shortly after the crisis Bitcoin was launched. The first bitcoin block included a message about the 2008 financial crisis. The one to create the message hinted at the solution we have been waiting for and Bitcoin offers: Sound and decentralized money for all, out of reach from corrupt monetary policies.

Our nations may be small but are leaders in using geothermal energy. We can also be leaders of bitcoin adoption. El Salvador is now holding the pen and writing history. We encourage you, dear citizen of El Salvador, to grasp this opportunity you are presented with. Your actions will be exemplary for the entire world and a giant leap for mankind towards freedom. 

With best wishes for the success of El Salvador!

&amp;#x200B;

Saludos y bendiciones a todos uds. Ciudadanos Residentes de El Salvador.

Nosotros, los Islandeses entusiastas de Bitcoin, estamos interesados de seguir la revoluci√≥n de Bitcoin que est√° comenzando en su pa√≠s. Los islandeses somos muy conscientes de los efectos de la inflaci√≥n y de la depreciaci√≥n de dinero. Queremos destacar que : Islandia en el a√±o1983, alcanz√≥ una inflaci√≥n de m√°s del 70% , luego en el a√±o 2008, 3 de nuestros Bancos m√°s grandes se declararon en quiebra.

La depreciaci√≥n de la moneda hizo posible que aquellos que controlaban o estaban cerca de la impresi√≥n de dinero ,obtuviesen ganancias a expensas del p√∫blico. Esto provoc√≥ el colapso de 2008. Poco despu√©s naci√≥ Bitcoin. La primera entrada de Bitcoin contiene un mensaje que nos recuerda el colapso econ√≥mico de 2008.

La persona que dej√≥ el mensaje quer√≠a enfatizar que Bitcoin es la soluci√≥n que hemos estado esperando: dinero confiable y sin fondos que protege a la gente com√∫n de la pol√≠tica monetaria corrupta.

Nuestras naciones pueden ser peque√±as, pero son l√≠deres en el uso de la energ√≠a geot√©rmica. Tambi√©n podemos ser l√≠deres en la adopci√≥n del bitcoin.

El Salvador est√° ahora escribiendo un nuevo cap√≠tulo en la historia de la humanidad y los alentamos, queridos residente de El Salvador, a que aprovechen la oportunidad que se les presenta. Sus acciones sentar√°n un precedente para todo el mundo y ayudar√°n a la humanidad a dar un gran paso hacia la libertad.

* being unmovable property
* and the ultimate fact thatit is appreciating at a lower rate

pmcw2c,BuscadorDaVerdade,Why I'm not afraid to invest most of my money in Bitcoin,"I believe in Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is hope for a better, more decentralized financial system and a better, fairer world. It was born out of a state of mind that desires freedom for oneself and others, which I relate to very strongly; it promises to take power away from the power-hungry structures such as governments and central banks, and empower the sovereign individual. I believe such a world is possible.

If my investment in Bitcoin turns out to be a good investment, it will mean I have lived to see such a better world, and the life-changing wealth that came from the investment will be a cherry on the cake, allowing me to enjoy living in that better world that little bit more.

Now, I understand nothing is certain and while it's very unlikely, my investment may turn out to be a failure. For all we know, Bitcoin, in a decade or two, may be worth nothing.

That would be unfortunate, you could say: I would lose the savings of my life.

Unfortunate indeed, but if that happens, the consequences of that will be much farther-reaching: it will not only be an investment failure of mine, but a failure of mankind! It will mean we, humans, had a sole opportunity to make the world a better place, and missed it; it will mean power-hunger, control, greed and indifference overpowered the desire to make the world a better place.

It will mean the world is a sad, hopeless, degenerate place, dominated by control-oriented filth, scum and trash, that Humanity was doomed to fail from the beginning and we were only deluding ourselves by believing otherwise. And in such a world of disappointment, no amount of wealth would be a consolation anyway - and certainly not the kind of wealth I would have accumulated by putting my wages in a fiat bank account.

But I think that's a very unlikely scenario. And it's not like a sports event where the outcome is independent of us; on the contrary, it depends on no one but us, bitcoiners.

The dream of a better world is only a dream, but by adopting Bitcoin and using it, we can make that dream a reality.

Any actions or precautions I should take with my crypto, or worry about, before departing and/or while I'm there? Will a VPN suffice? Any thoughts, suggestions, ideas, concerns are welcome. Thank you.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I'm an active crypto trader (and Bitcoin HODLer) in Canada and have accounts with Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken. I'm visiting family in the Middle East, for a couple of months, and wish to continue trading there. Ideally, this should be pretty straightforward, where I just simply log into my exchange, while I'm there, and done.

However, my two main concerns are: (1) You can't count on the government's Internet Service Provider being a trustworthy service, as they would likely triangulate the location of your phone/laptop if they, somehow, know you have money and will take you hostage; and, (2) I'm also concerned that Coinbase, Gemini, or Kraken won't allow me access to my account with a foreign IP address originating from the Middle East (considering my IP has always been a Canadian device/address).

So, is a VPN my solution here? Will a VPN hide my activity from the country's ISP and, at the same time, allow me consistent access to my exchange? Will exchanges flag VPNs and lock me out, or am I okay with just configuring my VPN to a Canadian IP, and done? Any other precautions, thoughts, suggestions, ideas, concerns are welcome. Thank you for your help everyone!",1631383280,8,1

(Can We Use Bitcoin?),"Most of the content you've  seen in El Salvador is in El Zonte (**Bitcoin Beach**) where the same people have been interviewed hundreds of times by journalists and crypto  enthusiasts. Furthermore, most reports are based in San Salvador, the capital where many wealthy and middle class people live, and where Bitcoin adoption appears to be going strong. 

We hit the streets on September 7th (the day the Bitcoin Law was implemented) and when the govt Chivo app was released. 

This was our experience trying to spend Bitcoin in western El Salvador.

I really prospered by buying more until the price went to over the ¬£20,000 mark then I stopped and watched my wallet get fatter and fatter. Earlier this year I decided that I was going to buy myself an old Vespa and restore it myself. I kept looking on Ebay and at the end of April I saw 2 for sale near London and the seller wanted ¬£600 in Bitcoin. I couldn't believe it this would save me money by  not going thru an exchange and it would only cost me the transaction fees from my Electrum wallet. I contacted the seller and on the agreed day I rented a van and after an uneventful journey I arrived and with no bank, no middle man nothing I copied his QR code and pressed send and watched as the Bitcoin landed in his wallet. It was a great feeling to conduct this deal as I had got these scooters for free, that was the feeling that I had. One of those scooters is now restored and MOT'd and up for sale for ¬£750 while the other one is in the middle of a full restoration and future respray. Just thought I'd share this story to show that Bitcoin isn't a scam, it isn't a Ponzi scheme and it isn't a Pyramid scheme either. What it is though is the future of money.

I am not sure what exactly have been accomplished but if the money was spent elsewhere in area such as schooling, hospital or even scientific research, instead of waging war perhaps we all would be in a better place.

Part of this is to do with how the Afgan war is actually a business as the public US fiscal budget is paid to numerous private contractors and mercs for war supply (eg. As explained in Dog of Wars), which ties to further R&amp;D for even more deadly weapons to be used for killing in future wars.

Should part of the Bitcoin movement be to separate the power of money control from the government, so the financial ability to wage war is reduced, to save lives and create a better world with less military conflict?

pjwgbm,Laja21,Any chance today's dip is linked to the end of Unemployment in the US?,"I'm just wondering for you people out there that whale watch... was today and last night consistent with whale movements? Or would you say it appeared to be retail-heavy?

I ask this because I linked a few of the initial price surges in direct correlation to the issuance of stimulus checks, the start and stop of federal PUA bonus, and the beginning of PUA in general. 

It seems like that would have some influence as many people who were entirely reliant on the unemployment, are likely now pulling out in the green to pay the mortgage and bills for the month.",1631050229,6,1
pjwaro,Roronomad,Help me make a bitcoin based sport DAO and we‚Äôll buy LFC!,"Hi guys,


I‚Äôm one of the bitcoin plebs and a Liverpool fan so I am hoping to you will help me set up a bitcoin-based DAO.


Sports teams are huge tribes currently owned by private interests. I think this could make them perfect for a DAO model of ownership. In exchange for ¬£1 worth of bitcoin donated to the Liverpool FC DAO treasury during a season, you would get one vote in the amount of the treasury that is released for spending on the following season. Divide the released treasury between each token equally that can be spent on whatever they want to fund for the club for the following season.


The tribe could build up a treasury with the aim to buy the club and support it‚Äôs growth. What fan wouldn‚Äôt love that?


According to Forbes Liverpool F.C. is currently worth ¬£3 billion. It‚Äôs hard to get a count on how many Liverpool fans there are in the world but a couple of online sources (just google searching here) put it above 100 million. Lets we can get 1% of fans to put in ¬£10 a month to the club for a say in how its run that would be ¬£120 million a year, that would be a little over 8 years for the DOA to collect enough money to buy the club. That‚Äôs also not taking into account the appreciation in the bitcoin price in the meantime.


On our side we have all of the bitcoiners who want any reason for bitcoin adoption to succeed to meme it for us and we also have all the online fan channels and communities we can contact to spread the message to all the fans.



This could obviously apply to any team but these types of DAO wouldn‚Äôt have to be limited to sports. 

We could create a rewilding DAO to buy back land at a fair price and allow the area to regrow and sponsor efforts to reintroduce a species. Bitcoin can be great for climate change! We could make one to fund research we don‚Äôt think is being prioritised high enough by institutions.


But I don‚Äôt know how to write smart contracts on lightning or using a side chain so I thought I'd ask her to see if this is possible.


Am I missing something about why this can‚Äôt work? 

Is the technology available for us to do this yet or are we still waiting for development to be done?",1631049766,1,1

pjw5vg,Black_Sky_Thinking,"If the crash was intentional, who are the suspects?","I‚Äôm no conspiracy theorist, but a $400bn sell is no accident, and it‚Äôs a hell of a coincidence that it happened on the same day as a major move forwards for BTC. If someone wanted to legitimately liquidate that much, there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôd do it all at once. Anyone that has that much money would also know that they‚Äôd move the price down as they sold.

The positive headlines of Bitcoin becoming a legit currency have changed to eye-rolling headlines about what a disaster it all is.


So for once, I do suspect this was an international move. Occam‚Äôs Razor seems to suggest that an accident or coincidence involving that much money today is unlikely.
So it begs the question: Who has that much money, is willing to burn it through a market sell order, and hates BTC?

People always vaguely blame ‚Äúbanks and institutions‚Äù but what legit bank would sacrifice its own money just to generally attack crypto? What nation would dispose of a significant chunk of its GBP without anyone leaking it? What individual would blow their own money bringing BTC down rather than going long?

Today I put in a last bitcoin buy at $46k for this bull run, as today's flash ""crash"" is a great opportunity to invest. There will be more dips along the way, but I'm out of fiat and live off btc now. While folks panicked sold, I panicked bought. I bought because this manipulation was just too obvious. Here's whats happening right now: big entities (governments, hedge funds, central banks, and btc whales etc) started a sell-off on the same day the first country (El Salvador) officially recognizes Bitcoin as legal currency, which also liquidated 3.4 billion in leveraged long positions, hence the initial severity. Perfect way to cause more panic selling among retail investors and create fear in the news. It's shaking out the weak hands so that the Smart money can buy back in at lower prices. I said this similarly 6 weeks ago when bitcoin was around $30k. This is a healthy pull-back to the 20-week EMA. I bought at 46k, knowing it can potentially go down to 36k in the short term (max 2-3 months sideways worst-case), before the inevitable rise back to new all time highs this year to Q1 2022, at least 100-150k this bull run. This manipulation happens in all markets, but for bitcoin it's all the opposing forces can do. Bitcoin has endured 12 years of government bans, misinformation, fear-based news, manipulation, etc, and it can not be shut down. Go down the rabbit hole my friends. Your fiat has been inflated with over 6 trillion dollars printed out of the blue, reducing the value of the dollar 10-15% each year. Inflation is here, hard assets are the best hedge, and bitcoin us the hardest asset ever created by mankind. 

THINGS ABOUT BITCOIN:
- Stock-to-flow model is still intact.
- Adoption is the fastest of ANY technology EVER.
- No indicators show bitcoin had a market cycle top yet. 
- Time in the market is better than timing the market.
- Buy the dip, DCA (dollar cost average)
- Stop reading fear-induced articles etc.

pktk72,SomeBrokeChump,Chivo experienced more downloads and users than expected. Some problems. Click for details,"Over a million people downloaded and used Chivo app all on the same day. So they overloaded the servers. So the government's solution is to limit the amount of users by only allowing users with any model of Samsung galaxy S20 or S21 to download the app from the Google play store for the time being. More models of smartphones will begin to be allowed to download the Chivo app sometime shortly.

Source: Right from Bukele's own Twitter account: https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1435440534500384772

So only Salvadorans who currently own any model of Samsung gslaxy S20 or S21 can download Chivo from the play store at this time.

The government is having the server issue fixed and they will begin allowing more models of smartphones to download the Chivo app.

The merchants that do not own one a smartphone model that currently has access to download the Chivo mobile app will not be required to accept bitcoin. Regardless of this, no one is punishing any merchants for not accepting bitcoin at this time. And the bitcoin law clearly says that any merchant that is not capable of accepting bitcoin is not required to accept bitcoin. I will quote the bitcoin law below.

Article 12 of El Salvador's bitcoin law states ""Quedan excluidos de la obligaci√≥n expresada en el Art. 7 de la presente ley, quienes por hecho notorio y de manera evidente no tengan acceso a las tecnolog√≠as que permitan ejecutar transacciones en bitcoins. El Estado promover√° la capacitaci√≥n y mecanismos necesarios para que la poblaci√≥n pueda acceder a transacciones en bitcoins.""

The English translation for Article 12 is ""Economic agents are excluded from the obligation expressed in Article 7 of this law, who by notorious fact and obviously do not have access to the technologies that allow to execute transactions in bitcoins. The State will promote the necessary training and mechanisms so that the population can access transactions in bitcoins.""

And Article 7 was the Article of the bitcoin law that said economic agents are required to accept bitcoin. So merchants who cannot download Chivo app because they're smartphones are not allowed to, are not required to accept bitcoin.

The government of El Salvador will slowly start allowing more models of smartphones to download the Chivo app from Google Play Store.

I got like 3 days researching and comparing prices relating to the hardware and fees to setup my mining rig, cryptocurrency, etc. Although ant-miner seems quite expensive, I considered about purchasing two S9 pro which will give me 100TH/s each,  power consumption about  \~ 6.2 Kw/h total. I did some calculations based on [https://www.mycryptobuddy.com/BitcoinMiningCalculator](https://www.mycryptobuddy.com/BitcoinMiningCalculator) and [https://minerstat.com/](https://minerstat.com/) which  pretty much looks like I'd lose the money if I went through the acquisition. 

I also checked GPU mining for Ethereum and pretty much the same, which these inflated prices trying to purchase something good like a  RTX 3090 16GB DDR6 which provides about 121.33 MH/s per GPU seems more expensive than purchasing the ant-miner considering it's listing price on amazon: [https://www.amazon.com/ZOTAC-Graphics-IceStorm-Advanced-ZT-A30900J-10P/dp/B08ZL6XD9H/ref=sr\_1\_4?crid=1SKD7D7PZMSE2&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=rtx+3090&amp;qid=1631147105&amp;sprefix=RTX+%2Caps%2C470&amp;sr=8-4](https://www.amazon.com/ZOTAC-Graphics-IceStorm-Advanced-ZT-A30900J-10P/dp/B08ZL6XD9H/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1SKD7D7PZMSE2&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=rtx+3090&amp;qid=1631147105&amp;sprefix=RTX+%2Caps%2C470&amp;sr=8-4), also considering that a good mining rig might take about 4 or 6 of these to make some good progress.

so my questions you guys which surely have a lot of more experience than me  are the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is it mining even profitable these days considering all odds, like how volatile difficulty is, expenses and long term commitment?
2. Is cloud mining legit? I even came across some websites offering contracts about 1K USD per 100 MH/s which looked like a scam. the one which stood out the most was : [https://oxbtc.com](https://oxbtc.com), but Idk.
3. Is it better to just study the market properly, get an account in some exchange, create a strategy, back-test it purchase some bitcoin fractions then just trade with it (or just Hodl until the price is right) rather than going for mining ?

pismkf,General-Good-648,ATO is after me,"I bought a fairly substantial amount of BTC in late 2013 and early 2014 which discovered I still have about a year ago and haven't spent a dime of it. The ATO (Australian Tax Office) has issued me an notice of assessment with a proposed tax bill they think I should be paying.

I heard the ATO only knows about crypto transactions as early as 2014 and possibly not 2013 so I'm guessing they don't know the full extent of my ownership of all my coins if they're only proposing a tax bill.

Can someone please clarify what this means when they do this?",1630904016,46,1

piqi8e,throwaway29801A,Update: Sold my investment property for bitcoin,"Yes, the title is true and I did this last years. It was an investment property. Here's what I've learned along the way.

I see 3 paths for someone who is working and having disposable income. The first path is saving, a guaranteed losing option. Most who are saving think of it as safety and do not understand (yet) what is going on. They are years away from waking up. The second path -and probably much more dangerous-is the speculator. Options, random stocks, random cryptos, etc. I am not making fun of this person-I was this person 2 years ago. They are motivated by the right reasons often. Most will lose the vast majority of their money. It's a step 90% of us take. The third choice is an asset accumulator -they can have a short term trading horizon, but this person has the attitude that they must keep XYZ bitcoin.

\-I continue to DCA and think it's the only strategy that works for 90% of people because most people that say they are waiting for a dip are talking, not planning. The dca is an actual plan. The ""I will buy at 20k"" crowd is the same crowd that loves to give opinions and talk. Talk is cheap. do not listen to these people-hanging out with them will make you poorer.

\-The vast majority of people are clueless about what bitcoin, and crypto in general, is. This is a very good thing.

\-The average person brought into bitcoin brings 1-2 more people. Monstrous.

\-I knew several people who were saying from 2015-2020 the housing market would crash. Most of them have recently bought homes. I still think housing, especially luxury housing, goes up fast. Most of these people have little to no bitcoin relative to their net worth.

\-There are many in bitcoin who have bought with no research. There seem to be more who hate bitcoin/think it's a scam who have done no research.

\-I commented on an earlier post, and as huge real estate bull this pains me to admit: bitcoin in my opinion is much better than real estate at this point. Both are bets on long term interest rate suppression because of aging demographics, more money printing/debt, and essentially a debasing monetary culture. Bitcoin has the advantage of a fixed supply. The only reason I see real estate being better is if someone is okay with 20/1 leverage and/or buying a house and renting 3/4 rooms out. 

\-Bitcoin is not mainstream yet. Most people have more wealth on their wrist than they do in bitcoin. 80% of the people I know, most who have at least $2,000 month in disposable income, some who have $10--$12,000 a month in disposable income, have zero bitcoin. The rest have a laughably small amount.

\-Most people who don't participate do so because of three things that all revolve around not putting in work: they think they are much smarter than they are (Go ahead: ask your friends how smart do you think you are? the answers are telling), they have not put in the work (very dangerous for a not smart person), and they believe I'm too late (once again, they do not put in the most basic of work).

\-I can see that with bitcoin getting yield, it will start to nip at a small amount of bonds. The bond market is hundreds of trillions. Or, simply, there are 14 trillion dollars of negative interest bonds and much more to be issued in the future. Crypto is 2 trillion and bitcoin is 1 trillion. I expect the crypto market to be 20-30 trillion within 10 years.",1630895297,53,1

piq5st,davidacoder,Is Coinkite a malicious actor with its Coldcard?,"Or do they just have lousy customer service, or am I missing something?

I ordered a Coldcard earlier this year, very happy with it. Couple months later I ordered a second one, plus steel plate and some other stuff. All direct from Coinkite.

The second Coldcard looked good, I set it all up and also put its key on my steel plate. I then updated the firmware of the Coldcard (all of this on the day after I received it), and ever since the device shows the red light that the firmware is not trusted. I went through all the steps that support, websites etc suggest: I trusted the new firmware, over the last couple of weeks I updated a couple more times to newer builds of the firmware etc. None of this helped, I never ever got a green light again that signals that the device is in order. When I compare my first and second Coldcard it is also VERY obvious that the red light in the second one is way, way, way weaker than the light from my first device. When I look at the second device, it actually looks like the green light is glowing very weakly at the same time as the red light is on as well. To me this all just looks like a defective device. No problem, I'm sure that happens from time to time to every manufacturer.

Where it gets bizarre is how the Coinkite support handled this. I immediately contacted them and explained the situation. Their response was that I had to send the device back to them so that they could take a look. I explained that under no circumstance would I send the device back, BECAUSE IT HAS MY PRIVATE KEY ON IT, and I already had moved funds to it. I also didn't want to ""give up"" on that particular key as I had just put it on my steel plate. They wrote back that I should just reset the device, i.e. delete the key from the device, and then send it back. I responded that I would certainly do no such thing, as it seems utterly inappropriate that I go through all the hassle of setting up a secure system, deal with steel plates and whatnot, and then in the final step I just (without a blink) send back a device that could potentially have the keys to all my bitcoins on it. And from then on, my interactions with their support were essentially an endless loop. I sent them videos showing them how the Coldcard behaves, how trusting the firmware doesn't change anything, I offered to hop on a Zoom call so that they could directly tell me things to try (I'm an experienced software engineer, and would have been happy to go through significant diagnostics with them, if they want to understand what is going on). To all of this, I always essentially got the same response: you've got to send the device back, otherwise we won't do anything. I should say that the entire interaction was HIGHLY frustrating, as each response from their end typically took many days, so this literally dragged out over weeks.

Am I wrong to refuse to send them the device back? It seems to me that even suggesting that from their end runs counter to literally all security practices that they themselves seem to promote with products like Coldcard. Even if I trust them (but really they shouldn't ask me to), it seems highly likely that my specific device has a defect. How am I to know that resetting it will actually wipe it? Maybe the defect also effects the wipe functionality? But more fundamentally, asking me to trust them that they haven't built in a backdoor into their device seems really inappropriate. This seems just like a too easy scam model: you sell hardware devices, design them so that once customers have put some funds on them they appear ""broken"", you tell customers to ""wipe"" them (but the wipe functionality doesn't do that) and to send the device back, and boom, they have my coins. Now, overall, it seems quite unlikely to me that that is actually the scenario, but why on earth would they behave in a way that I can't rule that out?

Here is what I had expected from them in terms of good customer support: sure, have some process to ensure I'm not just trying to get a free device, but once that is done, just offer to send a replacement free of charge and move on. And I think the fact that a) I've bought multiple other things from the before with no complaint (with a total cost that far exceeds the cost of that one Coldcard) and b) me sending videos that demo what is going on etc should really be enough to rule out a fraudulent behavior on my end.

So, my best guess right now is that they just have lousy customer service, and my suggestion would be to beware before you buy their stuff. I'd be interested to hear if others had similar experience. If you think I'm overreacting, please also let me know, maybe I am missing something.",1630893895,21,1

Has sent the following message to my account and some friends who are in a small reddit community:

&gt; Welcome to the full bitcoin club! In 20 years, than 1 million people in the world will likely be in this club. Congrats! I've been ""in the club"" for a while now, and hardware wallets are overrated and run on mostly proprietary source code, no one has hacked them yet, but it's possible. Cold Storage on the other hand cannot be hacked as it isn't hardware that can connect to anything.   
&gt;  
&gt;I would 100% do Cold Storage, nothing is safer and hackers are out for blood when they see you have a full BTC.   
&gt;  
&gt;Doesn't require an expensive purchase of a hardware wallet and can be backed up and restored. The easiest way is to through coinbase, initiate a withdrawal of 100% of your holdings. Coinbase controls your private keys so you really don't own that Bitcoin.   
&gt;  
&gt;There's websites that do it, but the functionality is built right into Bitcoin's source code to generate cold storage for toy automatically.   
&gt;  
&gt;So set up a withdraw, in the Notes section of the transaction, type ""cold\_storage:\[your@email.address\]"" This tells the blockchain to generate a new cold wallet. Send the bitcoin to the following address (Bitcoin's cold storage generator):  
&gt;  
&gt;bc1\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
&gt;  
&gt;After 1 confirmation you'll receive an email with a login, a 12 word backup phrase to backup your wallet, and a printable page containing your private and public key, as well as a second one with the recovery phrase.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Print this out, keep the private one locked up somewhere safe, even keep a copy in another physical location (I have one in my mom's basement, one copy buried under my tree stand, and a copy in my safe... My bitcoins aren't going anywhere haha).  
The public key you can use to receive more bitcoin or to send bitcoin.   
Enjoy! 

**These are the kinds of scams that new-ish users fall for, because it's full of truths, and one lie that sounds believable if you don't realize that BTC doesn't work like ETH... BTC ""Cold Storage Generator"".**

Always remember, if someone is sending you an address to send to, you're being scammed. **NEVER** send BTC to an address by request.

Bitcoin cannot run scripts natively yet, and even if you don't send to their address but add the ""cold\_storage:\[email\]"" in the coinbase memo area of a transaction you are giving node operators the ability to query your email and harass you to try to extort BTC.

Never divulge what you hold to anyone. Never put personal info in the memo field.

Most countries see Bitcoin as an asset, like real estate for example. So when you dispose it (sell it for example), that triggers a capital gain event that is taxed on the amount that it gained in fiat terms.

Now, in El Salvador, since Bitcoin will be seen as currency instead of an asset like Real Estate, wouldn't this be the perfect saving instrument? No capital gains?

I think it's similar in Germany if you hold Bitcoin for more than a year. And in Australia you get 50% discount in tax if you hold for more than a year.

I'm very late to this game (blame the fact I kept thinking a bit like Peter Schiff for years, not obnoxiously certain like he is, but skeptical of what would happen with Bitcoin over the longer run).  I currently have 0 bitcoin, but would like to start buying. 

The US government has in the past confiscated gold.  My primary concern is how to best make purchases in a way that is ""anonymous enough"" that if they try to do something like this in the future with bitcoin, I can not have them coming after me.  I do recognize that the amount I'm going to have is far less than others, so I won't be a big target, but I want to keep my risk profile as low as is practical for this consideration.

With that in mind, after looking around, my first thought was to sign up for localbitcoins and paxful, because these services allow buying bitcoin from individuals via paypal in small enough sums reporting requirements shouldn't be a huge issue.  But I noticed both of these services require SMS to sign up for purchasing, and I went ahead and signed up for paxful, and it also is asking me to verify my ID now because of where my cell number is located. Based on what it says, I don't think I have to verify there unless I exceed 1500$ worth of trade, but because I'm knew, I just want to verify I will be able to get the coins assigned to my local electrum wallet (I'm not sure this was best option for my concern, but based on prior research I think so?). 

My intent is to purchase over time and accrue as a form of savings, so small purchases are fine.

I'm not absolutely opposed to buying bitcoin in person from people I know but I'm an introvert with social anxiety outside work or the internet so I prefer this option a bit less.

So to convert this into some basic questions

1) What are best routes for me to buy bitcoin based on above?

2) What are best wallets for me to use?  I think I want to use local wallets (electrum) and then back up to the cloud for now.  I don't like the idea of wallets where I can easily forget the password and then I lose everything.  I'd rather worry about someone else taking it than that.  

3) What are the best exchanges for buying shitcoins with bitcoin?  I want to diversify a bit and maybe play with trading, since I don't think I'll be doing many real-world purchases with bitcoin due to my other concerns, at least not at first. 

4) If I do want to spend some of the bitcoin via mobile phone or something like that, what's best way to transfer it from my local wallet to a mobile wallet for spending that reduces risk of revealing my identity? 

5) Is there a better place to post this?",1630794220,21,1

The reason I ask is because there's now a noticeable difference between acquiring bitcoin from pre-2021 versus now. The main difference is that a whole bitcoin has crossed over from less than most people's annual salary to more than most people's annual salary. This is a common mental barrier, the price of one unit of something. According to [ssa.gov](https://ssa.gov) the median salary for Americans is just under $35k (from the most recent data of 2019). The average salary is higher at just under $52k. 

I am thankful that I'm aware of Bitcoin now. I have a small taste of what it was like before as I invested a little bit for a short while in 2018, but I stopped because I didn't have the appreciation and understanding that I do now, stemming from new personal motivations that came up in my life. So yes, I understand that people do deserve the price of Bitcoin that they're paying. Part of it is dumb luck of knowing the right people and part of it is what is the focus of one's time and energy. 

What is it like knowing that the average person getting in recently and in the future are very unlikely to have multiple bitcoin as time goes on?",1632086821,6,1

prelfg,extrastone,A Tour of the Moon,"What does Bitcoin going to the moon look like?

Let's start.

There are two stages of going to the moon in bitcoin.  The first is mass adoption.  The second is the first moon bounce which I will describe later.

Mass adoption will occur in one of a few ways:

1. People and companies in your nation will ""see the light"" and switch to the bitcoin standard.
2. Your nation's banks will collapse meaning that when local companies export they will decide that they want to be paid in bitcoin because they do not have bank accounts.
3. Your nation's local currency will hyper-inflate.  Instead of making payments in local currency by the wheel barrow you will make payments in bitcoin.
4. This one is a combination of all of them: other larger nations will have problems with their currencies or banks and your nation will just tag along and get into bitcoin as well.

Great so now we are all using bitcoin.  Bitcoin has gone to the moon!  Not quite.  On the other hand life might be pretty awful.  Your ""muggle"" (we need a name for non-bitcoiners) neighbor may have lost his bank account or other investments either through hyper-inflation or bank collapse.  Don't worry though, human beings are pretty industrious and life will recover.

So life has recovered and people are starting to discover that they need bitcoin.  They need it to buy groceries and pay rent.  Some people have decided that instead of spending bitcoin that they own they would like to borrow bitcoin at interest so that they can buy more expensive items than they can afford.  Borrowing starts to expand and then expand some more.

At this point we need to understand how to price bitcoin.  We cannot price it in dollars any more because dollars have become obsolete.  Let's price it in barrels of oil.  All numbers that I use will be approximate because everything here is a relative guess.  Today a bitcoin is worth about 600 barrels of oil.  Mass adoption of bitcoin as a currency could be estimated at a price of 10,000 barrels of oil.  (Today bitcoin is worth about $45,000 and a barrel of oil is worth about $75).

Great.  So now we are trudging along.  A barrel of oil costs 1/10,000 of a bitcoin or 10,000 satoshis.

How can we get to the moon?  It's very simple: debt crisis.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)

Every person who goes bankrupt sells his stuff at a discount to pay back some of his debts.  Eventually to stay solvent, people and companies are selling their goods at a discount to pay for their debts and there is deflation.  Your bitcoin is now worth 20,000 barrels of oil.

The next economic growth cycle will likely increase the value of bitcoin even more because while more goods may be produced through economic growth, the number of bitcoin will stay the same.  Somewhere around here is the moon.  It may not be that fun, but I think we will go there anyway.

So basically I have recently really tried to understand from a more future proof/philosophical type perspective what cryptocurrency will come out on top a long time from now.

Initially to start with I thought Bitcoin because of its network effect and it‚Äôs unparalleled security for over 10 years with POW.

To add I still don‚Äôt think POS is a viable solution for the long term as I believe it leads to centralization in a drastically worse fashion than POW ever could.

Now comes scalability, from what I gather, Bitcoins layer 2 protocol is the lightning network and the magical bullet solution to all the scalability issues that previously challenged and changed bitcoins once ‚Äúp2p everyday currency‚Äù narrative to a more ‚Äústore of value‚Äù narrative. Unfortunately as of now the lightning network isn‚Äôt actually scalable on a global scale and has many security issues that can arise from it, In its current state layer2 really strays away from bitcoins golden decentralization that it has at a base layer.

However I wouldn‚Äôt say this is all doom and gloom for bitcoin, the future technological advancements of layer 2 solutions and soft forking within in its current system could allow for it to render mostly all other cryptocurrencies pointless and come out on top, possibly changes and upgrades could allow bitcoin to reach an infinite state of secure scalability. On the flip side you could argue that bitcoins system is just so messed up from the base layer that the gateway between layer 1 and layer 2 will always hold it back from being perfectly secure and scalable?

My questions is are there laws in cryptography which disallow the gates between bitcoins layer1 and layer2 to ever be successful? Will technological advancements that we can‚Äôt see now be able to solve this? I‚Äôm here because I believe I found two crypto‚Äôs that solve infinite scalability, security and decentralization but I understand how bitcoin could render them pointless - so it‚Äôs a toss up out of three which to invest in...",1632072451,11,1

I run a small tech services startup that that supports many seed through series C startups in the bay area. Recently, some of our clients (crypto startups) have offered us tokens in lieu of cash payments for services rendered. For the businesses whose tokens that are tied to more established currencies (like BTC/ETH), it is easier to calculate the relative value in tokens and there is much less risk to my company.

However, many of these startups have tied their tokens to less well-entrenched cryptocurrencies (shitcoins?) and thus the valuation is more difficult and exposes my company to significant downside risk. Additionally, many of the startups haven't released a token yet/are offering stock options that convert into tokens/etc.

So my questions are : a) how do you value a services contract that is being performed in exchange for tokens/cryptocurrencies that are less well-entrenched than currencies like BTC/ETH?. b) how to approach valuing the options that convert into tokens?

I've considered the following options:

1. Make a percentage of the invoice payable in crypto and the remainder in USD/options/etc.
2. Add a multiple on to the cost of any less-well established token/currency offered for payment of an invoice.
3. only accept USD.",1632071255,6,1

I am wondering whether the Lightning Network can lead to a reduction in hash power employed in mining on the Bitcoin network. 

Based on my very limited understanding, LN basically bundles many transactions into one transaction on chain. 

(1). Is it theoretically possible that there will be very few transactions on chain and many transactions happening on LN in the future? 

(2) What happens to transaction fees per block on chain if number of transactions per block goes down? 

(3) If transaction fees per block go down, wont that reduce the mining incentive, all other things equal?

(4) I guess my actual question is, does the LN in any way reduce mining incentives on the bitcoin network?

In it ABIB seeks clarity on a range of debanking issues and provide a number of key recommendations, such as:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Bitcoin exchanges be assessed differently from other digital currency exchanges - the former being more akin to money changers while the latter more to casinos.
2. Banks ability to debank customers without recourse is detriment to bitcoin businesses and its customers.  
Data backed decisions are needed as well as increased transparency and recourse options.
3. Any regulatory framework needs to be tailored specifically to each digital asset class rather than all being slapped with a broad brush.
4. ABIB seeks to engage further with the Committee &amp; regulators.

psab55,Tux_fan,I‚Äôm from El Salvador‚Ä¶ UPDATE 2,"# Hi, it‚Äôs been a while since my last post so I want to give everyone an update adding also my personal perception on how things are going.

To begin with, chivo app (official wallet) haven‚Äôt been fully released to all android phones although it‚Äôs just a matter of time.

Here‚Äôs a recent [tweet](https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1440033171009982475) from president Bukele saying 1.6M Salvadorans are alredy using chivo app.

Bukele also [tweet](https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1438711414064128005) that chivo app is 100% functional, however there are still many issues to be solved.

* UX design problem, lightning network (LN) is hidden. ([See here some screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/3d9S3D1))
   * Most people don‚Äôt know the differences between Layer 1 (L1) and LN, they just tap ‚Äúreceive‚Äù and show you either the USD or Bitcoin qr code.
   * Transaction in LN are ok. 
   * L1 transactions between chivo‚Äôs app are ok.
   * *L1 transactions from chivo app to other wallets (Trust, Exodus, etc.) takes* ***days*** *to arrive.* 
      * I send a $2.00 transaction on sept. 8 (the same transaction I talked about in my last post) to my exodus wallet, today‚Äôs sept. 20 and I haven‚Äôt received it yet. From my personal perspective, this is the most common problem people post on social media, and since the money do not arrive, many have pay in USD, meaning they‚Äôre actually paying double.
* The USD qr code shows personal information. By using a qr scanner you can read the person DUI (Salvadoran ID) and full name. 
   * There are people who post their qr codes as a joke towards the anti-bitcoin ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt want the $30 then send it here‚Äù, many advise them to delete their post since anyone can see their data but they either don‚Äôt mind or don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs the problem. 
   * [Here‚Äôs a code](https://imgur.com/a/3d9S3D1), try scanning it with whatever qr code scanner you want. This guy is a government worker so his information is public anyways.
* There are issues withdrawing money from chivo app to a bank account (Note that first you need to convert btc to USD to use this feature). Sometimes it works fine others don‚Äôt. 
* Some random log out.
* There are moments you can‚Äôt make transactions, probably due to server problems since new devices are been added.
* Some people report not being able to send money from Chivo website using credit cards from Banco Agricola (Local Bank) and Chase.
* Chivo atm can be used with any wallet. ([Video by Marc Falzon](https://twitter.com/MarcFalzon/status/1439597651377414149))

&amp;#x200B;

**Now some insights about the general environment that is lived.**

Chivo‚Äôs atm are crowded almost all day. People are waiting in lines and asking for guidance, however (this is my perspective) most of them just want to withdraw the $30 bonus. Only a minority is using it to withdraw remittances or using it with other purposes.

Since most atms are crowded, many people are buying the $30 bonus btc for only $25. 

Let me explain (Please note that I‚Äôm not saying this is what most people are doing. It‚Äôs just a commonly seen phenomenon), you register in chivo app and get the $30 bonus, you want to withdraw that money to have cash. In order to do this, first you need to send the $30 to other chivo app and then re-send it to yourself to be able to withdraw it from the atm. Then you look for an atm to find it is crowded. To avoid all this hassle there are people who gives you immediately $25 cash and you send your bonus btc. This type of ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù is happening in many places. Almost all of my neighborhood has actually sold their bonus btc for $25. 

Aside the number of downloads shown in the stores, there are no other official data‚Ä¶ not really sure if people are actually using the wallet after getting the $30.

It might take a while to actually see if people use btc or ditch it away. There are no education programs about btc from the government aside teaching you how to use chivo app.

 

**Now let me ask you a question and get the discussion start.**

How is btc better than USD in a daily basis? Taking in consideration that many families have zero savings and live with what they earn daily or with a weekly/monthly paycheck. How are families supposed to get advantage of btc raise in price if they can‚Äôt hold them for more than a month?

At the moment, no one seems to have the answer. This is the dilemma of many low income families who are willing to give btc a try.

After successfully recovering the wallet.dat file, performing a dumpWallet command on the Bitcore wallet console, and uploading 4002 addresses on a watching-only wallet through Electrum, I found nothing. He claims he thought for sure he earned BTC in 2013 by watching ads and perhaps completing other micro tasks like completing surveys. I think there‚Äôs a chance that it may be stored through another account and never transferred to his wallet.

Say for example most people in this sub will be lucky to ever hold a full coin - if that climbed to say 500k (or more) like lots of people here are predicting, surely that means the currently rich individuals invested in BTC who hold 100s or 1000s will then become multi multi millionaires?

Ok so this is my theory about Bitcoin and about China and the USA and how it‚Äôs all connected. I‚Äôm probably very wrong but it‚Äôs just a theory that I have developed.

Ok, let‚Äôs get into it. So from my understanding Bitcoin was invented by and the white pages were written by Satoshi Nakamoto, very little is know about him or who he is. In my research I found that he tried to start Bitcoin twice but was supposedly arrested by the CCP. No one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is but it is said that he is the founder and has over 1 million bitcoins. I believe that the CCP know who Satoshi Nakamoto is because their culture is very much cantered around control. I‚Äôve heard stories of neighbours snitching on neighbours and that you never talk bad about the CCP because someone could hear you. They have cameras everywhere so something like this would not go unnoticed by the CCP 

I believe the CCP got Satoshi and took his Bitcoin storage and currently controls his over 1 million Bitcoin. They wanted to keep Satoshi a secret and keep his Bitcoins in secret. 

Ok, so now the USA has reluctantly given clear regulation surrounding crypto currencies and are currently being called out by people for not setting guidelines and regulating Bitcoin. I believe they are doing that for a good reason, America is known for taking there time and analyzing every option before making a move and China knows that. So using something such as Bitcoin they knew America would have to regulate it or would take their time analyzing it and because of that has gotten too big to be stopped.

The reason that the US is reluctant to consider Bitcoin a currency or have any regulations around it is because they are stuck. With China owning Satoshi‚Äôs Bitcoin stash, if the US approves it as a currency or gives it legitimacy by creating regulations surrounding it, I believe institutions and many more will invest in it. That being said realistically Bitcoin could hit 500K in 5-10 years as it‚Äôs market share would be considered the entire monetary system of the whole world. If that is too happen China is sitting on estimated over 1 million Bitcoins from Satoshi‚Äôs stash. Which would give them a massive financial step above everybody else. But the US has been analyzing everything and taking their time to make the ‚Äúright‚Äù call but by doing that Bitcoin has already gotten to be big and would look as though it‚Äôs betraying all the America in investors that hold Bitcoin. China also has a plan to take over the world and is said to be very very patient and strategic and could be secretly using Bitcoin to gain a massive amount and control.",1632355171,22,0

So do people who believe in lengthening cycles think that bitcoin halving should be independent from bull/bear cycles at some point? Or how does that make sense

And anyways, what are the fundamentals that halving events should trigger a bull run? The increase of supply decreases, but this should be priced in before. Is it miners behaviour?

\- Find out where to create account- When finds place like Coinbase or similar person needs to create a wallet- Go through KYC- Remember phrases- Educate about all of it (wallet, phrases, crypto address)- Choose which coin to buy- Use a credit card to buy it- Go to another site- Choose payment provider- Copy/paste your wallet id or address- Confirm that you are an owner somehow- Execute payment

pvg1d5,Razhier,Unpopular opinion: Bitcoin should remain inflationary,"Bitcoin inflation keeps mining profitable.

In the future, Bitcoin fees may not be enough, nor reliable enough, to pay for the security we have today.

Bitcoin inflation is a tax on the hodlers. Taxes that do not go to a minority controlling the monetary policy to satisfy their own interests, but rather to the people who is actively working on securing your Bitcoin in a perfectly competitive industry.

Fees are a tax to the transactors to ensure blockspace scarcity, and thus, decentralization. But they don't link to Bitcoin holdings.

Bitcoin inflation links its market cap with its security. Losing this link is very dangerous.

I know altering Bitcoin's hard cap would affect its value proposition. However, Segwit already increased the 1MB block size, which was as characteristic as the ‚Çø21M.

With a permanent inflation of 0.1%, Bitcoin miners revenue would be 10x higher than today's value. That is just a rounding error. Lost coins and better economy easily surpass that ridiculous percentage.

pvd2kb,citytelegraph,Why China Finally Decided to Ban Bitcoin,"After a strong start to the year, bitcoin and its fellow cryptocurrencies hit hard times yet again this week. The biggest news, and most wounding setback, was China‚Äôs announcement of new regulations banning all cryptocurrency mining and transactions. The government left no wiggle room: In the world‚Äôs most populous nation, buying, selling, and otherwise dealing in crypto is now flat-out illegal.

&amp;#x200B;

On Friday, 10 government bodies, including the People‚Äôs Bank of China, issued a joint statement vowing to crack down on cryptocurrencies and condemned the technology as a threat to citizens‚Äô assets and a tool for facilitating criminal activities like money laundering. The price of Bitcoin fell about 8 percent on the news, but regained its footing somewhat later in the day. Other, smaller cryptocurrencies took even bigger hits.

&amp;#x200B;

China has been instituting increasingly restrictive laws on cryptocurrencies in recent years. The country previously made it illegal for corporations to provide cryptocurrency-related services and to run cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. These new regulations go even further, and essentially amount to a wholesale ban on most every activity that allows the cryptocurrency ecosystem to function. Now, even cryptocurrency exchanges outside of the country won‚Äôt be allowed to serve people living in China. The country‚Äôs National Development and Reform Commission also announced that it was cutting power off for cryptocurrency mining operations, which expend large amounts of electricity to solve complex mathematical puzzles for which they‚Äôre rewarded with units of digital currency. The agency escalated its campaign to root out unauthorized mining from the country last week by targeting people who pretend to be data researchers in order to hide these energy-intensive activities.

&amp;#x200B;

China has in the past been a popular site for mining due to low electricity costs in areas like Inner Mongolia, but the country is currently experiencing an energy crisis and trying to become carbon neutral by 2050, a goal that cryptocurrency is making harder to meet. In 2019, China was home to 75 percent of the world‚Äôs Bitcoin energy consumption. That number dropped to 46 percent in spring 2021, and will likely drop even more sharply with the new restrictions announced on Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

The Chinese government‚Äôs move to rein-in cryptocurrency also has to do with its desire to exert more control over economic activity in the country. Bitcoin and its brethren were designed as a tool for facilitating transactions without institutional authorities like banks or governments, so allowing them to flourish in any country takes some power away from state actors. China is now trying to supplant bitcoin by creating its own digital currency known as eCNY, which will be backed by the government. However, eCNY has only superficial similarities to bitcoin and doesn‚Äôt use blockchain, the ledger technology at the heart of all cryptocurrencies.  


The unveiling of new restrictions in China wasn‚Äôt the only development weighing on cryptocurrency this week. Prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies also fell on Tuesday in the wake of the collapse of the megadeveloper Evergrande, which used to be China‚Äôs second-largest building company. Evergrande‚Äôs revenues have not been able to catch up with its lavish borrowing, and now the company is more than $300 billion in the hole. The failure of such a massive entity tanked the stock market and also sparked a huge selloff of cryptocurrencies. Investors tend to cash in on their riskier assets when there‚Äôs turmoil in the markets, and cryptocurrencies are one of the riskiest financial bets you can make. Bitcoin dropped 5.7 percent in price from Monday to Tuesday.

&amp;#x200B;

U.S. regulators are training their sights on Bitcoin as well. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler spoke at length about cryptocurrencies in an event hosted by the Washington Post on Tuesday, and he didn‚Äôt seem too optimistic about their future. Gensler noted that he doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a ‚Äúlong-term viability‚Äù and later signaled that the SEC is working ‚Äúovertime‚Äù to create new regulations for cryptocurrency markets that are likely to be quite a bit more aggressive than what‚Äôs already on the books. Of particular concern for the cryptocurrency is that Gensler left the door open to regulating stablecoins, or cryptocurrency that‚Äôs pegged to fiat currency, as securities. If that were to be the case, a number of cryptocurrency lending and trading platforms would be in serious violation of SEC rules.",1632595880,5,1

pv9mv1,Razhier,Should Bitcoin have a minimal constant inflation (say 0.1% per year) to keep mining profitable?,"**TLDR at the end!**

Hello Reddit.

I am a Bitcoin maximalist like no other. However, I have a question whose answer is still not clear to me: how mining would be profitable when the coinbase becomes negligible/zero?

I know the most commonly accepted answer is by transaction fees. But thinking thoughts about that, this answer does not convince me.

In a future where Bitcoin becomes a global currency, I assume that layer 2 and layer 3 solutions will be developed and secure enough to handle the vast majority of transactions. I am very optimistic with these developments, and I can imagine a future where these layers work so well and are so widely accepted, that in some cases they will be able to handle not just coffee payments, but also larger payments such as a car or a house.

Even more, I think the transaction size will be optimized over time with future updates (most recently with Taproot). So a layer 1 block will be able to handle more transactions than today, effectively reducing transaction fees.

This all sounds exciting, as it makes clear that the Bitcoin community is concerned about one of the mayor Bitcoin criticisms has, which is the high transaction fees.

However, this approach of reducing layer 1 congestion and optimizing block space, and thus minimizing transaction fees, conflicts with the idea of keeping mining profitable when the coinbase becomes negligible. We all want low fees, we all want PoW, but in that case, who will pay the miners? **Who will pay enough to keep Bitcoin secure?**

Today, the block reward is about 6.25BTC (coinbase) + ~0.2BTC (fees) = 6.45BTC. At the current value of ~43.000$, that's 277.350$. To simplify, lets round up to about 300.000$ each 10 minutes as the miner's current revenue. Also, let's assume that current block space allows about ~3.000 transactions per block. So, if today we had to pay miners only with transaction fees, the average on chain transaction fee should be about 100$!! Imagine the FUD coming from the media and shitcoins in that scenario!

Well, if that seems expensive, let me express my unpopular opinion: I think that amount of fees **would not be high enough** to pay for the security a global monetary network such as Bitcoin deserves. Even more considering that we are also indirectly paying for the security of the Lightning Network, RGB, smart contracts and all the L2/L3 solutions on top of the Bitcoin protocol.

I want the Bitcoin mining to consume way more energy than today, 10x at least (renewable and wasted, ofc). In the medium term future, I have no worries about that, as with each halving the price of bitcoin more than doubles, so bitcoin mining is even more profitable, more miners appear and more energy is consumed. However, this trend cannot be perpetual. The day will arrive in which the price of Bitcoin stagnates due to global adoption, but the halving will still occur, eventually reducing the coinbase to zero.

In that hypothetical scenario of L2/L3 solutions widely adopted, block space very optimized, and negligible coinbase, who is going to pay not just 300.000$ (at today's value) per 10min, but 1M$/10min at the very least?

Ok, I admit it, I am making a ton of assumptions. Who knows how the future will look like, especially in such a long term (50 years? 60? 70?) Maybe the base layer of Bitcoin will not be as unused as I am describing. Maybe the solution provided by Satoshi himself in his white paper is valid in this hypothetical future. I don't know, no one does, and I think even Satoshi himself didn't have such a level of foreshadowing.

What makes me comfortable is that, if this scenario happens, it will not be from a day to another, but slowly developed over time. For example, we will observe a decrease in hashrate over time (my biggest afraid), and a following debate about how could we make mining profitable again will occur within the community, very much like the blocksize war.

Well, I don't want to throw a problem without providing a solution, as that would be just FUD. Please, let me expose a couple of possible scenarios I have considered.

First, I thought about shrinking the block size, that is, artificially increasing transaction fees. However, this solution effectively does not help at all. Fees would be higher, sure, but less transactions would fit into a block, so in the end the block reward would not significantly change. In fact, increasing transaction fees would discourage base layer transactions, so people would prefer to use instead superior layers. In the end, transaction fees may be kept constant, and a block would handle less transactions, effectively reducing miners revenue. Remember, what we want to achieve is not higher transaction fees, but rather increase miners revenue each 10min.

So, if fees cannot keep mining profitable, what is their purpose? In my opinion, in Bitcoin, transaction fees are not a mechanism to fund miners (sorry, Satoshi). In my opinion, **fees are the mechanism by which a priority is established to the transactions in the mempool in order to be accepted in the next block, due to the nature of the blocksize limit**. That is, due to the nature of blockspace scarcity. This scarcity ensures a low enough blockchain size to be sufficiently decentralized, and thus, secure. I would not mind a future with a low layer 1 usage and zero transaction fees, as long as the blocksize is as restricted as today, and thus the blockchain is distributed enough.

But that raises, again, the question: how Bitcoin mining would be profitable in this hypothetical scenario?

As same as today: through **inflation.**

I know inflation is a very unpopular idea in this subreddit, but let me explain.

I hate fiat inflation as much as the other guy. That is in a big way, why I am a Bitcoin hodler and a maximalist. But not because I hate inflation per se. What I actually hate is the fiat monetary policy being controlled by a few people, unilaterally and arbitrary to satisfy their own interests. Think about this, Bitcoin is today inflationary, and will still be the rest of our lives. And still, we use it and believe in its future. At the same time, I am not a big fan of deflation per se. In fact, I would hate deflation as much as inflation if it was still controlled by a very few, unilaterally and arbitrary.

What I like about Bitcoin is not its deflation, nor inflation. It is its **public monetary policy**, known to all, set in stone from now for a 100 years, and no particular person can change that. We all must follow the same rules, no exceptions.

In that case, I am not against inflation. In fact, and following the theme of the post, I think it is the answer to keep the PoW in the hypothetical future I have described, and keep mining profitable.

In fact, that is exactly how Bitcoin works today. If the purpose of fees is to establish a priority to transactions to be confirmed into a scarce blocksize, I think inflation is what makes mining profitable, and thus, provides Bitcoin with tremendous security. And I think the opposite is also true: if Bitcoin had no inflation, there would be nearly no miners, and Bitcoin would be insecure, vulnerable.

I know, inflation is a tax to hodlers, as same as deflation is a reward to hodlers. Well, I, as a hodler, wouldn't mind to pay a small percentage of my holdings directly to a mining company to keep not only my funds, but all the Bitcoin network secure. That would be way cheaper than securing gold nowadays. However, I don't think altruism would be enough. First, because it is susceptible to malicious hodlers who would benefit from other people paying miners altruistically. Second, because there would also be non malicious hodlers who would benefit from this, like people in prison or in comma, unable to spend their coins, but still may be able to access them in the future.

So, imagine all 21M Bitcoin have been mined, there is no inflation, mining is not profitable and hashrate is worryingly low. Imagine we all discuss, debate, and accept through consensus a constant inflation of 0.1% a year. That would be 21.000 BTC created from nowhere every year, or about 0.4BTC every 10min. Imagine an arbitrary price of 10M$ as today's value per Bitcoin. That would be 4M$ every 10min which would go to miners revenue, plus negligible transaction fees. That would be 10x more block reward than today's!

For me, those numbers make absolutely total sense. I am telling you that, if you have 100.000$ in Bitcoin holdings, you just have to pay indirectly a depreciation of 100$ a year. Money that does not go to the minority controlling the monetary policy to satisfy their own interests, but rather **to the people who is actively working on securing your Bitcoins in a perfectly competitive industry.** Honestly, that seems very fair to me.

And now, if we consider the loss of bitcoin over time, the total inflation rate would be in the practice even lower. Also, consider the increase in purchasing power derived from global capitalism over time (I know, huge leapfrog there, but that is an entirely different topic to discuss). That 0.1% inflation becomes more and more of a rounding error.

To sum up, I think Bitcoin security should not be exclusively paid by those who permform on chain transactions, but also by those who hold Bictoin, and thus they benefit from the security provided by the PoW.

Anyway, I am looking for your opinions about what solution would you propose in this hypothetical future. Sorry if it ended up being a long post. I don't usually post much, but as much as I trust Bitcoin, this is my mayor long term concern, and I haven't found any paper or book providing a solution that convinces me. Also, I am not a native English speaker, so please sorry for any mistakes.

If you have reached here, thank you for reading me!

*Just to clarify it, I am not a Bitcoin miner in disguise, just a concerned hodler!*

**TLDR:** In the future, there is a chance that transaction fees would not be enough to provide suffice mining revenue, and thus security, to Bitcoin as a global currency. With a 0.1% permanent inflation, Bitcoin mining would me much more profitable than today, the monetary policy would still be predictable long term and transparent, and hodlers may not notice such a rounding error in inflation, but rather sill an increase in purchasing power thanks to lost coins/better economy.",1632585721,30,1

puf2pu,Pos_Mon,Banks don't worry about you losing your money to gambling but are worried about you buying Cryptocurrency. A skeleton is sure in the closet.,"Hey mates, think with me!!!
Why is it that banks don't worry about you losing your money to gambling but are worried about you buying Cryptocurrency? Are they protecting you? Or are the protecting their businesses? Are the trying to help you put food on your table or increase their own income? There are lots and lots of unanswered questions begging for answers. And I assure you, a skeleton is sure, in the closet here.
Banks let you buy lottery tickets. They let you gamble with your money day in day out. With just a few clicks, you can play around with your money on all of these. And yes, you should be allowed unconditional access to your money, because it is your money - YOUR MONEY.
But when it comes to you buying Cryptocurrency, the bank's ""policy"" changes. I once got a message from my bank saying that, ""for the safety of my money, payment to Crypto platforms had been restricted"". This was the funniest day of my life. I wondered why they didn't restrict payment to gambling and lottery sites? Oh yeah, I get it. They just never really cared about the ""safety"" of my money after all. They are only against Crypto because they know what it will do to their businesses. What they haven't realised is how unavoidable Crypto effects on banks and exchanges actually are.
Listen to Cryptocurrency critics talk and all they say are; Cryptocurrency breeds fraud, it helps to expand money laundering, it increases criminality, it helps bad people finance terrorism, blah blah blah blah.
I beg your pardon, before Satoshi Nakamoto invented bitcoin and subsequently introduced all of us to this beautiful world of awesomeness called Cryptocurrency, terrorism, fraud, money laundering, drugs and indeed all the bad things they accuse Cryptocurrency of had been in, not just existence, but on rampant occurrence.
You make your money, take it to the bank so they can help you keep it and release it back to you whenever you want to use it. Buy hell no, banks don't want to simply let you use your money whenever you need it. They want to be the ones to determine when and how you use your own money - YOUR OWN MONEY!!!
Unfortunately, this will not soften anytime soon. Banks will continue to fight. They will continue to restrict payments and stop us from expanding cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. And for this, you should not give up. Don't let anyone determine how, where and when you use your money.
Fam, I urge you to invest in Cryptocurrency. Don't pull all of your money into it. Why? Because I believe there are other needs and bills to take of. Rents, cars, insurance, name them.
But Cryptocurrency is sure, the future. And you are supper early in it. Only about 5% of the world's 7 billion people own Crypto and that tells you how much you will make when adoption explodes.
Buy and HODL. Yes, HODL!!!
You will be fine, I can assure you.
Have a great day wherever you are.
Love you all!!!
Cheers...",1632470016,103,1

We have currently spent no money on advertising and/or overhead so we're relying on organic growth to reach more people willing to volunteer. 

Requirements: 

1.Print out flyers https://imgur.com/pPH2rC2
2.Buy/Hand food out
3.Take photos of the food being given out with the flyers.
4. Send a the photos along with the receipt to cryptofthl@gmail.com and everything will be reimbursed in cypto (or cash if preferred) 

The biggest hurdle for the organization has been finding volunteers to give food out. 

There are several past redditors volunteers who can vouch for the integrity of the charity so please don't be hesistant to help today. Thank you!

pw9hjv,throwaway29801A,Random thoughts of a 38 year old,"If you are on reddit bitcoin, maybe you are new to bitcoin, maybe you are considering putting in more $. Here are some thoughts of a random 38 year old.

1. Are you still early? Super early? No. Early? Yes. The vast majority of people I know own zero bitcoin. I know people with real money who say ""tulips"". There is NO etf, and only 1 S&amp;P 500 company that owns it. I personally know about 30 people with net worth above 500k. ZERO have more than 10% of their net worth in btc. For those that own it, we are talking between 3-10,000 worth.
2. The dollar will NOT crash. I've heard this for a long time. The dollar is a measurement against other garbage currencies. I expect the dollar to stay in the same range for a long time. I do believe the dollar structurally crashes in about 20 years-we are far from this.
3. Humans always chase. Let me repeat: humans always chase. 2017 crypto, 2007 housing, 2000 dot com. Those are the ones people talk about. How about fracking in North Dakota and Texas? People that took out loans to buy trucks and make money like water flowed and then lost it. The miami real estate bubble in 2008 was insane-we are talking about people flipping condos that the development had not even broken ground on. How about some of the NFTS? People ALWAYS chase. 
4. There are 5 things that will make btc go up: expanding balance sheets of central banks, more stimulus, rate cuts, institutional adoption, and the etf. I think this year brings a future based etf and next year more rate cuts as the economy, worldwide, is slowing. Taper is the new rate cut. So they have to taper AND raise rates...lol not happening.
5. My belief is getting to 1 coin, or 2, is enough for the vast majority of people. Can people try to get to 10, 20, etc? yes, of course. However, if bitcoin goes to a path to 500k, then a million, it will be more than enough for most. Why? They can borrow against it or lend it out and use it as a 3-5% bond.
6. I think trading is an art most lose money at, me included. The siren song of trading futures and leverage-most people I know with money are firm in their STAY AWAY stance. Bitcoin is an 80 volatility asset. The S&amp;P is 10. There was a $1,000 swing in 1 hour today. Most people with leverage lose $. Most, not all. I think trading makes sense when you have hit your goal. Your goal is your goal alone.
7. Your friends, co worker, boss, and family might ask you how much btc you have. I'd significantly understate it. Why? Most humans are jealous. It's not evil-people are interesting creatures. Let's say you have 5 btc. Let's say btc goes to $10,000. A lot of people will call you up, mock you, etc. However, lets say btc goes to $200k. You now have a million dollars. You will attract a lot of unwanted attention. Also, it might ruin your friendships (c'mon man, my radiator is down and work is slow, it's only $600, you have 5 btc!""). Look at a lot of young adult men who get quick money-it's gone fast. Also, people knowing you have money is actually a safety issue.
8. Keep your job until you feel secure. I see a lot of people trying to gloat. Why not keep your job and build your stack?
9. Unpopular opinion, but bitcoin or being rich won't make you happy. There are a lot of miserable people with a LOT of money. I think the vast majority of people on CT are actually unhappy even if they have tons of money and luxury goods.
10. As a real estate person, I have been convinced that at this point, real estate is a worse bet than bitcoin. here's why:

ROI= equity gained / down payment.

The only way to max out this formula is to put as little down as possible.

However, there are 2 types of real estate and why they go up. Non luxury is only going to keep going up because of money printing and lower rates. If this happens, btc skyrockets. Luxury does this and because it's very scarce and the demand for luxury will greatly increase-however, to go after luxury real estate, at least in the US, starts are 2 million, and realistically more like 3. This means you are paying in most places 2-5k a month in taxes alone. Let me repeat-2-5k in monthly taxes alone. Unless you have tons of liquidity, my bet is btc.",1632716070,267,1

Millennials try to achieve this by drastically cutting down on their spendings, saving as much as 60% of their incomes.

&amp;#x200B;

What I know or suspect so far,

* Prices change daily
* Bitmain is setting the prices
* The prices apply to used and new machines
* The difference between suppliers is at most a few percent
* It appears to be a function of TH, watt usage(?), and maybe: Bitcoin total hashrate, and price

I do have a problem with the Suggested news feed Algo items that FB spits out at me on a consistent basis so I decided to count how many Bitcoin negative sentiment versus Bitcoin positive sentiment articles they feed me and how I personally feel each time one is suggested to me. Today I finally hit 100 and the results shouldn't be shocking at all.

The majority of sources for these articles are Forbes, Business Insider and Coindesk. You should know that all 3 of them are pay to play.. meaning if you want to pay $$$ your article can be featured on them.

Without further delay.. of the 100, only 3 had a positive sentiment for Bitcoin. I don't follow any Bitcoin pages, don't follow any groups and don't contribute to any crypto discussions on the platform so the suggestion is purely FB's way of saying yes we know you're into crypto so here's what we think you should read. The headlines have been ""Miamicoin set to grow faster than Bitcoin"" .. ""Find out why this viral TikToker has predicted Bitcoin's fall from #1"" .. ""Why Bitcoin is going to lose value due to X""

I'm not fucking selling.. But why does Facebook want me to so badly? Why does Facebook want me to think that Bitcoin is going to lose to some random shit coin? Why does Facebook care that I read about Bitcoin with negative sentiment?  Why doesn't Facebook share relevant positive sentiment articles? 

Facebook knows whether you're pro or not. Facebook knows if you hodl. So here's my 2 cents.. If libracoin can't succeed than why should the Winklevoss twins have something more valuable than FB and FB will exert it's power over the people with it's own agenda through suggested news feed articles to negative sentiment articles that people will read and recite as if it's the gospel..",1632683460,186,1

pxhnxs,JunoKat,A summary from my 100 hours of learning Bitcoin,"Warning: It will be long, but I tried to write it in the most simple language possible 

**Does bitcoin has intrinsic value?**

Imagine this:
If people hire an army to guard a vault full of gold and lots of people to count the gold coming in and out, making sure the truth is maintained, and gold could be sent in and out of the vault, at the speed of light, does this has value?

What about the massive energy usage?

If the vault only hire 3 guards with a few guns and one person to keep the count, would you trust your life saving in it?

When you hear on the news that Bitcoin is using more energy than Finland, what they actually mean is: If Finland were to spend a huge amount of money to buy mining rigs as divert all its energy to attack this Bitcoin vault, Finland would lose. The truth will still be kept, your money is intact.

The ‚ÄúBitcoin vault‚Äù has one of the strongest defend ‚Äúarmy‚Äù in the world nowadays in the form of energy. It also has hundred of thousand of computers keeping count, so value can go from one place to another 24/7/356 at the speed of light. 

**Wouldn‚Äôt it still be a huge waste of energy though?**

Yes, so here‚Äôs the ‚Äúcatch‚Äù: The vault used to use a lot of its defense energy from common sources such as coals, gas, solar, wind, etc, very similar to what we are using in our home today. But it doesn‚Äôt have to.

There is a lot of ‚Äútrapped‚Äù energy too far away from towns and cities for human to make use of. Think about geothermal energy sources next to volcanos. If we were to harvest electricity there and build power cables to lead it all the way to our cities, there will be almost no power left when it arrives because of the long distance travel. Now imagine you can ‚Äúhire‚Äù that renewable energy army to guard the vault.

That‚Äôs what the recent and near future of bitcoin defense will look like. One of its ‚Äúintrinsic‚Äù value is the army of defense the size of nations, to make sure no one can tamper with the record and the value it‚Äôs holding inside.

**What real life applications are there?**

There are four main applications for Bitcoin in my opinion:

*First: A store of value*

For normal middle class people like you and I, if we are lucky and live in a well run country where inflation is about 2-5% a year, after 30-35 years of working and saving, our life savings in cash would lose about 50-90% of its value.

For 1.4 billion people who is currently living in not so well run countries where inflation is about 10% a year, after working and saving their whole lives, their saving would lose 98% of value at retirement.

Note that many people like myself can access ETFs and other investment vehicles, many people in less developed countries can‚Äôt. The more money their government print, the more diluted and valueless their bank account becomes. People‚Äôs lives savings chipping away in their sleeps, a small piece at a time.

Fiat is money governments can print but you and me can‚Äôt. Bitcoin is money you and I can‚Äôt print, and no one else can print either. There is 21 million coins and that‚Äôs it. 21 millions coins under the best defense army in the world. It will help act as a store of value for many people, especially people living in high inflation or hyper inflation countries.

*Second: Big payments, country to country, think a huge shipping boat with thousands of containers kind of payments.*

It is tough to manage big payments in the tens and hundreds of millions of dollars. Imagine a company in Vietnam selling to a company in Finland, many banks need to be in the middle, they all need to work very hard, plus trust each other because it is hard to convert trillions of Vietnam Dongs into tens of millions of Euros and it will cost a lot of money.

One transaction in Bitcoin cost about $5 today for any amount, even a billion dollar. Because of the above mention army of security and hundred of thousands of computers keeping watch, no trust is needed between banks, a billion can go from Asia to Europe in about 10 minutes.

‚Äú$5 dollars are a lot of money for a small transaction though. Wouldn‚Äôt it make bitcoin not practical as a currency for small payments‚Äù

Yes, you are right, layer 1 of Bitcoin is not practical for small payments, this is what you might have heard a lot on the news: ‚Äúonly 7 transactions per second, not usable for every day use, too high fee, etc‚Äù

What many people missed is: layer 1 is not meant to be used for everyday transactions. Just like the Visa or Mastercard networks are layer 2 that were built on top of layer 1 which are clearing banks/houses. Clearing banks handle millions at the end of the day or week between banks and nations. Visa and Mastercard operate on top of this layer and keep count of small transactions.

The lightning network has been acting as Bitcoin layer 2 that is powering everyday transactions. While Visa is said to be capable of handling 24,000 transactions per second, lightning can handle millions. It is also borderless and decentralized, with the capability to power micro transactions at zero cost.

*Third: Micro transactions, powering new business models*

Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter said that if he had bitcoin and lightning back in the day, he wouldn‚Äôt have run Twitter on an advertisement model. Why?

It was close to impossible to charge people 1 cent for watching a video or for using Twitter for 5 minutes. It was impossible to do that when the users are in many different countries. The solution was then to sell ads, every time you watch and ad, Twitter charges the business that runs the ad 1p, at the end of the day after showing ads to tens of thousands of people, Twitter charges the business a few hundred dollars.

Bitcoin and lightning change this. 

Imagine the new businesses models that could be powered by micropayments. Lightning made it possible. 

*Last but not least, bank the unbanked*

I have been rather lucky to live in a big city in the UK that is served by many banks. However, it is not always the case in poorer and more remote area of the world. Some people I know back in Vietnam never had a bank account in their lives, some never will. They are deemed to poor and too unimportant to be served by banks. 

Bitcoin and lightning network mean that anyone in the world today with a phone and internet access can own a bitcoin ‚Äúbank account‚Äù, can participate in the ‚Äúgold vault in the sky‚Äù without discrimination, without having to prove that they are credit worthy to be served, all within about 2 minutes.

Bitcoin and lightning network mean that small business owners can start charging and receiving payments for their little street side business almost instantly without applying at the bank, without having a proof of credit, without installing and paying for any card machines.

There are so many businesses and applications being built on too of Bitcoin and Lightning by amazing people globally. I am learning every day but still I couldn‚Äôt keep up with the space of innovation in this area. I will keep sharing my knowledge as I learn more.",1632868292,39,1

Maybe no one has an answer but i imagine there are theories from anyone or someone that has exposure to information at a high level before the general population on here.

The amount of new things we are being made aware of being put into place by the US gov and affiliates along side other world Gov‚Äôs also, to create CBDC‚Äôs, which most importantly is the USD being forged into its Digital counterpart, in front of our eyes, and it is happening right now.

Alarm Bells are ringing for me because all crypto is valued against the current Fiat USD now. They just are, i understand the difference and how BTC particularly is an asset capable of far more than the current USD as a global reserve!

But it‚Äôs not widespread enough, El Salvador has adopted it i know and its too massive already to be nothing at all, but here is my issue.

Decentralised crypto and exchanges that just use P2P ways to move any and all coins or assets, all, and i do mean all, currently peg their standard benchmark unit of value back to the FIAT USD of currency we have now. 
What happens next? A digital USD is created while we argue which crypto we already have is best now, and then they all become pegged to the USDigital Dollar, which its value comes completely derived from whatever the shitshow system that is in place now.

Or what else?
I genuinely don‚Äôt know, BTC hodlers or maximalists surely see that regardless of belief in BTC potential, ETH fanboys pr else will not just allow BTC to become the global reserve asset of benchmark value all else become pegged to overnight.

What I‚Äôm trying to understand is more about lightning without being misdirected.

So basically if I have a LN wallet custodial or non custodial and someone sends me 5 bucks or something can I even send it back to a regular btc wallet? Wouldn‚Äôt the low balance basically be trapped in Ln because the btc on chain fee is too high so basically in LN even if it‚Äôs non custodial aren‚Äôt I just holding a ton of IOU‚Äôs? 

This clearly wouldn‚Äôt be even a second thought to a common user I‚Äôd say Venmo or something had LN wallet payments but to those who really want to ‚Äúown‚Äù their sound money on the main net isn‚Äôt this an issue? 

Why would I want to keep my BTC in LN . To me if you‚Äôre just as paranoid about a checking account holding your balance and not leaving your savings in a seperate account then how is LN any different?

The concept of it being a network and creating these routes makes perfect sense, I‚Äôm a network engineer by trade but why would we even need this it sounds like we are just over complicating what was meant to be a simple public ledger. 

I‚Äôm not bias to LN or I‚Äôm trying my hardest not to be that way I‚Äôm not just avoiding it from my own outlook... but I still get the sense this is all a building block to centralized banking style 2.0 and honestly no normal citizens of the world will care or understand, most don‚Äôt even understand how much debt their own country may be in.

I was here for the split, I know the arguments for both sides, and why both sides feel their certain ways but I could really use a better understanding of why this will be the course of scaling the decentralized internet vs keeping it as simple as possible on chain.",1632856709,11,1

I was euphoric, on top of the world. Then the floor fell out, I didn't understand much about the why.

It went lower and lower and retreated into the low thousands. I felt gutted. Emotional, upset. But I still believed and kept contributing little by little when I had spare change.

I look right now totally unphased at it as it slips by a couple of percentage points each week. 

A part of me wants it to crash 90 %, for if it did I would certainly buy it all over again.

This next run up could be in the hundreds of thousands for all we know. Or it could be 0. But for now I feel solid in my (fanaticism) that crypto is an investment in a speculative future of freedom from financial markets.

I've been around for several years in this forum but this is my first message ever. Step by step I've become what could be called a ""maximalist"". Maybe I read too many Mark\_Bear posts or listen too many Gigi podcasts, who really knows...

Like Frodon Sacquet I will try to be up to the many challenges we will face and to keep my mind clear to hodle and to avoid at any price shitcoinery. Not because BTC is my precious but rather it is the hope for a better world and to escape the debt monney. I see not point to recreate a paradigme where people fight to be the new brrrr printer lord with their premined scam. 

I've gone to far in the rabbit hole and the event horizon has been crossed. I run my nodes (validation &amp; lightning) and I am ready to die on this hill as a proud pleb. For this fight, we only need to stay united and to have stronger moral values than our opponents.

Due to covid I had to quit my job. It is for me an opportunity to reorientate my life toward more meaningful things. My dreams would be to be able to join a lightning network project. For instance to be part of an adventure like Bitcoin Beach in El Zonte and to create bridge between the BTC with real economy would be awesome. To work for companies like Blockstream would also be terrific !

Unfortunately I cannot code but I have other skills and I am a hard worker person. I need to meet people and improve my knowledge so as to have added value in this space. *If you guys have any advice or you know good projects (good companies &amp; positions) do not hesitate to send me a DM*.

The reason why I decided to write this post is linked to another topic and I would need your help as a community to assess if my idea is stupid or has some potential. Let me explain briefly.

Among my best friends, there is a couple of artists who are doing super nice design for cards, notebooks and also children books ([link of their website](https://petitgramme.fr/livres/)). They have a point of sale in Le Havre in France.

After all this NFT crazyness, I was upset to see that some scamer and people play on this hype to sell to naive people jpeg files for fortunes. I do think it is interresting to find way to compensate directly the artists / creators for their work but most of the NFT projects smelt like shit.

So here is my question: If I convince my friends to translate their book in English and to sell it in their eshop only through the Lightning network? Let's say 5000 numeroted books for instance at $30. Could it make special in a way and collector? The anti-NFT project with a real physical good sponsored by the BTC community? I would like to do something honest which could financially help them and so that they have a broader market. They have absolutely no clue about BTC so far. If we succeed in creating like a buzz around this story, it could help to promote real creators in real life and not some NFT hype with fake celebrities and scammer. For me it sounds much more close to BTC values. Maybe Michael Saylor could autograph a few of them to make them collection items ;-)

If you think it does not worth the time &amp; energy? Let me know if you have better ideas. Thank you very much guys !",1632847204,0,1

pycz9a,s3k2p7s9m8b5,My thoughts on why to hodl Bitcoin is a no-brainer.,"The world is rapidly moving to digital payments at an accelerated pace. Cash is going to become increasingly rare and inconvenient. 

And who will gain the most market share? Digital networks that make transfers free, instant and borderless, plus they can be private (without exposing your personal information on the internet). 

Bitcoin (with the use of its Lightning Network), is the only network that can do that, all other networks require your personal information (which is hacked, exposed and sold many times), as well as require intermediaries that need to be paid (they keep part of the money/transfer in the form of all kinds of fees and costs) as with credit cards, Paypal, etc. 

It is the power of decentralization (as well as with the internet), there is no centralized authority that can be hacked or needs to be paid.
Bitcoin is many things, besides being digital gold (because of its scarcity), it is a worldwide financial/monetary network in which everyone can participate, you just need a cell phone and internet access (that automatically gives financial services to the billions of people in the world who now have none and are completely disconnected from banking and financial services).

On top of that, it is at its base an immutable global registry, which will be used (and already certain countries are starting) for unalterable and indestructible property records, as well as for all kinds of inviolable contracts and will be used for fraud-proof voting and a myriad of uses that will arise from such properties (immutability, decentralization, borderless/global, speed, security, privacy, etc.), just as layers were built on top of the basic Internet protocol (TCP/IP) which in its beginnings was almost unusable, very slow and inefficient, until the necessary applications were built to make it more and more useful.",1632978580,5,1

The European market started to fall sideways, and the daily line surged and fell back to close, which means that it must still be turbulent at present. We should go short in the turbulence, and wait for counter-pumping is the key point. In any case, the decline or counter-pumping in recent days has not continued.

As for the short-term trading of BTC contracts in the day, yesterday, it touched the previous low point to support the counter-pumping, but this position has not been won, but it does not affect our continued bearish position, as long as it is still a see-through position in the rhythm of repression, which was also mentioned yesterday. In the morning, it is a counter-pumping market, which is also a cycle in the past two days. If we are short in shocks, we will continue to rely on our trend line to suppress the position to go short, and look at the cycle of European and American markets falling back. BTC contract short-term trading strategy: 43300-43400 area is empty, and the target is near 42300 area and 41800 area!

Time has passed, prices have been seen, profits and losses have been tasted, gains and losses have been recalled, experiences have been precipitated, and achievements have been made. I am deeply touched by bitterness, sweetness and sourness, and I am indifferent to it and have no competition with the market. Market trends are ever-changing. Only by keeping pace with the times and following the trend can we gain a foothold. A flower can't support the beautiful spring, and the strength of one person can't change the market trend.

We are creating a company that will feature many different products to help you become a successful Investor/Trader. The first product we are launching, and what you will receive in the beta will be a proprietary twitter data analysis tool. Essentially the program will scan in real-time every tweet on Twitter and **formulate** it into a **live** numerical feed with charts. This will be extremely valuable because it will help identify big trends before they happen. Wish you would have caught the GameStop craze before it happened? Our software will show the market sentiment of any keyword phrase you enter and categorize them into a **positive** or **negative** group. This in theory will help you better understand what people are buying and selling and the live/ past data of what is happening. This program along with many we are preparing to launch in the coming months is finally going to give everyone an edge. **Retail** and **Professional** Traders alike. Oh yeah, and screw the **Bloomberg Terminal** because only the rich can afford proprietary data.

A few issues were raised by our auditors:

Uncapped Deposit Fee

Absence of Emergency Withdrawal Function

Referral Code

Our team reviewed our analysis of different projects and came up with the following conclusion that could be detrimental to the project:

4. Extensive Time Delay between Seed Phase and Farming Phase (LP Phase)

As the team does our best to safeguard the community, a unanimous conclusion was made that a redeployment of smart contracts will be needed. Though this would be a tedious process and would delay the project, it is necessary for the survivability and longevity of our DeFi project.

TD;LR: 1) Minor contract changes will be made to the project to address the uncapped deposit fees. 2) We termed our (Emergency Withdrawal Function) as ‚ÄòWithdrawal‚Äô under both block explorers. 3) 2 Actions(Deposit/Withdrawal of funds) will be needed for a user to receive referral rewards. 4) A refined strategy has been made to effectively minimise the transition period between each phase to less than 10min, from an initial minimum delay of 1hr.

In this Medium article, we will address community concerns and present a revised launch strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

RugDoc‚Äôs review on yRace

1. Uncapped Deposit Fee

It was never our intent take advantage of an Uncapped Deposit Fee. Project yRace always put the community first and would not have changed our Deposit Fee. To address the legitimacy of building a lasting community project, the finding of an Uncapped Deposit Fee needs to be resolved. As such, the team has decided to implement a capped deposit fee to reassure public investors that no malicious action can be carried out on the back end of the project.

An Uncapped Deposit Fee allows project owners to change Deposit Fees to however much a project wants to. This effectively translates to a project being able to pull the rug and run way with potentially 100% of the community and investors funds.

2. Absence of Emergency Withdrawal Function, A Misunderstanding

Under RugDoc‚Äôs review, it was also noted that our project does not have an Emergency Withdrawal Function.

This is a crucial feature for every DeFi projects as it allows users to withdraw staked funds on a particular project when the front-end of the project fails, or the website of the project crashes. Emergency Withdrawal Function, however, does not allow rewards to be credited to the user.

Perplexed, we sat down with the our developers and found that there has been a misunderstanding.

The developers termed our (Emergency) Withdrawal Function as ‚Äòwithdrawal‚Äô, which can be found under the 10th dropdown bar of ‚ÄòWrite Contract‚Äô on our respective SeedMaster Contract on both [bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com) and [polygonscan.com](https://polygonscan.com).

Users would have to input the Pool ID and the amount of tokens that were staked on the Address. This works similarly to the ‚ÄòEmergency Withdrawal Functions‚Äô. On top of that, users would also be able to receive Yrace rewards at the end of Seed Phase.

3. Referral Code

In our Smart Contract Audit, a minor clarification was needed:

A second action needs to be taken by the referral in order for the user to receive 2% referral rewards.

TL;DR: A user must do 2 actions on the same pool, either deposit, harvest or withdraw. Deposits can only be done before Seed Phase ends, while harvest can only be done after Seed Phase Ends. The flow of every user‚Äôs action on yRace Seed Pools will automatically qualify him for referral rewards.

By logic, this works perfectly on our project as users will need to deposit (1st action) their funds into one of the designated Seed Pools during Seed Phase. During which, if the user deposits or withdraws funds from the same Seed Pool(2nd action). At the end of Seed Phase, users will have to harvest their yRace rewards(2nd action/3rd action). The harvest function will also withdraw staked tokens from Seed Pools.

The overall flow of any user‚Äôs action on yRace will automatically qualify any user who used the referral code, to referral rewards!

Please note that if the user does the 2nd action on a different pool, he will not be eligible for referral rewards. However, at the end of Seed Phase, users are required to withdraw staked tokens from Seed Pools (assuming depositing tokens is the 1st action, this withdrawal would be the user‚Äôs 2nd action). This would qualify users to referral rewards.

4. Extensive Time Delay between Seed Phase and Farming Phase (LP Phase)

As we kept taps on projects that launched in a similar fashion, we realised that the time period between Seed and Farming Phase plays a crucial and pivotal role. A long and dormant transition period between the 2 phases can be detrimental to the survivability of our project.

Project yRace took inspiration from Big Data Protocol‚Äôs launch and studied in depth at the way they launched, which used 2 different masterchef contracts to transit between Seed and Farming Phase. As our main operating wallet is multisig and behind a 24hr timelock contract, we realised that a minimum time delay of 1hr would be needed for a full and complete transition from Seed to Farming Phase and potential changes in masterchef contracts would instil fear in investors. Additionally, 1hr of inactiveness could result in major sell-off.

In order to rectify this issue, the team has decided to make the following changes:

We will revisit the ownership of Yrace token contract, and make SeedMaster and LPMaster (Masterchef of Seed Phase and Farming Phase respectively) the masters of Yrace token contract. In turn, the owner of the Yrace token contract will be the deployer of the contract.

Only the owner will be able to set masters by calling the setMasters() function. As such, only the masters of the Yrace token contract will have the rights to mint Yrace tokens. Once the owner sets the masters for the token contract, subsequent changes of masters cannot be made. Thereafter, the owner of the Yrace token contract will not be able to do any future operations on the contract.

Conclusion

Redeployment 2 days before our launch. We know the pain, but we have to do what is necessary to safeguard our community and investors.

As such, our project will be delayed by a maximum of 2 weeks. The redeployment of our contracts will take place on Friday, 27 August, with the launch of Seed Pool on 3 September. Nevertheless, we would like to thank our community for raising necessary concerns. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",1632949654,1,1

ppk7lb,Antique-Rub-892,The El Salvadoran Protest on Bitcoin and the Way Forward,"El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele announced to the world in Miami that El Salvador will adopt  Bitcoin as a legal tender in the country. The driven force for this policy is to ease remittances by Salvadorans in the United States back to their families at home as well as attracting foreign investment.

This bitcoin policy of President Bukele took off on 7/9/2021. Prior to that, the government had installed ATMs emblazoned with the name around the country. It also took a further step by purchasing  550 bitcoin worth roughly $25million  as well as launching a digital bitcoin wallet app called ""Chivo"". All these were honest efforts of the Bukele government to set the ball rolling.

However, in the morning of same 7/9/2021 it was reported that El Salvadorans protested in the streets of  Salvador against this noble policy of the Bukele administration. They cited the volatility of the coin amongst others as their reasons for their objections to the adoption of the coin in the country.

It will be recalled however that most of the protesters were middle class and low income earners.
El Salvadorans should however know that this Bukele policy is geared towards making things easier for them.  They should know that every innovations always have a learning curve. There will always be challenges in the early stages of its adoption or usage. That is precisely what they are passing through right now but the ability to persevere and overcome is the key. Everything cannot be achieved in one day! Thus, i humbly encourage them to bear this teething stages of this bitcoin policy of President Bukele as the end will surely justify the means. Government on its part should intensify the sensitisation and awareness of the use of the coins a a legal tender to the populace especially the middle class and low income earners.

ppjic4,abc3d1vo,Why current markets will fail and bitcoin will prevail.,"The current debt system we have in place is on the edge of of a catastrophic failure. I believe when the global financial crisis hits it will be the worst economic disaster in modern day history. When the crash happens the only option will be to adopt bitcoin and governments will be forced to come with terms with this and welcome bitcoin with open arms. That being said once bitcoin is adopted as a global currency the future will be very bright restoring the corruption that has been going on for well over century.

I don't think the banks are no longer profitable in terms of value- The fed has been giving out loans at an interest rate close to zero. This is absurd based on the fact inflation the past year is well over the skewed projection of 5%. The banks are handing out mortgages at a mere 1-2% for people to invest in a housing which acts as a hedge against the rapid inflation happening. The banks are drowning themselves in falsified wealth. This brings me back to the fact wealth/value cannot be created in terms of currency but only human capital. 

The government is handing out cash like candy on Halloween while no human capital is being outputted. Just take a stroll down any strip mall...everyone is hiring and they still cannot find employees . The fed will be forced to bring up interest rates but they know the banks cannot afford for that happen which is why we haven't seen it. They are going to drag this out till the end

Time line

Fed brings up interest rates-&gt;Market crashes/Banks fail-&gt;US Dollar Fails along with the rest of fiat-&gt;Mass Bitcoin adoption.

I'm not sure how this works, maybe somebody can enlighten me?
Question: let's say I have a Ledger hardware wallet and generate a new public key every time I purchase Bitcoin. I have, for example, 50 million Satoshis accessible through my ledger. Today I buy an additional 10 million. But I also decide to move 30 million Satoshis to another wallet. Does my ledger move funds from the oldest public keys first? So does the public key I used today when buying 10 million Satoshis still show those 10m in a blockexplorer until I move (not physically, I know there are no real bitcoins to be moved) more than 50m from my ledger to another wallet?

I'm asking because I've read Europe wants to know how much Bitcoin people have. Only my latest acquisition are fully kyc, with known public key.

2. Let's say, for the sake of discussion, that Bitcoin appreciates to $1 Million / Bitcoin.  Does MicroStrategy pivot their business model from being a business intelligence company to being something more crypto associated (ie. exchange, lender)? 
3. Does anybody have an idea how much Bitcoin MicroStrategy hodls in comparison to major exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, FTX, etc.? How much Bitcoin do you need in reserves to become an exchange at the scale of these large companies?
4. Is Michael Saylor aiming for world domination??

Ive been browsing the web and getting reaaaaaaaaal confused.,"Hey, Im completely new to bitcoin. I have been looking around and I also have been getting confused. I dont care about P2P, Blockchain-Secure360-Tumbling-Privacy-Mechanisms or whatever, and everything just confuses me.

Here is what i want:

1. I want to buy a little bit of bitcoin (around 100 dollar-ish for the start, or something like 0,0025 BTC)
2. No ID verification
3. I want to pay instantly, without having to go somewhere pay in cash and upload a receit (i have come across that many times while i was googling). Id like to use Credit Card, just it should be an instant transfer, reliable and simple to use. If there is site that accepts paypal itd be even better, but just as long as the fees arent too high.

I'm sure everyone can relate with looking to the past and saying ""I should have bought more"" or ""I should have kept my BTCs"". I owned 1.5 BTC in 2012 but I just played with it. I know there's no point ruminating about the past,  but sometimes the thoughts are still there. I hope eventually, I'll reach the 1.5 BTC point again.

Most of you will agree that BTC has much similarities to gold. But the price of gold would be somewhere else if the financial system would not have flooted gold with derivatives.
I thing through the ETFs permissioned by the SEC we might see similar derivatives for BTC which will have a harmful impact to the limited amount of bitcoin.

pqcldn,aero_kitten,I doubt Bitcoin is a real store of value,"I guess this viewpoint won't be appreciated around here, but Bitcoin and gold have little to do with each other, despite BTC's conceptual and popular ties to gold buggery. Some flawed models compare these assets to explain (and predict) Bitcoin's price growth and grace it with additional intrinsic value. I think the truth is, a lot of Bitcoin's value is based on people bidding it up. Its volatility is based on the ease with which it can be bid down. It's a speculative asset.

It's also a very interesting and promising project, but the exact future of this technology is unknown as of yet. Like some other interesting projects before it, it's created a bubble and a mythology around itself (resulting in a little cultishness too, truth be told). The story that's spun about it in enthusiast circles, along with the speculative growth of the asset, seems to have made everyone sure what the future looks like. I don't think anyone really knows though.

BTC is legal tender in El Salvador. Can we get real about that? This little country is governed by some two bit right wing politician with authoritarian tendencies. He's gung ho to gamble his country's future, but why? A reason you can easily figure out. A wealthy minority thinks they can do very well with it. The small middle class is happy to play along. But people on a subsistence income will get nothing out of being able to buy things with BTC, and they know it's not being done for them.

BTC is not remotely a store of value. Some folks are in for an awakening in the next downturn. Despite the fact that you ""learned economics"" from Mises stuff or whatever, and supposedly the dollar is on its deathbed because of conspiracy, foolishness and greed, and dystopia creeps upon us, in actually the dollar is trading strong and will be very popular in hard times because it's backed by the wealth and productivity of the United States. BTC not so much. And gold at the end of the day is golden even if traders don't send it to the moon.",1631926337,83,1

I casually mention that Bitcoin allows you to send money to anyone, anywhere, for any reason, any amount, and anytime. It was like a light bulb went on above his head and all of a sudden he saw the value of Bitcoin. After years of indifference my Boomer dad wants to buy some Bitcoin. He's still convinced there's a company or something that runs Bitcoin (I've explained decentralized miners a few times already but it doesn't seem to sink in) but it's cool that he sees the applications of the technology.

I spend some time in the precious metals community and you typically get a lot of animosity towards crypto. Plenty of those people complain about paypal holding their funds, charging extra fees, demanding info, etc. The irony is that these people who don't like Bitcoin have a problem that is solved by using Bitcoin.

I've made from my Bitcoin investment doubled what he gained from his poor financial decisions, including that 25-year-long loan.

When I confronted him about his poor advice and financial decisions. He had nothing to say but ""Yeah, it's going to crash %80 like it always does,"" to which I said, ""I really hope not, I want it to crash %95 so I can scope it all up"" The look at his face guys. Priceless.

How have we even gotten to this point? It's dumbfounding.

In the United States, the Treasury Department sells bonds to raise revenue for government spending. The banks and foreign entities (large institutions, generally) buy the bonds. The Federal Reserve pays the banks for these bonds with money from... nowhere. *In the most generous of cases, this money is justified by saying it is being drawn from the future*, since they are creating debt. 

At the local level of commercial banks, with the fractional reserve system, there is no way to put this except to say ""we are creating energy for free"". This breaks the fundamental laws of physics.    

I think in very specific cases, debt can be important. Since debt grows very quickly, it can get out of hand, but it can be important to get something moving, like getting a car moving out of a stopped position. If your community is devastated by a natural disaster, for example, it might be a good idea to take a calculated debt up to a certain point into the future to get yourself moving from zero. Charity also works in this situation, because a prospering community has benefits to the surrounding areas. But to have debt as the everyday operating system of a community makes no sense.

Hey everyone, hoping to bring some sweet value to your learning &amp; live trading starting 12 a.m. Monday (EST). Decided I can stream 4 days for you no prob. Very lax, fun environment because let's face it - the markets can get pretty boring. I'll prolly roll in some of my regular stuff like casual Texas Hold'em Poker Play, GTA Play while wearing my hot pink Chanel robber ski mask, surfing the internet &amp; commentating, making people laugh, hoping to bring a refreshing take to our community as trades unfold. I will also begin teaching from scratch Beginner all the way to Advanced.

**The gold in all of this: My win ratio stays a solid 72-90% accuracy every single session which is a bangerrrrr statistic in this community when consistent!

My Trade style is I want money in 5 minutes or less at a time as I am very easily distracted and extremeeeeeely lazy (you'll see we'll be jamming out and having fun simultaneously). I trade with pretty proper risk management no more than 5% of the account per trade (generally keep it at about 1-3% per). I've always taught people technical analysis with a big stress on naked forex charts. The system you'll see I've developed in the last pictures of my chart with full indicators is how I have it set up when I teach my beginners. You see, I've devised a way to see what I see with my eye on naked charts so I can better explain it to you all to make you independent traders with the ultimate goal being you not needing me and just wanting to join the stream to hang &amp; break bread together - Free of charge of course (we'll call it my good karma)!!! :)

My background is trading for 9 years now! I started at 16 under my mother's name and put all my money I worked for from Whataburger and Ricky's Paintball into investing. These were the days where there was very little VIABLE information on the markets so I had to learn O.G. style pre-pyramid schemes/scammers. Now I'm here to save you from that mess, disgusts me. I haven't had a ""real job"" really since unless I got bored and found a neat opportunity along the way like jobs I've taken in real estate so I can learn from the inside out then invest in that too (starting here soon). I made it all the way from Devil's Triangle El Paso, TX to now residing in Huntingdon Valley, PA. I've always taught for free and will ALWAYS teach for free, I want to see your come up the way I made mine happen and got out of a place &amp; upbringing that no one usually does. I now live extremely comfortably, I don't have a boss, I only trade a few hours in the day if that &amp; then have complete time &amp; financial freedom to do whatever I want, and have only increased my wealth during this covid time, and have helped a lot of others privately to do this as well.

Let's say I make a coin on Ethereum and it is hard capped to 21,000,000. I distribute these coins to all Ethereum wallets via airdrop.

Now we have a zero inflation coin, in a decentralized peer to peer network. On top of that since it is on Ethereum so it has native capabilities to be traded, lent, swapped without needing to be bridged somewhere.

Some answers I got before being removed were: 

* Bitcoin being mined = better than a coin I just minted.
* Bitcoin was first so it has more legitimacy.

Both of these are fixed by just the community valuing the coin instead of BTC. Like I could make a smartcontract that receives and ""burns"" BTC forever and mints the new-BTC on Ethereum. A one way street. 

I have no horse in this race, just curious.",1631563578,1,1
pnn9c5,cidadefalcao,"If you want bitcoin prices to rise, stop leaving bitcoin on exchanges.","Many people are wondering why the bitcoin price is not going up despite massive institutional buying and increased adoption.  An important reason for that is that bitcoin seems to be suffering from a similar phenomenon (although in a much lower scale at this point) that gold suffers:  The reason why gold is stagnated for years is because there are massive short positions kept by a few key players, which are ‚Äúsubsidized‚Äù by a vast amount of ‚Äúpaper gold‚Äù in the markets. With bitcoin, this happens through the exchanges. 

**People that care about the bitcoin price should stop using exchanges as wallets immediately.** It does not matter that they are safe. They can be 100% safe, insured if you would like, just like your bank deposits. Bitcoins in exchanges aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù, they are ‚Äúpaper bitcoin‚Äù.  They are a liability for the exchange and an asset for you, but a different asset than if you had the bitcoin in a personal wallet. What you have is a promise from the exchange to have that bitcoins deposited in an address you give should you request a withdraw.  Under normal circumstances, this works well. Under distress situations, it does not. What the exchange has is a promise to pay you back, but only if they can. In many instances, they will not be able to. And that‚Äôs fine, they are limited liability companies.  I am confident that the open short interest in bitcoin is substantially large, potentially much bigger than the number of existing bitcoins, or the bitcoin ""free float"".  These short positions are collateralized by bitcoins left in exchanges, regardless if the exchange mentions it explicit or not. Some exchanges are honest and mention it clearly in their terms that in the situation where their insurance fund is depleted, losses will be socialized among winning traders. Others don‚Äôt. The bitcoins that you leave in exchanges are used as collateral, explicitly or implicitly, by them to finance short positions of their clients. Even if an exchange does not allow margin trading for retail clients, they very likely do for institutional clients, which is even worse. Notice also that it does not matter if the balance of clients matches what these exchanges have in their wallets. It is practically invisible to outsiders how much institutional clients are leveraged through these exchanges, and a way of estimating or getting a sense of it must be urgently developed for a better understanding of the market. If all those keeping bitcoins at exchanges withdraw them to a private wallet, the exchanges will have to increase their margin requirements for leveraged clients (or reduce the leverage limits), which will force these clients to close their positions or buy more bitcoin. There is no other way, and this of course is good for bitcoin. If people however keep using exchanges as wallets, then we run the risk of bitcoin being constantly manipulated by players who are able to leverage short positions at levels that we cannot even assess. 

My recommendation is that those interested in higher bitcoin prices to move their bitcoin to addresses that they, and only they, have control of. This includes those likely making use of custodial services, particularly when custody is made by an exchange. It is quite ironic that many of these investors that buy bitcoin instead of gold because ‚Äúgold price is manipulated by the banks‚Äù do exactly the same gold investors do. If you buy bitcoin to leave it deposited somewhere else under a custodian,  particularly if this custodian has clients that can short bitcoin, you are very likely doing a disservice for bitcoin. Move your bitcoins immediately somewhere else, buy insurance if necessary, or leave them with a custodian that performs only custody and nothing else. The reason by the way why custodian services are usually cheaper than insurance is precisely because the custodian can profit on you (by having your precious bitcoins in custody) in other ways. 

As long as we have bitcoins being left in exchanges or in the hands of custodians that fill very much the role of the same banks that bitcoin holders aim to be disconnected from, we will have bitcoin moving sideways and fighting hard for higher price levels. 

 In the end, inevitably, bitcoin prices will grow. But this process can be much faster if each bitcoin holder takes care of its own bitcoins or leave them with true custodians, not exchanges.",1631563567,502,1

  He told me that in order to get the money we sent he has to go to the bank which has a line of over 150 people waiting to get money as well and he was not willing to wait for over 4 hours to just retrieve the cash.

 See the way it works is, if you sent money through Western Union then it goes to the central bank, then the Nicaraguan Government has to Approve that you can receive the money, if they don't, then the cash is confiscated on the spot and you have no say or ask any questions why this was done, not only do we have a pay a $50 fee to send $2,000 USD but the bank and government also charge you a fee, Not only do you have to wait inline for hours to get your cash from the bank but instead of getting Dollars Western Union give you Pesos and they pay you a lower rate than what is normally being paid in the country in the black market, IE $35 pesos per dollar, Western Union pays them $34 that is $1 peso profit for every dollar that is sent, Over time this ads to A lot of money, talk about double triple Fuck from the Government and Western Union, we pay to send the money, they get charged a fee by the bank and government and run the risk of your dollars being confiscated and on top of that western union gives them a lower rate for each dollar they receive, I told him all these fees and waste of time could be avoided if they were using Bitcoin like El Salvador is doing, he could be sitting at home on his couch watching TV while he receives the money almost free of any fees and within seconds through his phone, he was speechless..but the Nicaraguan government would never allow bitcoin this to happen, FOOK Socialist communist government, FOOK western Union and Fook the Central banks, I'm done with this RANT..FYI both my cousin and her husband are Doctors making pennies on the dollar..sorry for the grammar English is my 2nd Language but i hope my post gets the point across.",1631561794,23,1

Now I feel proud to own these digital property rights.,"It took me long enough to believe on BTC or any crypto to put my money into. So while I knew a little already, I started lurking in the sub almost daily and in parallel started reading The Bitcoin Standard. It was a very lazy and slow process for around 6 months, but I had fun learning gradually and knowing lots of opinion and also lots of crying and whining of people on this sub. But all you great people taught me a lot of things. I guess I was trying to learn from other people's mistakes and accomplishments :)
There were too many posts about 'Not your key, not your coin' every other day. So I ended up buying a hardware wallet even without having a single cent of cryptocurrency. And then I took the plunge by buying 0.1 BTC via a local exchange and transferred it to the hardware wallet. HODLing and DCAing since!
I had seen Michael Saylor's video where he describes BTC as digital property rights. To be honest, I'm really feeling great by owning these digital property rights.

pnjgvz,TombStoneFaro,Story of the first BTC remittance in El Salvador?," 

I would like to hear the story of someone who received money from USA or another country who normally would have gotten money via WU and this involved a bus trip in addition to the fees from WU.

I would bet that a bunch of little old ladies travel together by bus each month to a city, all from the same town, not only for protection but maybe it is like an outing although both time consuming and expensive and somewhat dangerous because everyone knows they will have cash on the way back.

So I would like the hear the story of the first person who stays behind because she used BTC. Such a person could result in an entire community converting.

I wonder if literally anyone in the country has received money this way yet who last month used WU -- it is possible that no one in El Salvador has ""converted"" yet. We would need a pay day, which maybe has already happened but maybe people tend to remit just once a month so maybe we have to wait for October.

Anyway, any budding journalist in El Salvador should visit such a person and get an interview, find out whether she has inspired her friends to try it.

I do see besides the obvious technology-resistance of older people often (I have noticed this in myself) the possibility that say half a dozen women from the same town take the bus to the city as a fun thing that maybe is another reason to keep doing it the old-fashioned way. But the cost of WU and bus tickets is very significant: if you save nothing, suddenly being able to save say ten bucks a month is a huge deal, it may be the only way to afford to buy an appliance on time or even invest in a small business -- essentially, BTC will be making potentially millions of microloans.

And it might not be so bad if the extra money is simply saved as BTC; if they had been doing this a decade ago (which I know was impossible) some little old ladies would literally be millionaires today.",1631552166,11,1

As prices dropped this week, option skews quickly broke into negative territory, lead by short-term and medium-term options.

Long-term options also saw skews dip, but only slightly and quickly recovered.

The long-dated option skews are telegraphing sustained market demand for upside volatility, something bullish for the price trends in the larger picture.

pni3ol,kinetic_jfig,I spent 50 hours doing DD on the 5 biggest Bitcoin Mining Stocks. Are they a better investment than Bitcoin?,"A lot of institutional funds that can't directly invest in BTC have been scooping up a series of publicly traded Bitcoin mining stocks, so I was super curious to see if they had outperformed the base asset, BTC, over the long run. 

These are all listed on the Nasdaq and are:

* RIOT
* MARA
* BITF
* HVBT
* HUT

Some of my findings:

* One of the biggest challenges of being a Bitcoin miner is that it is extremely capital intensive. As the hash rate for Bitcoin grows exponentially over long periods of time, miners constantly need to shell out cash for new and faster performing machines to keep up with their competition. Thus theoretically, an acquisition of machines for one miner is a net negative for all of its competition, as it entitles them to a larger share of the daily block reward.
* Compared to the price of Bitcoin, these stocks have done incredibly well - but it all depends on what your start point is. If you‚Äôre measuring from January 2020, they‚Äôve well outperformed the price of Bitcoin. But go further back to March 2019, and their extreme drawdowns in correlation to Bitcoin‚Äôs bear markets have actually positioned them a lot worse off (MARA was the only one that outperformed, the rest dramatically underperformed BTC price).
* HUT8 is the only one that HODL's the entirety of their BTC treasury in BTC that they mined on their own - which means if ""green"" or ""virgin"" coins end up fetching a premium (I doubt they will), this company would theoretically benefit the most from that.
* HIVE/HVBT is the only company on this list that is debt-free - almost all of these companies have diluted in order to scale and expand their businesses as they do not have positive free cash flow.
* BITF is the cheapest stock in terms of market cap versus their reported hash rate.
* After investigating these stocks and seeing their business models, it makes absolute sense to me that almost every ENERGY PRODUCTION company will eventually get into this sector. It is abundantly more profitable to mine BTC with cheap/excess energy than to sell that energy to the grid. 
* Since mining is as simple as purchasing a few computing units, hiring a few low level engineers to set them up in a well ventilated space, hash rate should continue to rise - and this method of thinking can be multiplied to many other countries outside North America with abundant capitalization and endless energy resources.

There's a lot more and I summarize it visually with some graphics and other material here:

I plan to go buying weekly when I see dips in price until i reach $1000, then I‚Äôll hold it forever and see if I become rich by 2045.

Currently I left the balance on Binance, but I understand that I probably should send it to a wallet to keep it safe but I don‚Äôt understand how wallets work, is there any good material on this subject? From what I understood a wallet is just a randomic address, but how is it ‚Äúregistered‚Äù to the blockchain so I can send funds to it?

Also, if I plan to hold it until I‚Äôm old, is it a bad idea to have a paper wallet with lots of backups around my house?

What struck me as interesting is the author cited and thanked Nick Szabo (creator of bitgold) for discussions on OpenPGP-based financial instruments.

I then did a search and found this paper from 2005:

[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-75993-5\_3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-75993-5_3)

The author identifies several key features for creating an optimal digital currency, namely, stressing digital currency should be anonymous, peer-to-peer, irreversible, etc.

I also found a link to an open-source software that the author actively created from 2002-2005/6 called ePoint, which abruptly stops development around 2006/2007,

[https://web.archive.org/web/20060614121353/http://epointsystem.org:80/](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614121353/http://epointsystem.org:80/)

[https://sourceforge.net/projects/epoint/files/epointpgp/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/epoint/files/epointpgp/)

The individual is Hungarian (based in Europe).

So in brief:

* Actively was developing a digital currency from 2002-2005/6, at which point the project stopped
* Publishes article in 2008 advocating for OpenPGB-based Instruments (and claims to be developing new technology)
* In collaboration with Nick Szabo (created bit-gold)
* Based in Europe (fits Satoshi profile)

As of late, it appears he is publishing on Bitcoin/developing for Ethereum.",1631663981,0,1

So what do you do? You buy fucking Bitcoin. Thanks to Bitcoins programmable rules and monetary policy that cannot be changed or edited, converting your $160 to BTC everyday will protect you from the bad inflation J Powell causes. But guess what‚Äôs the best part: if you buy enough it you might even become a billionaire because of how much it will appreciate.

Method 2: DCA like $300 each month into buying Bitcoin. Less stress as theres no loan to repay and flexible as well but prob need strict discipline, and likely you will be mentally torn apart: do you want Bitcoin value to rise so the fractional Bitcoin you got has risen in value but future purchases will be more expensive in fiat term, or vice versa?

pfikv3,vitor_as,"What places are there where we can learn more about Bitcoin development, especially with a focus on the Lightning Network, either here on Reddit or in general?","I am just getting into the crypto world and looking forward as many content to learn as possible. With Ethereum it seems a lot easier to find courses, books, YouTube channels and even a dedicated subreddit when it comes to software developing (r/ethdevs), but for some reason I'm struggling finding the same kind of materials that focus on Bitcoin, the Lightning Network and upper layers (Impervious and etc.). When we search about developing in the Web3, most results will be related to Ethereum.

Maybe a reason for that is because Ethereum has grown up with the discourse of being about not just finance and cryptocurrencies, but above all about a ""programmable money"". Nowadays it has established a solid foundation into the software industry with dApps and Solidity (no pun intended), and there seems to be a fairly big opportunity for jobs, even thought they might be far from being a fully polished thing yet.

On the other hand, the scalability problem about blockchains is one of, if not the major challenge today, and in my opinion this challenge seems to be increasingly better handled by Bitcoin with the Lightning Network and technologies that explores its potential to the full extent, such as Impervious. Yet, I feel like the perception of a Web3 is still strongly attached, not to say *solely* attached, to Ethereum, and therefore all I'm going to find are Solidity courses and such. 

I'm really interested to know what architectural technologies are there like IPFS, Livepeer, The Graph, Arweave and Helium, or how could these technologies interact with the Lightning Network instead of Ethereum, like described in [this article](https://multicoin.capital/2020/02/06/infinite-scale/) and [this one also](https://beta.web3index.org/blog/introducing-the-web3-index). The only use case I could find that actually addresses Bitcoin as becoming the better place to develop in the Web3 was Arcade City.

Or maybe I'm just incredibly bad at searching on the internet haha.",1630456238,4,1

Myth: You have to run your own node to use lightning or wait weeks for a Bitcoin account to be created to transact with Bitcoin

Truth: All you need is a phone and internet to get an app from the app store, you can start accepting Satoshis then and there.

- you don‚Äôt need to set up a user name
- you don‚Äôt need to reveal your name, email, birthday, address, none of that
- you don‚Äôt need to provide proof of address or prove that you are a human

You can start accepting Satoshis, and send those Satoshis out to other users, anywhere in the world. Just like that.

Where to start?
- For the simplest experience, I recommend Muun Wallet (non-custodial) or BlueWallet (custodial)
- If you want to test other wallets as well, try Phoenix Wallet
- If you have questions, ask a fellow Bitcoin sub or lightning sub Redditor

Earlier this year, after years of hesitation, I purchased my first batch satoshis and slowly began my DCAing.

Before this, I had very little hope on the outlook of my financial situation, of owning a place to live, and on life in general.

I had lost a friend to suicide after the onset of the pandemic. In mourning I turned to the bottle, became a terrible drunk, gained more weight than I'm comfortable revealing, and was terrible with my money. In short, I was the least healthy in all aspects of my life as I'd ever been before.

Something in me reminded me about Bitcoin around the time the wall street craziness started. My friend had told me ""whatever you do, just buy bitcoin"" before I cut him off after him relapsing). He knew I was pissed at him, but left me with what I know now was a nugget of wisdom in his state of chaos.

I remembered. I always had, but was too cautious and never REALLY looked into it. Something about this year changed though. 

In my terrible state of mental and physical health, I eventually became so passionate about what Bitcoin could mean, what it could do, that I basically didn't have any choice but to buy.

Today I have hope. I have better habits (in progress) and am working towards being my healthiest self again. 

Most of all, today I have Satoshis.

pfcl9k,jonesmilner,Coinmama VS Coinbase: Best Cryptocurrency Exchange Comparison," If you‚Äôre looking to get into cryptocurrency trading, the first thing you‚Äôll have to do is to get some crypto tokens. To get them, you could earn them by receiving payment in crypto for a good or service you provide. Or you could always [**buy some cryptocurrency**](https://go.coinmama.com/visit/?bta=66626&amp;brand=coinmama) using your fiat currency. There are several websites where you can do this and several payment methods. Two of the names that pop up more often when looking at sites to buy crypto tokens are Coinmama and Coinbase. In this article, we‚Äôll do a [**Coinmama vs Coinbase**](https://go.coinmama.com/visit/?bta=66626&amp;brand=coinmama) comparison so you can decide which one is more convenient for you. 

[**What is Coinbase?**](https://go.coinmama.com/visit/?bta=66626&amp;brand=coinmama)

Coinbase has been around for a while. It was founded in 2012 and is a cryptocurrency exchange service, based in San Francisco. It is one of the most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. It's a custodial exchange, which means they provide crypto wallets for all their users and all tokens bought or traded are stored in those wallets until the user transfers them to their own personal wallets.

Coinbase is popular among novice crypto traders because, unlike many other exchanges, they offer a simple, easy-to-understand, beginner-friendly user interface.

Is Coinbase safe?

Like all custodial exchanges, which store millions of dollars worth of user‚Äôs crypto assets at any given time, Coinbase is a tempting target for hackers. But they have yet to suffer any significant hacks. They have implemented several important security measures. First of all, most funds are stored in offline encrypted wallets, and those wallets are distributed among several different places. For added security, two-factor authentication (2FA) is mandatory for all users. A few months ago, Coinbase reported that they had been targeted by hackers this past June, but the security team blocked the attempt without any crypto being stolen. Almost any Coinbase review you find will speak highly of their security.

Coinbase fees

All cryptocurrency purchases and sales require you to pay a fee. This is normal for every exchange. However, figuring out your transaction fee on Coinbase can be a little confusing for beginners. This is because Coinbase fees vary according to the amount of crypto you are buying and the payment method.

For example, if you are buying 100 USD worth of Bitcoin and paying with a US bank account, the fee would be 2.99 USD. But if you are paying with a credit card, then the fee would be 3.99 USD. This takes some getting used to.

[**What is Coinmama?**](https://go.coinmama.com/visit/?bta=66626&amp;brand=coinmama)

Coinmama is a web service that allows users to buy cryptocurrency. It is registered in Slovakia and started operations in 2013. Its initial intention was to allow users to purchase bitcoin easily and quickly. Other crypto tokens were added later. However, Coinmama isn't a full crypto exchange. It allows neither trading of tokens nor withdrawing cryptocurrency into fiat currency.

Is Coinmama safe?

You might read a Coinmama review or two that state it's not as safe as other cryptocurrency exchanges because it doesn't allow for extra security features like 2-factor authentication (2FA) or e-mail authentication. While this was certainly true in the past, it is no longer the case. Currently, setting up 2FA is not only possible, but it's actually mandatory. These and other measures make Coinmama just as safe as other crypto trading platforms.

Coinmama fees

Let‚Äôs get this out of the way right now: Trading on Coinmama is more expensive than many other sites. There are two different fees in play. First, Coinmama charges a 5.9% brokerage fee, which is already applied when the site shows you its trading prices.

On top of the brokerage fee, there is also a 5% fee for credit card processing. In the end, the price you pay on Coinmama when you buy cryptocurrencies will be 10.9% above the current market price. Other exchanges are well below that.

Now that we‚Äôve met the two counterparts in this Coinmama vs Coinbase comparison, let‚Äôs put them head-to-head in different aspects and see which one will come out on top:

Coinmama VS Coinbase: Head-to-Head

Round 1: Type of service

Coinbase is a full cryptocurrency exchange that allows you to purchase crypto tokens with fiat currency, trade one kind of cryptocurrency for another, and withdraw crypto tokens into fiat currency. Purchased tokens are stored in Coinbase wallets until the user decides to transfer them into their personal wallets.

Coinmama isn't technically a cryptocurrency exchange, but rather a brokerage service. When you buy bitcoin on Coinmama, you are actually buying the token from Coinmama itself rather than from another user. While this is generally faster, brokerage services are generally more expensive than exchanges. Purchased tokens are directly deposited into the user's personal wallets. In this regard, Coinmama operates much like non-custodial exchanges such as Changelly.

What Coinmama doesn‚Äôt allow is trading crypto tokens or withdrawing crypto into fiat. The only thing you can do here is to buy cryptocurrencies with your credit card.

For offering a full range of trading services, this round goes to [Coinbase](https://go.coinmama.com/visit/?bta=66626&amp;brand=coinmama).

Round 2: Security

Both platforms currently offer similar security measures and protocols. Both will require setting up 2FA before making your first purchase. Neither service has suffered any major hacks with cryptocurrency stolen from their users.

The second round in this head-to-head is a draw.

Round 3: Payment methods

Coinmama allows you to buy cryptocurrency with credit cards or in Euro via a SEPA transfer. Coinbase offers a much wider selection. Payments on Coinbase can be made with US bank accounts, credit cards, SEPA deposits, SWIFT, PayPal, and others.

Coinmama VS Coinbase Round 3 goes to Coinbase, hands down.

Round 4: Ease of use and speed

Coinbase is famous for being easier on the novice crypto trader than many other exchanges, with a simple, easy-to-understand user interface. It is one of the more beginner-friendly exchanges out there.

But Coinmama is on a whole other level of ease. A big part of this ease of use is the fact that on Coinmama you can do one thing, and one thing only. And this one thing is presented in a way that is easy o understand and follow.

Regarding the speed of the transactions, Coinmama does have an edge on Coinbase, because of its brokerage nature. Since you are buying your cryptocurrency directly from Coinmama itself, your tokens will be sent to your wallet the instant your payment comes through. Coinbase trades are by no means slow. They‚Äôre just not quite as fast.

This round ends with a slight advantage for [Coinmama](https://go.coinmama.com/visit/?bta=66626&amp;brand=coinmama).

pfsgck,tom_Faria,What is the best way to day trade options?,"The straightforward definition ‚Äì an option is a straightforward financial derivative. This legal contract affords you the right to buy or sell an asset during or within a pre-determined date (exercise date). If you are the seller you have an obligation to meet the terms of the transaction. These will be to either sell or buy if the buyer chooses to ‚Äòexercise‚Äô the option prior to the expiration date.

Options for day trading span across numerous markets. You can get stock options, ETF options, futures options, and more. These traditional options are also known as ‚Äòvanilla options‚Äô.

&amp;#x200B;

# What Is An Options Contract?

You‚Äôll be afforded a number of rights with an options contract. Each contract should include details of the following:

* Type of option (call or put option)
* Underlying security
* The strike price (the price at which you can exercise the option)
* Unit of trade (the number of shares)
* Expiration date (the last trading day for exercising your option)

# Types

Options are often classed as complicated, risky investments, and that puts off many aspiring day traders. However, there are just two main classes of options.

* **Put ‚Äì** These selling options allow you to sell a stock at a specific price.
* **Call** ‚Äì These buying options allow you to purchase a stock at a specific price.

Setting aside the two main classes, there is a long list of different markets and options available. Although not all are suitable for day trading, the list includes:

* Stock options
* Index options
* Mini options
* Mini Index options
* Options on futures
* Weekly SPY options
* OEX options
* ETF options
* S&amp;P 500 options
* IRA accounts
* E-Mini options
* ES weekly options
* QQQ options
* Deep in-the-money (ITM) options
* Crude oil options",1630497756,1,1

So I diagnosed by testing each board to find which one is not working. And I found it. On opening the S9j, I found the faulty hashboard(1 of the 3) has detached heat sinks, almost five.

My question; is this the problem causing it not to appear on the web UI and if i reattach them back will it work?

Note all this time when its not on web UI the red light on the board was on.",1630477073,2,1

I was thinking that if we all used bitcoin, people would be less inclined to take out loans and mortgages, because when it comes to paying it back, the amount they borrowed could be worth significantly more in real terms, potentially making it difficult to pay back the loan. 

So in theory this would mean fewer people taking out loans/mortgages, therefore less demand for housing, so the prices should come down.

pgnhhg,SneakAf,A new approach of scammers on reddit,"So , I happened to come across reddit message invite .
I accepted, we exchanged a little Hi/Hello greetings . I was expecting a  scammer in the first place or a random community invite maybe , coz, thats all you get in the majority of the cases.

So after the customary greeting, the user straightway writes, and I quote ""Well, I am 42 and an independent lady and I happen to have a thing for men, but I tend to be the dominant one so I‚Äôm looking for a loyal and submissive baby to spoil, I love to explore the world 
I will pay all bills and show you love of anything you facing"".

To this , I straightaway knew someone is bullshitting , but didnt know which direction honestly.

So the user tries to build a connection by saying she is looking for honesty and what not, so I was like okay ,but how do I know who you really are. To which the user sent me an email reluctantly. 

So I thought lets see where does this bullshit go actually ,what is this fucker trying to get out of me.
So I create a new gmail ,and send a hangout invite, which got accepted, and the user starts to talk about stuff where they work, they believe in charity ,had a tough chilhood growing up ,to which I was like ,ok ,this is not as I expected it to be.
But 5 min into the conversation, I get hit by that text "" Do you invest in Bitcoin"" outta nowhere.

Now I know all the build up was upto this thing. So I reply ,no , I only invest in Ethereum, to which the user says , ok how much of Eth do you have , and I stated the amount as low as 5 dollars. Didnt receive a reply for 2 minutes, and I text the user again, ""what happened, didnt I fall into your cryto requirements"" and they stated hold on, I am doing some stuff, and then goes like do you want to invest it(I really didnt get this part).
To which I replied no, I plan on selling it.

pgn7bv,Pepticsalve,"Bitcoin isn't truly fungible, right?","Hey all - I really hope this doesn't come across as FUD, I'm a big believer in Bitcoin, I buy it, own it, and it's the only crypto I'd ever dream of owning.  But there is one thing that does worry me and that's the apparent lack of true fungibility in Bitcoin.  Are there any plans to try and solve this in the future, within the core codebase?  I know that Litecoin (sorry, I hate to mention alts) have been working on the MimbleWimble protocol, and wondering if something similar should/could/can be adapted to Bitcoin (in the same way that Litecoin was the test ground for SegWit before it got adopted into Bitcoin).

My concerns long term with Bitcoin is that from my knowledge it's pretty clear that not all coins are equal, in other words there isn't true fungibility on the network.  Certain coins can be blacklisted by exchanges, and I wonder if there will soon be ""graded Bitcoin"", where-by coins without a full audit trail or history/provenance end up trading at a discount.  I listened to a Podcast a few weeks ago with an institutional guy (can't remember his name) but he was talking about institutions only buying/dealing with block-reward Bitcoin purchased directly from miners with ""green"" credentials - in other words some sort of purity grade Bitcoin that had never moved around the network and never existed in multiple wallets etc.

I know I'm rambling a bit here, but is the lack of fungibility going to kick us in the ass later on?  I hate the idea that we all might be innocently and legally buying coins from legit exchanges like Kraken that 10 transactions ago were used for some black-market / grey-market activity (drugs, money laundering etc) and then they eventually get blacklisted as the chain-analytics gets better and better and it turns out these coins were associated with a dodgy address 10,000 blocks ago and 10 owners before us.

I'd love to hear some opinions about whether this is a concern, can it be addressed in the future (does Lightning solve this problem?).  I know people talk about Coinjoins and stuff, but then I've also heard that using Coinjoins causes a bunch of issues on exchanges, and people have to go to elaborate lengths like transferring their coins through multiple wallets just to purify them again.

Again, hope it doesn't come across as FUD, it just strikes me as the last major hurdle to overcome with Bitcoin (or does it really not matter?).",1630605800,4,1

pggzzk,RyanHugeBrain,Birthday Bitcoin,"I recently made the decision to make bitcoin my go to gift for any friend or family member on birthdays/special occasions. I feel like this is a great way to introduce Bitcoin to those whom otherwise would never take the first step, and I've always been annoyed by browsing around a department store at the last minute trying to find a unique gift that people don't already have.

Here's the simple and cheap way I am doing it, and you guys can offer suggestions for improvement.
1. Purchase a given amount in USD (recently $50 for mother's birthday) and hodl in my wallet.
2. In a small notebook, write the date of purchase, type of coin (BTC), amount of BTC purchased, amount of USD used to purchase BTC, price of BTC in USD at time of purchase, and total BTC owned. This can be used as a running ledger for future gifts from me.
3. Give a quick explantion on BTC, how to check price, the market fluctuation etc. Explain that I have it stored in my cold wallet and if they ever want me to sell, just call me up no problem. Also explain that if down the road they want to get their own wallet, I will be happy to help them get everything set up and transferred.

I feel like this is a nice intermediate step for introducing people that may feel non savvy in the tech world. There is zero risk for the receiver, and I never have to figure out unique birthday/Xmas gifts again.

Don‚Äôt project anything into it, preached by billionaires, that are simply in it for the money. Michael Saylor is one of the biggest losers of the dot com bubble, he seeks another way to gain more power, wealth and influence through the Bitcoin community.

- He lost $13.53 Billion, which was over 90% of his net worth 30 years ago.

- His company used to spend millions on marketing, yet after their Bitcoin purchases, they now spend zero.

- Michael Saylor via Twitter: *#Bitcoin days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.* (2013)

- They‚Äôre using their reserves to pay directors with Bitcoin (who will later sell, and convert it to cash), so they can avoid filing their sell orders with SEC, and the public.

- Casually talks about a ‚ÄúBitcoin boating accident‚Äù. (Other term for exit-scam/hiding funds from authorities)

- He encourages his followers to take loans to buy Bitcoin at the ATH. (It ended with Bitcoin crashing 50%)

pg7lfs,booleanlifeform,Cryptosedition,"The advent and popularization of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have brought about new ways of thinking about wealth, money and personal liberty.

The nature of most cryptocurrencies includes decentralized control (no central 'bankers'), trustless and permissionless activities, uninhibited personal financial freedom, and location neutrality.

These factors combine to allow a new, large-scale, inter-country 'feature' of cryptocurrencies, which I call ***Cryptosedition***.

What is Cryptosedition?

*In a nutshell, it is when crypto bypasses existing geo-political boundaries and allows financial transactions by individuals beyond the normal control of their overlords.*

There are 2 types of countries in which cryptosedition is occuring:

1. **Countries with very high interest rates**. Examples include Venezuela (where the 2020 inflation rate was 6500%), Zimbabwe, Lebanon, Argentina, etc.  
These countries often have dysfunctional governments and rampant ongoing devaluations of their currency. Such countries attempt to ban the use of crypto, fearing that the flows of capital that crypto allows will further restrict the ability of the governments to levy taxes and control the financial activities of its citizens.  
The emergence of an alternative store-of-value mechanism that is unable to be easily traced and is invisible to the normal banking sector strikes at the very heart of a nation's sovereignty. The advent of [sound money](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/) changes everything.  
In these countries, individuals can defy the state by owning 'magic internet tokens' which can be transacted via a mobile phone wallet. The state then needs to worry about flight risk of wealthy individuals, illegal activities from drug lords and other destabilizing effects beyond their usual control mechanisms.  
By contrast, liberal countries with stable currencies see little to fear from crypto - preferring to consider it merely an investment opportunity akin to gold or the stock market.
2. **Countries with authoritarian governments.** Examples include China, Turkey, Russia (partly). These countries do not have weak or ineffective governments, but are ruled strongly. The push-back from the ruling parties in these countries against crypto stems less from purely monetary flow concerns, and more from an unwillingness to allow citizens control of their own finances. These countries (particularly China and Russia) are in a long-term geo-political battle with 'western' cultural concepts such as democracy, libertarian values, personal freedom and free-ranging capitalism. China's CCP has recently been cracking down on [wealthy individuals](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-02/chinas-war-on-everything-turns-towards-its-own-tycoons-verrender/100341464) and [popstars](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/30/china/china-entertainment-crackdown-mic-intl-hnk/index.html) in order to prevent any individual from challenging the supremacy of the State. In this context, it is little wonder that crypto (and the freedom that it allows) is seen as a major subversive threat. Unfortunately for China, the sedition genie is out of the bag already. Chinese people will continue to invest and use crypto, regardless of ever-increasing attempts at controlling the population and tracking their every purchase.

These are the deeper meanings of cryptosedition - the backdoor, secretive, small-scale use of crypto by repressed citizens to foster an emergent class of the proletariat who are not reliant on the State for banking and trading services. Once crypto scales up fully (I'm talking Bitcoin / [Lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/) mostly here), and microtransactions are cheap and easy, then the ability of an oppressive regime to control the secondary (black) market will wither away. This has been long predicted, and is now both imminent and inevitable.

Sedition is treason. Cryptosedition is coming...",1630545557,0,1

I have taken money that is exclusively under my control in a cold wallet and moved it to another place, a less secure, but more convenient and faster to use, and which is also totally under my control, to use it whenever I feel like it.  Without asking anyone's permission, without fear of losing it because I can take many security measures, and what I find most liberating, without giving an email, a name, a phone number. 

Digital Cash. 

I really want to be able to pay for a coffee or an ice cream with Bitcoin. I just haven't had the opportunity. I haven't found the place. And it's not something I want to look for. It's something I want to find by surprise. And be happy to discover that shop that accepts bitcoin, take out my phone and pay for that coffee and my colleague's, even though I probably won't be buying anything else with bitcoin for a long time, even if I have the option.

plae7b,TheForgetfulOptimist,Institutional Pushback Hitting Close To Home,"Over the last year I've read plenty of stories of certain banks locking withdrawals to different exchanges in other areas as well as other predatory methods. Honestly these didn't hit home until recently as I've experienced first hand the backlash of trying to extract myself from the banking cartel. For years I've had perfect credit, always paid on-time, and no other strikes against me. I'm also a business owner, so hold different lines of credit for suppliers, projects, etc. Again never once in over a decade had a single issue.

Well that all changed in about the last 4 months in quite shocking fashion. Since 2020 in particular I've been withdrawing large sums of fiat (from my own personal savings, not business funds but with my personal identification) to services like Celsius to stake and earn far more than any bank account, as well as various exchanges to buy and move funds to cold storage. It started dawning on me that transfer times that once occurred in 24 hours or less began taking 4-5 days. Then started receiving notices that different applications for services being implemented as my business grows were rejected. Never once had any issues for years with anything of this sort. One service rejected simply stated ""Unfortunately, we‚Äôre unable to speak of the specifics of why your application was rejected"". They also stated they would not entertain any future applications from my identification. I've also received messages from bankers on my cell wanting to speak with me due to questionable withdraws to certain entities. All exchanges I use are well known, its not like I'm using some back alley exchange. Seriously, they need to mind their own business.

I might be paranoid on this, but this is seriously screwing with me. Have others noticed subtle (and not so subtle) pushback and deterrents from major banking entities in seemingly retaliation for removing funds from their grip?",1631234326,3,1

pl9yfj,nullama,If you're lending your Bitcoins make sure to see your deposit address with a watch-only wallet,"Let's say you setup an account with a company that pays you some interest for your Bitcoins deposited into a Savings Account or similar.

Some of them are paying 5-6% interest a year, which seems rather nice, instead of not getting any interest in your own wallet, right?.

Now, that's all good as long as you understand the risks involved and accept to take them. I invite you to do the following:

Instead of just trusting the web based interface from the company that tells you all about your transactions in your savings account, your interest earned, and all that, open that same deposit address as a watch-only wallet to really see what's going on.

You can do this easily with [Blue Wallet](https://bluewallet.io/). Install it on your phone, open it, and add a wallet by clicking on **Add now**. Click on **Import Wallet** at the bottom, and then simply paste your deposit address there. Now just wait for a few minutes until it finishes the import process.

Once it finishes, have a look at the transactions. Compare them with the transactions the company website shows you. Remember, don't trust, verify.

First, check the incoming transactions. Make sure that every deposit you've made shows up correctly in the watch-only wallet. Then, make sure that any interest paid from the company is actually deposited into your account. If that interest doesn't show up, ask yourself why.

Second, check the outgoing transactions. If you've withdrawn at any time, check if you can find these transactions. If you can't find them, ask yourself why. Then, check if there are other withdrawals that you haven't made. If that's the case, ask yourself why.

Make sure to check these things over time, to see what's really going on with your account. You don't want to be in a situation where everyone withdraws their Bitcoin at the same time and you end up with no Bitcoins at all.",1631232671,25,1

pl78r3,sunsetreunion,A report on the top-ranked QR-Code generators for Bitcoin (Beware SCAMS!),"I performed the google search ""bitcoin qr code generator"" which yielded me the following 10 results (9/9/22):

\#1

[https://www.qr-code-generator.com/solutions/bitcoin-qr-code/](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/solutions/bitcoin-qr-code/)

**Review:** Newer site, but at the time of this writing, appears to generate a legitimate QR-code based on your address, but it won't let you download the qr-code without a user account.

&amp;#x200B;

\#2

[www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/)

**Review:** *THIS SITE IS A TOTAL SCAM!*  It's been identified as such by another reddit user 7 months ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/li39mb/psa\_httpswwwbitcoinqrcodemakercom\_may\_be\_scamming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/li39mb/psa_httpswwwbitcoinqrcodemakercom_may_be_scamming/)

It's also implemented advanced address mimicking software, designed to mimic the first several characters of the Bitcoin address you input.

This same scam site appears as the #1 result of a Bing search, and the #2 result of a duckduckgo search.

&amp;#x200B;

\#3

[https://gobitcoin.io/tools/qrcode/](https://gobitcoin.io/tools/qrcode/)

This site is legitimate and has been around for a while, but does not correctly verify Bech-32 addresses and has ads cluttering the user experience.  It does however support some of the Bitcoin URI payment specification and also verifies non-Bech32 Bitcoin addresses. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#4

[https://www.budgetcoinz.com/qr-code-generator/](https://www.budgetcoinz.com/qr-code-generator/)

Appears to be legit, but doesn't perform any address check to ensure that user is entering a valid address.

&amp;#x200B;

\#5

[https://games647.github.io/BitcoinQRCode/](https://games647.github.io/BitcoinQRCode/)

Also appears legit, but also does not perform any Bitcoin address verification check.

&amp;#x200B;

\#6

[https://www.zdnet.com/article/network-of-fake-qr-code-generators-will-steal-your-bitcoin/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/network-of-fake-qr-code-generators-will-steal-your-bitcoin/)

A news story published last year documenting the bitcoin qr-code scamming problem.

&amp;#x200B;

\#7

[https://www.cwaqrgen.com/](https://www.cwaqrgen.com/)

A legit site that's been around for a while: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8fh5eo/crypto\_wallet\_address\_qr\_generator/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8fh5eo/crypto_wallet_address_qr_generator/)

All around, a decent site, but doesn't support Bitcoin address verification or the Bitcoin URI payment specification (BIP 0021).

&amp;#x200B;

\#8 and #9

A couple more news articles on QR code generators for Bitcoin

&amp;#x200B;

\#10

Wiki page on QR code generating for Bitcoin.

[https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/QR\_Code\_Generator](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/QR_Code_Generator)

&amp;#x200B;

Now the above analysis was only done for Google results.  If you search on duckduckgo or bing, the results are even worse, with numerous scams charting the top results.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple years ago, a couple friends and I built a legitimate site specifically tailored to Bitcoin to address this problem:

[https://qrcode4bitcoin.com/](https://qrcode4bitcoin.com/)

but it still has no SEO ranking.

&amp;#x200B;

We announced it on reddit and it was well received:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/c0odsw/we\_built\_an\_adfree\_scamfree\_bitcoin\_qr\_code/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/c0odsw/we_built_an_adfree_scamfree_bitcoin_qr_code/)

The site we created is (as far as I'm aware) still the most capable and secure Bitcoin QR code generator on the internet.  It also operates without any ads or monitoring of users and the source code is transparent.

&amp;#x200B;

What confuses me is why the site we built remains such an utter failure (in terms of search engine rankings) and why websites that are total scams continue to top the charts despite many news outlets continuing to report on this very problem.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In his speech, the President directed the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. Companies could face thousands of dollars in fines per employee if they don't comply. 

Basically, the employer gets fined every week they have unvaccinated employees on the payroll. In other words, if you don't get the jab, you get fired.

2. Being robbed: when these people take the bus to the city, people know they are going to pick up money
3. The sender having to go to a WU office (maybe they can do a bank transfer but that costs money)
4. WU can take 3 days (wow)

So I wonder if the 400 million is only WU fees and it does not take into account the what seems like substantial expenses besides these fees? How much is using btc costing? Do people use Lightning typically? If they only used btc without Lightning, are fees very high nowadays?

A sort of cynical point is, the receiver being robbed does not mean the money leaves the country but it is obviously a huge incentive for the receiver to use btc rather than WU.",1631213025,27,1

This is my read about all this:

Our dear Christine is worried about inflation in the EU (currently sitting around 3% YoY). Statistics don't show it (yet) to be as high as in the US, but everyone knows official inflation and real inflation are two different things, and with the current levels of interest rates, together with the current debt/GDP ratios , there is no monetary policy left to do. 

What can happen?

Option ""Christine saved by the bell"": 

1. They successfully reduce the QE pace. 
2. With the slower increase of money supply, they achieve their 2% inflation goal over the long term (no one said anything about the short term? Did they forget?). 
3. Markets have confidence in the economic outlook of the EU and take over that demand of bonds that the ECB is currently purchasing, so that governments can continue with what they already budgeted for
4. New bond owners like it to have a zero or close to zero nominal interest rate (real negative yield), because of whatever inexplicable reason
5. Due to the above-mentioned point, the ECB does not have to increase interest rates, for the bonds to be placed in the market
6. Since interest rates don't increase, Europeans (people, companies, and governments) can still fulfill their interest payments on the already acquired debt obligations (only the government debt, without corporations or individuals, is over 90% over GDP in the EU), so the debt bubble does not pop, but indeed continues growing, because the cost of money remains zero

There are multiple other options, by which Christine's plan fails: either the plan fails in point 2 (a sharp increase of inflation obliges to cut QE and reduce money supply), or it fails in point 3, or it fails in point 4, or in 5, or in 6. 

I tend to see many aspects of life as a decision tree: possible outcomes, and probability of happening. Based on that, you set your expectations. I do really think that all 6 points of Christine's plan, together, don't have more than 5-10% chance of happening. 

I believe it is inevitable that we will see higher-than-expected inflation across the board (so, for starters, less purchasing power for people like you and me). That will induce Central Banks to further reduce QE and money supply, so interest rates will rise. With that rise, we can see the debt bubble popping (either at a global level, or at an industry level like in 2008, or at a personal or local level). None of this outcomes is positive for the real people, quite on the contrary. 

Despite the fact that I'm already sorry for all of us who will suffer from this (many will be severely affected), I see no reason why this would not be a catalyst for further BTC adoption: first people, and then companies, will want to have (to own!) the only sound money

Right, so late this afternoon I sent BTC to a saved address for one of the centralised wallets I use. The split is mine to know, as are mnemonic phrases for my private wallets. Pros and cons of both, so I balance accordingly.

Long story short, it wasn‚Äôt the right address. It also did look completely foreign either which is a huge source of frustration. I‚Äôve reached out to the exchange and block explorers, even the mining pool of that block. 

Not to do what I am well aware cannot be done. No sob, no pity shite, just a very simple inquiry. Not surprisingly, hands were washed and dried without answering the question, just responding as if I was unaware of the unique properties of BTC. 

So, as BTC is neither anonymous or untraceable as XRM is, I only want to know if one can leave a small amount of information somewhere for that address. What they decide is 100% ok with me. I lost the right to that BTC regardless of intent or motive.

So, apart from Recklessness and having decided me and BTC long term, this was and is unnecessary from where I sit typing. You cannot ridicule me anymore than I‚Äôve done before you read this, or not.

To do so, we first provide a basic understanding of money: what money is, its importance, the process by which a good becomes money, the necessary characteristics for it to do so, and the main types of money that have historically existed.

Afterwards, we briefly describe Bitcoin and proceed to answer the core question of this post on whether it can be considered money or not.

# Exchange and Money

## Barter

Barter is the simplest form of exchange; it refers to the transfer of a good or service for another good or service. For this reason, it is typically considered direct exchange since no third object partakes of the transaction.

Barter requires cooperation between individuals and double coincidence of wants, i.e., that both parties have and are willing to exchange the good or service that the other party desires for the good or service that the other party possesses. Therefore, this form of exchange involves high transaction costs due to the opportunity cost incurred in finding an individual with whom to make the barter.

## Indirect Exchange and money

These high transaction costs involved in the bartering process led to the emergence and prevalence of indirect exchange, i.e., a type of exchange in which a good or service is exchanged for a more widely acceptable item, which can be subsequently used to exchange for the goods or services desired. Therefore, for indirect exchange to occur, acquired goods must be more marketable than those surrendered. As the greater the marketability of a good, the more it will facilitate the final objective: the acquisition of the desired good or service.

In this way, in indirect exchange systems, the most marketable goods became a media of exchange, i.e., widely accepted. At the same time, as these goods became more widely accepted they further increased their marketability, bolstering their position as a medium of exchange. And, in turn, displaced those goods with lower marketability as means of exchange. Thus, leading to an inevitable scenario in which only a single good was universally employed as a medium of exchange: money.

## Functions of money and their development

Therefore, we can define money as a **generally accepted medium of exchange**. Nonetheless, in several definitions of money, two secondary functions are attributed to it:

1. **Store of value:** It allows to transmit value through time and space.
2. **Unit of account:** It permits the valuation of goods and services.

Notwithstanding, for a good to become money, it is not necessary that it initially fulfills all the above functions. Indeed, goods are converted into money through a process by which they usually acquire some of these functions first, and then others are subsequently developed.  In addition, the acquisition of new functions establishes synergies with the previous ones, reinforcing and consolidating their position.

For example, as the practice of using a good as a medium of exchange becomes widespread, people begin to hold it in preference to others, thus developing its function as a store of value and reinforcing its function as a medium of exchange. As a result, acceptability becomes more widespread leading economic agents to set prices using this good as a reference, thereby becoming a unit of account.

On the other hand, for a good whose value is relatively stable, there will be economic agents interested in buying it not to satisfy their most direct needs, but to maintain their future purchasing power. In this way, it will be accepted by a growing number of agents and, therefore, become a medium of exchange. And, thus, economic agents begin to treat it as a unit of account.

## Properties of money

Nevertheless, for money to fulfill the above functions, it must meet various characteristic requirements:

1. **Portability:** It must be possible to transport or accumulate a large amount of value in a small amount of space, thereby facilitating transferability and hoarding.
2. **Divisibility:** Money should be divisible into different units to enable precise pricing and facilitate transactions.
3. **Uniformity:** It must be easy to identify units of money having the same value, enabling the counterparty receiving the money to promptly discern its value. Thus, facilitating its transferability.
4. **Durability:** It must remain intact over time without physically degrading or disappearing, therefore favoring its hoarding.

## Types of Money

This subsection is merely for informational purposes and is not relevant for the understanding of the later sections of the post. Readers who wish to do so may omit it by jumping to the **Cryptography as a means of privacy and the emergence of Bitcoin** section.

Throughout history, money has taken many forms. Although today fiat money is the norm, commodity money characterized much of earlier history.

## Commodity money

Commodity money refers to real units of a specific commodity universally accepted as a counterpart for goods and services. Accordingly, commodity money has intrinsic value. Historically, a myriad of commodities has served at one time or another as a medium of exchange: animal skins, salt, barley, tea, gold, silver, tobacco, etc.

As economies became more complex, increasing the number of payments, commodity money became cumbersome. The quality of the metals was continually tested to ensure that they had not been tampered with or that they were not of a lower grade than assumed. On the other hand, agricultural products were relatively difficult to transport compared to metals because of their lower unit value. For this reason, two alternatives emerged that sought to solve these problems: coinage and representative money.

Coinage was a revolutionary invention that changed people's way of thought. Coinage seems to have first occurred in the Kingdom of Lydia around 600 BC when the first electrum coins were minted, a natural alloy of gold and silver. (recent findings suggest that coinage may have originated in China a few years earlier, near Guanzhuang in Henan province). Consequently, metallic coins are a type of commodity money, which is highly transportable and divisible. Moreover, minted coins contained a mark that guaranteed their weight and purity, i.e., their value, thus solving the uniformity problem that untreated metals faced.

## Representative money

Representative money is money whose value does not derive from the value of the material it is made of, but from what it represents, since each monetary unit is supposed to represent a fixed quantity of something that has real value.

Some scholars have suggested that this form of money pre-dates coinage. In the ancient empires of Babylon, Egypt, China, and India temples, and palaces were considered inviolable, the former due to religious reasons and the latter due to the heavy protection they possessed. Therefore, they became safe places to store precious goods. Depositors received a certificate attesting deposits, which was a claim to the deposited goods. These certificates have been associated with multiple objects which were used in international trade, such as glazed scarabs in Egypt and cylindrical seals in Babylon and India. For this reason, these certificates are believed to have been used as a means of payment. Furthermore, due to the implementation of the gold standard, representative money occupied a central role during the 20th century.

## Fiat money

Fiat money refers to money that has no intrinsic value and does not represent anything of intrinsic value. Public trust in both the issuer and the money itself is what drives its value. Such trust can be attributed, in most cases, to the confidence in the future stability of money's purchasing power.

Some authors have defined state-issued fiat money more critically as credit reimbursable for the payment of future tax obligations. And, therefore, associating fiat money as a way of using a government's liabilities as a store of value.

In 1971, following the end of the Bretton Woods agreement, we find the emergence of modern fiat money. Nevertheless, in the fifth century B.C in Carthage, we already find one of the earliest known forms of widespread use of fiat money. This money was a small piece of leather sealed by the state, which enveloped a mysterious substance that nobody knew its composition except the maker. Only by breaking the seal, its composition could be known. However, in the presence of this event, this money was considered worthless.

Recent studies have speculated that the mysterious substance was, in fact, tin or a compound of copper and tin and that the wrapping of this compound was not leather, but parchment.

# Cryptography as a means of privacy and the emergence of Bitcoin

In the early '90s, a movement called cypherpunk emerged. It was a libertarian-minded group that wanted to promote cryptography as a means of consolidating and increasing freedom. Cypherpunks published two documents setting forth their goals and ideals: [The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/crypto/cypherpunks/may-crypto-manifesto.html) and [A Cypherpunk‚Äôs Manifesto](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/cypherpunk-manifesto.txt). In them, they promoted cryptography to increase privacy and anonymity and decentralized software to make their censorship more difficult.

In 1998 Nick Szabo and Wei Dai independently envisioned how these ideas could be applied to money, referring to them as [b-money](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt) and [Bit gold](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-property-titles/), respectively. For this purpose, they both envisioned a scheme in which balances were stored in a distributed database, and the creation of money was done through the solution of a problem, whose solution is easy to verify.

In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper titled: [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). In this paper, Nakamoto combined several previous inventions to create a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash.

At the beginning of 2009, Nakamoto started the peer-to-peer network. Moreover, he released the Bitcoin source code and compiled binaries on Sourceforge.

## A concise overview of how bitcoin works

Each time a transaction occurs, the network records the Bitcoin address of the receiver and sender together with the amount transferred. This information is entered into the end of a ledger, called the **blockchain**. The blockchain is updated about every 10 minutes, and it is sent to every full node (computers connected to the Bitcoin network that verify all of the rules of Bitcoin).

Every transaction is encrypted with public-key cryptography and is verified by **miners**, computers connected to the Bitcoin network that secure the blockchain. The main objective of the miners is to fix the transaction history and prevent transaction fraud. This is done by solving a computer-intensive process by which individuals involved are rewarded with newly minted bitcoins.

Moreover, rewards given to miners are not always the same, yet they decline geometrically, with a 50% reduction every 210,000 blocks. This pattern was established because it approximates the rate at which gold is extracted.

## Is Bitcoin money?

Bitcoin meets all the necessary characteristics required to fulfill the functions that we previously stated that money must accomplish. As a digital asset, it is extensively portable, being its transferability and accumulation easy. In addition, it is deeply divisible: one bitcoin can be divided into 100 million units, commonly known as satoshis.  Likewise, the digital nature of bitcoins makes them uniform and durable.

However, the fact that it meets the necessary characteristics to fulfill the functions of money does not imply that it fulfills them. Consequently, before we can say whether bitcoin is money or not, we must first analyze whether it fulfills these functions: (1) generally accepted medium of exchange, (2) store of value, and (3) unit of account.

1. **Generally accepted medium of exchange**: As of today, Bitcoin is not a generalized medium of exchange. We cannot go to the bakery next to our house and buy bread with it, nor can we go to a car dealership and buy a car with it.
2. **Store of value:** Bitcoin has historically had severe price volatility, which is not favoring its function as a store of value.
3. **Unit of account:** The limited adoption of bitcoin as a means of payment and its price volatility do not foster its use as a unit of account.

Thus, we can say that **bitcoin currently cannot be considered money**. Notwithstanding this, given the attractive properties of bitcoin, we might ask ourselves a slightly more complex question: is bitcoin in the process of becoming money?

## Is bitcoin in the process of becoming money?

In the beginning, Bitcoin had a highly volatile price, as it was a new, virtually unknown asset that very few people owned. Nevertheless, Bitcoin was an asset with quite appealing monetary properties, coupled with a decentralized scheme and a finite money supply.

These properties led more and more economic agents to believe that bitcoin could become a future store of value and, thus, decided to acquire and hold bitcoin. Likewise, the growing demand for bitcoin led to an increase in its popularity, which drove more economic agents to reach this reasoning, thereby generating a virtuous circle.

This process led to a decrease in the downside volatility of Bitcoin, as can be seen in Figure 1, rendering Bitcoin more attractive as a future store of value.  And, thus, attracted new investors such as Tesla, which announced a $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase in the 10K, issued on February 8, 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1. Bitcoin Downside Risk](https://preview.redd.it/2k1l9v368nm71.png?width=950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24f2cb24b3d8250e05d8bed60367d3279b1be33a)

Consequently, the adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value is becoming more and more widespread. Once a store of value is well established enough, i.e., many agents understand that this asset is a good store of value, they can start to demand it against the sale of their goods.

Despite this, not many companies do offer their goods or services in exchange for Bitcoin. However, if the popularity and the trend towards increased Bitcoin price stability are not affected mid-term, an increasing number of agents will accept Bitcoin as a means of payment.

Finally, if Bitcoin's function as a medium of exchange were to develop, it would increase its popularity and at the same time solidify its position as a store of value. Enabling future economic agents to start accounting with bitcoin, i.e., opening the possibility of development to the function of unit of account.

Therefore, **we cannot say that bitcoin is in the process of becoming money, but we can say that Bitcoin is currently in the process of becoming a store of value**. That said, whether such a function is widely recognized depends on the maintenance of the trend in which it is now present: further decrease in its downward volatility without giving up its current popularity. Moreover, the development of other functions as a generalized medium of exchange and unit of account is still a long way off and is conditional on the soundness of the development of the store of value function. In addition, **even if at some point the store of value function is fully developed, the development of other functions will still remain highly uncertain.**

Figure 2 summarizes the process by which Bitcoin could obtain the functions of money and thus become money. Take into account that this figure is an abstraction and does not consider various factors that could influence this process, such as external shocks that could have adverse effects and the time that each transition could take.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 2. Bitcoin Monetization Process](https://preview.redd.it/p7nxmm048nm71.jpg?width=1087&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77145141af65085302d6f692f562fe4878cb7b6c)

Recently, Taleb has argued that Bitcoin can never be a store of value, since its fundamental value is 0. In the next subsection we address this criticism.

## Against Taleb's argument of Bitcoin's impossibility to become a store of value

In the summer of 2021, Nassim Taleb published a short article entitled [Bitcoin, currencies, and fragility](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14697688.2021.1952702), in which one of his arguments is that the value of Bitcoin is exactly 0 and, therefore, Bitcoin cannot be a store of value.

To argue this, Taleb relies on the premise that the fundamental value of any asset is equal to the sum of the present value of its expected future cash flows together with the terminal value that the asset will have.

Therefore, as bitcoin does not generate cash flows, i.e., the mere fact of owning bitcoin as such does not result in monetary payments, meaning that the value of bitcoin only depends on its terminal value.

Additionally, according to Taleb, Bitcoin is a technology. Therefore, Bitcoin, like any other technology, will eventually be replaced by another. As a result, its terminal value will be 0. Consequently, Taleb argues that since its fundamental value is 0, Bitcoin will not become money.

Nevertheless, in this argument, Taleb avoids two important points: (1) humans are not completely rational, and (2) Bitcoin is in the process of becoming a store of value as we saw in the previous subsection. Taleb may be right, bitcoin may not yet be a store of value as such. But, this does not imply that it cannot become one, as we have seen in the previous subsection.

The reason behind this is irrationality in the early stages of Bitcoin, at that time it could be valid to say that Bitcoin had a value of 0. Nevertheless, multiple economic agents were attracted by it, which, as we have seen in the previous section, led to the start of the development of Bitcoin's store of value function. As a result, many economic agents already consider Bitcoin as a store of value, while others expect it to become one in the near future.

Such a fact is critical since assets that act as a store of value provide the holder with a service: the transfer of value in space and time. Consequently, as Bitcoin is in the process of developing its store-of-value function, this implies that the expected flows of bitcoin are no longer zero, but the implicit value of this service. Therefore, Bitcoin's fundamental value should be greater than 0.

Therefore, in the case of Bitcoin, we face an instance in which a collective irrationality has endowed this asset with a value that a priori it should not have. Nevertheless, as part of this process, the store of value property has begun to develop, which justifies that this asset has value, and, at the same time, this value allows it to act as a store of value.

# Key Takeaways

* Money can be defined as a generally accepted medium of exchange.
* Ideally, money should also act as a store of value and a unit of account.
* Thus money has three main functions: (1) generally accepted medium of exchange, (2) store of value, (3) unit of account.
* A good becomes money through a process by which it usually acquires some of these functions first, and then others are subsequently developed.
* Not all goods can become money. They must meet specific characteristics to fulfill these functions: (1) Portability, (2) Divisibility, (3) Uniformity, and (4) Durability.
* Bitcoin was born in 2008 as a revolutionary means of payment since it was decentralized and pseudo-anonymous.
* Bitcoin has a known and finite monetary supply. Furthermore, it meets all the specific characteristics that money should fulfill: it is portable, divisible, uniform, and durable.
* Bitcoin does not currently serve any of the functions that money should have: it is not used as a general means of payment, price volatility does not favor it as a store of value, and because of the preceding points, it is not used as a unit of account.
* Therefore, Bitcoin cannot currently be considered money.
* Despite this, Bitcoin is in the process of becoming a store of value, due to a downward trend in its volatility that has led more and more economic agents to believe that its conversion to a store of value is possible in the near future and, in turn, has solidified its position.
* The beginning of the development of Bitcoin as a store of value arises from an irrationality of origin.
* If the current trend is not affected by external shocks, Bitcoin is likely to become a store of value in the near future.

plgqek,charles_goforth,Addressing the issues faced during launch,"During our launch, a few issues were faced once the Start Block was verified on respective chains. The team and developers would like to take this opportunity to address these issues, as well as the measures that were taken to resolve these issues.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Users were not able to Stake and Withdraw on the website‚Äôs frontend

&amp;#x200B;

When users were not able to stake and withdraw their tokens on our websites frontend, we immediately dived down into our codes to figure out the issue.

&amp;#x200B;

The library that was used to handle big number values was converting large values into exponential form. (Example : 1000000000000000000 was converted to 1e18.)

&amp;#x200B;

The smart contracts don‚Äôt expect values in exponential form. Therefore an error was thrown while staking and withdrawing.

&amp;#x200B;

Do note that you can deposit and withdraw using block explorers of respective chains, BSC and Polygon.

&amp;#x200B;

Solution ‚Äî We changed the library for handling big numbers to Bignumber.js

&amp;#x200B;

2. Incorrect Value was displayed on TVL, Total staked liquidity and a User‚Äôs Stake

&amp;#x200B;

On polygon, USDC was used to calculate TVL, Total staked liquidity, as well as a user‚Äôs staked value. USDC on polygon is a 6 decimal token, while the common decimal values for a token is 18 decimals. As such, due this miscalculation, the valuations across TVL, Total staked liquidity and User‚Äôs Stake was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Solution ‚Äî Used different decimals for each token to get it fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

We acknowledge our mistakes and apologise for any inconvenience caused.

&amp;#x200B;

The team is currently working hard to address these issues, as well as Wallet Connectivity and the integration of Trust Wallet!

A couple of weeks ago, I started studying at the 3D graphics course from the [Isaev Workshop](https://www.instagram.com/isaevworkshop/) \- Motion Design V3. 0.The purpose of this course is to go through all the stages of creating a motion-style commercial and make a full-fledged work for my portfolio.

At the first stage, I received a technical task ‚Äî to create a cool motion video on the topic I chose. I took ""Bitcoin""as the topic. Why Bitcoin? I'll tell you more now‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

[My symbol of freedom](https://preview.redd.it/0ya2swoztmm71.jpg?width=1140&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc881a4ee1b31425f30fef0c8a92cbf558c6087d)

# A little background

Most recently, I worked for hire 2/2 at a job that has nothing to do with design. And in my free time, I studied motion design using tutorials from YouTube, made small orders from Yandex. design services ‚Äî but all this brought only pennies.

One fine evening, a friend calls me, whom I haven't seen for a long time... We met and she told me about a project where you can get passive income. This project is connected with investing in cryptocurrency, she spoke about the opportunities that it gives and outlined the development prospects in colors. At that moment, I immediately cut off this idea, referring to the fact that I now have absolutely no free money to invest.

But this idea stuck in my head, as it echoed my thoughts about investing ‚Äî I understood that this was the only way to get out of this squirrel wheel in which I was. I started looking for relevant information about this project in particular. I reviewed a lot of different videos on this topic and most of all I liked how [Vladimir Ruzanov](https://www.youtube.com/c/RuzanovLIVE) talks about ways to get passive income, I felt confidence in him personally, as he talked about everything without ""rose-colored glasses"", talked about all the pros and cons, about risks and new opportunities.

I found a detailed analysis of many projects on his channel and chose a couple of them for myself. I began to buy cryptocurrency a little every month and invest. He talked about new opportunities to colleagues, friends and relatives. Many listened with disbelief, someone was interested, and someone began to do the same as me ‚Äî in particular, my family members, to whom I told the most about the new (for me) world of cryptocurrencies.

In general, I left my hired job and now I can only do what my heart is for-I study motion design, because I can just live on the interest from investments. For me, Bitcoin is a symbol of new opportunities and financial freedom that investing in cryptocurrency gives.

# I'm making a fan video on the topic ""Bitcoin""

The creation of the video begins art direction to work out the idea and style of the future video. Then there is previsualization and blocking, so that you can roughly understand how good the idea is in dynamics. And then the content, the implementation of the style and modeling. Then materials, lighting, effects, compositing.

Working through the idea, I associatively chose the key images for the video series:

1. the actual coin (as bitcoin is often symbolically depicted)
2. a bull + a bear (in stock exchange slang, traders trying to make money on the growth of the market are ""bulls"" and on the fall ‚Äî ""bears"")
3. rocket (often used as an illustration of the rise in the price of an asset)
4. mask Anonymous (anonymity of crypto transactions)
5. cubes in motion (blockchain and everything related to it)
6. a statue of Elon Musk that will break (why is he? - this is a reference to market manipulators - Ilon's tweets first influenced the growth of the BTC price, and then its sharp collapse by 60% - May 19, 2021 )

[Preliminary visualization of one of the scenes](https://i.redd.it/4zr5okyrtmm71.gif)

Previsualization or blocking

At this stage, it was important to make all the scenes from primitives and animate them and the camera movement in each scene in order to understand and see the future dynamics in the video. Special attention had to be paid to the movement of objects and the camera in the frame, to work out the composition.

To make everything look good, it was important not to allow pauses in the movement of objects and the camera, so that there was no drawdown in dynamics. Also, think about transitions from one scene to another, this is done by moving objects, adjusting the speed of movement. It is important to follow the viewer's gaze-to direct it so that one scene seamlessly connects with another. To achieve this effect, the editing transition is made at the peak of the object's speed in the frame, if this movement is at the end of the frame, the object should continue moving with the same acceleration in the next frame.

The dynamics of movement in the frame should correspond to the music track, the change of scenes occurs mainly under the beats in the music, it is good when the speed of movement of objects changes with a change in the tempo of the music.

&amp;#x200B;

[Working with on](https://i.redd.it/d59t4cebumm71.gif)

# Working with assets

An asset is a set of resources that you can use in your project, in this case, 3d models.

The current stage of work on the project consists in introducing 3d models into scenes instead of previously animated primitives, simulations are also being worked out, if they are in the project.

In the process of searching for suitable assets, we had to work hard to find high-quality models that will be combined with each other, forming a stylistic unity. For example, I have been looking for a bear model for a long time, which would be combined in style with a bull.

When working on animation, there were difficulties in working out, I set up graphs of the speed of movement of objects for a long time, I did not like a lot of things as it turns out. Of course, when the blocks from the primitives were replaced, it became much more interesting for me myself, as everything began to come to life and approach the final form. I applied the selected color scheme to the objects so that the overall color and how everything fits together were visible.

In the video, in addition to 3d graphics, there will also be fragments of the footage integrated into the scenes. When cutting out objects from the video, we had to manually modify the sections at the edges so that they would not ""shake"", since automatic tools were not ideal, the option with neural network processing showed even worse results.

At the next stage, I will already work with textures and set the light in the scenes, adjust the visualization. Work on the video continues, I will keep you informed of events.",1631260938,0,1

I know that 0.10$ isn't really that high compared the usual bitcoin on-chain fees, but surely this can't be an actual solution for micro transactions right? I mean especially poor people can't afford these kinds of fees, and other altcoins have cheaper fees on layer 1 than bitcoin does on layer 2.

Why are the fees so high?

And couldn't someone ""game"" the system by just sending repeatedly 3$ for 10 times to pay only 10 sats for 30$? I don't really understand why the fee gets so high once you send a little more?",1631257642,34,1

Coinbase pro charges only 0.5% fee, which seems reasonable, however recently I noticed that Robinhood also offers Bitcoins without fee (But don't know their price is good or not).

So in the past week, I tried multiple times that I open both Robinhood and Coinbase Pro on web browsers, and purchase $1000 BTC on both websites simultaneously. I choose market price, $1000 on Robinhood, and $995.02 on Coinbase Pro (plus $4.98 fee to get $1000).

Interesting, I found that the price (including the fee) at Coinbase Pro is \~0.5%-1% higher than Robinhood (Given Coinbase Pro fee is 0.5%, this mean Coinbase Pro pre-fee price is still higher than Robinhood?). I only tested a few times in the past week, so cannot guarantee this is always true, nor did I test the selling price.

**Given the observation, I want to ask if there is another platform that offers even better price? Or should I just switch to Robinhood.**

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear:

\- I know ppl here care a lot about owning the key/wallet, but I don't care that much. In fact I don't even want to have it, and I would prefer my bitcoin is fully managed by a credible company (Big enough ones like these public companies, PayPal, Square, Coinbase, Robinhood, etc.).

\- I know ppl hates Robinhood for their standing during $GME things early this year. I don't care that much, and I only care about if I can make most money.

\- I found Coinbase Pro is not quite user friendly: E.g. they don't have emails for each transaction, and their transactions history only tells you how many coins you bought in each transaction, but not how much you spent in each transaction, so it's so hard to track transactions.",1631251506,34,1

Proof of History (PoH) paired with Proof of Stake (PoS) claim to allow for the fastest transaction speeds while simultaneously providing security.

[Solana White Paper](https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf)

I tried to read Solana‚Äôs White paper and it does not make sense. How can transactions not be calculated and confirmed in order if sequential SHA256 hashes are required to build the immutable blockchain? How can anyone say their is a scientific manor in which transactions can be confirmed, hashed, added to a block, added to the blockchain, confirmed by others, made immutable by being stored on a consensus of nodes, and allow for users to feel that their transaction is secure. 

The white papers written overall and reads like someone is rambling at me. 

If you search Proof of History the first result is a 2017 article from medium.com relating Solana to Libra. 

Is there something I am missing here as SOL currently has a market cap of over $56 billion?",1631246369,9,1

Living in today‚Äôs word is quite different than growing up in the 80s. For example you can find a job by picking up your phone and possibly be at work within the same day or even hours. If you want to know where a friend or loved one is you do not have to go looking for them or wait until you know they are going to be home you can simply look at their location, and if you need to talk to them you don‚Äôt have to go through an operator you can simply just call or text them. Today the amount of work abundance and money making opportunities is honestly quite incredible. But what about money, there was no e-currency or tokens or crypto back then, heck the only thing there was were stocks, gold and money. As time went on we started seeing the internet come out and with that is when the e-currencies started being developed like PayPal and such. Now we are developing into a time where your cash is starting to become annoying and the governance of a currency is becoming more widespread known as fraud money. My point is that over a period of only 40 years or so, we have evolved passed using certain pieces of technologies and other every day items that at the time we thought we would never be able to live without, but as time went on these objects became obsolete and other newer, more efficient objects are now the new normal.

pm68em,DetroitMotorShow,Setting the record straight on the Gravel Institute FUD: Sen. Mike Gravel had long disowned his own twitter account. It is run by a bunch of teenage kids who are spreading lies and propaganda. Disgraceful [included: Video of Sen. Gravel disowning the Twitter account],"There is a new FUD hit piece going on around BTC, spread by an account posing as ""Gravel Institute"". The hit piece is just old regurgitated talking points that have been debunked a thousand times over and have been doing the rounds since 2011 alteast - No government backing, only used by drug dealers, too volatile, no one uses it etc.

The funny thing is that the account spreading these attacks is the account of Sen. Gravel, now named as ""Gravel Institute"". This Institute was apparently founded by Sen. Mike Gravel in his last days in 2019, when Sen. Gravel was 89 years old, by those same teenagers who ran his 2020 Presidential Campaign. Safe to say that at 89 years old, Sen. Gravel didnt have much to do with this so called Gravel Institute. Even wikipedia says that ""The Gravel Institute is mainly run by Henry Williams, David Oks, and Henry Magowan, the teenagers who ran Gravel's 2020 presidential campaign.  Gravel himself, who was 90 years old when the institute launched, was not involved in day-to-day operations but served as a consultant and provided advice.""

However, there is more.. even before Sen. Gravel's passing away, his twitter accounts has been spreading propaganda and lies, and someone managed to directly ask Sen. Gravel about the content posted by his own account. 

Sen. Gravel's account tweeted that ""Americans should hang their head in shame"" regarding abandonment of Kurds. When asked about it, Sen. Gravel said that no, he does not think Americans should hang their head in shame. Finally when put to him that his own account tweeted this, he then categorically disowned this account. He said ""This quote appears to come from me, but doesnt come from me in this regard. And the fact that these teenage kids have views that are not vetted by years of experience is self evident""

While Gravel was more forgiving towards these kids attitude (even though, right at that time, the actions of these kids using Senator's account to spread their narrative amounted to nothing but elder abuse), the fact that these kids still continue to use Sen. Gravel's account post his death, to spread lies and propaganda on issues that Sen. Gravel really had no opinion on, is nothing but stealing his identity for their own selfish interest. These bunch of nothing kids have no right to use Senator's name to spread their own propaganda. Its actually shameful and a damn disgrace that they spread such lies by using the name of a well regarded Senator. 

[Video of Mike Gravel disagreeing with his Twitter account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5kINNkXqqc)

Imo this whole account should be shut down, as it is nothing but identity theft and it is evident that Senator had distanced himself from the account. The ones running it dont have any experience in real issues (in Senator's own words) and they have been only a brief part of Senator's career. The persons behind the account - David Oks and Henry Williams - only got in touch with Senator Mike Gravel in 2019, when he was 89 years old! David was a high school senior at that time, and Henry was a college freshman.  By every sense, they were too inexperienced and unaware of Senator Gravel's views on a lot of important issues. They entered Senator's life when he was 89 years old! It would be totally different if the account was run by his family or someone who has worked many years with Senator Gravel.

During Sen. Gravel's campaign, this twitter account took to posting personal attacks on other 2020 contenders. This is from the Wiki page of Gravel's 2020 campaign:

&gt;His Twitter account was run by Oks and Williams who became the campaign manager and chief of staff, respectively. They posted attacks on other Democratic presidential candidates and potential candidates Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, and Beto O'Rourke while praising fellow candidates Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard, including when Gravel urged them not to make personal attacks and rather focus on policy critiques.

These kids knew the Senator for just 2 years, when he was 89 and 90, and after his death are using the Senator's identity to run their propaganda machine. Pathetic",1631361897,5,1

I understand that Bitcoin cannot be confiscated in any scenario, so I know that Bitcoin is as safe a way to store your asset wealth, as any, but if the NWO bans private ownership of 'anything', what are the best strategies of converting as much wealth into Bitcoin before that happens - IF that nightmare (for me anyway) comes true?  
*BTW, I am resigned to thinking about ultimately having to move to a Bitcoin refuge/country, if they can even be allowed to exist, at that time.*  


My Bitcoin is secure in a hard wallet, but my main concern is my biggest asset (atm!), my house. 

After a lifetime of work and mortgage payments, I own my house but as many conspiracy theories now seem to be coming true, I'm concerned that all private property title will also be made null and void - and I doubt whether any compensation will be anything like what I could sell it for, now.. So, I'm looking at my options and I'm wondering how other might be preparing for this contingency.

**Option One** is to sell the house now and come to an agreement with the new owner to rent back the house, whilst I convert the sale proceeds to Bitcoin.   
*Hopefully, Bitcoin price appreciation over the rental term would more than cover sale and rent, but this seems a short term strategy and I want long term since I built the house exactly how I like it.*

**Option Two** is to get a MAX possible reverse mortgage or equity loan and convert that to Bitcoin.   
*Again, hopefully, Bitcoin price appreciation would more than cover the interest.*

**Option Three** is to sell the house and everything, convert to Bitcoin, and prepare to bug out, when and if  necessary.

I'm expecting hyperinflation sometime in this decade, so I won't be holding any fiat currency, more than I need.

I'm not a tax expert, and I get nowhere with traditional financial planners on this - who only push me to their 'products' - so I would like to learn of any more options and what others in this great Bitcoin community are planning or doing for this 'end of days' scenarios... or is all hope lost, anyway?.",1631346852,35,1

pm2m3k,throwaway29801A,"RE or btc, that is the question","Over the last few weeks I got into discussions on real estate vs bitcoin.  
I am bullish real estate. I also sold an investment property to buy bitcoin. The million sat question:

If I did NOT own a home, would I buy a home now or buy bitcoin? My answer: bitcoin. Here's why.

1. The factors that are making real estate go up are the same factors that make bitcoin go up. Bitcoin just goes up harder and faster when these factors happen.
2. Not being a jerk, and I think real estate goes much higher, but I have a lot more friends who have been saying real estate will crash over the last 5 years who then bought a house within the last 12 months. 
3. The only exception to this idea-of buying real estate instead of bitcoin- is luxury real estate with at least 10 to 1 but hopefully 20 to 1 leverage. This is not possible for the majority of first time buyers.
4. Bitcoin allows an expansion of a position; Got a bonus check? into bitcoin. Yes, you could buy a reit I guess, but besides that it's hard to dca or throw extra towards real estate.
5. Bitcoin allows mobility-for many people, I think they are wildly understating how important this will be over the next decade.
6. As bitcoin matures and lending products get longer terms and higher ltv, the price of bitcoin might explode even higher. Real estate is tapped out in this respect.
7. A life changing event happens-you get sick, divorced, married, want to take time off, whatever-it's hard to do this as a landlord. Believe me. My tenants (and they aren't bad) need attention. Literally have a hard time fixing the most basic things. Don't think property management companies are turn-key.
8. Go back to #2. Add that most people own one home. People who come into bitcoin accumulate hard. The supply getting sucked up relative to real estate is on another level.

What happens when Bitcoin drops? - Altcoins drop.  
What happens when Bitcoin is on the rise? - Altcoins bloom.  
The difference is that when Bitcoin has risen 2% in 24h the older altcoins rise 5%-20%, some even 40% to 60% .  
I know altcoins seem like a lot of money when you see that big percentage (on the f\*cking 24h% change rate). Are you really reciveing that very same percentage?

The demand for Bitcoin is dropping which actually is behind those weird unexpected drops of all crypto.  
A lot of you dont want to admit that you've failed to raise your portfolio and that is really the worst part of it. That's what makes it gambling - you lose with a huge percentage so you try to get it back quickly with that huge percentage.  
Yes flipping is possible for sure, those who HODL eventually gain.  
Crypto adoption has begun and ""real-word market"" is where they accept bitcoin. The portfolio values are calculated into bitcoin.

pm1tt2,SonnigVuori,Money and the ascent of Bitcoin,"This post aims to answer the commonly asked question of whether bitcoin is money or not? To do so, we first provide a basic understanding of money: what money is, its importance, the process by which a good becomes money, the necessary characteristics for it to do so, and the main types of money that have historically existed.

Afterwards, we briefly describe Bitcoin and proceed to answer the core question of this post on whether it can be considered money or not.

# Exchange and Money

## Barter

Barter is the simplest form of exchange; it refers to the transfer of a good or service for another good or service. For this reason, it is typically considered direct exchange since no third object partakes of the transaction.

Barter requires cooperation between individuals and double coincidence of wants, i.e., that both parties have and are willing to exchange the good or service that the other party desires for the good or service that the other party possesses. Therefore, this form of exchange involves high transaction costs due to the opportunity cost incurred in finding an individual with whom to make the barter.

## Indirect Exchange and money

These high transaction costs involved in the bartering process led to the emergence and prevalence of indirect exchange, i.e., a type of exchange in which a good or service is exchanged for a more widely acceptable item, which can be subsequently used to exchange for the goods or services desired. Therefore, for indirect exchange to occur, acquired goods must be more marketable than those surrendered. As the greater the marketability of a good, the more it will facilitate the final objective: the acquisition of the desired good or service.

In this way, in indirect exchange systems, the most marketable goods became a media of exchange, i.e., widely accepted. At the same time, as these goods became more widely accepted they further increased their marketability, bolstering their position as a medium of exchange. And, in turn, displaced those goods with lower marketability as means of exchange. Thus, leading to an inevitable scenario in which only a single good was universally employed as a medium of exchange: money.

## Functions of money and their development

Therefore, we can define money as a **generally accepted medium of exchange**. Nonetheless, in several definitions of money, two secondary functions are attributed to it:

1. **Store of value:** It allows to transmit value through time and space.
2. **Unit of account:** It permits the valuation of goods and services.

Notwithstanding, for a good to become money, it is not necessary that it initially fulfills all the above functions. Indeed, goods are converted into money through a process by which they usually acquire some of these functions first, and then others are subsequently developed.  In addition, the acquisition of new functions establishes synergies with the previous ones, reinforcing and consolidating their position.

For example, as the practice of using a good as a medium of exchange becomes widespread, people begin to hold it in preference to others, thus developing its function as a store of value and reinforcing its function as a medium of exchange. As a result, acceptability becomes more widespread leading economic agents to set prices using this good as a reference, thereby becoming a unit of account.

On the other hand, for a good whose value is relatively stable, there will be economic agents interested in buying it not to satisfy their most direct needs, but to maintain their future purchasing power. In this way, it will be accepted by a growing number of agents and, therefore, become a medium of exchange. And, thus, economic agents begin to treat it as a unit of account.

## Properties of money

Nevertheless, for money to fulfill the above functions, it must meet various characteristic requirements:

1. **Portability:** It must be possible to transport or accumulate a large amount of value in a small amount of space, thereby facilitating transferability and hoarding.
2. **Divisibility:** Money should be divisible into different units to enable precise pricing and facilitate transactions.
3. **Uniformity:** It must be easy to identify units of money having the same value, enabling the counterparty receiving the money to promptly discern its value. Thus, facilitating its transferability.
4. **Durability:** It must remain intact over time without physically degrading or disappearing, therefore favoring its hoarding.

## Types of Money

This subsection is merely for informational purposes and is not relevant for the understanding of the later sections of the post. Readers who wish to do so may omit it by jumping to **Cryptography as a means of privacy and the emergence of Bitcoin** section.

Throughout history, money has taken many forms. Although today fiat money is the norm, commodity money characterized much of earlier history.

## Commodity money

Commodity money refers to real units of a specific commodity universally accepted as a counterpart for goods and services. Accordingly, commodity money has intrinsic value. Historically, a myriad of commodities has served at one time or another as a medium of exchange: animal skins, salt, barley, tea, gold, silver, tobacco, etc.

As economies became more complex, increasing the number of payments, commodity money became cumbersome. The quality of the metals was continually tested to ensure that they had not been tampered with or that they were not of a lower grade than assumed. On the other hand, agricultural products were relatively difficult to transport compared to metals because of their lower unit value. For this reason, two alternatives emerged that sought to solve these problems: coinage and representative money.

Coinage was a revolutionary invention that changed people's way of thought. Coinage seems to have first occurred in the Kingdom of Lydia around 600 BC when the first electrum coins were minted, a natural alloy of gold and silver. (recent findings suggest that coinage may have originated in China a few years earlier, near Guanzhuang in Henan province). Consequently, metallic coins are a type of commodity money, which is highly transportable and divisible. Moreover, minted coins contained a mark that guaranteed their weight and purity, i.e., their value, thus solving the uniformity problem that untreated metals faced.

## Representative money

Representative money is money whose value does not derive from the value of the material it is made of, but from what it represents, since each monetary unit is supposed to represent a fixed quantity of something that has real value.

Some scholars have suggested that this form of money pre-dates coinage. In the ancient empires of Babylon, Egypt, China, and India temples, and palaces were considered inviolable, the former due to religious reasons and the latter due to the heavy protection they possessed. Therefore, they became safe places to store precious goods. Depositors received a certificate attesting deposits, which was a claim to the deposited goods. These certificates have been associated with multiple objects which were used in international trade, such as glazed scarabs in Egypt and cylindrical seals in Babylon and India. For this reason, these certificates are believed to have been used as a means of payment. Furthermore, due to the implementation of the gold standard, representative money occupied a central role during the 20th century.

## Fiat money

Fiat money refers to money that has no intrinsic value and does not represent anything of intrinsic value. Public trust in both the issuer and the money itself is what drives its value. Such trust can be attributed, in most cases, to the confidence in the future stability of money's purchasing power.

Some authors have defined state-issued fiat money more critically as credit reimbursable for the payment of future tax obligations. And, therefore, associating fiat money as a way of using a government's liabilities as a store of value.

In 1971, following the end of the Bretton Woods agreement, we find the emergence of modern fiat money. Nevertheless, in the fifth century B.C in Carthage, we already find one of the earliest known forms of widespread use of fiat money. This money was a small piece of leather sealed by the state, which enveloped a mysterious substance that nobody knew its composition except the maker. Only by breaking the seal, its composition could be known. However, in the presence of this event, this money was considered worthless.

Recent studies have speculated that the mysterious substance was, in fact, tin or a compound of copper and tin and that the wrapping of this compound was not leather, but parchment.

# Cryptography as a means of privacy and the emergence of Bitcoin

In the early '90s, a movement called cypherpunk emerged. It was a libertarian-minded group that wanted to promote cryptography as a means of consolidating and increasing freedom. Cypherpunks published two documents setting forth their goals and ideals: [The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/crypto/cypherpunks/may-crypto-manifesto.html) and [A Cypherpunk‚Äôs Manifesto](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/cypherpunk-manifesto.txt). In them, they promoted cryptography to increase privacy and anonymity and decentralized software to make their censorship more difficult.

In 1998 Nick Szabo and Wei Dai independently envisioned how these ideas could be applied to money, referring to them as [b-money](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt) and [Bit gold](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-property-titles/), respectively. For this purpose, they both envisioned a scheme in which balances were stored in a distributed database, and the creation of money was done through the solution of a problem, whose solution is easy to verify.

In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper titled: [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). In this paper, Nakamoto combined several previous inventions to create a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash.

At the beginning of 2009, Nakamoto started the peer-to-peer network. Moreover, he released the Bitcoin source code and compiled binaries on Sourceforge.

## A concise overview of how bitcoin works

Each time a transaction occurs, the network records the Bitcoin address of the receiver and sender together with the amount transferred. This information is entered into the end of a ledger, called the **blockchain**. The blockchain is updated about every 10 minutes, and it is sent to every full node (computers connected to the Bitcoin network that verify all of the rules of Bitcoin).

Every transaction is encrypted with public-key cryptography and is verified by **miners**, computers connected to the Bitcoin network that secure the blockchain. The main objective of the miners is to fix the transaction history and prevent transaction fraud. This is done by solving a computer-intensive process by which individuals involved are rewarded with newly minted bitcoins.

Moreover, rewards given to miners are not always the same, yet they decline geometrically, with a 50% reduction every 210,000 blocks. This pattern was established because it approximates the rate at which gold is extracted.

## Is Bitcoin money?

Bitcoin meets all the necessary characteristics required to fulfill the functions that we previously stated that money must accomplish. As a digital asset, it is extensively portable, being its transferability and accumulation easy. In addition, it is deeply divisible: one bitcoin can be divided into 100 million units, commonly known as satoshis.  Likewise, the digital nature of bitcoins makes them uniform and durable.

However, the fact that it meets the necessary characteristics to fulfill the functions of money does not imply that it fulfills them. Consequently, before we can say whether bitcoin is money or not, we must first analyze whether it fulfills these functions: (1) generally accepted medium of exchange, (2) store of value, and (3) unit of account.

1. **Generally accepted medium of exchange**: As of today, Bitcoin is not a generalized medium of exchange. We cannot go to the bakery next to our house and buy bread with it, nor can we go to a car dealership and buy a car with it.
2. **Store of value:** Bitcoin has historically had severe price volatility, which is not favoring its function as a store of value.
3. **Unit of account:** The limited adoption of bitcoin as a means of payment and its price volatility do not foster its use as a unit of account.

Thus, we can say that **bitcoin currently cannot be considered money**. Notwithstanding this, given the attractive properties of bitcoin, we might ask ourselves a slightly more complex question: is bitcoin in the process of becoming money?

## Is bitcoin in the process of becoming money?

In the beginning, Bitcoin had a highly volatile price, as it was a new, virtually unknown asset that very few people owned. Nevertheless, Bitcoin was an asset with quite appealing monetary properties, coupled with a decentralized scheme and a finite money supply.

These properties led more and more economic agents to believe that bitcoin could become a future store of value and, thus, decided to acquire and hold bitcoin. Likewise, the growing demand for bitcoin led to an increase in its popularity, which drove more economic agents to reach this reasoning, thereby generating a virtuous circle.

This process led to a decrease in the downside volatility of Bitcoin, as can be seen in Figure 1, rendering Bitcoin more attractive as a future store of value.  And, thus, attracted new investors such as Tesla, which announced a $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase in the 10K, issued on February 8, 2021.

[Figure 1. Bitcoin Downside Risk](https://preview.redd.it/38984wh8dtm71.png?width=950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56b4e4e2b8be4ec49d0632ad73760d5ea888a1b0)

Consequently, the adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value is becoming more and more widespread. Once a store of value is well established enough, i.e., many agents understand that this asset is a good store of value, they can start to demand it against the sale of their goods.

Despite this, not many companies do offer their goods or services in exchange for Bitcoin. However, if the popularity and the trend towards increased Bitcoin price stability are not affected mid-term, an increasing number of agents will accept Bitcoin as a means of payment.

Finally, if Bitcoin's function as a medium of exchange were to develop, it would increase its popularity and at the same time solidify its position as a store of value. Enabling future economic agents to start accounting with bitcoin, i.e., opening the possibility of development to the function of unit of account.

Therefore, **we cannot say that bitcoin is in the process of becoming money, but we can say that Bitcoin is currently in the process of becoming a store of value**. That said, whether such a function is widely recognized depends on the maintenance of the trend in which it is now present: further decrease in its downward volatility without giving up its current popularity. Moreover, the development of other functions as a generalized medium of exchange and unit of account is still a long way off and is conditional on the soundness of the development of the store of value function. In addition, **even if at some point the store of value function is fully developed, the development of other functions will still remain highly uncertain.**

Figure 2 summarizes the process by which Bitcoin could obtain the functions of money and thus become money. Take into account that this figure is an abstraction and does not consider various factors that could influence this process, such as external shocks that could have adverse effects and the time that each transition could take.

[Figure 2. Bitcoin Monetization Process](https://preview.redd.it/42zvdycadtm71.jpg?width=1087&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c0667b44a38f2e3384fe2040f0bb6ce727cceac)

Recently, Taleb has argued that Bitcoin can never be a store of value, since its fundamental value is 0. In the next subsection we address this criticism.

## Against Taleb's argument of Bitcoin's impossibility to become a store of value

In the summer of 2021, Nassim Taleb published a short article entitled [Bitcoin, currencies, and fragility](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14697688.2021.1952702), in which one of his arguments is that the value of Bitcoin is exactly 0 and, therefore, Bitcoin cannot be a store of value.

To argue this, Taleb relies on the premise that the fundamental value of any asset is equal to the sum of the present value of its expected future cash flows together with the terminal value that the asset will have.

Therefore, as bitcoin does not generate cash flows, i.e., the mere fact of owning bitcoin as such does not result in monetary payments, meaning that the value of bitcoin only depends on its terminal value.

Additionally, according to Taleb, Bitcoin is a technology. Therefore, Bitcoin, like any other technology, will eventually be replaced by another. As a result, its terminal value will be 0. Consequently, Taleb argues that since its fundamental value is 0, Bitcoin will not become money.

Nevertheless, in this argument, Taleb avoids two important points: (1) humans are not completely rational, and (2) Bitcoin is in the process of becoming a store of value as we saw in the previous subsection. Taleb may be right, bitcoin may not yet be a store of value as such. But, this does not imply that it cannot become one, as we have seen in the previous subsection.

The reason behind this is irrationality in the early stages of Bitcoin, at that time it could be valid to say that Bitcoin had a value of 0. Nevertheless, multiple economic agents were attracted by it, which, as we have seen in the previous section, led to the start of the development of Bitcoin's store of value function. As a result, many economic agents already consider Bitcoin as a store of value, while others expect it to become one in the near future.

Such a fact is critical since assets that act as a store of value provide the holder with a service: the transfer of value in space and time. Consequently, as Bitcoin is in the process of developing its store-of-value function, this implies that the expected flows of bitcoin are no longer zero, but the implicit value of this service. Therefore, Bitcoin's fundamental value should be greater than 0.

Therefore, in the case of Bitcoin, we face an instance in which a collective irrationality has endowed this asset with a value that a priori it should not have. Nevertheless, as part of this process, the store of value property has begun to develop, which justifies that this asset has value, and, at the same time, this value allows it to act as a store of value.

# Key Takeaways

* Money can be defined as a generally accepted medium of exchange.
* Ideally, money should also act as a store of value and a unit of account.
* Thus money has three main functions: (1) generally accepted medium of exchange, (2) store of value, (3) unit of account.
* A good becomes money through a process by which it usually acquires some of these functions first, and then others are subsequently developed.
* Not all goods can become money. They must meet specific characteristics to fulfill these functions: (1) Portability, (2) Divisibility, (3) Uniformity, and (4) Durability.
* Bitcoin was born in 2008 as a revolutionary means of payment since it was decentralized and pseudo-anonymous.
* Bitcoin has a known and finite monetary supply. Furthermore, it meets all the specific characteristics that money should fulfill: it is portable, divisible, uniform, and durable.
* Bitcoin does not currently serve any of the functions that money should have: it is not used as a general means of payment, price volatility does not favor it as a store of value, and because of the preceding points, it is not used as a unit of account.
* Therefore, Bitcoin cannot currently be considered money.
* Despite this, Bitcoin is in the process of becoming a store of value, due to a downward trend in its volatility that has led more and more economic agents to believe that its conversion to a store of value is possible in the near future and, in turn, has solidified its position.
* The beginning of the development of Bitcoin as a store of value arises from an irrationality of origin.
* If the current trend is not affected by external shocks, Bitcoin is likely to become a store of value in the near future.
* This would lead more economic agents to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment and thus open the way for the development of its function as a generalized means of payment.",1631340011,1,1

This Roth IRA would go until my retirement age, which would be 59.5-67 years old. That would be somewhere between 2060-2067. I have some questions and would really appreciate if you'd answer.

**QUESTIONS:**

**Looking at previous years, I am aware that Bitcoin provides amazing annual returns, but with the high volatility over the coming years, and the inevitable future bearish negative years, it really affects compounding interest. So instead of taking the projected arithmetic mean, I should go by the geometric mean. From 2022 to 2060, what do you predict will be the average annual return (taking into account the geometric mean)?** 

**Would you say it will very likely be a higher annual return than if I had invested the same money into normal non-crypto Roth IRA? Is a 12% average annual return realistic? 15%? 20%? More?**

Thanks in advance, guys! And also, I'm a noob, so please go easier on me lol.",1631331063,35,1
plzmr4,Kinolva,"URGENT EL SALVADOR Questions: The ""Chivo"" ""Government Issued Wallet"" WTF?","I keep hearing things about ""Chivo"" the ""government issued bitcoin wallet"" in El Salvador ([source](https://www.reuters.com/technology/el-salvadors-bitcoin-digital-wallet-beset-by-technical-glitches-2021-09-10/)). 

The idea of a ""government issued bitcoin wallet"" seems to me to be a HUGE red flag, and runs counter to much of the ""bitcoin doesn't require trust in a nation state"" narrative . (Note: I am a bitcoin maximalist... look at my post history... not trying to spread FUD... but I have genuine concerns). 

Here's what I mean: who among us would trust a ""government issued bitcoin wallet"" from the US Government? Fucking nobody. How about from the Russian Government? Fucking nobody again. I don't know much about El Salvador, but I doubt the government there is actually ""benevolent"" or ""benign"" in any enduring way. Thus: the idea of a ""government issued bitcoin wallet"" is hugely problematic.

Questions abound:

1) Why ""Chivo wallet""? Why not just encourage the use any of the open source, publicly available wallets? 

2) Are El Salvadorian citizens / users allowed to transfer BTC out of the ""government issued bitcoin wallet"" to any wallet of their choice? Or does it have to stay inside the ""Chivo"" wallet?

3) If this initial Chivo wallet is just for the ""free $30.00 worth of BTC"" isn't this a kind of trojan-horse way of performing monetary surveillance on the population of El Salvador? IE: Coin tracking from this initial origin through all transactions / joins to new addresses? 

4) Does Jack Mallers have a reddit account? If so, somebody please ping him.  I'd be curious of his response / opinion on this. I know he has been quite involved.",1631330251,16,1

pjfjhv,awuga-shop,Why Bitcoin will fix the Healthcare System,"Americans over consume everything in life and especially unhealthy foods and drinks. People buy fast food because they feel it is easy to get and cheap but this is far from the truth. The current financial system is ran by large corporations that want to keep humans in the hamster wheel. Wake up and have your coffee. Get a quick note here on your way to work. Go to lunch here. Get a quick dinner there. Get a drink with people here. People get so stressed out with the day to day that they have no plan for the long run and feel they have no time to focus on their bodies. Easy money policies make it to where people get stuck on the hamster wheel and can't get off without falling on their face so all their time and energy is focused on the next step ahead of you. This has caused Americans to be fat, lazy, tired, addicted to caffeine and alcohol, and neglect their bodies basic needs. When Bitcoin becomes the global currency, you will have more time in your life to sit down and make a budget and grocery list. You'll realize the value in preparing for the week and will have more time to exercise your body. People will be less willing to mindlessly pay insurance premiums and will ask where their money is actually going (into the pockets of insurance CEOs). Not to mention student loans will be in less supply so doctors wont have to get $100K+ in debt (universities will decrease tuition prices) to get their degree which is a major factor in the rising rates of healthcare.

pjf99s,awuga-shop,Why Bitcoin will Fix the American Family,"America has seen a sad downward trend in the family unit since the late 60s and early 70s. This has been caused by inflation, a weak currency, and easy money policies. Households can no longer live off of one income so dual incomes have become the norm and in many cases it is needed to live an average life. This has harmed the population in many ways. Men and women are at work all week to stay afloat and have less time to spend with one another which leads to arguments over finances and divorce. Women don't have as much attention to spend on their kids which makes each generation more shitty than the last. Women are also expected to go to college (loaded with student loans), start a career, and not start having kids until they are in their late 20s lots of the time which is risky because infertility increases with age. Many of these children are being raised outside of a home with both a father and a mother which has devastating impacts on a family and a community. This is causing an identity crisis in America where we now see people confused with their sexual orientation, their gender, and lack a vision for the future because they were born into sad homes. Bitcoin can fix this. Bitcoin can stop the inflation which will make homes more affordable. Bitcoin can provide a stable retirement that isn't crashed every 10 years because Wall Street gets greedy. Bitcoin will make America a nation that values savers (hodlers) and punishes irresponsible spenders. Bitcoin will give people more time in the week to spend with their spouse and their children which will result in a happy family and less divorce/single parent homes. America was built on strong families, not on a strong government force.",1630986490,41,1

pjeykg,awuga-shop,Why Bitcoin will fix Global Warming,"Many think Bitcoin mining will hurt the environment but this is an ignorant and false statement. Bitcoin will heal the earth. The biggest factor for global warming is over consumption which has been caused by the current fiat financial system that wants us to spend money. Stimulus programs and other incentives to buy buy buy has caused the working family to impulse buy products (cars, appliances, etc.) on easy debt. Americans and the world as a whole constantly buy shit they don't need because they are advertized 24/7 and banks let the credit flow because money is constantly flown through them. When Bitcoin is the global currency, the central bank will no longer be able to bailout the commercial and investment banks. Therefore, the banks will need to be more diligent and frugal when it comes to giving out loans. This will make prices of everything go down because you won't be able to swipe a credit card with such a large limit to buy groceries at the store. If people are consuming less then the environment won't be polluted, less cargo ships and planes will be going around the world, and factories will not produce as much. This is what the world and humankind needs. We need to stop buying so much shit on easy debt and instead use more hours and energy in our day to be with friends/family, exercise, and enjoy nature. We also need to learn to save, get out of debt, and actually budget again. Peace out Amazon and other BS retailers, and good fucking riddance.",1630985352,2,1

So it doesn't matter if the price of Bitcoin is ""high"" or ""low"", he had already separated the amount required to give $30 USD to everyone.

He is doing it the right way: Transparently and in the open, announcing publicly their purchases.

To those saying: ""He should've bought when the price was lower!"". 

They are wrong: The Government's duty is not to 'invest' in Bitcoin, **it's NOT appropriate for them to speculate with Bitcoin**, and certainly not for the short term.

All this Quantitative easing has also pushed real estate debt to record lows causing real estate to surge in value.  

Given all the above you would think the Fed would have begun to aggressively taper in the last few months as the economy more or less returned to normal.  But as we learned in 2018 QE is a drug the central bankers will never give up.

So looking ahead we are entering a perfect storm, eviction moratorium ending, ICUs running out of bed, winter coming, delta and other mutations spreading etc.  

So what does any good banker do when think get bad? You guessed it more QE!  So with Equities already overvalued, Real Estate already in negative caps, Bonds regarded as trash where is money to go?

pjbu8c,SatStax,"A case for a $1 MILLION Bitcoin, before you expect it (just for fun)","(originally commented in r/ CryptoCurrency answering ""Do you think Bitcoin will hit the $100,000 mark by the end of 2021?"")

When Bitcoin starts to go, it goes fast (leaving the no-coiners in the dust)  
Some BIG reasons why it could hit $100K before anyone anticipates:

1. **Liquidity**, as seen through on-chain analysis, is some of the lowest
2. Likewise, **hodlers** count is the highest.
3. Attention from the media - tons of Eyeballs. Partially = because of the NFT scams and occasional altcoins making the news. This means **the FOMO reach** is much wider.
4. El Salvador is in. **Other countries WILL FOMO** in (not sure when exactly though)
5. And lastly, $100K is **NOT THAT MUCH from here.** Look, 100K is only 100% from here. We just did almost 100% from 28k to 50k and no one is screaming about it. And from the last ATH ($65k) it's ONLY 50% gain

Now a case for $1,000,000 per Bitcoin:

Some potential events to consider. Loosely, by likely to less likely: 

* High inflation / hyper inflation risk. Cause by Supply chain issues (goods from China to the US and other regions) means inflation is \^.  (likely no hyperinflation in the western economies yet, but smaller countries could pop and scare others)

OR

* High inflation / hyper inflation risk. Caused by more irresponsible printing.   
Maybe another bad Covid wave (hits the unvaxed - majority of the world population. Or vaccines not working all that well...)
* Recession hits hard. Trad assets fall in price, fiat inflation. 
* Natural disaster (not that unlikely)

Don't want to go all doomsday here. But there are also the UNEXPECTED variables. 

Keep in mind, it's totally possible for SEVERAL events occur all at once. And when that occurs.....

Similar to what happened to the Titanic: it could withstand 4  of 16 compartment breaches, but 5 compartments were affected, so... it sunk. 

This will scare MANY investment managers, into..

But into what? Bonds negative, Equities overvalued, the economy (actual value production) is not humming all that good. 

Fund managers buy gold, commodities and other limited supply assets (wink wink)",1630973562,14,1

pjtydw,Elon-Musks-Musk,My final mental hurdle - Concerns about Bitcoin when block rewards are gone and transaction fees are needed to keep the network secure,"Ok, I have taken the deep dive into bitcoin these last few months and have listened to countless podcasts, youtube videos, read The Price of Tomorrow and The Bitcoin Standard and I think I know enough about bitcoin to partake in the conversation with some level of intelligence (I hope). I apologize in advance for any incorrect terminology.

I see the appeal of bitcoin (being a non-inflationary asset / money, holding wealth better than fiat currency, seems like improved digital gold, etc) but the one question I have is around the ongoing transition as the block rewards get smaller and smaller and how to incentivize ongoing mining and the security risks that might follow.

My understanding is as follows (correct me on any of these points, as I truly do want to learn).

1). The more miners and the more CPU directed toward mining the more 'secure' the network is. To break the trust of the bitcoin network you would have to hold 51% of the computing power. Currently that would cost an astronomical amount, and thus it would cost an exorbitant amount with no monetary gain (as then the price of bitcoin would crash).

2) The main income from miners comes from block rewards. Yes there are also transaction fees that further incentivize miners, but my understanding is that the fees contribute \~5-8% compared to the actual block reward. Thus as the block rewards decrease then the transaction fees will have to increase to further incentivize miners.

3) Now things get interesting. As the block rewards decrease, then the fees would have to increase to demand the same level of CPU / energy directed toward them. If there are lower fees, then the miners would not be as interested in mining, and some CPU power would leave the network (until a cost of CPU/electricity vs transaction fees are profitable). If the fees are increased then more miners would join the network (until a cost of CPU/electricity vs transaction fees are nominally profitable)

Thus it seems that the fees are eventually going to be what ensures the safety of the bitcoin network.

4) I see a couple of things that could subsequently happen that would decrease the fees or transactions.

4a) A second layer or lightning network ontop of bitcoin. Yes this would allow more transitions on this layer, but it would decrease the amount of transactions on the base bitcoin layer. Thus the bitcoin base layer transactions would decrease, resulting in much higher fees per transaction. Now maybe if it truly is used at some massive banking layer then these high fees will be minimal compared to the amount of bitcoin being moved at that base layer.

4b) More and more people hold bitcoin as a store of value, thus there are less and less daily transactions. Yes during its growth phase there will be a speculation and thus transactions, but imagine that you get to a steady state in terms of demand and there is limited price volatility and thus limited speculation. Then it seems to me that there would be fewer and fewer daily transactions (yes I might convert my fiat money to bitcoin with each paycheck, but that rate of transactions probably will be minimal compared to what is occurring today and when there is speculation. So if it becomes like global gold that everyone has, then I don't know how often the base bitcoin layer would have transaction compared the the fees that would be needed to truly have this a secure network.

5) Another possibility is that another cryptocurrency becomes more valuable than the rewards+fees of bitcoin and thus CPU power leaves elsewhere. I guess whatever the price of bitcoin is, is the level of CPU security that we will get on the bitcoin network (the market will always go to where there is a profit to be made).

But if another cryptocurrency becomes more valuable than bitcoin, or lets say that another group of miners on another cryptocurrency realize that they have more than 51% CPU power than the bitcoin community, then in a single day they could transition from mining their prior cryptocurrency to joining the bitcoin network and with more than 51% CPU power they could crash the bitcoin network and thus devalue the price to 0. This would kill bitcoin and then some of those people would be looking to join another cryptocurrency network and likely they would join the currency that is the largest and thus the attacker would massively benefit through this added demand. Does that not mean that Bitcoin needs to stay top dog in terms of crypto price to eliminate this threat? Also why has this not been done more often, where large bitcoin mining groups just go out and crush any competition that uses proof of work to further increase bitcoins monopoly?

6) All of that is to say, to keep a secure network there has to be no other group could obtain 51% CPU power compared to the bitcoin network. To keep that monopoly the transaction fees in total will have to be worth at least the amount of the next highest cryptocurrency. I just don't know what that price would be, and if the fees alone can support it.",1631042563,22,1

Then I quit my job, this was for personal reasons ranging from mental health to taking a new big risk aka prioritizing my own business full time with a trade I've excelled in, Photography &amp; Videography. That jump didn't scare me, as none of these major dips have scared me.

I'm holding, I believe in myself and the risks I take, I just purchased another $500 through crypto as coinbase blocked my card after todays big dip. I genuinely believe in BTC, I've used it to cover my medication and bills, I hold more and more funds each month in BTC feeling more secure than my current banks that consistently overdraw my accounts throwing on daily extra fees with every business transaction I don't constantly keep on top off. My only regret was not accepting BTC back in 2016 when I was in a group chat with Martin Shkreli, some youtuber named Billy the fridge and two other guys giving small amounts of BTC, a few jumped on and I didn't. Weird story I know.

I've always been a low income earner, paycheck to paycheck, BTC over the last few months has helped me keep even more afloat during my full time work transition for my business.

I'm holding, I believe in myself and the risks I take, I just purchased another $500 through crypto as coinbase blocked my card after todays big dip. I genuinely believe in BTC, I've used it to cover my medication and bills, I hold more and more funds each month in BTC feeling more secure than my current banks that consistently overdraw my accounts throwing on daily extra fees with every business transaction I don't constantly keep on top off. My only regret was not accepting BTC back in 2016 when I was in a group chat with Martin Shkreli, some youtuber named Billy the fridge and two other guys giving small amounts of BTC, a few jumped on and I didn't. Weird story I know.  


I've always been a low income earner, paycheck to paycheck, BTC over the last few months has helped me keep even more afloat during my full time work transition for my business. So I'm also planning to start accepting BTC through my own events media company based in Australia. (I'm taking up an apprenticeship in welding if this pursuit fails, I'm not doing this blind either as I've done wedding and events photography for 3years while working full time to make ends meet.)  


Anywho my main point is that this form of currency isn't about making a sizeable profit for the everyday people, most of us won't, I see this as a means for us to truly have more control and freedom on our finances. This is still only the start and the world will have to accommodate and learn with these changes.",1631038912,0,1

I bought some bitcoin with Coinbase and I was preparing to move it to my wallet (Not your keys, not your bitcoin, etc.).

Polygon is built on top of Ethereum, which is what makes it a Layer-2 network, fully compatible with the Ethereum infrastructure, but free from its exorbitant commission fees and network load. This means that future Buyzooka users will be protected from the scalability issues of ETH, which over the past year plagued so many projects built on the second biggest network in crypto ‚Äî commission fees jumped to tens and even hundreds of dollars, while transaction speed dropped drastically. However, let‚Äôs look into what Polygon (MATIC) is?

Polygon is a Layer-2 scaling solution created to help bring mass adoption to the Ethereum platform. It caters to the diverse needs of developers by providing tools to create scalable decentralized applications (dApps) that prioritize performance, user experience (UX), and security. Polygon relies on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, unlike ETH that uses Proof-of-Work (PoW). This is one of the things that allow Polygon to improve network performance.

pk5ne1,vocergui1988,Frequently Asked Questions at NASDEX,"What is NASDEX and what does it do?

NASDEX is a decentralized exchange for the trading of tokenized stocks. NASDEX is designed to serve as a bridge between the crypto world and the equity world. We believe that the onchain adoption of the equity asset class will deliver increased accessibility with improved capabilities for both crypto and equity investor

Please describe the size of your target market?

NASDEX is designed to bring the entire global equity market to crypto investors. Hence, our target market is basically every single listed stock in the world. Through DeFi, which is permission-less and borderless, no market is out of bounds for us. Just to put it in perspective, the two largest equity market in the world is the US and China with combined market cap of over USD50 trillion. And ROW makes up around another USD50 trillion for a combined global market cap of over USD100 trillion. In comparison, the entire crypto market is only around USD1.5 trillion. Hence, targeting the global equity market allows NASDEX to target a market that‚Äôs 100x the size than a typical DeFi DEX. for NASDEX, with the help of the community, we can list every single security in the world. That is extremely powerful. This is ultimately a DEX for the people, by the people.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of the target audience, NASDEX will be able to welcome a larger user base who‚Äôs already familiar with equities. You can see in the below chart that the countries with the highest adoption of crypto are, understandably, countries with unstable currencies (Nigeria) and countries with strict capital control (Vietnam). But for major developed countries, we can take the US and China for example, which has possibly one of the highest crypto adoption in the world yet the amount of people who own crypto is only less than 10% of the population according to this research. Yet, the amount of people who own stocks in the US is past 50% and in China that number is similar. This means that although crypto adoption is growing significantly, equity owners still make up the majority of the investors in the world. NASDEX will offer these equity owners a much better platform to do investing in tokenized equity.

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, we are targeting a market with a total combined market cap of over USD100 trillion and a target audience of several hundred million people!

What are some of the obstacles you see in this project and how do you plan to overcome them?

Liquidity and user adoption will be the first hurdle that we must overcome as a project. Based on the mechanics of the minting and trading system, we need the help of our community to supply liquidity and choose a role to play to fuel the entire ecosystem. As shepherds of the project, the NASDEX team must create the right incentives to attract the community to test out our platforms. But we are confident that once the community starts to participate, they will understand the power and the ease of trading tokenized stocks on NASDEX.

Regulation is obviously another obstacle that we need to overcome. However, this is not only a challenge for NASDEX but for the entire DeFi ecosystem. We agree that certain regulation is needed to prevent scammy projects from stealing user‚Äôs hard earned tokens. But we also agree that over-regulation may discourage innovation and kill off the DeFi ecosystem in its infancy. Ultimately, we believe that a healthy balance will eventually be achieved through the collective work of creators, users, and regulators. We are all creating a better financial system for the future that we would like to work better than the existing system. NASDEX will always put community first in complying with regulations and making sure that our user funds are safe

Who are your key competitors (crypto and non-crypto) and what is your competitive advantage?

There are some other projects in crypto that are trying to solve similar problems. We respect those projects very much and have tried to expand on some of their innovations. With that being said, this is an industry with a TAM of over USD100 trillion. There is more than enough room for several players to co-exist at the same time. Tokenized stocks is our team‚Äôs sole focus at this point and will work to make certain it becomes a vibrant ecosystem.

In the non-crypto space, we really have no competitors since there is no way for legacy exchange to solve legacy issues.

What‚Äôs new about what you‚Äôre making? What are you solving?

What we are offering is empowering crypto investors everywhere by providing borderless access to the entire equity asset class. Many investors today started their investing journey through first buying crypto instead of equities, and is unfamiliar with the equity asset class. We are obviously huge believers in crypto, but at the same time we‚Äôve been around the block to understand the importance of diversification into different asset classes.

At the end of the day, most of the world is still ‚Äútokenized‚Äù through the equity market with stocks. If one wants to have investment exposure to some of the most innovative companies in the world like Apple, one still needs to buy this archaic token we call stock, along with its legacy issues.

NASDEX is creating a bridge for crypto investors to gain access to this large asset class through frictionless rebalancing between crypto and equity with DeFi mechanics to boost yields.

&amp;#x200B;

What is your monetization strategy?

NASDEX is an exchange; therefore, our revenue will be based on the volume traded. We want to build an exchange for the people, by the people. Which means that with increasingly greater community participation, volumes will increasingly grow on NASDEX, and we will be able to produce more profits to share with the community and all our stakeholders.

Take the Hong Kong stock exchange for example that allows the trading of only Hong Kong listed stocks. The total market cap of HK stocks is USD7 trillion and the HK Exchange made a profit of around USD500mn for its shareholders in the first quarter alone. And this is just one single market. With the ability to tap multiple markets around the world, NASDEX‚Äôs monetization potential is truly limitless.

&amp;#x200B;

ABOUT NASDEX

NASDEX is the premiere decentralized exchange enabling the trading of Asian stocks on-chain. It is designed to serve as a bridge between the crypto world and the equity world. Its core benefits and differentiation includes stock yield enhancement through liquidity mining and special focus on Asian stocks. It‚Äôs product offering includes ETFs, indices, and additional asset classes and derivatives as well.

The exchanges show you the price action over a short time frame to ENCOURAGE you to trade. They make money whether the price goes up, down, or all around.

The vast majority of people lose $ when trading. You hear the win stories, not the losses.

Leverage is generally necessary for long term purchases: a house, education, a car. It is not needed for bitcoin.

pk3f6b,Wobbly_Jones,"Making a reddit bot for this sub, opinions needed","Just for fun the other night I started learning what goes into making a reddit bot and wanted to give it a shot with some *arguably * useful features.  

Right now it's a bot that searches through comments to find people who mention x amount of sats / satoshis . It then pulls the current btc price and runs the conversion of sats to USD.  You can say things like 500 sats , or 3,000,000 sats or 34 thousand sats and it should be able to give a proper response.  It's all in an effort to make the unit of bitcoin more digestible as we grow towards public acceptance and adoption.  

I was thinking of other cool features I could add on like maybe it could randomly tip out sats to commenter using the lntip feature , like 1 in 100 comments gets 1000 sats or something.

Maybe if you comment ""update"" on the bots comment it could take the parent comment and re-run the calculation with the new btc value so we could see how it changes over time. 

What other cool or useful ideas would this community be interested in?  

Lastly, if it starts getting used a lot,  it might get annoying.. or maybe you already think its annoying.  Love to hear any/all feedback.

piali0,davidcwilliams,"My take on the ""buy and hold"" and ""never sell"" arguments.","They're absolutely right. Here's why:

1. You should not be holding an amount of Bitcoin that you would be tempted to sell, no matter what the price does. Within reason, obviously. If you're holding 1.0 Bitcoin, making 30k/year and Bitcoin goes to $1,000,000, okay fine, but in general, you should have enough that when Bitcoin spikes, you're elated, but not so much that when it dives you are devastated.

2. There is nothing wrong with funding a wallet for spending, Lightning or Chain. Spending is not selling. I mean, in practice it's not the same thing. People who 'sell' are almost always drastically decreasing their position. Someone who is 'spending' their Bitcoin, is not usually changing the amount they hold by even a quarter of a percent. Holding is great, but have fun, and spread it around.

3. The main reason why you should treat Bitcoin as a ~~long term~~ **lifetime** investment, is because *the world has never seen anything like this before*. So treating *it* like something that 'has bottomed', or 'peaked', or is in a 'bull market' or 'bear', is relegating this alien thing to a class of assets that are governed by rules that simply do not apply. It's possible that Bitcoin's true value will *never* be determined. We might *always* be in a price discovery phase. But if you are in this for the long haul, then relax, and recognize that the price on any given day almost never has anything to do with holders like you. Instead, it's determined by thousands of short-term, often meaningless factors, affecting, and caused by, people who could not care less about Bitcoin itself.

I quote 

a poll by the Central American University (UCA) showed on Thursday.
At least 67.9% of 1,281 people surveyed said they disagree or strongly disagree with the use of bitcoin as a legal tender, said the poll by UCA, a Jesuit university based in El Salvador. Just over 32% of people said they agree on some level.

The study was issued days before the government is due to formalize the cryptocurrency as legal tender in El Salvador on Sept. 7, a plan announced by President Nayib Bukele in June.

UCA's poll, carried out in August, also showed that 9 out of 10 people did not have a clear understanding of bitcoin, and 8 out of 10 said they had little or no confidence in its use.

Most people, 7 out of 10, thought lawmakers should repeal the law that makes it legal tender.

pi8igw,pm0211,Went down the Crypto Rabbit Hole - Ended up Writing a Book," 

In December 2020, I started taking interest in cryptocurrencies after following some smart people on Twitter. These people are the ones who know how to make money and can recognize trends early on.

I started with a very small investment in BTC to understand how it all works and I started reading more. The information was fascinating and blockchain was a truly revolutionary technology if you read the white paper and the purpose of blockchain.

I went down the rabbit hole to completely understand the technology. If an opportunity comes across in this revolutionary field, I would be ready for it and have the knowledge.

I understood the technical terms and how they work. My family and friends could not yet understand this technology and they would laugh at me. I wrote the book and gave it to them to read. Some did read it and some didn't.

The ones that read the book really liked the book. They liked the book because they understood in detail about cryptocurrencies and blockchain. They had superior knowledge as compared to their peers. The knowledge was backed by logic and real-world truths.

Most of them now have an active crypto portfolio as a result of the knowledge gained from the book. The book does not sell any investment or financial advice. They acted solely based on the knowledge gained from the book.

This encouraged me and brought a smile to my face as my work helped somebody and opened a new field of interest for them.

pi5pm9,throwaway29801A,"Put in the work, or don't","I hope this post provides information whether you are thinking about buying bitcoin, thinking about selling, or simply want to learn.

Synopsis: The vast majority of people who I know who do not buy bitcoin generally do not understand it. The vast majority who buy a little are risk averse (they avoid any type of significant financial risk and are the type of person who generally will never be rich and never be poor). I respect you if you do the work and say I don't want to buy it for x/y/z reasons. I haven't met anyone in that category.

In the last decade I acquired real estate. As I kept buying, I heard from most people on the last few purchases that it would crash, it was over valued, etc. I did not understand the money printing. I did understand that payments relative to wages was more important than just purchase price. I can't believe people could say xyz will happen and have no basis to their argument. What I have learned is people saying crash or similar to people who chase-emotions rule over common sense. Lack of research pays the price.

There is nothing wrong with saying a market is overvalued or is going to crash. What is wrong is saying that and not having a reason. If you can't explain your lack of investment or your investment, that's a bad sign. I was that way with Tesla- judgemental, not open to ideas.

I have friends who have been saying bitcoin will crash, tulips, etc. Once again, these are fair criticisms. What's not good for them is that they can't explain their position.

Of my group, the people that kept saying real estate crash-well, 50% of them bought homes in the last year. 50%. Why did they buy? Same reason-no reason at all, no research. I might add, many of these people have great incomes, good careers, business owners, etc. It teaches me that you can be smart in many ways and an absolute moron in others.

This same group owns a very small amount of bitcoin, if any. They generally have no idea what bitcoin is. For example, one of the common arguments used is abc coin is better or who is to say another crypto can't take bitcoin's place? Fair reasoning, but that's where their argument stops. They literally parrot a headline they read. They don't put in the work. They can't explain their position. It reminds me when I say a NBA superstar makes $40 million a year and they scoff and say that's outrageous. No research, no thought process, pure emotions.

My thought is that bitcoin is headed towards 500-1,000,000 within the next 5-10 years. I consider this conservative. The lack of putting in the work or putting in the work will have a massive, massive effect on the wealth of you and your family in the next 5-10 years. Many who don't put in the work now will generally fomo in and potentially lose much of their net worth-JUST LIKE THEY DID FROM 2006-2008 IN HOUSING. I am American and can tell you the vast majority will end up with no assets. Leased car, rented house, no retirement. I am closing in on 40 and my research leads me to the following conclusion:

For the first time in our history, at least my generation's, those in the middle and the bottom have a decent chance to better their situation. What is going on with $ printing and interest rates reminds me keenly of 2008-when everything fell apart but the grey haired said it was a bump in the road, things were fine. Those same people are telling us they can taper, that they can normalize rates, or sweet jesus, rates will actually go up.

I don't write this to scare you. I don't think the world will burn down. It will simply change. IMHO, we are 15-20 years away from a real disaster when the dollar finally has it's exit...but we aren't even close to that yet. 

THIS IS A ONCE IN HUMAN HISTORY EVENT. A FIAT SYSTEM ON IT'S WIND DOWN OF 50 YEARS. AN EXPONENTIAL CHANGE OF TECH. SOCIAL UNREST INCREASING. THERE WILL BE DIGITAL WALLETS IN EVERY NEW PHONE IN 5 YEARS.

The people in the government do not care about you. They care about the wealthy and they care about keeping those in power, in power. The #1 way to lose power is a bad economy...and so they will keep doing what they are doing. And especially with the bad economic news, they will refuse to taper or raise rates. Every time-100% of the time-that there has been a recession, the fed has cut rates twice. 100% of the time. Keep that in mind when they say rates will go up.

The price of bitcoin is all about the trading at the margin. We know that 70% of people are long term holders-what really happens is the behavior on the margin.

My 2 cents: the next quarter, if it comes with at least 2 S&amp;P 500 companies and an ETF or futures based etf, will drive the price parabolic. And the most critical people, the ones that scoff tulips, will chase it far above 500.

If you choose to buy bitcoin or not buy it, I hope you have a reason. In my opinion: in 5 years you will be at a couples dinner date. And the guy with the 1500 sat score, the high iq, the guy who did everything right will be waiting for the valet. The Bentley will be brought around to the guy with the 1200 SAT, the guy with the C average. The only reason is that he will have put in the work.",1630813005,8,1

Home in a sunny region, with the beach right outside my house with its own private garden, swimming pool and artificial water fountain.

My day to day would be doing charity work, perhaps teaching economics part time in a school, looking after my garden, learn to surf.

Have always wanted to open an animal shelter‚Ä¶.perhaps even a small farm. Hopefully the running cost would be too expensive its just food right like corn and veg since most farm animals dont eat meat.

Weekend it is poker and perhaps drinks here and there. Want to own a nightclub but prob too many moving parts‚Ä¶maybe can just be a shareholder in one.

Own a lambo but unless it has auto pilot I would be riding around in a Tesla (yes i am super lazy to drive, imo its dead time i could be reading instead during the journey).

Japanese food most of the time, more white meat less red meat, by that time they should have perfected the plant based stuff so i can eat with a clean conscience.

Holiday in vegas, thailand and switzerland, maybe australia during the winter‚Ä¶..not private jet but maybe first class will do just as well.

They dont understand that if the amount of goods is staying the same or is less... and you create more than double amount of money in the system, prices will go also double.

If you dont increase prices to double, you will have shorttages.

I dont know if keynesians indoctrination went too far and they dont realize this simple fact, or 90% of people just dont get it at all.

They will be suprised that their stocks are not rising as fast as prices of goods and in fact, they will lose buypower..  Thats because workers at Amazon will not bring 2x amount of boxes and increase productivity by amount of money being printed...

To compensate for that, you need something that is not correlated, something thats is fixed, something that is scarce. You need bitcoin.

For the longest time I refused to look into this thing because what could be so great about it? Then I got interested because a friend started investing. But I know now they don't really understand what they are investing in. And that is fine I guess. 

Anyway, I then spent a few days watching Andreas Antonopoulos speeches on YT and was captivated by his presentations. Such passion, so many great speeches. Beautiful human being. I also looked at a few kinda technical explanations here and there and slowly started getting the gist of it. A bit. 

As I got more and more excited, I realised there was no other way but to look up the original white paper. 

I have seen the light now. 

This tech is like, in the wind, man. You can't see it but it's there. It's blowing over all the continents, through all the countries, all the homes, all offices, all government buildings. 

The world is gonna dissolve itself in this tech. It will consume everything.

pildg3,Get_the_nak,Serious Proposal: Nakamoto is the new name of the 5th decimal of Bitcoin.,"Serious Proposal: Nakamoto is the new name of the 5th decimal of Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Why name a decimal?

&amp;#x200B;

A: Like satoshi (0.00000001 BTC) it is easier if decimals have names.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Why do we need Nakamoto, we have Satoshi?

&amp;#x200B;

A: The satoshi to bitcoin ratio is 100 million. The Nakamoto is in between bitcoin and satoshi, because the satoshi to bitcoin ratio is a little bit to big for regular everyday business. Not much in your everyday life costs one bitcoin or one satoshi.

&amp;#x200B;

It is easier to say that a sandwich costs 4 Nakamoto than to say it costs 

0,00004 bitcoin or 4000 satoshi. This will help when you remember and compare prices.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Why the 5th decimal? 

&amp;#x200B;

A: There is a need to do business today not tomorrow and to compare with the dollar is reasonable for most people. Today you get 2 Nakamotos for one USD. This will help regular people understand the value. It will also help business owners list prices both locally and on the web. 

Yes the value will change but it will be possible to keep it within understandable ratios for at least a few years, to promote adoption.

If BTC reaches 100k then one dollar buys one Nakamoto. If BTC reaches 200k then you pay 2 dollars for a Nakamoto. Of course we do not know anything about the future value but if it goes down you can say: now you can get 5 Nakamotos for a dollar!

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Why not use the metric system and call it millibitcoin or similar?

&amp;#x200B;

A: I do not think people will use that name and also it will not give the 5th decimal a ""special"" meaning. You might talk about millibitcoin one day and the next day you say microbitcoin and it is confusing.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Why the name Nakamoto?

&amp;#x200B;

A: Following the ""naming convention"" of satoshi for the smallest unit, it is a tribute to the original creator of Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: But why?

A: I think this will facilitate adoption.

And I think it will solve everyday problems of displaying prices in shops, bars, webshops and wallets.

&amp;#x200B;

That is my Nakamoto.

(Note: at the time of writing this post one Nakamoto equals 50 cents)

&amp;#x200B;

pil184,Equivalent-Boat-4091,Question: Moving to Germany to cash out HODLed crypto,"Hey,  I've learned today that in there's no capital gain tax on crypto held  for more than one year in Germany. I'm an EU citizen so moving to  Germany is not much of a problem, and in comparison with other place  where I could stay (and tax the cashout), I would gain 120k-250k more  from what I'm planning to cash out. That's worth of a ""lost"" year.

I'd  only like to do the bare minimum to have tax residency for maybe 2022  there. I don't think I'd actually stay in the apartment there. I also  don't want to work there or even register as freelancer (it makes it too  complicated).

The way I see what should be done (based on my experiences moving around EU quite a lot), I'd have to

\- find a cheap apartment

\- register in local population register with rental contract

\- arrange social and health insurance (necessary?)

\- get a bank account

\- cash out the crypto and move it to the bank account

\- get a tax consultant and submit german tax report for 2022

\- move money where I need (feed the german tax report to the receiving bank to show this is clean money)

\- leave das Reich in the end of the year

Expenses are 20k total for the year.

Is  there any business arranging this in Germany? Is there any business  arranging this in other crypto tax heave? (portugal, malta,..?)

Is there anyone who actually moved there and cashed crypto?",1630874871,124,1

What they really mean is exchanging BTC for a local currency like USD.

Today in 2021 nearly all purchases in the US are priced in dollars and it‚Äôs necessary to exchange BTC to USD to spend it unless the merchant takes BTC. However, BTC is no less a currency than the Euro or Yen, which also need to be converted into USD unless the merchant takes EUR/JPY.

Instead of ‚Äúselling BTC for cash,‚Äù think ‚Äúexchanging BTC for USD/your local currency.‚Äù

*Most countries don‚Äôt recognize BTC as a currency/cash so whether we think of BTC as cash, exchanging it still creates capital gains and losses.

pihc6a,HopefulInformation,Private keys and addresses,"Can someone please explain to me how all this works. I‚Äôm so confused. 
So every btc  has a public address that anyone can look up (link it to you possibly) and you can send receive crypto on that address. Where do you create the address? And if your using Ledger then that will automatically give you an address to store it in. 
Ledger will give you a seed phrase to access the address. Now if you don‚Äôt use ledger, how do you get a private key? Coinbase and Celsius all crypo stored on their wallets so you don‚Äôt need one. 
And I heard about keys.lol. What is that site? It says it displays all public addresses of btc. So does that include ledger addresses, CB addresses etc? And it has the private keys for each address?",1630862951,20,1

could newer cryptos have a much lower rate of loss? 

i am very sure that btc will lost in perhaps amazing amounts. this will be evident in perhaps 10 years when early holders start to die with insufficient provisions for passing on private keys. i know that parents often do not want the estate transferred prior to their deaths so will tend not to give keys prior to death and will also be paranoid about entrusting an attorney with private keys -- I sure would be. 

There are schemes whereby the private keys are split up for example and perhaps only the will contains the list of people who can working together reassemble the private keys but this is far from foolproof.",1630726007,9,1

But right now I'm earning 6% lending out my bitcoin on Nexo. Is there any meaningful difference between someone earning passive income from lending instead of staking? Lending provides a service: the use of the capital, but so does staking: securing the network.

If you loaned out your bitcoin to someone who used it to buy mining rigs, then wouldn't it be literally the same as proof of stake income?

I had a meeting today with a very nice person regarding crypto currency. Somehow this person started talking to me about Bitcoin, seemed very excited, but I was at first kind of suspicious. I am a very busy VC and I had called my private banker months ago about Bitcoin, and was redirected to some broker lady that wanted to sell me some shares in some company buying into some Bitcoin. However after going through this process Bitcoin seemed a bit scammy and stayed away.

I still remained genuinely interested in Bitcoin and this nice person told me to forget about ""brokers"", ""investment managers"" basically everything and everybody circling me and wanting my money. I was told that Bitcoin is available directly to me and wouldn‚Äôt need the ‚Äúhelp of suited monkeys‚Äù, I can only imagine if this person viewed me as a suited monkey?

I was referred to try Coinbase and Bitstamp as first steps and more education would come on self custody after I finished my first purchase. 

I‚Äôm happy to say, today was my first purchase!

Something everyone doesn‚Äôt realize, is that there are plenty of wealthy people out there, genuinely interested in Bitcoin. But we just do not have the proper angle, the proper contacts, the proper knowledge. We are geniuses with money, but simply do not understand the crypto world, and do not know anyone honestly advising us how to approach. Thankfully I met this kind stranger and learned more from them than my $500/hour paid executive assistants and money managers. I only wish I had the opportunity to thank this kind stranger.

phg8uf,Iva_321,3 common trading mistakes you should avoid.,"1. Closing trades out of fear

You have surely experienced this before: You got into a trade, took a quick profit, only to see the market run and run from there. You‚Äôre left behind scrambling to find a re-entry.

Let a trend run its course. You will never make a meaningful profit if you‚Äôre always quick to sell. If you consistently miss out on huge profits because you keep a tight stop, you‚Äôre probably too fearful. Also don‚Äôt close a position because it‚Äôs ‚Äòtoo high‚Äô, or because ‚Äòanything can happen‚Äô. Huge profits are your breadwinners, so hold onto a trend until you have enough evidence for a reversal.

When prices trend up, you stay long. When prices start to trend down, you reverse short. If a reversal turns out to be false, have a re-entry strategy.

Avoid predicting where prices will go next, but follow a trend as it is given to you by the market. Don‚Äôt force your beliefs onto it. Rookies love to hear predictions, so do news pundits on CNBC. They thirst for absolute certainty but the truth is that you will never have absolute certainty when dealing in financial markets. It‚Äôs a bitter pill to swallow.

You need to work on a systematic process with trading rules that promise a statistical edge over a long period of time. You can achieve this by maximizing your risk-to-reward ratio for every trade (let winners run), or you can minimize your risk per trade by losing as little as possible (close losing trades fast). Ideally, you aim for both and can come out profitable even with a 40% win ratio.

Trust your trading rules and trust the process. You should seek out an experienced trading mentor if you need help with that.

2. Waiting for endless confirmations

Take a recent downtrend that I shorted back in February. I was watching the price action between bulls and bears at a critical level and expected a bounce back. Instead, bulls simply let the bears cut through it. It was a defeat and a sign for me to reverse short immediately.

Avoid waiting until every single indicator confirms your move. Going short and placing a stop at a nearby peak meant a tiny risk for me. Rookies, however, hesitated because the MACD didn‚Äôt crossover yet. They stayed away because the RSI has flattened. It‚Äôs ‚Äòmixed signals‚Äô everywhere. By the time they finally realize that they should have gotten in, the risk-to-reward ratio already shifted badly against them.

Bears crashed prices further down until March. While profits from my short position increased day after day, rookies watched the market in disbelief. Their charts are cluttered with indicators in hope that they can give them definite answers.  Without realizing it, indicators have become an excuse for not pulling the trigger.

phfqpi,polloponzi,BITCOIN IS SEPERATE FROM ‚ÄúCRYPTO‚Äù,"The difference between the two is becoming more and more apparent as bitcoin is poised to challenge the world‚Äôs monetary system.

There are many out there who believe that Bitcoin falls under the ""crypto"" umbrella. This could not be further from the case. ""Crypto"" is designated for the affinity scams that launched in Bitcoin's wake and attempt to leverage its pedigree and latch on to its narrative to sell useless tokens to unwitting noobs. The affinity scammers believe they can ""beat"" Bitcoin by providing a feature set and a ""culture"" that turns out to be more appealing to the masses and thus makes individuals more likely to pick their favorite ""crypto"" over the best money humans have ever come into contact with.

These people couldn't be more delusional. The success of Bitcoin doesn't depend on the ""culture"" of bitcoiners. Bitcoin is an amoral and dumb protocol that has no way of knowing the ""culture"" of its users. And if it is successful it will be used by many different people from many far off lands with very different cultures. A cultural hold on a particular competitive landscape of social media LARPing doesn't really matter at the end of the day. Whether or not certain pseudonyms or blow hard VCs on Twitter are partial toward your favorite ""crypto"" is nothing more than noise. It is inconsequential in the long-run.

What really matters is the quality of Bitcoin's monetary policy and the public's confidence that the policy will be respected in the long-run. The best way to build confidence in that policy is to make the cost of attempting to change that policy, or falling out of line with the consensus rules of the network as high as possible. Nothing in ""crypto"" comes close to Bitcoin in these regards, and that is because the Bitcoin network is slowly but surely integrating itself into the energy sector of the globe. The execution risks associated with mining Bitcoin have become very high. If a miner fucks up and falls out of consensus, they are punished materially by missing out on precious block reward payouts. As the network becomes more ingratiated with the energy sector, these costs will rise and abiding by the monetary policy put forth by the network of full nodes will be paramount.

Heck, it already was in 2017 when the biggest corporate players and miners attempted to hard fork a block space increase that fell out of consensus with the full nodes on the network. The unwillingness to follow consensus ruined reputations and lost a lot of miners a lot of money over the four years that have followed the hard fork. This is what gives people certainty that bitcoin is a suitable monetary good in the digital age.

All of ""crypto"" LARPs focused on speed, app building, and being less ""energy intensive"" have completely missed the plot and have relegated themselves to a hedonistic sand box filled with degenerate gamblers and low energy thinkers.

Bitcoin has already won because it has won the energy game. And the energy game is what will protect Bitcoin's monetary policy in the long-run because it will be strongly incentivized by full nodes to do so. Very few understand this.

Final thought...

Mosquitoes, man. I hate em.

Fidelity said, Bitcoin could reach 1b \[1\]. I was researching how much capital is available worldwide to make Fidelity's prediction possible. 

I checked the Money Project \[2\] and other sources and I found that there would NOT be enough capital available. BTC@1b would demand 21 quadtrillion to be possible. But there are much less liquid resources available.

What am I missing? Is (hyper-)inflation key to that prediction?

This is a view from a good friend of mine who is an expert on the subject and well in the know.

Nobody knows where the USD supposedly backing it goes. Most of it is in ‚Äúcommercial paper‚Äù they said, but the investors who work in that industry say they‚Äôve never heard of them.

This seems impossible because at their scale, that would make them, like, the 5th largest commercial paper investor on Wall Street. How could commercial paper investors not heard of them?

Unlike Bitcoin, Eth, and other coins, Tether was always claimed to be backed by something which ensured it's stable value. Tether the company claims that their tether coins are each worth $1.
There are now &gt;$60Bn worth of Tether coin issued. With that much money they'd be a very serious private financial institution, and yet they only have 13 employee's. They have never been audited by any independent third party. They have repetitively lied about who owns the company (the same people who own Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange own Tether, and yet did not disclose that until it was found out). They have receptively changed their story on what backs Tether coin (originally each coin had $1 in a bank account to back it, now it's majoritively unspecified ""commercial paper"").
There is nothing which proves that Tether actually is backed by anything and the billions in new Tether coin which are minted could very well be worthless. Institutionalized investors allegedly sending billions of dollars to Tether, despite tether lying about their reserves, committing fraud by claiming to be fully backed when they were not, and reported by Bloomberg to be under DOJ criminal investigation for bank fraud.

There was never anywhere near a trillion dollars put into the crypto system. The miners created multi-millions of imaginary tokens without putting any dollars into the system. Those miner imaginary tokens came out of thin air, not from people investing dollars into the system.

If only 10% of those tokens are cashed out instead of ""hodl"", the $50 billion in tethers and few other dollars would instantly be depleted. The miners have a lot more than 10% to sell.

It is a classic Ponzi. All is fine when more people are sucked into putting in dollars (to pay the miners who put in zero dollars). But when people want to cash out, there is not enough dollars in the entire Ponzi to pay 10% of the imaginary tokens. The small amount of cash in the Ponzi runs out and the Ponzi collapses. It is very simple and does not require any complex conspiracy theory.",1630772742,3,1

pqxifn,AllenDo,I think the BTC wallet security calculation is WRONG,"Hi all

I think the BTC wallet security calculation is WRONG

Here is the wrong logic:

If I am using 24 words, then the possible combination is 2048\^24, which need a xxxx super computer in xxxx galaxy in xxxxx billion years.

Yes I get it

But i think it is WRONG.

 The assumption is using the computer to test all of the possible combinations in the BTC 24 words universe. But the problem I more worried about is: Can someone generate the same seed phrase to me. The possibility is calculated as below

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming 1 billion wallets will be created after mass adoption. This is the same as throw M balls in total of N boxes and ask what is the opportunity of 2 or more balls ended up in the same box (2 or more people ended up with the same private key), where M=10\^9 and N=2048\^24.

The total possible situation is N\^M----every ball ended up with N possible cases and M balls in total-----this is the denominator

&amp;#x200B;

Numerator is the possible cases allowed. meaning pick M boxes from total of N boxes and put a ball in it. order doesnt matter so the answer is 

C-N-M=N!/\[M!(N-M)!\]

SO over all, the chance of no one generate the same wallet private key would be N!/\[M!(N-M)!(N\^M)\]

&amp;#x200B;

So the chance someone generate the same key would be 1-N!/\[M!(N-M)!(N\^M)\]

where N=2048\^24;

M is the wallet created; 

N!=1\*2\*3\*....\*N;

pqv1qz,Cruxicil,Question: How Exactly does Bitcoin Deal with Sybil Attacks,"I was wondering what happens if a malicious actor is somehow able to create fake full nodes on the Bitcoin network, which total to more than half of Bitcoin's real full nodes. In this way, the attacker would be able to put fake transactions on these nodes (By forking Bitcoin core and modifying its code, for example) and make the entire network agree on them since he has 51% of all nodes (not hashing power) in the network. I know that having more than 51% of the hashing power is practically impossible and is referred to as a 51% attack, but I don't think it is impossible for someone to create tens/hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin full nodes. In the end, it is just disk space.

I searched this question up on the internet and found out that such an attack is referred to as a Sybil attack. However, all the answers I found are quite unclear to me... For example, [this answer](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/50922/whats-a-sybil-attack) from stack exchange:

&gt;Sybil attacks are avoided in Bitcoin by requiring block generation ability to be proportional to computational power available through the proof-of-work mechanism. That way, an adversary is limited in how many blocks they can produce. This provides strong cryptographic guarantees of Sybil resilience.

I don't really understand this sentence and more specifically, what is meant by ""block generation ability"". I noticed that some answers bring 51% of attacks into the mix But I don't understand what 51% of attacks have to do with Sybil attacks as a 51% attack concerns the miners whereas a Sybil attack concerns the nodes.

One solution that I could think of is that the network would reject so many nodes being created all at once and since everyone is able to verify the date of creation of these nodes, it is clear that it is an attack. However, since I am not skilled enough to read the code, I don't know if such a check is implemented anywhere.

I hope all this makes any sense...

I was hoping to cover as much terrain as I could, but I wanted to explore an angle and I wanted to know what you think from the perspective of an international investor.  


Would Bukele Pinochet'ing El Salvador's economy, or puppeteering it if he consolidates authoritarian power, prove the nation's economy to show more stable and therefore more enticing to invest on Bitcoin?, Be it from the confort of one's home or visiting the country?.  


Or would you think the association of Bitcoin and worst case scenario Bukele prove challenging to spread Bitcoin's adoption as legal tender worldwide?.

pqsfn3,Br00dlord,Why Bitcoin won't be the currency of the future,"I'm aware that this might be a bit of an unpopular opinion, but let me preface this by mentioning that I believe that the technology behind crypto is terrific, and will definitely change the world as we know it today. The only issue I see, is that many people are expecting that in the decades to come, everyone will use Bitcoin as a legal tender, and my humble Macroeconomics knowledge tells me that it won't work. But why? Bitcoin tokenomics are not designed for a currency IMHO. The simple fact that there's a limited supply of Bitcoin makes it unsuitable for the modern economy. 

Let's imagine the hypothetical scenario that Bitcoin is the only legal tender in the world starting from tomorrow. Obviously the price will skyrocket on that news, and afterwards - with demand increasing and supply limited, the price of BTC will keep going up, up and up. That's great for everyone holding it, but what happens next? Well, imagine if every day your money gets more valuable - who in their right mind would spend their Bitcoin? Why buy ice cream for 10 sats today when you can buy two icecreams for 10 sats tomorrow. And with that sudden change of currency, people would be economically motivated to spend as little as possible because each Sat spent is a bit of profit wasted. 

Now how long do you feel it will take before all the producers of the world see the sudden slump in demand and just start producing less and less?

That leads to my point. A deflationary currency in today's economy will essentially boost the value of financial assets to infinity, and of physical assets to 0 (hence why no one will be motivated to produce anything). As I see the scenario, everyone will be a gazillionaire, but there will be nothing to buy out there, since there's no incentive to produce.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR If there's a limited supply of the world's currency, it incentivizes people to hold onto their money instead of spending it, leading to a drop in supply of all types of consumer goods.

&amp;#x200B;

I might be wrong, but if you see this play out in any different way, can you help me understand how our modern society will function with a currency that has a finite supply?",1631992033,51,1

pqs04c,rossli,My favorite conspiracy theory about bitcoin.,"My favorite conspiracy theory about bitcoin is that Satoshi Nakomoto is an alien.

Now, why an alien and if he is then why would an alien make bitcoin? Those two things go hand in hand and here is the rationale:

There have been many high powered individuals who would be in the know about aliens if they existed and if we(humanity) have been in contact with aliens/seen them. The list of people includes Canadian foreign minister, 
the director of the Israeli space program, many scientists and generals. Usually the claimants are retired and they seem to always have a version of the same story. The aliens are here,
they are not hostile and they want to give us space technology. However they will not do so until we calm the fuck down, establish peace and a global government. 
So peace and global government.

But why bitcoin? How does bitcoin accomplish the supposed goals of the mysterious peaceful space aliens?

""Money is the sinews of war""  -Cicero

There are many examples of war stopping or not starting because one side was simply to poor to pay for it, war is after all a costly business. One notable example is pre-revolutionary France's 
inability to send an army to help the patriots in the dutch civil war against the Orangists(British) once the Prussians entered the fray on the Orangist side in 1787, this weakened the French regime
and contributed to the revolution. Long story short you need money to fight wars and if you don't have it, can't borrow it or ~~steal~~ tax it you are not going to war. There was however 
discovered a workaround, you can tax through inflation(money printing) and in the great war that is what was done and has been going on since then (or even as early as the American civil 
war). Now what does this have to do with bitcoin? Well if you introduce a border-less currency that can't be inflated by fiat then warmongers are shit out of luck and through lack of conflict
because of it's great cost and a trusted international monetary system we might move closer to a peaceful global world, paving the way for awesome space alien technology.

Now, what is the likelihood of this being the case? Who the hell knows, still, fun to think about.",1631990564,79,1

That combined with the need to have your identity associated with the wallet, and a possible requirement for businesses to use Chivo makes me think there might be something dangerous here.

It sounds like Chivo is a centrally managed wallet, meaning the El Salvador govt is holding everyone's bitcoins that are using the wallet, and with the identity thing, they are able to track all of the transactions between people. 

Yep, you can pay bitcoins into the wallet from other bitcoin apps, and supposedly for the free $30 you get to start, it is reported that after it is transferred a few times, it is allowed to leave the network. 

I feel this is just asking for a Mt Gox style event to happen, but on a much much bigger scale. An entire nation's money is being controlled by the central govt. When you look at your phone and see you have 2 BTC on there... is it really there? What if the central server gets hacked? What if the govt needs to raise money to fight a war, save the poor, or fight covid? Can it just dip in there, spending the bitcoins to do it, but not subtracting it from accounts, basically doubling the money. 

I am all for this great promise of a bitcoin currency, but with the principles that back up bitcoin, most notably not relying on a central authority. To me it looks like El Salvador govt is getting the benefit of accumulating on the back of the citizens, while creating a parallel fake bitcoin currency that people use to get more bitcoins into the system.

If you don't control the money, then it isn't your money.

Note: this is all based on what I am skimming out of issues related to the news of the roll out of this wallet. I could be wrong, but this certainly isn't an open source verifiable decentralized wallet, and that on a big scale is pretty scary.",1631139896,8,1

Adoption of Bitcoin has a strong potential to reset this game and loosen their financial grip. In such situation, they could resolve to the old ways of enforcing influence.

It seems that the key players of world politics would be the last to realise defeat. But when that time finally comes, what else is there to do than fight?

I'm kind of new to the space but I have a decent grasp the basics of how wallets and the lightning network function. However, I'm starting to get overwhelmed by the problem of trying to integrate payments and paying off credit cards and all that stuff. I'm not sure if my problems have solutions at this stage in the development of BTC but let me lay them out for you. I imagine that maybe some of the problems I'm having could be solved by a new business model. I would really appreciate some help. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm a personal chef.  I have about 8 clients that currently pay me USD through Venmo or Paypal. None of them are into crypo enough to pay me through the lightning network. But even if they did how do I pay my creditcards and bills from my lightning wallet? (Breez or Strike). Do I have to convert withdraw to USD and then pay them? Is there a service that will automatically do that conversion for me and that is also integrated with the a lighting wallet? It's not worth it to me to add steps in paying my bills just to use the lightning network. So that my first problem that I can't seem to figure out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second problem. As I said, my clients currently pay me in USD. I already pay a %2.5 - %3.5 percent processing fee. Is there a platform that can invoice my clients in USD and then automatically buy BTC at .3%? [lvl.co](https://lvl.co) has a native USD checking account to the platform but I would have to buy BTC manually. LVL also doesn't use lightning. Is there any other platforms that have native FDIC insured checking accounts? 

Bascially, I'm trying to be native to BTC but trying my integrate my business is overwhelming me at this point. I would really appreciate some help on my journey. 

Thanks a lot,

The 3D printing is meh.. some layer separation.. looks like the speed was turned up.. nibs.. etc.. 

Anyways.. setup my roller coaster guy, it worked for about 2 weeks.. then stepper motor started screeching.  Quickly unplugged it, seems the gear sticks at one spot. Plugged it back in and it seemed to work.. until this morning he was flopped over pointing up.  Seems stepper motor no longer is working.  Sent an email to [support@voltagegoat.com](mailto:support@voltagegoat.com) and got an email back that they are done for the year.  Will not respond to any emails until January.

pr7fow,DecentralizedLaw,New Shocking US Crypto Regulation Far More Invasive [Due Diligence],"# New US Crypto Regulation Far More Invasive Than We Thought

**US Congress intends to regulate crypto on a level far deeper  than currently understood‚ÄïThey will:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Designate Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks as commodities and regulate their transactions accordingly;
* Create legal uncertainty for all other crypto projects and ICOs by allowing them to be labeled as securities;
* Ban the use of (unauthorized) stablecoins;
* Introduce penalties for the use of mixers and privacy coins;
* Rebrand smart-contracts that take longer than 24 hours to deliver as futures contracts and regulate them accordingly;
* Re-define  legal tender and change the way money is created by the Federal  Reserve; and authorize the issuing of a digital USD of which all  transactions are recorded;
* Introduce foreign regulations into US law for all virtual asset service providers in the US (and with US clients). This would not be done to then never use it.

&amp;#x200B;

**In short: Congress wants to bring crypto-currencies under full oversight and control.**

These  new regulations introduce massive regulatory burdens on existing  projects, ban and criminalize current normal activities, restrain  innovation and free enterprise, and even introduce a transparent central  bank digital digital currency that redefines money as we know it!

According  to United States representative Don Beyer, congress should incorporate  ‚Äúdigital assets into existing financial regulatory structures.‚Äù(1) As you will see, they intend to do just that.

And it will change the way things are done for crypto forever‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;What This Post Is About_

This  post provides an overview of the crypto legislation currently  (September 2021) being put through US congress.

It does not just look at  the proposed bills, but rather at the wide range of laws that are to be  amended.

Once all the puzzle pieces are put together, the big  picture reveals shockingly strict regulations of crypto and a complete  overhaul of the idea of ‚Äúmoney.‚Äù This could have serious effects not  only on the crypto sector, but also on the financial system as a whole.

Behind  the excuses of preventing money laundering and ensuring investor  protection, the use of crypto is transformed in something it was not  supposed to be. Especially delicate is the fact that part of this legislation is drafted outside the US.

***Disclaimer***\*:  This report provides a high-level overview of the US laws that are to  be introduced/amended by two new bills. Its depth is limited by the inadequate knowledge of the author of the large body of US law involved, and given that these bills are subject to amendments and have not even passed into law yet, none of this information can be considered legal or financial advice.\*

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;What Is Going On?

On April 06, 2021, a ‚Äúmust pass‚Äù bill was introduced called the ‚ÄúInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act‚Äù(2)  (‚ÄúInfrastructure Bill‚Äù). It passed in the House of Representatives and,  after fierce debate, the Senate. Hidden in this bill, an amendment to  the Internal Revenue Code was added. It introduced new reporting  requirements and obligations for record keeping.

While this bill  created a lot of public outcry, more recently, a real game-changing bill  was introduced in the House on July 28, 2021, namely the: ‚ÄúDigital  Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act‚Äù (3) (‚ÄúDigital Asset Bill‚Äù).

This  bill proposes amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank Secrecy  Act, Securities Exchanges Acts, and the Commodity Exchange Act. It  changes the definition of legal tender, and it introduces international  crypto regulation into US law.

This article looks at each of these amendments‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Commodities or Securities?_

The  main take-away is that two different bodies of law will apply to crypto  projects: commodities and securities laws. So far, only Bitcoin, Ether,  and their hard-forks are confirmed to be commodities (see below). All  other cryptos are subject to future guidance by market regulators:

*‚ÄúNot  later than 150 days after the date of the enactment of this section,  the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish, for purposes of a 60-day public  comment period, a proposed rulemaking that classifies each of the major  digital assets.*

***Not later  than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act***\*, the SEC and  CFTC shall jointly publish a final rule that classifies\* ***each of the top  25 major digital assets*** *by (i) highest market capitalization and (ii)  highest daily average trading volume as‚Äî*

*(1) a digital asset; or(2) a digital asset security.‚Äù* (4)

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretation:

* Cryptos will be subject to two different regulatory regimes: commodities and security regulations.
* Services  engaged with both digital assets (commodities) and digital asset  securities (securities) could be subjected to both regulatory regimes.

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Commodities Regulation_

The  Commodity Exchange Act regulates the trading of commodity futures in  the United States. Passed in 1936, it has been amended several times  since then.(5)  It provides federal regulation of all commodities and futures trading  activities and requires all futures and commodity options to be traded  on organized exchanges.

In 1974, the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission (CFTC) was created to oversee the market. With certain  exceptions, the CFTC has been granted exclusive jurisdiction over  commodity futures, options, and all other derivatives that fall within  the definition of a swap. Certain cryptos will be regulated as  commodities.

&amp;#x200B;

## Definition of ‚ÄúCommodity‚Äù Amended to Include Digital Asset:

First and foremost, Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act on definitions will be amended to read as follows:

*‚Äú****The term ‚Äúcommodity‚Äù means***  *wheat, cotton, rice, corn, oats, barley, rye, flaxseed, grain sorghums,  mill feeds, butter, eggs, Solanum tuberosum (Irish potatoes), wool,  wool tops, fats and oils (including lard, tallow, cottonseed oil, peanut  oil, soybean oil, and all other fats and oils), cottonseed meal,  cottonseed, peanuts, soybeans, soybean meal, livestock, livestock  products,* ***digital asset (including Bitcoin, Ether, and their hardforks)****,  and frozen concentrated orange juice, and all other goods and articles,  except onions (as provided by section 13‚Äì1 of this title) and motion  picture box office receipts (or any index, measure, value, or data  related to such receipts), and all services, rights, and interests  (except motion picture box office receipts, or any index, measure, value  or data related to such receipts) in which contracts for future  delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.‚Äù*(6)

&amp;#x200B;

## Digital Asset Definition

Next, the end of Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act will be amended by adding a clarification of what a digital asset is (7)(definition to long to post here)

&amp;#x200B;

## Smart Contracts with Delivery Time of More than 24 hours are Futures Contracts

A  sharpening of the definition of retail commodity transactions could  decrease the options for the use of smart contracts outside of regulated  exchanges.

Currently, Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act prohibits persons that are not *‚Äúeligible contract participants‚Äù* or *‚Äúeligible commercial entities‚Äù*  to engage in agreements, contract or transactions in commodities on  leverage, margin, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a  person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar  basis.(8)

Next,  additional amendments mentioned in the SEC. 202 of the Digital Asset  Bill applies this on transactions done by smart contract of which the  delivery takes longer than 24 hours:

*‚Äú(ii) ‚ÄÇExceptions*

*(III)‚ÄÇa contract of sale that‚Äì*

*(cc)  with respect to* ***digital assets***\*, results in\* ***actual delivery*** *(including  transfer of control over private keys) n****ot later than 24 hours after the  transaction is entered into*** *and such delivery is accomplished by  either-*

*(AA) recording the transaction on the public distributed ledger for the digital asset; or*

*(BB)  with respect to digital which are not recorded on a public distributed  ledger for the digital asset, reporting the transaction to a CFTC  registered digital asset trade repository; or‚Äù* (9)

&amp;#x200B;

## Dodd-Frank Act and Market Transparency

After  the 2008 financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act introduced strict  regulations for swaps. Naturally, these will also apply to digital  assets as well.

The definition of swaps, as provided by the  Commodity Exchange Act (section 1a(47)) is broad. For example, it could  refer to any ‚Äúagreement, contract or transaction‚Äù that ‚Äúprovides for any  purchase, sale, payment, or delivery that is dependent on the  occurrence, nonoccurrence, or the extent of the occurrence of an event  or contingency associated with a potential financial, economic, or  commercial consequence.‚Äù (10)

## Next, the Dodd-Frank bill authorizes the CFTC to:

* Regulate  swap dealers by installing capital and margin requirements, require  dealers to meet robust business conduct standards, and meet  recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
* Increase  transparency and improve pricing in the derivatives marketplace by  requiring standardized derivatives to be traded on regulated exchanges  or swap execution facilities and bring better pricing to the market  place and lower costs for businesses and consumers.
* Lower risk to the American public by moving standardized derivatives to central clearinghouses.(11)

&amp;#x200B;

## Digital Asset Trade Repository

To  meet the above mentioned market transparency requirement, the Commodity  Exchange Act stipulates the need for a digital asset trade repository  to collect information on SWAPS in order to provide the public with the  correct market information:

*‚ÄúThe  term ‚Äòdigital asset trade repository‚Äô means any person that collects and  maintains information or records with respect to transactions or  positions in, or the terms and conditions of, contracts of sale of  digital assets in interstate commerce entered into by third parties  (both on chain public distributed ledger transactions as well as off  chain transactions) for the purpose of providing a centralized  recordkeeping facility for any digital asset, but does not include a  private or public distributed ledger or the operator of either such  ledger unless such private or public distributed ledger or operator  seeks to aggregate/include ‚Äòoff chain‚Äô transactions as well.‚Äù* (12)

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretation Commodities Regulations:

* As  of writing, only BTC and Ether (and their hard-forks) will be confirmed  as commodities. All other cryptos could potentially be regulated as securities (what this means is explained next).
* The fact that novel technologies such as Bitcoin and Ether are to be  subjected to a large body of law that developed around the trading of  livestock and frozen concentrated orange juice could spell regulatory  uncertainty for various business models in the industry.
* No  ‚Äútrading on margin‚Äù is allowed outside regulated entities, unless done  by high-level investors called ‚Äúeligible contract parties.‚Äù This could  perhaps frustrate particular ideas about decentralized finance or OTC  markets.
* Smart contracts  that take longer than 24 hours to deliver could be considered futures  contracts under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. That smart contracts can  be labeled as futures contracts appears indeed to be the opinion of the  CFTC.(13)

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Securities Regulations_

In  the US, securities are regulated by the 1933 Securities Act.  Additionally, the 1934 Securities Exchange Act further regulates the  trade of securities, and established the SEC to oversee these markets.

## Definition of ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù Amended to Include Digital Asset Security:

First  and foremost, Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act will be  amended to include a ‚Äúdigital asset security‚Äù (and exclude ‚Äúdigital  assets‚Äù) in the definition of security:

*‚Äú(10)* ***The term ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù means***  *any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap,  bond, debenture, certificate of interest or participation in any  profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royalty or  lease, any collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or  subscription, transferable share, investment contract,* ***digital asset security***\*,  voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, any  put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate  of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest  therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle,  option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange  relating to foreign currency, or in general, any instrument commonly  known as a ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù; or any certificate of interest or participation  in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or  right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing;\* ***but shall not include any fiat currency, commodity, digital asset***\*,  or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker‚Äôs acceptance which has a  maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months,  exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which  is likewise limited.‚Äù\* (14)

## Digital Asset Security Definition

Next, the Digital Asset Bill (SEC. 101) defines what a digital asset security will be:

*‚Äú(A) IN GENERAL.‚ÄîThe term ‚Äòdigital asset security‚Äô means a digital asset that:*

*(i) Provides the holder of the digital asset with any of the following rights:*

*(I) Equity or debt interest in the issuer.*

*(II) Right to profits, interest, or dividend payments from the issuer.*

*(III)  Voting rights in the major corporate actions (which shall not include  new block creations, hardforks, or protocol changes related to the  digital asset) of the issuer.*

*(IV) Liquidation rights in the event of the issuer‚Äôs liquidation.*

*(ii)  In the case of an issuer with a service, goods, or platform that is not  wholly operational at the time of issuing such digital asset, with  respect to* ***any fundraising or capital formation activity (including initial coin offerings***\*)  which is accomplished through the issuance of such a digital asset,  issues such digital asset to a holder in return for money (including  other digital assets) to fund the development of the proposed service,  goods, or platform of the issuer.‚Äù\* (15)

&amp;#x200B;

## What does it mean to be regulated as a security?

Investing in securities in the US is regulated to:

*‚Äúprotect  interstate commerce, the national credit, the Federal taxing power, to  protect and make more effective the national banking system and Federal  Reserve System, and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets  in such transactions.‚Äù* (16)

Regulations  focus on both the issuing of securities (primary market), and  subsequent trade of such securities (secondary market).

The goal  of securities laws is firstly to require issuers to fully disclose all  material information that an investor would need in order to make up his  or her mind about the potential investment. A regulated company must  create a registration statement, which includes a prospectus, with  copious amounts of information about the security, the company, the  business, including audited financial statements.

Next, the  subsequent selling and trading in these securities is regulated, by  restricting trade to market places over which the regulator has  oversight. The Security Exchange Act section ¬ß78l(a) states:

*‚ÄúIt  shall be unlawful for any member, broker, or dealer to effect any  transaction in any security (other than an exempted security) on a  national securities exchange unless a registration is effective as to  such security for such exchange in accordance with the provisions of  this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder.‚Äù* (17)

&amp;#x200B;

## Summary of Securities Regulations:

* Crypto projects will need to be regulated and provide clear financial information for investors to make an informed decision.
* Trading of securities will generally take place on regulated exchanges.
* Any new fundraising or capital formation activity (including ICOs) are likely to be securities.
* When  a crypto is regulated as a security, the entire coin is subject to  strict regulations. In the case of commodities, only specific use cases  (futures) are regulated. It is a big difference.
* US  Congress is taking a leap of faith. It needs identifiable persons to  enforce a law upon. Who is going to be held accountable in a  decentralized network? Many issuing companies have handed control over  to network participants. Perhaps for this reason, Section 12(g) of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will be amended to allow the issuer to  apply for ‚Äúdesecuritization.‚Äù (18)  The question remains: who will apply for desecuritization once a  network is decentralized? The investors? Weren‚Äôt they the ones supposed  to be protected in the first place?

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Changing the Nature of Money_

These  regulations are not just about crypto. It is clearly part of a wider  discussion on the future of money. As shown below, this bill not only  changes the definition of money in the US, but also changes how money is  created!

As a first, in Section 5312(a)(3)(B) of title 31, US  Code (Money and Finance) digital assets are included as a monetary  instrument.(19)  However, Section 5103, of title 31, US Code will be amended to  specifically exclude digital assets and digital asset securities as  legal tender.(20)  And finally, it is determined that digital assets and digital asset  securities will not be covered by Federal Deposit Insurance (FDIC or  NCUA).(21)

&amp;#x200B;

## Introducing the Digital USD (or Central Bank Digital Currency/CBDC)

After  slamming the door on digital assets to be used as lawful money, the  Federal Reserve Act is amended to provide the Federal Reserve Board with  far reaching new powers; section 11 will be amended to say:

*‚Äú(d) To supervise and regulate through the Secretary of the Treasury the issue and retirement of Federal Reserve notes (****both physical and digital****),  except for the cancellation and destruction, and accounting with  respect to such cancellation and destruction, of notes unfit for  circulation, and to prescribe rules and regulations (****including appropriate technology****) under which such notes may be delivered by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Federal Reserve agents applying therefor.‚Äù* (22)

In addition, Federal Reserve notes will in the future also be issued digitally; an amendment to section 16 confirms this:

*‚ÄúFederal  reserve notes, to be issued at the discretion of the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System for the purpose of making advances to  Federal reserve banks through the Federal reserve agents as hereinafter  set forth and for no other purpose, are authorized. Notwithstanding any  other provision of law, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System is* ***authorized to issue digital versions of Federal reserve notes in addition***  *to current physical Federal reserve notes. Further, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, after consultation with the  Secretary of the Treasury, is* ***authorized to use distributed ledger technology for the creation, distribution and*** ***recordation of all transactions***  *involving digital Federal reserve notes. The said notes shall be  obligations of the United States and shall be considered legal tender  and shall be receivable by all national and member banks and Federal  reserve banks and for all taxes, customs, and other public dues. They  shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department  of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia,  or at any Federal Reserve bank.‚Äù* (23)

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretations on the Future of Money:

* The door is shut for the use of cryptos as legal tender.
* The  Federal Reserve Board is to be authorized to create and distribute a  ledger-based Federal reserve note that could be used for everyday  transactions in USD.
* Digital  federal reserve notes will make the ‚Äúrecordation‚Äù of all transactions  possible. Did they use this word because ‚Äúmonitoring all transactions‚Äù  would be too obvious? Recording all transactions without anyone looking  at them makes no sense.
* These  amendments significantly increase the power of the Federal Reserve.  Contrary to what is widely understood, the Fed does not ‚Äúprint money.‚Äù  It can only manage the money supply indirectly.(24)  The private sector ‚Äúcreates‚Äù most of what we use as money by issuing  credit. It is with the supply of credit by the private banks that the  monetary supply is inflated. Conversely, with the reduced demand for  credit, the money supply deflates. The Fed is not as powerful as it  wants the market to believe, and the Federal Reserve Act restricts a lot  of its actions. This amendment, however, could drastically expand the  authority of the Fed, by allowing them to create and distribute a  ‚Äúdigital USD‚Äù directly. It could change the entire structure of the  financial system and potentially have far reaching consequences.
* The  original idea behind the Federal Reserve was for private bank deposits  to be combined to provide an emergency line of credit in times of  economic stress.(25)  But if the Digital Dollar is based on a blockchain, how can it also be  based on reserves? And what mechanism will determine how funds (and how  much) are added to the economy? And where and how will they be  distributed? What about privacy and security? Will all this authority be  handed over to a board of seven unelected bureaucrats? This amendment  has the potential to change the way the Federal Reserve operates. This  deserves a wider discussion by economists and financial experts outside  the crypto-space as well.

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;International FATF Crypto Regulation Introduced in the US_

Those  paying attention to international anti-money laundering legislation  know that the following sections from the Digital Asset Bill originate  from guidance issued by the FATF (Financial Action Task Force). FATF is  an intra-governmental organization [creating financial legislation](https://decentralizedlegalsystem.com/fatf-bitcoin-regulations-summary/).

In March, the Paris based FATF issued draft guidance(26)  (‚ÄúFATF Guidance‚Äù) on a number of topics. And even though this guidance  hasn‚Äôt been finalized, there are already a number of points directly  included in the Digital Asset Bill.

&amp;#x200B;

## Banning the use of Stablecoins

Subchapter  I of chapter 51 of subtitle IV of title 31, United States Code,  department of treasury regulation, will be amended, to read as follows:

*‚Äú(a) IN GENERAL.‚ÄîBeginning on the date of the enactment of this section,* ***no person may issue, use, or permit to be used a digital asset fiat-based stablecoin*** *that is not approved by the Secretary of the Treasury under subsection (b).‚Äù*(27)

&amp;#x200B;

## Criminalizing the use of privacy coins and anonymizing services (mixers, coinjoins)

The  bank secrecy act is going to be amended to sanction the use of  anonymity-enhanced convertible virtual currencies and anonymizing  services.(28)  It is worth noting that willful violations of the bank secrecy act  could give rise to a fine of not more than $250,000, or imprisoned for  not more than five years, or both.(29)

&amp;#x200B;

## Introduction of the term Virtual Asset Service Provide (VASP) into US Law

As  a next step, the term Virtual Asset will be introduced into Section  5312(a) of title 31, United States Code. A Virtual Asset can be a  digital asset, or *‚Äúa digital representation of value that can be  digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or  investment purposes;‚Äù*(30)

So  far we have seen a number of definitions. To understand their  relationship, the following image was made based on the definition of  Virtual Asset according to Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States  Code:(31)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j832orezggo71.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d357f747bbfddd9db3c997e07953e556fc264ac5

&amp;#x200B;

Virtual  Asset is a broad definition; it covers most activities involving  cryptos. We can see in the Digital Asset Bill that entities that are  facilitating transactions in Virtual Assets are to be called ‚Äúvirtual  asset service providers,‚Äù or VASPS. Sec 301 of the Digital Asset Bill  defines a VASP:

*‚Äú(A) means a person who‚Äî*

*(i) exchanges between digital asset and fiat currencies*

*(ii) exchanges between digital assets;*

*(iii) transfers of digital assets;*

*(iv) is responsible for the custody, safekeeping of a digital asset or an instrument that enables control over a digital asset;*

*(v) issues or has the authority to redeem a digital asset; and*

*(vi) provides financial services related to the offer or sale of a digital asset by a person who issues such digital asset; and*

*(B) does not include any person who‚Äî*

*(i) obtains a digital asset to purchase goods or services for themself;*

*(ii) provides communication service or network access services used by a money transmitter; or*

*(iii)  develops, creates, or disseminates software designed to be used to  issue a digital asset or facilitate financial activities associated with  a digital asset.‚Äù* (32)

This  definition comes directly from the FATF Guidance, with the only  difference being that the US excludes the exchange between different  forms of one virtual assets. On the other hand, section (v) is a new  addition.

&amp;#x200B;

## The Big Picture: Global Regulation

The logic  behind this seems to be to first introduce a high-level definition  (including coins regulated as commodities, securities, and everything in  between). Next, any future global restrictions on the wider  crypto-space can be applied at this level.

From the latest FATF  Guidance, a number of possible additional restrictions can already be  deducted. Things to look out for are the restriction of the use of  ‚Äúunhosted wallets,‚Äù the introduction of the ‚Äútravel rule,‚Äù labeling  those who engage in peer-to-peer transactions as a risk, and a whole  host of other measures. (33)

One  additional aspect of VASP regulation mentioned in the FATF Guidance is  also included in the Digital Asset Bill; VASPS engaged in services which  are available in the United States and to United States persons, have  to be regulated in the United States, even if the provider is located  outside the United States. (34)

## Interpretation International Regulation in the US:

* International AML legislation, created by Paris-based FATF, is being introduced in the US.
* The  FATF term ‚Äúvirtual asset service provider‚Äù (VASP) is introduced in the  US. The definition is so broad that it covers practically all crypto  projects.
* After first being  in the FATF Guidance, the banning of stablecoins and anonymity-enhanced  cryptos and the obligation for VASPs to be licensed in the country of  their clients are included in the Digital Asset Bill.
* It  is not hard to imagine that other restrictions for cryptos currently  discussed by FATF, such as the travel rule and restricting unhosted  wallets, will be introduced next. This is not a regulation you introduce  to then never use.
* All VASPs with operating in the US or with US clients need to be regulated in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Amendments in the Infrastructure Bill_

Last  August saw public outcry over the US Infrastructure bill. It included a  section on IRS reporting for crypto. Some highlights:

## Clarification of Definition of Broker

It  makes sense that the tax authorities use a wide definition to cover all  possible economic activities in crypto. Section 80603 of the  Infrastructure Bill amendments the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,  provides that brokers need to report the activity of their clients to  the IRS and adds the following to the definition of broker:

*‚Äú(D)  any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly  providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf  of another person.‚Äù* (35)

## Reporting of Digital Assets

In addition, a unique wide definition of digital assets is added:

*‚Äúany  digital representation of value which is recorded on a  cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology  as specified by the Secretary.‚Äù* (36)

## Effective Date

Effective after December 31, 2023. So there is time.

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretation Infrastructure Bill

There  was a lot of commotion about this bill. This was mainly due to the wide  definitions used, which could cover all activities in the crypto space,  including mining. In response, according to an article on Bloomberg,  the U.S. treasury will shortly issue additional guidance, along the  lines of the following:

*‚ÄúOther  firms key to the nearly $2 trillion crypto market ‚Äî from developers and  miners to hardware and software providers ‚Äî won‚Äôt have any new  requirements, so long as they don‚Äôt also act as brokers, according to a  Treasury official‚Äù* (37)

At  a glance, it appears that this bill is not as invasive as originally  feared. It would also be impossible to enforce this legislation on  miners due to the nature of the technology.

In this case perhaps  it would have been better if clear definitions were used of what is, and  isn‚Äôt included. Moreover, comments from ‚Äúanonymous sources at the  treasury‚Äù do not provide real regulatory clarity. This industry too  easily accepts the opinions of officials as decree. But we are all,  including officials, subject to the law. Given that officials change  over time, opinions and guidance are not the way forward; clear laws are  needed.

The commotion also distracted from the massive changes  proposed in the Digital Asset Bill discussed in this post, which so  far have been ignored by the industry...

&amp;#x200B;

# &lt;TL;DR_

**Next to the infrastructure bill, a new bill was introduced in US Congress: the ‚ÄúDigital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act.‚Äù It is not law yet, could still be amended, and if it ever comes into effect it will likely not be this year/cycle. What it says:**

**Bitcon, Ether, and their hard-forks, are to be regulated as commodities. Smart-contracts taking longer to deliver than 24 hours are considered futures contracts and regulated as such.**

**Every other project and future ICO is potentially a security; guidance will be issued by CFTC/SEC. Issuers of securities are likely required to provide transparency and financial information to investors. Trade is generally restricted to regulated exchanges.**

**In addition, international anti-money laundering legislation is introduced in the US; Stablecoins, privacycoins, and mixers are to be prohibited. The high-level term VASP is introduced for almost all crypto projects, possibly to facilitate more future regulations.**

**Finally, the Federal Reserve gets shocking new powers to create and distribute a central bank digital currency (CBDC), of which all transactions are recorded.**",1632056226,1422,1
pr7efg,Hopeium_Littlefish,"If today a BTC whale has 1000, and an ETH whale has 10,000‚Ä¶. How much will you need to have to be a BTC and ETH whale in 5, 10, 15 years?",,1632056086,1,1

pr7c0p,DecentralizedLaw,Warning: New US Crypto Regulation Far More Invasive Than We Thought [Due Diligence],"# New US Crypto Regulation Far More Invasive Than We Thought

**US Congress intends to regulate crypto on a level far deeper  than currently understood‚ÄïThey will:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Designate Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks as commodities and regulate their transactions accordingly;
* Create legal uncertainty for all other crypto projects and ICOs by allowing them to be labeled as securities;
* Ban the use of (unauthorized) stablecoins;
* Introduce penalties for the use of mixers and privacy coins;
* Rebrand smart-contracts that take longer than 24 hours to deliver as futures contracts and regulate them accordingly;
* Re-define  legal tender and change the way money is created by the Federal  Reserve; and authorize the issuing of a digital USD of which all  transactions are recorded;
* Introduce foreign regulations into US law for all virtual asset service providers in the US (and with US clients). This would not be done to then never use it.

&amp;#x200B;

**In short: Congress wants to bring crypto-currencies under full oversight and control.**

These  new regulations introduce massive regulatory burdens on existing  projects, ban and criminalize current normal activities, restrain  innovation and free enterprise, and even introduce a transparent central  bank digital digital currency that redefines money as we know it!

According  to United States representative Don Beyer, congress should incorporate  ‚Äúdigital assets into existing financial regulatory structures.‚Äù(1) As you will see, they intend to do just that.

And it will change the way things are done for crypto forever‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;What This Post Is About_

This  post provides an overview of the crypto legislation currently  (September 2021) being put through US congress.

It does not just look at  the proposed bills, but rather at the wide range of laws that are to be  amended.

Once all the puzzle pieces are put together, the big  picture reveals shockingly strict regulations of crypto and a complete  overhaul of the idea of ‚Äúmoney.‚Äù This could have serious effects not  only on the crypto sector, but also on the financial system as a whole.

Behind  the excuses of preventing money laundering and ensuring investor  protection, the use of crypto is transformed in something it was not  supposed to be. Especially delicate is the fact that part of this legislation is drafted outside the US.

***Disclaimer***\*:  This report provides a high-level overview of the US laws that are to  be introduced/amended by two new bills. Its depth is limited by the inadequate knowledge of the author of the large body of US law involved, and given that these bills are subject to amendments and have not even passed into law yet, none of this information can be considered legal or financial advice.\*

## &lt;What Is Going On?

On April 06, 2021, a ‚Äúmust pass‚Äù bill was introduced called the ‚ÄúInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act‚Äù(2)  (‚ÄúInfrastructure Bill‚Äù). It passed in the House of Representatives and,  after fierce debate, the Senate. Hidden in this bill, an amendment to  the Internal Revenue Code was added. It introduced new reporting  requirements and obligations for record keeping.

While this bill  created a lot of public outcry, more recently, a real game-changing bill  was introduced in the House on July 28, 2021, namely the: ‚ÄúDigital  Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act‚Äù (3) (‚ÄúDigital Asset Bill‚Äù).

This  bill proposes amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank Secrecy  Act, Securities Exchanges Acts, and the Commodity Exchange Act. It  changes the definition of legal tender, and it introduces international  crypto regulation into US law.

This article looks at each of these amendments‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Commodities or Securities?_

The  main take-away is that two different bodies of law will apply to crypto  projects: commodities and securities laws. So far, only Bitcoin, Ether,  and their hard-forks are confirmed to be commodities (see below). All  other cryptos are subject to future guidance by market regulators:

*‚ÄúNot  later than 150 days after the date of the enactment of this section,  the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish, for purposes of a 60-day public  comment period, a proposed rulemaking that classifies each of the major  digital assets.*

***Not later  than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act***\*, the SEC and  CFTC shall jointly publish a final rule that classifies\* ***each of the top  25 major digital assets*** *by (i) highest market capitalization and (ii)  highest daily average trading volume as‚Äî*

*(1) a digital asset; or(2) a digital asset security.‚Äù* (4)

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretation:

* Cryptos will be subject to two different regulatory regimes: commodities and security regulations.
* Services  engaged with both digital assets (commodities) and digital asset  securities (securities) could be subjected to both regulatory regimes.

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Commodities Regulation_

The  Commodity Exchange Act regulates the trading of commodity futures in  the United States. Passed in 1936, it has been amended several times  since then.(5)  It provides federal regulation of all commodities and futures trading  activities and requires all futures and commodity options to be traded  on organized exchanges.

In 1974, the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission (CFTC) was created to oversee the market. With certain  exceptions, the CFTC has been granted exclusive jurisdiction over  commodity futures, options, and all other derivatives that fall within  the definition of a swap. Certain cryptos will be regulated as  commodities.

&amp;#x200B;

## Definition of ‚ÄúCommodity‚Äù Amended to Include Digital Asset:

First and foremost, Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act on definitions will be amended to read as follows:

*‚Äú****The term ‚Äúcommodity‚Äù means***  *wheat, cotton, rice, corn, oats, barley, rye, flaxseed, grain sorghums,  mill feeds, butter, eggs, Solanum tuberosum (Irish potatoes), wool,  wool tops, fats and oils (including lard, tallow, cottonseed oil, peanut  oil, soybean oil, and all other fats and oils), cottonseed meal,  cottonseed, peanuts, soybeans, soybean meal, livestock, livestock  products,* ***digital asset (including Bitcoin, Ether, and their hardforks)****,  and frozen concentrated orange juice, and all other goods and articles,  except onions (as provided by section 13‚Äì1 of this title) and motion  picture box office receipts (or any index, measure, value, or data  related to such receipts), and all services, rights, and interests  (except motion picture box office receipts, or any index, measure, value  or data related to such receipts) in which contracts for future  delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.‚Äù*(6)

&amp;#x200B;

## Digital Asset Definition

Next, the end of Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act will be amended by adding a clarification of what a digital asset is (7)(definition to long to post here)

&amp;#x200B;

## Smart Contracts with Delivery Time of More than 24 hours are Futures Contracts

A  sharpening of the definition of retail commodity transactions could  decrease the options for the use of smart contracts outside of regulated  exchanges.

Currently, Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act prohibits persons that are not *‚Äúeligible contract participants‚Äù* or *‚Äúeligible commercial entities‚Äù*  to engage in agreements, contract or transactions in commodities on  leverage, margin, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a  person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar  basis.(8)

Next,  additional amendments mentioned in the SEC. 202 of the Digital Asset  Bill applies this on transactions done by smart contract of which the  delivery takes longer than 24 hours:

*‚Äú(ii) ‚ÄÇExceptions*

*(III)‚ÄÇa contract of sale that‚Äì*

*(cc)  with respect to* ***digital assets***\*, results in\* ***actual delivery*** *(including  transfer of control over private keys) n****ot later than 24 hours after the  transaction is entered into*** *and such delivery is accomplished by  either-*

*(AA) recording the transaction on the public distributed ledger for the digital asset; or*

*(BB)  with respect to digital which are not recorded on a public distributed  ledger for the digital asset, reporting the transaction to a CFTC  registered digital asset trade repository; or‚Äù* (9)

&amp;#x200B;

## Dodd-Frank Act and Market Transparency

After  the 2008 financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act introduced strict  regulations for swaps. Naturally, these will also apply to digital  assets as well.

The definition of swaps, as provided by the  Commodity Exchange Act (section 1a(47)) is broad. For example, it could  refer to any ‚Äúagreement, contract or transaction‚Äù that ‚Äúprovides for any  purchase, sale, payment, or delivery that is dependent on the  occurrence, nonoccurrence, or the extent of the occurrence of an event  or contingency associated with a potential financial, economic, or  commercial consequence.‚Äù (10)

## Next, the Dodd-Frank bill authorizes the CFTC to:

* Regulate  swap dealers by installing capital and margin requirements, require  dealers to meet robust business conduct standards, and meet  recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
* Increase  transparency and improve pricing in the derivatives marketplace by  requiring standardized derivatives to be traded on regulated exchanges  or swap execution facilities and bring better pricing to the market  place and lower costs for businesses and consumers.
* Lower risk to the American public by moving standardized derivatives to central clearinghouses.(11)

&amp;#x200B;

## Digital Asset Trade Repository

To  meet the above mentioned market transparency requirement, the Commodity  Exchange Act stipulates the need for a digital asset trade repository  to collect information on SWAPS in order to provide the public with the  correct market information:

*‚ÄúThe  term ‚Äòdigital asset trade repository‚Äô means any person that collects and  maintains information or records with respect to transactions or  positions in, or the terms and conditions of, contracts of sale of  digital assets in interstate commerce entered into by third parties  (both on chain public distributed ledger transactions as well as off  chain transactions) for the purpose of providing a centralized  recordkeeping facility for any digital asset, but does not include a  private or public distributed ledger or the operator of either such  ledger unless such private or public distributed ledger or operator  seeks to aggregate/include ‚Äòoff chain‚Äô transactions as well.‚Äù* (12)

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretation Commodities Regulations:

* As  of writing, only BTC and Ether (and their hard-forks) will be confirmed  as commodities. All other cryptos could potentially be regulated as securities (what this means is explained next).
* The fact that novel technologies such as Bitcoin and Ether are to be  subjected to a large body of law that developed around the trading of  livestock and frozen concentrated orange juice could spell regulatory  uncertainty for various business models in the industry.
* No  ‚Äútrading on margin‚Äù is allowed outside regulated entities, unless done  by high-level investors called ‚Äúeligible contract parties.‚Äù This could  perhaps frustrate particular ideas about decentralized finance or OTC  markets.
* Smart contracts  that take longer than 24 hours to deliver could be considered futures  contracts under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. That smart contracts can  be labeled as futures contracts appears indeed to be the opinion of the  CFTC.(13)

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Securities Regulations_

In  the US, securities are regulated by the 1933 Securities Act.  Additionally, the 1934 Securities Exchange Act further regulates the  trade of securities, and established the SEC to oversee these markets.

## Definition of ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù Amended to Include Digital Asset Security:

First  and foremost, Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act will be  amended to include a ‚Äúdigital asset security‚Äù (and exclude ‚Äúdigital  assets‚Äù) in the definition of security:

*‚Äú(10)* ***The term ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù means***  *any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap,  bond, debenture, certificate of interest or participation in any  profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royalty or  lease, any collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or  subscription, transferable share, investment contract,* ***digital asset security***\*,  voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, any  put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate  of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest  therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle,  option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange  relating to foreign currency, or in general, any instrument commonly  known as a ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù; or any certificate of interest or participation  in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or  right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing;\* ***but shall not include any fiat currency, commodity, digital asset***\*,  or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker‚Äôs acceptance which has a  maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months,  exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which  is likewise limited.‚Äù\* (14)

## Digital Asset Security Definition

Next, the Digital Asset Bill (SEC. 101) defines what a digital asset security will be:

*‚Äú(A) IN GENERAL.‚ÄîThe term ‚Äòdigital asset security‚Äô means a digital asset that:*

*(i) Provides the holder of the digital asset with any of the following rights:*

*(I) Equity or debt interest in the issuer.*

*(II) Right to profits, interest, or dividend payments from the issuer.*

*(III)  Voting rights in the major corporate actions (which shall not include  new block creations, hardforks, or protocol changes related to the  digital asset) of the issuer.*

*(IV) Liquidation rights in the event of the issuer‚Äôs liquidation.*

*(ii)  In the case of an issuer with a service, goods, or platform that is not  wholly operational at the time of issuing such digital asset, with  respect to* ***any fundraising or capital formation activity (including initial coin offerings***\*)  which is accomplished through the issuance of such a digital asset,  issues such digital asset to a holder in return for money (including  other digital assets) to fund the development of the proposed service,  goods, or platform of the issuer.‚Äù\* (15)

&amp;#x200B;

## What does it mean to be regulated as a security?

Investing in securities in the US is regulated to:

*‚Äúprotect  interstate commerce, the national credit, the Federal taxing power, to  protect and make more effective the national banking system and Federal  Reserve System, and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets  in such transactions.‚Äù* (16)

Regulations  focus on both the issuing of securities (primary market), and  subsequent trade of such securities (secondary market).

The goal  of securities laws is firstly to require issuers to fully disclose all  material information that an investor would need in order to make up his  or her mind about the potential investment. A regulated company must  create a registration statement, which includes a prospectus, with  copious amounts of information about the security, the company, the  business, including audited financial statements.

Next, the  subsequent selling and trading in these securities is regulated, by  restricting trade to market places over which the regulator has  oversight. The Security Exchange Act section ¬ß78l(a) states:

*‚ÄúIt  shall be unlawful for any member, broker, or dealer to effect any  transaction in any security (other than an exempted security) on a  national securities exchange unless a registration is effective as to  such security for such exchange in accordance with the provisions of  this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder.‚Äù* (17)

&amp;#x200B;

## Summary of Securities Regulations:

* Crypto projects will need to be regulated and provide clear financial information for investors to make an informed decision.
* Trading of securities will generally take place on regulated exchanges.
* Any new fundraising or capital formation activity (including ICOs) are likely to be securities.
* When  a crypto is regulated as a security, the entire coin is subject to  strict regulations. In the case of commodities, only specific use cases  (futures) are regulated. It is a big difference.
* US  Congress is taking a leap of faith. It needs identifiable persons to  enforce a law upon. Who is going to be held accountable in a  decentralized network? Many issuing companies have handed control over  to network participants. Perhaps for this reason, Section 12(g) of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will be amended to allow the issuer to  apply for ‚Äúdesecuritization.‚Äù (18)  The question remains: who will apply for desecuritization once a  network is decentralized? The investors? Weren‚Äôt they the ones supposed  to be protected in the first place?

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Changing the Nature of Money_

These  regulations are not just about crypto. It is clearly part of a wider  discussion on the future of money. As shown below, this bill not only  changes the definition of money in the US, but also changes how money is  created!

As a first, in Section 5312(a)(3)(B) of title 31, US  Code (Money and Finance) digital assets are included as a monetary  instrument.(19)  However, Section 5103, of title 31, US Code will be amended to  specifically exclude digital assets and digital asset securities as  legal tender.(20)  And finally, it is determined that digital assets and digital asset  securities will not be covered by Federal Deposit Insurance (FDIC or  NCUA).(21)

&amp;#x200B;

## Introducing the Digital USD (or Central Bank Digital Currency/CBDC)

After  slamming the door on digital assets to be used as lawful money, the  Federal Reserve Act is amended to provide the Federal Reserve Board with  far reaching new powers; section 11 will be amended to say:

*‚Äú(d) To supervise and regulate through the Secretary of the Treasury the issue and retirement of Federal Reserve notes (****both physical and digital****),  except for the cancellation and destruction, and accounting with  respect to such cancellation and destruction, of notes unfit for  circulation, and to prescribe rules and regulations (****including appropriate technology****) under which such notes may be delivered by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Federal Reserve agents applying therefor.‚Äù* (22)

In addition, Federal Reserve notes will in the future also be issued digitally; an amendment to section 16 confirms this:

*‚ÄúFederal  reserve notes, to be issued at the discretion of the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System for the purpose of making advances to  Federal reserve banks through the Federal reserve agents as hereinafter  set forth and for no other purpose, are authorized. Notwithstanding any  other provision of law, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System is* ***authorized to issue digital versions of Federal reserve notes in addition***  *to current physical Federal reserve notes. Further, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, after consultation with the  Secretary of the Treasury, is* ***authorized to use distributed ledger technology for the creation, distribution and*** ***recordation of all transactions***  *involving digital Federal reserve notes. The said notes shall be  obligations of the United States and shall be considered legal tender  and shall be receivable by all national and member banks and Federal  reserve banks and for all taxes, customs, and other public dues. They  shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department  of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia,  or at any Federal Reserve bank.‚Äù* (23)

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretations on the Future of Money:

* The door is shut for the use of cryptos as legal tender.
* The  Federal Reserve Board is to be authorized to create and distribute a  ledger-based Federal reserve note that could be used for everyday  transactions in USD.
* Digital  federal reserve notes will make the ‚Äúrecordation‚Äù of all transactions  possible. Did they use this word because ‚Äúmonitoring all transactions‚Äù  would be too obvious? Recording all transactions without anyone looking  at them makes no sense.
* These  amendments significantly increase the power of the Federal Reserve.  Contrary to what is widely understood, the Fed does not ‚Äúprint money.‚Äù  It can only manage the money supply indirectly.(24)  The private sector ‚Äúcreates‚Äù most of what we use as money by issuing  credit. It is with the supply of credit by the private banks that the  monetary supply is inflated. Conversely, with the reduced demand for  credit, the money supply deflates. The Fed is not as powerful as it  wants the market to believe, and the Federal Reserve Act restricts a lot  of its actions. This amendment, however, could drastically expand the  authority of the Fed, by allowing them to create and distribute a  ‚Äúdigital USD‚Äù directly. It could change the entire structure of the  financial system and potentially have far reaching consequences.
* The  original idea behind the Federal Reserve was for private bank deposits  to be combined to provide an emergency line of credit in times of  economic stress.(25)  But if the Digital Dollar is based on a blockchain, how can it also be  based on reserves? And what mechanism will determine how funds (and how  much) are added to the economy? And where and how will they be  distributed? What about privacy and security? Will all this authority be  handed over to a board of seven unelected bureaucrats? This amendment  has the potential to change the way the Federal Reserve operates. This  deserves a wider discussion by economists and financial experts outside  the crypto-space as well.

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;International FATF Crypto Regulation Introduced in the US_

Those  paying attention to international anti-money laundering legislation  know that the following sections from the Digital Asset Bill originate  from guidance issued by the FATF (Financial Action Task Force). FATF is  an intra-governmental organization [creating financial legislation](https://decentralizedlegalsystem.com/fatf-bitcoin-regulations-summary/).

In March, the Paris based FATF issued draft guidance(26)  (‚ÄúFATF Guidance‚Äù) on a number of topics. And even though this guidance  hasn‚Äôt been finalized, there are already a number of points directly  included in the Digital Asset Bill.

&amp;#x200B;

## Banning the use of Stablecoins

Subchapter  I of chapter 51 of subtitle IV of title 31, United States Code,  department of treasury regulation, will be amended, to read as follows:

*‚Äú(a) IN GENERAL.‚ÄîBeginning on the date of the enactment of this section,* ***no person may issue, use, or permit to be used a digital asset fiat-based stablecoin*** *that is not approved by the Secretary of the Treasury under subsection (b).‚Äù*(27)

&amp;#x200B;

## Criminalizing the use of privacy coins and anonymizing services (mixers, coinjoins)

The  bank secrecy act is going to be amended to sanction the use of  anonymity-enhanced convertible virtual currencies and anonymizing  services.(28)  It is worth noting that willful violations of the bank secrecy act  could give rise to a fine of not more than $250,000, or imprisoned for  not more than five years, or both.(29)

&amp;#x200B;

## Introduction of the term Virtual Asset Service Provide (VASP) into US Law

As  a next step, the term Virtual Asset will be introduced into Section  5312(a) of title 31, United States Code. A Virtual Asset can be a  digital asset, or *‚Äúa digital representation of value that can be  digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or  investment purposes;‚Äù*(30)

So  far we have seen a number of definitions. To understand their  relationship, the following image was made based on the definition of  Virtual Asset according to Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States  Code:(31)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j832orezggo71.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d357f747bbfddd9db3c997e07953e556fc264ac5

&amp;#x200B;

Virtual  Asset is a broad definition; it covers most activities involving  cryptos. We can see in the Digital Asset Bill that entities that are  facilitating transactions in Virtual Assets are to be called ‚Äúvirtual  asset service providers,‚Äù or VASPS. Sec 301 of the Digital Asset Bill  defines a VASP:

*‚Äú(A) means a person who‚Äî*

*(i) exchanges between digital asset and fiat currencies*

*(ii) exchanges between digital assets;*

*(iii) transfers of digital assets;*

*(iv) is responsible for the custody, safekeeping of a digital asset or an instrument that enables control over a digital asset;*

*(v) issues or has the authority to redeem a digital asset; and*

*(vi) provides financial services related to the offer or sale of a digital asset by a person who issues such digital asset; and*

*(B) does not include any person who‚Äî*

*(i) obtains a digital asset to purchase goods or services for themself;*

*(ii) provides communication service or network access services used by a money transmitter; or*

*(iii)  develops, creates, or disseminates software designed to be used to  issue a digital asset or facilitate financial activities associated with  a digital asset.‚Äù* (32)

This  definition comes directly from the FATF Guidance, with the only  difference being that the US excludes the exchange between different  forms of one virtual assets. On the other hand, section (v) is a new  addition.

&amp;#x200B;

## The Big Picture: Global Regulation

The logic  behind this seems to be to first introduce a high-level definition  (including coins regulated as commodities, securities, and everything in  between). Next, any future global restrictions on the wider  crypto-space can be applied at this level.

From the latest FATF  Guidance, a number of possible additional restrictions can already be  deducted. Things to look out for are the restriction of the use of  ‚Äúunhosted wallets,‚Äù the introduction of the ‚Äútravel rule,‚Äù labeling  those who engage in peer-to-peer transactions as a risk, and a whole  host of other measures. (33)

One  additional aspect of VASP regulation mentioned in the FATF Guidance is  also included in the Digital Asset Bill; VASPS engaged in services which  are available in the United States and to United States persons, have  to be regulated in the United States, even if the provider is located  outside the United States. (34)

## Interpretation International Regulation in the US:

* International AML legislation, created by Paris-based FATF, is being introduced in the US.
* The  FATF term ‚Äúvirtual asset service provider‚Äù (VASP) is introduced in the  US. The definition is so broad that it covers practically all crypto  projects.
* After first being  in the FATF Guidance, the banning of stablecoins and anonymity-enhanced  cryptos and the obligation for VASPs to be licensed in the country of  their clients are included in the Digital Asset Bill.
* It  is not hard to imagine that other restrictions for cryptos currently  discussed by FATF, such as the travel rule and restricting unhosted  wallets, will be introduced next. This is not a regulation you introduce  to then never use.
* All VASPs with operating in the US or with US clients need to be regulated in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Amendments in the Infrastructure Bill_

Last  August saw public outcry over the US Infrastructure bill. It included a  section on IRS reporting for crypto. Some highlights:

## Clarification of Definition of Broker

It  makes sense that the tax authorities use a wide definition to cover all  possible economic activities in crypto. Section 80603 of the  Infrastructure Bill amendments the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,  provides that brokers need to report the activity of their clients to  the IRS and adds the following to the definition of broker:

*‚Äú(D)  any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly  providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf  of another person.‚Äù* (35)

## Reporting of Digital Assets

In addition, a unique wide definition of digital assets is added:

*‚Äúany  digital representation of value which is recorded on a  cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology  as specified by the Secretary.‚Äù* (36)

## Effective Date

Effective after December 31, 2023. So there is time.

&amp;#x200B;

## Interpretation Infrastructure Bill

There  was a lot of commotion about this bill. This was mainly due to the wide  definitions used, which could cover all activities in the crypto space,  including mining. In response, according to an article on Bloomberg,  the U.S. treasury will shortly issue additional guidance, along the  lines of the following:

*‚ÄúOther  firms key to the nearly $2 trillion crypto market ‚Äî from developers and  miners to hardware and software providers ‚Äî won‚Äôt have any new  requirements, so long as they don‚Äôt also act as brokers, according to a  Treasury official‚Äù* (37)

At  a glance, it appears that this bill is not as invasive as originally  feared. It would also be impossible to enforce this legislation on  miners due to the nature of the technology.

In this case perhaps  it would have been better if clear definitions were used of what is, and  isn‚Äôt included. Moreover, comments from ‚Äúanonymous sources at the  treasury‚Äù do not provide real regulatory clarity. This industry too  easily accepts the opinions of officials as decree. But we are all,  including officials, subject to the law. Given that officials change  over time, opinions and guidance are not the way forward; clear laws are  needed.

The commotion also distracted from the massive changes  proposed in the Digital Asset Bill discussed in this post, which so  far have been ignored by the industry...

# &lt;TL;DR_

**Next to the infrastructure bill, a new bill was introduced in US Congress: the ‚ÄúDigital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act.‚Äù It is not law yet, could still be amended, and if it ever comes into effect it will likely not be this year/cycle.** 

**Bitcon, Ether, and their hard-forks, are to be regulated as commodities. Smart-contracts taking longer to deliver than 24 hours are considered futures contracts and regulated as such.**

**Every other project and future ICO is potentially a security; guidance will be issued by CFTC/SEC. Issuers of securities are likely required to provide transparency and financial information to investors. Trade is generally restricted to regulated exchanges.**

**In addition, international anti-money laundering legislation is introduced in the US; Stablecoins, privacycoins, and mixers are to be prohibited. The high-level term VASP is introduced for almost all crypto projects, possibly to facilitate more future regulations.**

**Finally, the Federal Reserve gets shocking new powers to create and distribute a central bank digital currency (CBDC), of which all transactions are recorded.**",1632055806,3,1

pr2l69,shnog,I told an AI to write an article on Bitcoin,"This is what it spat out:

 

Should you invest in crypto or the stock market? Many people tout the wonders of investing in crypto like Bitcoin and Ethereum, while others say that cryptocurrency is basically a Ponzi scheme, and that you should put your money in traditional investment vehicles. 

I'm going to tell you what I think you should do if you want to maximize your investments in 2022.

First of all, let's start by defining the terms. What exactly is crypto? It's digital currency. That means that it exists only on a computer or smartphone and can't be spent like regular money.

It's similar to traditional currency in some ways, but also different in other ways. The most obvious difference is that cryptocurrency doesn't exist in physical form, so there's no coins you can hand someone. Instead of being physically deposited into a bank account, it's stored on your device (typically referred to as an ""electronic wallet""). And when you buy something with crypto, the transaction happens almost instantly and securely between two devices.

To illustrate this difference more clearly, I have three hypothetical scenarios: A cashier hands me one dollar bills; a waiter gives me five pieces of silver; and a restaurant owner asks for five Bitcoins. In each scenario, I'm getting exactly what I want, but how does the money get from my pocket to the person who needs it? In all three cases, money moves around electronically between various people, which is much easier than physically moving large amounts of currency or coins. 

That said, just because cryptocurrency isn't physical doesn't mean it's not valuable. Bitcoin was invented in 2008, before most Americans had heard of cryptocurrency or blockchain technology. Today, it's one of the most popular currencies in existence, with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of transactions happening every day.

But cryptocurrency's value goes way beyond Bitcoin itself. Many other types of digital assets are also available. Some use proof-of-work or proof-of-stake mechanisms to determine which cryptocurrencies will become increasingly scarce over time and whose prices can therefore go up. Others allow users to create tokens that represent specific things such as equity in a company, rights to a particular data set, ownership of a real estate property, or even movie tickets. The point is that there's no limit to the number of possible combinations of cryptocurrency and its underlying network technologies, so it may take a while for everyone to figure out what works best.

The thing about investing, though, is you never know when something better might come along. This means you're going to be jumping back and forth between various investments to try and beat the market. You'll need to constantly monitor your returns, buy low and sell high, then make sure to invest more of your hard-earned money into more promising crypto projects as they emerge. And if a project falls through for some reason, you have the ability to easily cut your losses by selling off your coins at whatever price you bought them for‚Äîwhich is why crypto has been getting more attention from the mainstream media lately. 

You might think it's a lot of work to find and invest in new companies, but the good news is most investors aren't doing it alone. There are already several websites where you can plug in information about a crypto project and get an idea of how much it could potentially earn or lose over the course of time. For example, coinmarketcap.com provides a free tool called InvestFeed, which lets you compare multiple crypto projects on a single page by creating a ""heat map"" of their popularity. 

And for those who want to do a little bit of investing themselves, there are also apps like Robinhood, a commission-free platform that makes it easy to invest in individual cryptocurrencies without having to worry about opening an account with each different exchange. 

I'm going to give you some examples of potential investments and let you decide whether you want to invest more into the stock market, Bitcoin, Ethereum, or another digital asset. But before we get started, here's one last word: To maximize your investment return, it's important to understand the differences between traditional stocks and cryptocurrency investments, as well as the pros and cons of both. 

If you're wondering if crypto and traditional investments have any advantages or disadvantages, keep reading for my opinion on that topic. Then I'll tell you how I'd allocate your money today. Let's start with my top pick: I recommend Bitcoin and Ethereum, followed by traditional equities (stocks). I won't go too much into detail on my reasoning for this because it's really only a matter of personal preference. What is clear is that both options have unique benefits and drawbacks that will help you determine which option is right for you. If you can stomach a little risk and don't mind taking a longer time to see a return, I would suggest investing in traditional equities instead of cryptocurrency. Otherwise, if you prefer higher security and shorter wait times, I think Bitcoin is a great choice.

In my opinion, I think all three are viable ways to invest in 2022, so feel free to choose whichever one(s) you think will work best for you. Of course, just because I think one way is better than another doesn't mean you should follow suit! That's why I've created a list of questions to ask yourself when thinking about your investment strategy. Use this checklist to make sure that what you decide to invest in is the right fit for your financial situation.

Here are the three scenarios:

Scenario 1. Cashier hands me one dollar bills.

Do you want your investment to generate a steady income over time? 

Scenario 2. Waiter gives me five pieces of silver.

Is the potential to make a large profit more appealing than the ability to hold on to your money?

Scenario 3. Restaurant owner asks for five Bitcoins.

What's the most important thing for you? Is it safety and security? Or is it speed?

I think each of these scenarios presents a unique set of tradeoffs. So think about how much control you want to exert over your money, the risks you're willing to take, and how much money you can afford to lose.

This is just a short summary of the most common types of crypto-related investments. I encourage you to read up on the specific companies and networks you're interested in, as well as their possible advantages and pitfalls.

In the next few sections, I'll be talking more about the two most popular cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum. These will be the main focus of our discussion. You might notice some similarities between Bitcoin and Ethereum; for instance, they use similar hashing algorithms to create a digital currency network. But there are some key differences that will affect what type of investment you should consider. Here's what I'm going to be focusing on:

Bitcoin's biggest advantage: It was designed to be used primarily as a digital currency. Unlike other digital currencies, Bitcoin can also function as a long-term store of value, which means you can buy items with Bitcoin and use it to pay for things in the future.

Ethereum's bigger drawback: The original version of Ethereum is best known for being a platform for developers to build new kinds of decentralized applications. While the platform is still in its early stages, it's also becoming a popular place for people to create digital collectibles or ""tokens"" that represent real world assets. This is particularly useful in cases where it's desirable for the creators of digital assets to have total ownership over them, but also wants them to maintain a degree of anonymity and independence from outside influences. For example, Ethereum is an excellent platform to launch new types of crowdfunding campaigns or create tokens for real estate projects, but also makes it easy to create tokens that represent ownership in a particular company or data set. However, it can take years before these tokens are widely adopted by the public.

So, which crypto is best for you? 

I think that, overall, Bitcoin has been more successful than Ethereum, and is likely to remain the most well-known and accepted form of crypto in the coming years. Its recent price spike is a good indication that its popularity isn't waning. I think the benefits of using Bitcoin for payments are far greater than the drawbacks. For example, Bitcoin transactions are secure and cheap to send.

However, there are also advantages to holding a token on an Ethereum-based network. You can earn interest by holding your Ethereum-based token instead of cash, and you don't have to worry as much about losing your money as you do with Bitcoin. 

Let's say you invested $1,000 in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin has a market capitalization of about $77 billion and an annual inflation rate of 5.5 percent. That means that every year, the amount of money you could potentially get back from Bitcoin drops. Meanwhile, Ethereum is worth more than Bitcoin, and it's not experiencing the same sort of inflation. If you invest in Ethereum, you can expect to see your investment grow at an average of 6.7 percent per annum. 

But I have a feeling that you're probably wondering why Bitcoin hasn't grown even more in the past few months. Well, a lot of factors come into play when deciding whether to invest in a specific cryptocurrency. First, I'll mention the reason I mentioned earlier: Bitcoin is a currency first and foremost. Like I said, Bitcoin is a medium of exchange. In my opinion, if you're looking to invest in a digital asset, you want to invest in something you think will appreciate in value.

Second, I'll talk about a possible issue that may hold Bitcoin back: the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is a second layer protocol built on top of Bitcoin. It allows Bitcoin to work in a way that's very similar to the current banking system. Instead of having to pay a Bitcoin transaction fee when sending your payment, you only need to deposit the appropriate amount of Bitcoins to the Lightning Network. Once you're done transferring the funds to someone else, the recipient will withdraw the balance of the original Bitcoin transaction and send the remaining funds back to you.

I think that the future of Bitcoin is bright, and the reasons why I think this are numerous. I'll mention just three of the main ones.

First, Bitcoin is currently the only type of crypto currency that's been widely accepted. It's the dominant type of digital currency on the internet, and that's no coincidence. There's a good chance that the majority of the growth we can expect to see in the next five years will be driven by the technology behind it.

Secondly, the blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin is considered one of the most valuable innovations of the last decade. Blockchain is a database that keeps track of all transactions. Every time you make a purchase online, your credit card company stores a record of the transaction on the blockchain.

This type of database is great for tracking assets and transactions, but it can also be used to prevent fraud. For example, you might use a private key to sign a contract that allows you to buy certain goods from a third party for a specific price. This type of arrangement is much harder to undo if there's ever a dispute.

Thirdly, Bitcoin has been a great store of value because it's not subject to the same whims of central banks as other types of fiat currency. You always know exactly how much your dollar or pound or euro is going to be worth, but you don't really understand what will happen to the value of your Bitcoin in the long run. This is a major advantage, and I think it will continue to give Bitcoin a leg up on the rest of the competition.

To wrap things up, I'm sure you've got some questions about how crypto investments actually work. Here are a few answers to the most common ones.

Does anyone know of any debit cards that are 100% confirmed used on these instant btc sites using cards?

Bitcoin's increasing energy consumption has triggered a passionate debate about the sustainability of the digital currency. And yet, most studies have thus far ignored that Bitcoin miners cycle through a growing amount of short-lived hardware that could exacerbate the growth in global electronic waste. E-waste represents a growing threat to our environment, from toxic chemicals and heavy metals leaching into soils, to air and water pollutions caused by improper recycling. Here we present a methodology to estimate Bitcoin's e-waste and find that it adds up to 30.7 metric kilotons annually, per May 2021. This number is comparable to the amount of small IT and telecommunication equipment waste produced by a country like the Netherlands. At peak Bitcoin price levels seen early in 2021, the annual amount of e-waste may grow beyond 64.4 metric kilotons in the midterm, which highlights the dynamic trend if the Bitcoin price rises further. Moreover, the demand for mining hardware already today disrupts the global semiconductor supply chain. The strategies we present may help to mitigate Bitcoin's growing e-waste problem.  


## Highlights

‚Ä¢

Bitcoin's annual e-waste generation adds up to 30.7 metric kilotons as of May 2021.

‚Ä¢

This level is comparable to the small IT equipment waste produced by a country such as the Netherlands.

‚Ä¢

On average Bitcoin generates 272¬†g of e-waste per transaction processed on the [blockchain](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/blockchain).

‚Ä¢

Bitcoin could produce up to 64.4 metric kilotons of e-waste at peak Bitcoin price levels seen in early 2021.

‚Ä¢

The soaring demand for mining hardware may disrupt global semiconductor supply chains.

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature‚Äôs God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation‚Ä¶.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.‚ÄîThat to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. ‚Äî That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness‚Ä¶ it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.



If posting this gets me of a federal list, you are no government of mine. If you can tax the man begging for money on the street, but you let me off the hook, you are no government of mine. If you wage wars but you can't wage your own people enough to live, you are no government of mine. The truth is, feds, you are no government of mine. You're a government for the interest groups. You've succeeded in creating a civilization of slaves who enjoy their enslavement and will happily bend over and give you cryptocurrency. 


Not me. Fuck you. The only thing you'll get from me is a laugh. You want to tax my crypto? You're gonna have to earn it and accept it as currency first. I suggest you do because right now I have a 1% APY just holding Chinese currency relative to your USD. Why would I own any USD?

USD is only around because we live under the illusion that we are forced to cater to it simply because we are Americans. It's time to adopt something new. I'm not against taxes. I'm against crooks who like to bath themselves in the blood, sweat, and tears of the taxpayers rather than do something useful. You politicians aren't all that way, but without a public ledger we can't have any reliable way to trace our money or establish public trust that requires no media outlet to understand. 

Y'all need to be watched yourselves, feds. If the money is going to a purpose, do it. You've failed us so many times in this regard...  Just adopt crypto already. For a group that enjoys multi trillion dollar surveillance programs so much, a basic concept like crypto ledgers would save you so much money you could, oh, I dunno, turn off a printer or two?

Something I have noticed as of late (this past year) is more and more people are becoming bitcoiners but they seem to be using this as a financial accelerate to trade back to fiat.

Presence of the idea bitcoin will make you """"rich""""

My premise is to not sell and continue holding the coin until widespread adoption. Does anyone else feel this way ?

I anticipate holding until I can buy groceries with bitcoin and treat the current hold like a massive compound interest. 

I want to have crypto as my whole life, this is the future.

I dream of true fiscal liberty, decentralization and an end to the Saudi oil cartels relationship with the US dollar the fed and our corrupt politicians.

 Now I see bills being proposed that call for surveillance of every aspect of my financial life worth 600 USD or more while you give banks a slap on the wrist for laundering money for drug cartels, and give u.s. senators zero repercussions when participating in insider trading.

prjjcz,Constantylovely,Is bitcoin mining a lottery?,"Hey guys I have a question about Bitcoin mining. When miners(ASICS) are mining, do they all start from the same nonce(1) and try every combination or do they begin hashing from an arbitrary number such as (1,000,000,0)? The reason I am asking this question is because I often hear that mining is like a lottery and whoever guesses the nonce first gets the whole reward. But let‚Äôs say that the most powerful ASIC in the world were to mine BTC, if all of the ASICS in the world were to mine BTC beginning from (1) that means that only the most powerful ASIC will get the block reward every single time.",1632096186,10,1

I'm wondering how do we keep our hard earned currency away from their nefarious intentions of taking what's not theirs.

Is there something I don't know? Or doing wrong? Is there a crypto haven? Is there a safe exchange market in the dark web?",1632096021,8,1

**We can consider this stage we are in now as a stage between 2017 and 2020, from my point of view, I see that Bitcoin may stay between 64K ( last resistance) and 30K area (if it goes down to 20K, it will be your biggest chance) until the next halving (2024). ) And then you will see it above the 100$K and most currencies will follow.**",1632095717,3,1
