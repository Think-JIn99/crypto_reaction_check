ANYWAY yesterday I set it up and moved the majority of my BTC, XRP and XLM over (can't bring myself to ditch the altcoins - went in hard Dec '17 and the losses would hurt my soul, so hanging on). All went well and it was super easy considering my knowledge is that of somebody that reads the daily's comments and not much more.

Three questions remain (last one split into two because I'm still immature enough to laugh when others say it after reading it 1000+ times... and I've never had an account):

1. What do I do with my ""dust""? A few thousand sats scattered over multiple exchanges; so small the exchanges wont let me withdraw... but my brain says when I'm old and wrinkly, that'll be a good chunk to give the grand kids!
2. Do I continue to buy (always DCA'ing) over exchanges or is there a better way, like finding real world humans... how would one even go about doing that??

3a. Are there any really stupid ways I could mess this up now? I plan to HODL &amp; stack until the things I actually WANT to buy are acceptably priced and available through pure crypto purchases and not by fiat conversion nonsense (so a long time).

I operate a small IT firm. The other partner and I want to invest in Bitcoin, but other than lurking here for a while, we haven't made any major decisions. On one of my personal computers, I installed the Bitcoin Core, and have made a few small test purchases via Coinbase &amp; Coinbase Pro, and have transferred them to my wallet (in the bitcoin core application) as prep for the Jan 3 keys thing.

We have found ourselves with a bit of an opportunity. We have about $4-6K USD that is available in the business, and we want to purchase Bitcoin with this, as an investment for the business.

Is the next step for us purchasing a hardware wallet, setting that up, and then creating a Coinbase/Pro account for the business? Does the business need its own account? or can we purchase it through my personal account and then send it to the business' hardware wallet? If we have encrypted redundant backups of a system that is running the core/wallet, do we need a hardware wallet?

I am very open to suggestions, so please feel free to let me know where we can improve/help the community.

emeugs,bannaples,Coinbase-Pro vs Kraken new fees and spread.,"I'm pretty new to crypto and have been Coinbase-Pro for the last 6 months. I'm well aware of the new fees but am only now beginning to realize how much spread they take on transactions (ie the difference between the market rate and the rate they actually give you). 

From their pricing/fee page ([https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2109597-coinbase-pricing-fees-disclosures](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2109597-coinbase-pricing-fees-disclosures)) they say that buying cyrpto with fiat will incur a trading fee but on top of that, the spread will be up to 0.5%. So say the trading fee is 0.5% (transation of &lt;10K), adding the spread on top of that and you're down a full 1% on the trade (ouch!).

&amp;#x200B;

But it goes even further...say you wanted to convert one digital currency to another (ie buy ETH using BTC). They don't charge a flat fee on this however, the spread can be up to 2%. This seems pretty similar to if you converted BTC to USD then used the USD to buy ETH as the fees (ie 0.5% fee + 0.5% spread x 2 orders = 2%). So you're not even saving anything by doing a direct crypto to crypto transaction. In my opinion, this is not cool.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've two questions:

1. How does the spread on Coinbase-Pro compare to Kraken? I have read the fee structure for Kraken which is better than Coinbase at lower trading volumes but worse at higher volumes ([https://www.kraken.com/en-us/features/fee-schedule](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/features/fee-schedule)). However, I can't find info on the spread that Kraken takes...does anyone know this and can give me a link?
2. It seems straightforward on how Coinbase-Pro can take a spread on a market order. That is, they give you a slightly lower price than the current market price (ie 0.5% lower) and pocket the difference. However, how can they charge a spread on limit orders? That is, you've told them to buy eg BTC at a specfic price. Taking into account the spread of 0.5% they say they charge, does this mean that the actual price they buy it at is 0.5% higher than your limit price and then they pocket the difference? For example, let's say you set a limit order to use $10K to buy BTC at a flat price of $10K per BTC. Do they then actually buy the BTC at $10,050 (ie $10K + 0.5%) then give you your $10K worth of BTC and take the $50 spread for themselves? Is this how it works? I've not included the flat fee in this example just to simplify things.

If I was to receive payment in bitcoin, what would I expect to pay to cash out to a USD account using an exchange such as Coinbase or Kraken? Both have fees listed, so on the order of about $25. Will my bank also pay a wire transfer fee? I'm guessing that's another $25 or so, so total should be &lt;$50?

Also can public keys associated to an xchange account be used to accept the initial transaction? I think this would avoid paying an extra bitcoin transaction fee if I for example accepted payment at an address generated by my wallet outside the exchange, and then transferred into an account held at the exchange and then wired that.

Look at the price of BTC compared to every other shitcoin out there and you'll see what's happening. 

Bitcoin has the perfect recipe. 


Top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. 

Bitcoin

Ethereum ETH

XRP

USDT Tether

Bitcoin Cash

Litecoin

EOS

Binance coin

Bitcoin SV

Monero


Bitcoin is unstoppable. It is the perfect money. The Bitcoin network belongs to the people of Earth. Up 97% from a year ago. Always bounces back to New highs. Bitcoin has the strongest hash rate of 120 million trillion hashes per second. 

ETH/BTC is down 53% on the year. That means ETH has lost half it's value relative to Bitcoin in the last year. Ethereum. Ethereum uses a cheaper and less secure proof of stake (POS), which is a POS (piece of shit). If proof of stake was superior to proof of work (POW), then that would be Bitcoin's consensus mechanism. Ethereum is dying relative to Bitcoin. 

XRP/BTC is down 73%. XRP, a fundamentally flawed imitation of Bitcoin, has lost 73% of its value relative to Bitcoin. XRP is a centralized, pre mined scam by the inventors who absolutely control that network. They call it distributed and then their world map shows 14 dots. Bitcoin has over 11,000 nodes. XRP is a shitcoin deluxe. XRP tries to imply that it is a value compared to Bitcoin by creating 100B XRP tokens compared to the 21M Bitcoin hard limit. It's deceptive. 

USDT Tether is a stable coin not meant for investing in. The Bitcoin exchange that runs it says it's backed by dollars, but you have to trust them, which completely breaks why you would want to buy a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is a trustless system. That's what you want. Don't hold any money in tether. 

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a hard fork of Bitcoin. That means they took the perfect recipe (Bitcoin) and they fucked it up by changing it. BCH is mainly supported by bad actors who are defrauding people by pretending it's Bitcoin when it is not. The hash rate is everything when it comes to cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Cash has only 1.6% the hash rate of Bitcoin. They registered the fake website bitcoin.com and have a fake Reddit and a fake Twitter that pretend to be the official Bitcoin. The real Bitcoin website is the .org domain. www.Bitcoin.org. Bitcoin Cash has lost 25% of its value relative to Bitcoin in the last year. Steer clear of this scam. 

Litecoin was a fork of Bitcoin. They changed the block reward from every 10 minutes to every 3 minutes. The founder has since sold his stake and has abandoned the project. LTC has lost 41% of its value relative to Bitcoin in the last year.

EOS is plagued by hacks. It's not even really a cryptocurrency. EOS has lost 52% of its value relative to Bitcoin in the last year. Terrible. 

Binance coin is a Bitcoin copycat invented by the Bitcoin exchange Binance. It's centralized, and controlled by greedy people. (Assume everyone is greedy and you'll never be let down). How is this different than having dollars in a bank? The difference is that Binance coin is a market driven asset, which means the price fluctuates. So it's even riskier than dollars in a bank. You could lose value, and you're relying on am institution instead of a decentralized open protocol like Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin SV is a hard fork of a hard fork of Bitcoin. It's problems are the same as BCH, from which it was formed. Bitcoin SV's hash rate is half of that of BCH and less than 1% of Bitcoin's hash rate. Bitcoin SV gas lost 33% of its value relative to Bitcoin in the last year. 

Monero is a privacy coin. It has lost 43% of its value relative to Bitcoin over the last year. 

The reason the 2017 Bitcoin bull run stopped is because investors got distracted by all of the shitcoins. 

But now there is a great unification taking place. People are understanding more and more than Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency worth investing in, especially long term. 

So when people say, ""if it's not Bitcoin it's a shitcoin,"" that's what we mean. 

Once this shitcoin noise settles down, people will be more focused on Bitcoin and the next halvening will bring on some serious fireworks.",1578579507,25,1
ema64v,MintyWallpaper,CryptoPixelWall,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share this project a friend and I have made show a fun way to use few different cryptocurrencies.

**#**[**CryptoPixelWall**](https://cryptopixelwall.com/)

We know others like this already exist but we have not been able to find one that has different choices like we have added.

The reason we added different choices of crypto was to demonstrate speed, fees to send and token options. We thought it was a good idea to add a choice of how long you want to display your image / link as you may just wish to try the service or want to buy an upcoming expiring slot.

This has been a really fun project and if anyone has any other ideas on how it can be improved or what other currencies we should add please tell me (it's pretty easy for me to add any token).

Please note that this is not running on a powerful server so speeds might not be brilliant please allow time for the page to load.  


If someone else selects the same slot as you which ever payment is received first will get the slot, the other payment will be refunded. 

Also I should add : This is on a screen in the classroom right now and will be for the rest of the day as I demonstrate how the different currencies work.

em4iww,toguythrow,Does anyone have experience with this (scam?),"So I have been recently getting into domain flipping. (Selling website names) I made one sale on this site called
Gecalcrypto.com (anyone know it)

The buyer requested we use it as it was an easier for him to get me the large sum for the domain he was buying. 
The reason I'm making this post is as an alert while I'm not sure this site is a scam I have reason to believe so 

1. At first they need a 0.02 deposit to verify my wallet (shakepay) then 0.05 to get premium status and now its claiming the last step is a 0.1 deposit that will be refunded so they claim. Reason is to prevent money laundering to anyone out the EU. (This one maybe a dumb question but didnt the uk (where the company is based) leave the eu?

2. Cant find them online (this one on me should've researched but I was eager to make my first sale!)

3. Online only company I can find that they registered in August via google and that the owner lives in Italy 

4. All while this is going on I was switching banks so I thought I'd be easier to transfer to btc then send it all to shakepay so now my funds are trapped and I could save up and do the deposit but idk if they are gonna have another trap for me to pay. 


So my question to you all is what do I do and what steps should I take? Do I bite the bullet and save to put the 0.1 in my account. Thanks for taking the time to read I'm still new and learning.

1. **[Not your keys, not your coins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F12lpqnug-0)**. If the wallet do not offer you the way to control your bitcoin keys, that is NOT your wallet. You are going back to relation ""master - slave"".  

2.  **SEGWIT**. If the wallet do not offer support for segwit BTC address (starting with bc1 or 3), that wallet do not deserve attention, is antiquated and will do more damage to you than good. Remember all new Bitcoin apps and protocols will include segwit support. so using an old legacy address will makes you excluding yourself.  

3. **Lightning**. Consider to use a wallet that is already supporting LN, aside with onchain. LN is the future, it will be much easier if you already have a wallet that use both ""chains"".  

If you respect these simple 3 rules, all the rest it's just a preference of features, functionalities that fit your necessities.

eks8c9,throwaway139845601,Bitcoin Groupthink,"So, I am just learning Social Psychology in University and it is so fascinating to see how group dynamics in Bitcoin context happens.

&amp;nbsp;

Group-think is an effect whereby people via two ways fall into dysfunctional decision-making outcomes. The reason is because we people want to belong in a group, and in this case, no matter the cost. Insert your 'bitcoin maximalist' here. 

As a result, when the 'project is promising', the result is **collective over-optimism**. Insert your bullish memes and charts. To the moon!

&amp;nbsp;

The other way happens when the 'project is risky'. The result is **collective avoidance**, which basically means people ignore other people's opinions and critique. Sounds familiar?  

Funny how *both* of these outcomes are applicable to Bitcoin sphere.

&amp;nbsp;

What do I think?

Let's just say that I have a long-term outlook, knowing that Bitcoin is more than what you can see from scratch. It is not just memes, hodling, and bubbles.

Amendments to the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act (MLTFPA) were adopted by the Estonian parliament Riigikogu on 11 December 2019. The focus of the amendments is on cryptocurrency service providers. The main purpose of the amendments is to strengthen the position of the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in its authorisation and supervision procedures for cryptocurrency-related businesses.

The main amendments are:

\- the currently two different licenses are merged into one licence with two services;

\- crypto-to-crypto exchange becomes regulated;

\- the state fee for a new application increases from 345 to 3300 euros;

\- the KYC and AML compliance requirements will be equalled to those of financial institutions;

\- registered office, actual business and the location of the management needs to be in Estonia;

\- the minimum share capital requirement is set to 12 000 euros (currently it is 2500 euros);

\- the FIU will have 60 days with a possible extension of up to 120 days to render the decision whether to grant a license (30 days now);

\- stricter due diligence of the management board members.

The amendments enter into force on 10 March 2020. Companies with existing licences must bring their operations in compliance with the new requirements by 1 July 2020.",1578846145,6,1

Scarcity does not mean valuable. Bitcoin is not scarce, even if crypto currency becomes a thing it's hard to say it'll definitely be Bitcoin. 

Purpose of money is to present itself as abstraction of work, because exchanging work is cumbersome and complex (perhaps we could make some work solver today, where we'd always directly exact work, when I buy carton of milk, I'd use mobile phone to solve work-demand problem, so that I give my work to someone, where the chain ultimately leads to the grocery store  selling milk). But solving that complex problem of exchanging work is much easier with money, if money itself increases or decreases rapidly in value, that is a problem, I didn't receive or perform more work. 

Historically hyperinflation is about lack of availability of products, there is nothing to buy, so prices go up, it doesn't matter what assets you're holding, because there isn't enough goods the seller can ask as much as the richest people who want that good have. And this lack of goods to buy problem can happen very easily.

If fiat were to fail wholesale only valuable asset class are tools, technical clothing etc, because global supply chains are fragile, they would simply fail and we wouldn't have anything to spend our assets on. It is in everyone's best interest to keep fiat working, fiat failing won't be resolved to new crypto currency future in our lifetime, maybe our children's children could have working global economy based on something else.

There are no fundamentals supporting value of bitcoin in our lifetime, but getting rich is still in anyone's reach.

Because money is abstraction of work, being able to perform in-demand work is always very good investment, learn something that is highly compensated and no matter what medium of exchange is used, you can accumulate it more than you need. If you access to Internet you can in 3 years time, with 4-5h a day educate yourself with no monetary investment to a place where you can work remotely anywhere where you want and invoice at least 100kEUR/YRC, more once you gain experience and become recognised in your chosen industry. If you are not based in Brazil or US you can also entirely forego income, dividend and capital gains taxes by choosing where you live.

This method will get anyone from 0 to first million in less than decade, with assumption that market continues to return 8-9% average. Only hard investment you need, is to put in the 4-5k hours investment to learn to perform work someone wants to pay you for. The reason why this works, is because very few are willing to learn something that takes thousands of hours to learn.",1578818435,40,1

epbuyo,StrayVoyage,Semi-Submersible Crpyto Mining Rig,"**\[Following Post Undergoing Active Development\]**

Greetings members of the r/Bitcoin community, a few months ago I made a post to this sub-Reddit (along with a few others) discussing my idea of utilizing a Semi-Submersible Rig or Large Barge, and constructing a Crypto Mining Farm on-top of it. Since then I have developed a more fleshed out plan regarding the project and would like to hear your input and also ask that you consider making a small contribution towards this project since getting a bank loan for something of this nature has not went well for others. I will update this post as things progress and attach supplementary materials and data points.

Regarding anyone running Windows 10 on their device.
The NSA has released an official, public statement urging everyone to update their Windows devices as soon as possible. An exploit has been identified in the current version of Windows 10 that can allow malicious software to be automatically installed on your computer, under the guise of approved Windows updates. 

This means that very soon, hackers will be developing tools to be able to take control of and install malicious software to over 900 million PCs worldwide, with little to nothing that can be done to stop or remove the infected software due to the system believing it is from an approved Windows Update.

The NSA and US Department of Defense urges everyone on Windows 10 to update their computer IMMEDIATELY, as a fix for the exploit has already been released. Again, failing to update now will put your machine at extreme risk in the future.

To update, click the windows logo in the bottom left, click the cog, go to ""update and security"" and press ""check for updates.""

Links to the OFFICIAL NSA statement and a detailed news report are included below for you to read.

I think it‚Äôs high time community and developers be prepared for such an event. I mean every gift has bunkers and all for possible nuke attacks even if it‚Äôs unlikely.

On same lines I think we as a community have a plan b or back up ready for such an attack just in case it happens.

My thought is we should be able to fork/ run bitcoin smoothly on POS for time being of the attack or come up something hybrid POW/POS to mitigate the attack. We need to keep testnet /protocol ready for such an event

Having such a mechanism first of all will make bitcoin 51% attack proof as only a fool will invest that much of money in attacking only to find out that we switched to POS and the attack will fail...

Second just in case a fool dies that anyways we simply switch and go on with life as usual.

Bitcoin is distributed better than any other coin with strong community so 51% POS would be nearly impossible unless state wants to buy all coins in which case it will moon af boosting the ecosystem further.

I'm a fully verified user since 2017. My volume is on the second/third level and I have and use the coinbase debit card.  
I've referred new members to the platform, family and friends. I always was a coinbase fan, because I love the platform and the reputation.  
But on December 22nd my account was restricted. I can¬¥t use my funds. There wasn't any reason to do it. The only response I got was the same day, coinbase told me that it would be fixed on 2 days. Now, more than 3 weeks later, my account is still restricted and I've not got any new answer to my case.

It's really frustrating when a company block your funds, without explanation, without a solution, without any reason, for more than 3 weeks and the support saying nothing. It's unbelievable how coinbase can have the worst support ever, it's a shock. How this can be possible. You are coinbase guys, not a shady russian shit exchange.

eqqwj5,DiamondtheDegu,Is my boyfriend making a mistake?,"So this will be a bit of a long one but I really appreciate anyone who reads through it all! I will put a TL;DR at the end but I do recommend at least skimming through the following first!

My boyfriend's grandmother died recently (RIP), and he is expecting to receive ¬£10,000 in inheritance.

He is dead set on spending the majority of this 10 grand on a miner.

Now, I won't try and make out I know much about these things. I do not. I don't even really understand bitcoin and the mining process. However, I do understand he's going to spend roughly 10 grand on a large machine that will earn him, according to some website he found on the internet, about ¬£10 a month or possibly a week (I can't quite recall now) after the cost of the vast amount of electricity used is covered - we live in a flat, we do not have solar panels and the energy isn't included in my rental agreement, I pay for that myself and therefore whatever energy the miner uses will have to be covered in it's entirety by whatever the miner earns.

I'm just extremely concerned.
At ¬£10-¬£40 profit monthly.... it will take years just to cover the cost of buying the miner.
My boyfriend then says he will add newer parts to it over time, upgrade it slowly but surely and 'before long' me and him (or him most specifically) will be raking in thousands. Just by letting a machine run.

This sounds fantastic, and very much like a get rich quick scheme that does however require an investment on my boyfriends part. But... what if it all goes wrong?

What if it never earns him more than ¬£40 a month? If that? He says he could simply sell the miner if it doesn't yield results, but I don't see him recovering all of his money, so this still stands to be a possible loss.

I'm a bit torn really.
It is his money and his choice.
But I really think he could be making a terrible mistake and I do believe if his grandmother was alive still she would also ask him to proceed into this with caution. Alas, she is not here, and i don't have any say in how he spends his money - I don't want to be that controlling girlfriend, but I don't want to watch him do something I suspect he will bitterly regret in the near future when I could say something.

I do not want to go into a discussion with him about this however when I am really very uneducated on the subject of both bitcoin in and of itself and mining. Hence why I'm here asking you guys.

TL;DR - My boyfriend is spending his inheritance on a miner. It stands to be earning only a maximum of ¬£40 a month initially. Is it worth it right now?",1579403170,20,1

I even emailed their parent company. No response.

My account had a balance. I changed my phone number and needed to change it for verification. They ignored my support requests and then eventually closed my account. Next step is to contact a German lawyer.

I have a savings account that has several thousand dollars in it. It earns a few cents in interest each month, and I really don't do anything with it. It is reserve fund and house fund that hasn't really grown. I maintain this account at this bank because their Credit Cards and Mortgages are literally the best in the business. No joke.

I have another account that I do almost all of my business with. I have a checking account there, and they are one of the top 3 in the USA.

I decided recently that things have progressed far enough in my personal life, that my family and I will be buying a house in the next six months. As such, I'm cutting down on other expenses, and will be making deposits (for the first time in decades) into my savings account. Went to set it up through my Top3 bank. . . and the slowest version of a transfer to another bank is 3 day, $3 per transaction, regardless of transaction size.

This is beyond stupid. I want to set up bi-weekly transfers around $50-100. Why would I pay 3-6% per transaction? Those are literally Bitcoin ATM level fees.

I'll be upping my weekly Bitcoin buy instead, and will use some of that later this year as my deposit on a house.

Let's not give up before it even has a chance of passage. Your individual voice matters. Even if your representative doesn't read your email, their staff probably will, and helping to inform them is also important. Please feel welcome to adapt this language to fit your style.

""...

I write to you regarding the proposed bill entitled ""Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020."" I am in full support of this bill and hope you choose to be as well. Currently, capital is being driven out of the United States into foreign jurisdictions because we have not adopted a friendly posture toward new blockchain and crypto technologies. To the contrary, multiple agencies of the U.S. have taken a relatively hostile posture toward the promise of these new and significant technologies. For example, the IRS requires that even the smallest personal transactions (e.g., buying a cup of coffee) of a citizen must be tracked and reported (i.e., tax basis and tax gain/loss). This is not a fair way to tax people, and indeed, it is a cruel form of taxation. A $200 exemption is already in place for gains due to foreign currency fluctuations. What this bill does is level the playing field for crypto-related personal transactions. The current market cap of crypto exceeds $200 billion. That is money just waiting to be tapped into by the U.S. economy. Either we make a friendly environment in this country so that those savings can be injected into our local economies, or instead, that wealth ends up being injected into overseas economies. Using crypto for purchases is a much more sustainable benefit to the U.S. compared to scalping tiny capital gains from crypto trades, and imposing an onerous record-keeping requirement on the citizenry, even for personal transactions. I urge you to do what is within your power to see this bill progress forward.

For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/es1pmq/just_received_36_bitcoin_but_is_it_a_scam/

Unfortunately, OP of that thread is actually one of the smarter ones, asking if it's a scam (and then ignoring the advice given, so who knows).

If you get a message saying you've ""won"" some money or bitcoin, or see on social media that someone is ""giving away"" bitcoin. Report it, block the user, move on.

You will send money, either to pay for a ""withdrawal fee"" or to get the wallet up to a ""minimum balance"" and nothing will happen. You'll just lose your bitcoin that you sent. That's it.

Giveaways on social media are the same. You'll send bitcoin for the promise of bitcoin being ""sent back"" and nothing will happen. Bye bye Bitcoin. All those responses saying it's amazing and thanking the kind soul giving away the money? All fake. Every single one.

If you send any bitcoin to anyone on the promise of more bitcoin, you are being scammed and you WILL lose anything you send. Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed. The money is gone forever.

I have a few questions for the community. I've dealt with BTC before and am fairly familiar with how it works, but this would be my first 'real' venture into it. Thanks for reading in advance!

How much would you recommend investing in relativity to 'total wealth'? I know this isn't an exact question- more personal opinion, but I'd like to at least have a general idea of what's common.

What exchange(s) are best for buying a decent amount of BTC, and eventually cashing out? I would probably look at anywhere from a few hundred USD to 1K. Main thing I'm looking for is low fees- I don't need transactions to be instant or anything.

‚Ä¢Wallets! I know that hardware wallets are the golden standard security-wise, but I would likely be using a virtual wallet short-term. Any recommendations for either are greatly appreciated! 

‚Ä¢Any tips or resources for somebody new to the world of BTC investment? Hoping to avoid any common pitfalls or mistakes and learn as much as I can beforehand

If/when I do choose to invest, I would of course wait for BTC prices to get over this current boom, but just gathering info at the moment!

I'm gathering information about BTC wallets for iOS and will use it to provide good info about what to look for or choose depending on a users needs or preferences.

If you are an iOS Bitcoin wallet user, I'd love to get your answers to the following questions - as well as critical comments of any answers provided here. That will help a lot. 

Here are my questions:

1. What features do you look for when choosing a mobile iOS Bitcoin wallet?

2. Which feature omissions are deal breakers?

3. Which features are deal-MAKERS?

4. What is your preferred app?

5. What, if any, great or terrible experiences have you had with any particular iOS Bitcoin wallet?

The method is based on clicking ads shown by the bot in Telegram App. For one click we get the equivalent of $1 (0.0001142 BTC).

Withdraw is available from 0.0025 BTC, but what's interesting is that in the guide you will see how to use a script that will show you how to make it completely automatically. 

It means that you can have the script working on your computer and you can go to sleep. By that time you can earn even up to $800.

eti787,fittes7,My 2 cents.,"Sometimes when I think about economics and bitcoin, I compare it to a video game I have played when I was a kid, - Maple Story.

For those who aren‚Äôt familiar with this game, it‚Äôs an online 2d game, you can buy &amp; sell items, upgrade them and build your character, etc, just like WoW and other similar games.

What amazes me is that fact there was free market. Let‚Äôs forget about the fact that people could get advantage by wasting real $ and buy in game items, there were free markets by all means, people used to let the market decide the price of every item, the most expensive items were the ones who have been finite in their quantity and considered rare, big part of these items were just collectibles, they had no use rather than ‚Äúshow off‚Äù.

The max amount of money (mesos) you could hold was 2,147,483,647 and everything had the same price for years and most of those collectible rare items even raised in price through the years.

Until the game master interfered.

They have raised the max amount of money you could hold to 9,999,999,999, they made money to be easier to get (for example instead of 1 meso for every monster you‚Äôve killed, they now awarded you with 10), and created version 2 for some of the collectible items. Prices quickly raised, the version 2 collectibles have cut the price of version 1 collectibles, but those items who have never been replicated since introduced, immediately raised in price and followed the inflation. People (including me) were frustrated because of the game masters behavior, and the game was, and now is dead.

That leads me to a question, how is that different from our real world? Banks are continuously raising the supply of our day-to-day money which is dollar for the most of us (dollar being the reserve currency of the world), I can compare version 2 collectibles to houses in the real world, for the reason that houses aren‚Äôt really following the inflation, because we build new houses and the speed of construction is getting faster and faster through the years, and every other asset is in some way expandable in supply, but bitcoin. I could compare bitcoin to those in game rare collectible items, that had no real use rather than show off, same with bitcoin, it doesn‚Äôt have any other use rather than the ability to transfer wealth from one place to another (Peter Schiff says this is a disadvantage).

I have also thought about this, and why would something that we call money to have any other user rather than anything related to payments, transfers, and money? Ok cool so gold can be used as jewelry, but gold isn‚Äôt priced 1500$ per ounce because of its use as jewelry material. Saying that bitcoin isn‚Äôt going to work because it doesn‚Äôt have any use rather than transfers online is like buying a wash machine and complaining that you can‚Äôt use it as a table.

I was using Bread App because it was the only thing that would work with my tech. set-up at the time. Also, it took my debit card to purchase BTC, which is desirable for me.

I have a debit card from a local credit union. They didn't mind Simplex.

etcr53,Smithtechguru,Recovery lost or stolen bitcoin,"Bitcoin is a digital currency created in January 2009. It follows the ideas set out in a whitepaper by the mysterious and pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity has yet to be verified. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued currencies. Unlike fiat currency, Bitcoin is created, distributed, traded and stored with the use of a decentralized ledger system known as blockchain.


Bitcoin's history as a store of value has been turbulent; the cryptocurrency skyrocketed up to roughly $20,000 per coin in 2017, but as of two years later, is currency trading for less than half of that. As the earliest cryptocurrency to meet widespread popularity and success, Bitcoin has inspired a host of offshoot and imitators. 

Over the years, many many companies have created different cryptocurrencies and different wallets like coinbase, blockchain, binance etc and many trading platforms where you can invest,halve or trade your money for more . 

There‚Äôs as much as $10 billion in stolen crypto out there in the market, according to Pawel Kuskowski, CEO of blockchain sleuthing firm Coinfirm. And he wants to give victims a fighting chance at getting their funds back.

Exclusively revealed to CoinDesk, Coinfirm has teamed up with global investigations firm Kroll, a division of consulting firm Duff &amp; Phelps. The joint initiative being launched is called ReclaimCrypto, and combines the latest blockchain forensic techniques with the more established world of legal investigation and asset recovery. 

Kuskowski told CoinDesk: ‚ÄúSo far, there is no one place where victims can go and get help. It‚Äôs almost like they are pleading to get someone interested in their case. In the end, they have to work it out themselves; see about getting a lawyer, perhaps in some other jurisdiction.

After a long research with my colleagues at the University we found out a way to trace and recover stolen Bitcoin and so far we have had over 100 successful ones since we started 2019.

https://preview.redd.it/vs8b0fpg9id41.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d4a7de2c9b2b712d959b06f4f6e01cbf7e664ca

For years now there has been possibilities to increase Bitmain bitcoin miners ‚Äúantminer‚Äù efficiency with custom firmware. It is understandable that Bitmain don‚Äôt want their customers to change overclock on their[ asic miners](https://mineshop.eu/asic-miner/). OC changes could possibly kill or damage hardware in some cases when chip oc and voltages applied to much. Overclock could kill miner it self or power supply. This is one of the reasons why Bitmain lately locks down their miners firmware, they dont want customers to do any changes on them.

The factory settings are standard, whoever is mining for while now. Knows that from some chips you can get better efficiency, just because quality of every chip is not the same. Lately there is been released an upgrade firmware and manual for Antminer S17 from hiveOS. HiveOS is gpu and asic miner monitoring/remote control. They previous firmware for Antminer S9 and T9 has been very successful. We have done review on this firmware also, and the best feature what Bitmain original firmware does not have is auto-chip tuning. It works very well, basically it finds the most optimal chip oc and the voltages to reach best efficiency.

We have now also tested the new firmware for Antminer S17, it does perform much better then Bitmain original firmware.On[ **Antminer S17 53TH/s**](https://mineshop.eu/asic-miner/antminer-s17-53th-s/) version , air cooled miner we where able to reach **75TH/s** u/3300 **watts**. It worked very well and setup is straight forward. It is possible to reach even better performance up to 85 TH/s , but you will need immersion cooling. As with air cooled at 75 th/s our miner chip temperatures where close to 80c at room temperature 15c. Also be careful , Bitmani stock power supply Antminer S17 max power usage is 3500 watts.

**hiveOS asic miner the installation guide** :

#### Notes

And now let‚Äôs go back to the installation process. There is no universal manual, for S17 and S17 Pro there are 3 versions of stock firmware. Therefore, every particular case has its own manual on the custom firmware installation.

Please note, that all the manual steps which involve using BTC*TOOLS can be done via ASIC‚Äôs web interface (BTC*TOOLS is usually used for a large number of devices).

#### Preparation Stage (required for all the options):

1 .Download and unzip the following archive:¬†[http://download.hiveos.farm/asic/repo/fw/Antminer/s9k-s9se-st15-st17-installer.zip](http://download.hiveos.farm/asic/repo/fw/Antminer/s9k-s9se-st15-st17-installer.zip).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jge60cb79id41.jpg?width=1749&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bed7fd0c00af661f98f5b1ba00ff20d1b699aff

1. Scan the network using BTC\_TOOLS and export the list to¬†**csv**. From csv, copy the¬†**IP list**¬†and insert it in¬†**ips.ini**. In case you don‚Äôt have a lot of devices, you can make this list manually. Or use bitmain ipreporter tool.
2. Go to¬†**config.ini**¬†and check login and password for the ASIC‚Äôs SSH or web interface. If the password for the web interface was changed, the same would be for SSH. Set up¬†**FARM\_HASH**¬†to connect to Hive or API, if necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ar6sto289id41.jpg?width=1934&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ee4c99dc7c12b30783b8577abc7eab3688f285a

1. Download the firmware file (it has to have ‚ÄúHiveon‚Äù in its title):¬†[http://download.hiveos.farm/asic/s17/](http://download.hiveos.farm/asic/s17/)

For S17 and S17 Pro, we offer the same firmware file. However, there are two options: ‚Äúsigned‚Äù and ‚Äúnosigned‚Äù firmware. The signed firmware can be updated ONLY to another signed Hiveon firmware via ASIC‚Äôs web interface or BTC\_TOOLS. Third-party or official firmware can‚Äôt be installed in this way. However, you can use the¬†rm -rf /etc/bitmain-pub.pem  
command ‚Äî send it to your ASICs via the Hive web. It will temporarily delete the certificate, but you can reboot your ASIC to bring it back. After this, you will be able to move to any firmware via the firmware update menu (in the Hive web). It will be possible to choose the firmware from the list or to use the URL.

The signed firmware can be downloaded here:¬†[http://download.hiveos.farm/asic/s17/Antminer-S17-S17pro-Hiveon-1.00-sign.tar.gz](http://download.hiveos.farm/asic/s17/Antminer-S17-S17pro-Hiveon-1.00-sign.tar.gz)

### If the stock firmware of your ASIC is released before 1 July 2019

1. Flash your devices with a file from the archive¬†**‚Äúremsig*****all*****before\_2019‚Äì07‚Äì01.tar.gz‚Äù**. This can be done via either ASIC‚Äôs web interface or BTC\_TOOLS in case you have a lot of devices. You will see an error in status, but this is okay ‚Äî it should be like this at the moment.
2. Flash the devices with the firmware file. Again, this can be done via either ASIC‚Äôs web interface or BTC\_TOOLS.
3. Launch¬†**‚Äú3*****hash*****farm*****for*****signed.cmd‚Äù**¬†from the archive. The ASIC will get connected to the web.

### Stock firmware released from July 2019 to December 2019

1. Launch¬†**‚Äú1*****open*****ssh.cmd‚Äù**¬†from the archive and wait for the script to be performed. The devices will be rebooted. After the reboot, wait for around 3 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Flash the devices with the firmware file (via either ASIC‚Äôs web interface or BTC\_TOOLS)

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img u3wfs3qa9id41...*

1. Launch¬†**‚Äú3*****hash*****farm*****for*****signed.cmd‚Äù**¬†from the archive. The ASIC will get connected to the web.

Please be aware you could damage your hardware by applying new overclock to your Antminer S17 .

ev1454,KamiKazeKenji,Warning! beldextrade.com is a scam - another fake giveaway,"I wasn't too privy to this specific scam before today, and I searched for the website in question but found nothing. The red flags were everywhere the entire time I was going through this, but it initially seemed legitimate enough for people to be easily deceived. Hopefully any potential victims can find this post and save themselves from being scammed.

It all started when I got a message on Discord ([https://imgur.com/1fMZ3qS](https://imgur.com/1fMZ3qS)) from a guy (ironically) named ""Crooked"" telling me I won $69 of bitcoin in a random giveaway. This was the first red flag but I clicked through just to take a look. I went to the site, created an account, and tried to withdraw my 0.008 BTC... [https://imgur.com/s1J4D5u](https://imgur.com/s1J4D5u) I have to gamble some of it away to withdraw it? Second major red flag.

At this point I had nothing to lose so I went ahead and bet the minimum of $15 on the roulette. When the timer hit 0, I was greeted with this: [https://imgur.com/xtXt80t](https://imgur.com/xtXt80t). I won $2k in bitcoin!? Yeah, obviously this is too good to be true, but in the moment I just blinked at the screen. There's a ""live"" chat with the gamblers chatting away, so I asked if I really just won. Some of them quickly answered me with the affirmative. It all looked pretty convincing, but I wouldn't be surprised if these are paid actors or even AI chatbots.

Then I tried to withdraw again, but I got a message telling me I need to talk to support to activate a ""bot app"". So I do, and support linked me to a chrome extension:  [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/a%D1%80%D1%80-cr%D1%83%D1%80t%D0%BE/bhihlepfeofebhiafmidfeipambijdgl](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/a%D1%80%D1%80-cr%D1%83%D1%80t%D0%BE/bhihlepfeofebhiafmidfeipambijdgl). I need to install it and log into coinbase / binance / etc to ""verify I'm not a bot or money launderer."" I read the reviews on the extension and it's glaringly obvious. The extension steals the login info of the wallet and the scammers empty it out. At this point I was certain this is a scam, but I spun up a VM to install it so I can get to the bottom of this.

Sure enough, another attempt to withdraw was met with failure, and further talk with the support rep informed me that I need to have at least $500 of bitcoin in my online wallet in order to be verified. After all these red flags, I'd have to be an idiot to go through with that, so I finally called them out on it. Alas, the rep promptly disconnected from the live chat and banned me from the gambling chat for good measure.

I know enough about scams to not fall for stuff like this, but I can totally see how people can. There's some techniques used in order quell the doubts that pop up while going through the hoops. There's the low initial giveaway (&gt;$100 seems believable), the rush of gambling (ESPECIALLY for people who are prone to these addictive behaviors) and ""winning"" $2k in realtime. This all reminds me of the old ""sign up for x to unlock free y"" scams that were all over the internet a decade ago, but a lot more nuanced and sophisticated. There's probably dozens, if not hundreds of these sites out there, but I feel the more info is out there the less people will end up falling for it.

TL;DR: If you get a message on Discord saying you won a small amount of bitcoin, ignore it. It's a scam.",1580188915,19,1

euzhyn,rula_khabaal,"Bitcoins can be printed, the infrastructure is already there - The Para Movement","\-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----

All the banknotes have a unique ID, right? And we have the promise of each banknote being unique, we have a whole infrastructure world wide to print banknotes in unique way as well as control and protect their uniqueness as much as possible. In that case, lets derive an address from the unique ID on a banknote by hashing it. We can then send coins to this address without any owner. The coins can't be retrieved any more from this address, therefore we have printed the coins kinda into the banknote. Someone possessing the banknote can validate the amount of coins printed on that banknote by simply scanning the banknote, generating the unique address and looking up the amount of coins. The community is going to establish the necessary conventions and protocols for implementing this idea pretty fast, no doubts there.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, its up to your imagination what we can do with printed cryptocurrencies and how they are going to change our lives. People are going to be much more careful when giving away a banknote because there might be some valuable coins on it, that is for sure. We are going to see apps for scanning the amount of coins, we are going to see professional devices for stores quickly checking the amount of coins on a banknote when accepting them. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the printed coins can't go back to the digital world anymore they are going to have their own valuation, own pairings and exchanges sooner or later. They are even going to have their own name (I would have suggested Bitcoin Cash in a parallel universe :) ), ""Bitcoin Para"" maybe, ""Bitcoin Para USD"", ""Bitcoin Para EURO"" etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cryptocurrencies vs cashless society, who would have thought that. I really don't know what kind of equilibrium this thought experiment ends in socioeconomically. Did we just start the Para Movement? Is this a turning point in history? Or are these just some nonsense ideas of a nerd hiding behind a nickname?

&amp;#x200B;

You guys are going to decide, like you did with Bitcoin.

&gt;I think this is really simple if you just ask some questions and get the answers. I'm not an expert, but even I can figure it out, e.g.  
&gt;  
&gt;from bottom to top:  
&gt;  
&gt;Q: What is a blockchain? A: A chain of batched data in which each batch of data is cryptographically linked to the previous batch.  
Q: Why is the data linked cryptographically? A: To make it difficult to change by brute force.  
Q: Why is the data linked together in a chain? A: To make the data increasingly difficult to hack as time progresses.  
Q: Why does it become increasingly difficult over time? A: Because miners regularly link new data to the end of the chain.  
Q: Why do they do that? A: Because they are rewarded for doing so.  
Q: How are they rewarded? A: With new bitcoins.  
Q: How is that a reward: A: It's a reward because people value bitcoins.  
Q: Why are bitcoins valued so highly? A: Because they are the only secure digital asset.  
Q: Why are they secure? A: Because it's almost impossible to hack the blockchain  
Q: Why? A: Because the blockchain data is decentralized and distributed, and the mining hash power is decentralized.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now from top to bottom:  
&gt;  
&gt;Q: What would it mean if the blockchain data wasn't decentralized and distributed, and the mining hash power wasn't decentralized? A: It would mean the organization that controls the blockchain can direct the mining to go back and change the data, no matter how old it is.  
Q: What does that mean? A: It means the data \[could\] be easily changed by the parent organization, but it would be difficult to change by others.  
Q: What does that mean? A: It means the tokens with which the miners are rewarded wouldn't be secure.  
Q: What does that mean? A: It means the tokens wouldn't be valuable because the parent organization can easily change them.  
Q: What does that mean? A: It means the process of mining wouldn't be rewarded with anything valuable.  
Q: What does that mean? A: It means there would be no incentive to mine new batches of data.  
Q: What does that mean? A: It means there would be no point in creating the blockchain in the first place.",1580152912,9,1

While most active conversations today in the space are about wider adoption of the blockchain technology (which often means selling out to the Wall St.) and competition with systems like Visa and Mastercard (which often means giving up with decentralization or introducing unclear security assumptions in the name of efficiency), there is the obvious need to revisit the roots of the cryptocurrency movement, which are mostly about decentralization. Many questions to be answered in clear here. Is it okay when 90% of mining power in Bitcoin [can gather in one room](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/673398201307664384)? Is it okay when 2 or 3 mining pools control majority of hashing power, so can do censorship? Is it okay when almost all the new nodes avoid processing a blockchain from its genesis block? Is it okay when a Proof-of-Work coin developers are doing a hard-fork changing the consensus algorithm to make it GPU-friendly again? Can we summarize all the issues with decentralization? Can we cover most of issues with technical means?

Decentralization is about many issues lying in many fields, of technical, social, and hybrid kinds. Researchers and developers are trying to find technical solutions, preferably, elegant and efficient. However, for many issues such solutions are not known, thus social solutions are also needed.

In this article I will cover only technical aspects of decentralization, namely, decentralization of mining and decentralization of verification.

## Decentralization of Mining

The two biggest concerns about decentralization of mining are specialized hardware (such as ASICs) and centralized pools.

With ASICs, a big player capable to invest enough money into R&amp;D can get unfair advantage from privately owned efficient hardware. In principle, for any kind of computational activity it is always possible to develop specialized hardware performing better than commodity computing units, such and CPUs and GPUs. However, for different computational tasks R&amp;D efforts and possible outcome could vary a lot. Reasoning behind a search for a perfect (or close enough to perfect) could be quite complex (see e.g. 30 pages long [Equihash paper](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/48)).

For most of Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZCash), 2 to 4 centralized mining pools  
control majority of mining power. This could mean easy censorship or frontrunning on applications (for example, reordering exchange orders), as in centralized pools only pool decides block candidate for the whole pool to work on. As a possible outcome, non-outsourceable mining schemes can prevent centralized pools formation. Only [Ergo Platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) is known for deploying a practical non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work scheme (based on a supposedly memory-harder problem from the [Equihash paper](http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/48)) called [Autolykos](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/ErgoPow.pdf).

As an example where social decentralization issues meet the decentralization of mining, sometimes developers of Proof-of-Work are introducing hard-forks to make a Proof-of-Work algorithm GPU-friendly again once ASICs are going to dominate in the mining market for the coin, however, it is always not quite clear why totally legit activity is banned and why developers (along with some users) can do hard-fork for this particular reason.

## Decentralization of Verification

Decentralization of verification is about possibility to check validity of blockchain history. Such check provides confidence that nothing bad (i.e not conforming to a protocol) was injected to the blockchain and thus give a user a right to reject malicious chain even if it has absorbed more work than alternatives. There were many talks about such the right in the Bitcoin community when it was partly hot about User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) idea, and recent article [‚ÄúWho secures Bitcoin?""](https://medium.com/@BitcoinErrorLog/who-secures-bitcoin-95b19bbcda3c) is summarizing this way of thinking well.

If verification can be done in reasonable time only by an entity able to spend millions on renting a datacenter, obviously a network is not decentralized. Ideally, it should be possible to check integrity of the whole blockchain on commodity hardware, like a decent laptop.

However, new blockchains also tend to absorb more and more features, and they are not coming for free. Then the huge topic in the research community is about how to make possible to check integrity of the whole blockchain with pruned blocks or system state (or both) under plausible assumptions. Possible solutions here are about bootstrapping state snapshot and blockchain suffix on top of it (popular in Ethereum protocol clients, and formalized in [an academic paper even](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/129.pdf)), stateless clients ([partially stateless](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/994), as implemented in [Ergo Platform](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) or [fully stateless](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/968) which do exist only in research papers currently).",1580475760,1,1
ewo242,sp0222,How does BTC payment in retail stores work?,"Take this article as example: [https://www.coindesk.com/japans-bic-camera-accept-bitcoin-payments-stores](https://www.coindesk.com/japans-bic-camera-accept-bitcoin-payments-stores)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A consumer electronics retailer in Japan is expanding a bitcoin payment option to all its stores nationwide.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone explain to me how this payments in stores work? Because from my understanding it takes min. \~ 10 minutes for the transaction to be added to the next block in the blockchain. Also if you buy goods for hundreds / thousands of USD the vendor would at least want 3 confirmations to be safe, or not? The customer obviously can't be forced to wait half an hour in the store so your transaction can be verified. So, after purchasing I could just leave the store and just instantly send the same BTC with a higher fee to an other wallet of mine and basically have the goods and my BTC still (double spend).

I understand that you could have instant transactions through Lightning Network. But wouldn't the store first need to open a payment channel with the customer who also should already have an initial funding transaction? It makes total sense e.g. for buying a daily coffee at work, but does it also make sense for a nonrecurring payment of possible thousands USD for camera equipment?

My other thought is to use it for purchases we make regularly (food for groups, office supplies).  Are there any sites like Amazon or office supply sites that would take bitcoin that anyone knows of, or does anyone have any suggestions on how we could do this?",1580455073,28,1

ewisgh,cloudgorilla,Question about Lightning and number of confirmations,"Bitcoin's massive hash rate should prevent deep blockchain reorgs with more than a couple of blocks replaced.

In the last 2 years a couple of shitcoins got 51% attacked and coins got sold on exchanges for Bitcoin before their blockchain was rewritten. 

In Bitcoin there is also the scenario that 2 miners find a block at almost the same time and it takes another additional block or two until it's clear what is the longest chain.

With the lightning networks success and growth it's going to be possible to send larger and larger amounts of ‚Çø over the network. First exchanges are already accepting deposits over the lightning network.

Is the following scenario possible, or how is it prevented:
Open a lightning channel, spend the funds out of that channel, chain gets reorganised and the channel opening transaction did never happen. 

With Bitcoin we say 6 confirmations gives finality, is there something in place for channel opening transactions?",1580444767,13,1

ewhda3,GcryptoS,General Crypto Store is now for sale.,"Hi all.

Long story short, I created this site because I love the crypto-space and wanted to contribute, but I am not a techie or programmer.  So, I figured the next best thing was to participate in the culture by selling fun merch like T-Shirts, mugs, and stickers.  Some other really cool products too, like a crypto smart ring, custom made jewelry, BTC cards, etc.  

Anyways,  I have another business that has been more successful monetarily, as well as a full time job.  So, instead of continuing to neglect it, I need to make the difficult decision to sell the store (generalcryptostore.com).

I still really believe this store has a lot of potential, and I have done a lot of the heavy lifting, but just don't have the necessary time to focus on it.

Included in the sale are the Shopify store, the domain, social accounts, email account, all original files of artwork and designs (about 5GB) and the rights to those materials, and all current arrangements/deals with suppliers which I've negotiated to allow for high margins and easy management.  I'll also work with you to make sure you get up and running smoothly, and answer any questions before, during, and after the handoff.

This is primarily a print-on-demand business, meaning the products are automatically created by the manufacturer when a customer submits an order.  I hold no inventory and don't need to handle any shipping - I just run the site and accounts. By putting a little effort into marketing, you could very easily create a source of passive income.

If you are interested, send me a PM.",1580438343,8,1

That is the volume ONLY using LocalBitcoin (LBTC), here people use Uphold, Airtm and other exchanges (even local ones).

Minimum wage (which is earned by a big chuck of the population, not like other countries) is 150.000 Bs. (Bolivares) wage (3 USD) + 150.000 Bs. food bonus (3 USD) PER MONTH.

Government gave away a 0.5 Petro airdrop to a lot of people two week ago as a ""bonus"", which is around 30 USD. More than a crypto, Petro works like an asset its USD value is fixed and the thing that changes is the Bs. (Bolivares) value. 

From the crypto perspective, it was ok, even when I dont sympathize with the current government. Anyway most of the people exchanged it to fiat to purchase food, even when the USD price of the petro is fixed as there is a lot of offer and low demand, people are paying low. 

This is a way of direct subside to people in need instead of subsiding the final products. So they are moving a little to the center from the left.

Biggest bank note is 50,000 Bs. which is around 1 USD. You need to use debit and credit, bank transfer, cryptos and USD to pay anything. There is a big department store, called Traki that accepts (besides USD and Bolivares) ETH, BTC, LTC and PETRO.

This after 5 zeroes were shaved from the currency less than a year ago and 3 zeroes more 12 years ago. So that banknote would be 5,000,000,000,000 Bs.

Here in Venezuela situation is really hard, some people dont believe that amount is the minimum wage. I work and earn a little more than that (anyway, the amount is really low, I'm sure with that amount I would be living homeless in Colombia, Peru or Panama for example), usually get some donations from redditors (I really thank them!) and do some freelancing work (translating mostly) and it is really hard to keep up daily. Sometimes people encourage me to keep posting.

Scarcity has lowered because goverment ""opened"" a little (their ""center"" movement), you can find a lot of products now at the stores and supermarkets (national production or imported), if you have a good wage or income you will be ""better"" now but if you are old and your only income is around one or two minimum wage, you cannot even enter the stores and you only can but two kilos of meat with your monthly wage.

e.g A Cryptocurrency start-up to solve remittance challenges or inflation issues, something like that.

I have a bachelors degree in accounting(which I didn't use) since I changed my career to being a Growth hacker at a start-up I was with from 2016-2018

Right now I'm now working on being a full stack web developer(self-taught) and could ""perhaps"" fit a junior dev role.

I'm also good at bookkeeping and accountancy since it is something I studied in college, but my career isn't going that way so it's just a complementary skill.

With Growth hacking, I'm also good at designing experiments, improving SEO, User Acquisition and Retention.

I have experience working in start-ups so I'm quite familiar with concepts like failing fast, product-market fit, etc etc.

The only way to effectively counter this would be with a better, more secure system that doesn't rely on the trust of an individual Country. Unless the USA is prepared for the World to move to a Chinese system.

Clearly, Countries around the World would vastly prefer a system that wasn't centrally controlled by a single Country. That is the very reason the whole World is moving away from US dollar denomination in the first place - it gives too much power to a single actor. This power is abused in the form of unilateral sanctions. Everyone has learned their lesson from this.

What if Bitcoin is and has been the USA's replacement Global financial system all along? There is literally no other way to develop such a system than to hide the creator. But no one in this World is or can be hidden from the NSA.",1577865131,22,1

eidszt,fabio-gomez,Proof of Nearest Consensus Protocol [PoN],"# Consenso Proof of Nearest [PoN] V0.7

**Fabio G√≥mez, Diciembre 2019**

https://nd2.io/

## Abstracto
El algoritmo de consenso PoN permite crear una red no permisionada segura, tolerante a fallas bizantinas, eficiente, escalable y con bajo costo de consumo energ√©tico. La participaci√≥n en la red PoN es f√°cil, libre, an√≥nima y NO requiere hardware aplicado como ASIC/GPU/FPGA/CPU-SGX, etc. Puede correr en una CPU convencional solo con una eficiente conexi√≥n a internet. 

En la red PoN cada nodo tiene el mismo poder, la misma probabilidad de ser recompensado y es resistente a las agrupaciones o pools de miner√≠a. El algoritmo aprovecha la aleatoriedad de un resultado impredecible pero determin√≠stico ‚Äî√∫nico para cada nodo/bloque‚Äî y lo convierte en un resultado llamado ***Distancia de Cercan√≠a Cuadrada*** o ***nd2***. Con este resultado PoN introduce una competencia y de esta, se genera una medida de dificultad cuantificable. Cada nodo puede obtener su resultado nd2 despu√©s de haber construido su propio bloque a partir de informaci√≥n clave del bloque base. Lo que garantiza que solo participan nodos habilitados, activos, debidamente conectados y procesando la informaci√≥n.

Para cada bloque son seleccionados en una competencia que involucra el resultado nd2, 28 nodos ordenados que resultan totalmente aleatorios, distribuidos, impredecibles, diferentes cada bloque y desconocidos entre ellos. Los nodos que obtengan un resultado nd2 dentro del umbral requerido, reclaman ante *""mediadores""* para participar en la loter√≠a. El nodo con distancia de cercan√≠a cuadrada (nd2) menor, ser√° el constructor del bloque actual y los siguientes 27 ser√°n los siguientes *""mediadores""* quienes divididos en nueve ternas, ejecutan un algoritmo que en 3 rondas de 3,  agrupan las transacciones recogidas para generar el siguiente bloque base sin posibilidad de agregar o eliminar m√°s transacciones que las que afirman o niegan al menos dos de los tres mediadores en cada terna y durante las tres rondas. Tambi√©n reciben las reclamaciones de los nodos que obtienen un nd2 dentro del umbral calificable; las validan, ordenan e informan a la red los resultados nd2 para el ganador y los siguientes 27 mediadores.

Los mediadores crean el bloque base de sus transacciones recibidas y distribuyen el registro de hashes y ra√≠z Merkle para que cada nodo, dentro de los l√≠mites de tiempo lo reconstruya desde sus propias transacciones y/o solicite las faltantes a sus pares cercanos. Ni el ganador ni los mediadores se conocen previamente. Mejorar los resultados nd2 que ha conseguido el conjunto de la red es en la pr√°ctica imposible. Falsos resultados nd2 no pasan la verificaci√≥n de la red. Tampoco pueden tener desacuerdos con sus pares, por lo que es imposible coludir.

Un mecanismo de inversi√≥n autorregulado por la demanda, define el costo de participaci√≥n que es igual para cada nodo. Fondos en la moneda nativa son usados para crear una transacci√≥n especial que habilita la direcci√≥n poseedora para participar de la miner√≠a. Aumentando la oferta de dep√≥sito, los nodos m√°s interesados empujan el umbral m√≠nimo del dep√≥sito obligando a los dem√°s nodos a superar este umbral y regulando as√≠ la participaci√≥n.  Hay tiempos previos y posteriores a la ventana de habilitaci√≥n que permiten detectar anticipadamente la planeaci√≥n de un posible ataque y tambi√©n castigar a los atacantes y nodos que los hayan respaldado apostando en ambas cadenas.

Cada bloque hay 28 recompensas lo que permite una eficiente distribuci√≥n sin acudir a agrupaciones. Para bloques de 1 segundo, habr√≠an 2,419,200 recompensados d√≠a aunque solo 86,400 bloques.

PoN tiene alta capacidad de transacciones y tiempos de bloque fijos que pueden ser muy peque√±os por lo cual est√° orientada a recoger y validar todas las transacciones solicitadas eliminando la cola en la mempool. Con las mejoras en conectividad, la capacidad de la red crece din√°mica y exponencialmente a mayor velocidad que la demanda de transaccionalidad. Una conexi√≥n de 20 Mb/s es suficiente para participar en una red que registre 4,386 TPS[^note_visa] aunque el promedio global de velocidad de acceso supera los 70 Mb/s o ciudades como Toronto superan los 140 Mb/s[^note_speed]. A medida que crece la transaccionalidad, el nodo solamente debe mejorar su velocidad de conexi√≥n a internet. De lo contrario, simplemente empieza a ver disminuida su oportunidad de ser recompensado al no alcanzar a procesar la informaci√≥n y competir dentro de los tiempos establecidos. La latencia y velocidad de transferencia son las √∫nicas limitantes[^note_disk].

Just ducking around for the past hour it‚Äôs been pointed out to me that bitcoin has an anonymity problem.

To me this seems fundamental to any cryptocurrency that will actually be used. I think a lot of people want something as anonymous as cash. I‚Äôve thought this for a while but feel even more strongly about it with all the privacy issues in the media.

In my searching it looks like Monero fits the bill, but I understand there are also other options.

What is the case for bitcoin as an actual currency as opposed to an alternative that has privacy baked in?",1577832137,18,1
ei9yll,Mark_Bear,Do yourself a favor: understand and always remember the difference between actual wealth and money,"There is **actual wealth**.  For example, a cart full of apples is actual wealth.  The cart is actual wealth.  The apples are actual wealth.  The trees the apples came from, the land the trees grow upon -- actual wealth.  People used to barter - that is, trade actual wealth for actual wealth - but bartering has serious limitations.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is **real money**, good money, sound money.  For example, gold is real money.  So is silver.  **Bitcoin is real money**.  You might trade a gold coin for the cartload of apples, for example.  Good money has certain properties: durable, recognizable, fungible, divisible, portable, difficult/impossible to counterfeit, **scarce**, expensive/difficult to produce/obtain.  

&amp;#x200B;

People used to use good money.  It typically beats bartering, but has it's own limitations.  The use of a precious metal for real money improved greatly with the advent of standard coins in standard, known weights.  Imagine trading a box of apples for a lump of silver as opposed to trading the apples for a one-ounce silver coin.  Coins inspire trust.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then there are **bank notes**.  The idea here is that there is an amount of ""real money"" locked in a vault someplace, and that the note can be redeemed for the amount of ""real money"" printed thereupon.  In this case, we can say that the notes are ""**backed by**"" the gold or silver in the vault.  Notes tend to be more convenient than carrying bags of metal coins around.  Still, the bankers tended to cheat and issue more notes than the amount of metal they were storing.  Bank runs happened.  For a while, fractional reserve banking was attempted; a banker might be allowed to issue notes for ten ounces of silver for every ounce actually in their vault.  Still, people cheat, and then the bank runs start.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is **fiat money**, that is, ""**play money**"".  In this case, a government or central bank might print fancy-looking notes, but there is no real money, nor any actual wealth backing them.  They are not ""backed by"" anything other than thin air.  At this point, the fiat money pretends to be a bank note which is backed by real money which can be exchanged for some actual wealth.  As you can see, fiat money is pretty far removed from any actual wealth.  Fiat money lacks some of the properties necessary for sound money.  Fiat currency is not sound money.  

Fiat money is inherently dishonest.  Central banks, for example, have created many tens of trillions of dollars worth of it since about 2008, and have used it to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies at the expense of the rest of us.  When central banks create more fiat money, then use it to buy actual wealth (eg, land), they are unfairly transferring that actual wealth unto themselves, but at a cost.  Naturally, you and I and just about everybody else you ever meet are the ones who get to pay that cost.  We pay the cost, but they get the actual wealth -- this is a form of theft.  Central bankers are thieves.  Con men.  

&amp;#x200B;

There is also **digital** money.  In the case of digital fiat money created by central banks, they don't even bother to print the notes.  It exists only as ""bits"" inside the banking system's computers.  To create, say, 800 billion dollars only requires some numbers to be typed into a computer - no printing, no notes, no coins.  When people talk about central banks creating ""digital currency"" to replace or compete with Bitcoin, those people are ignorant and/or dishonest.  About 90 percent of all fiat money right now exists only in digital form.  This has been true for decades.  Digital currency is nothing new.  

&amp;#x200B;

But what about Bitcoin?  Yes, Bitcoin is also a form of digital money, but it is not fiat money, nor is it ""backed by"" anything.  Yet Bitcoin is sound money.  Like gold, Bitcoin backs itself because it has all the properties of ""good money"" (sound money, strong money, real money).  Unlike gold, Bitcoin is digital, which gives it certain significant advantages over gold.  

&amp;#x200B;

You will do yourself a favor to understand and always remember the difference between actual wealth and money -- especially fiat money.",1577831780,8,1

Now that introductions are done,
I am an individual that has been interested in crypto for some time now.
I am yet to go beyond the initial investments I have made and am looking to work within the market.

I have no doubt that the market as a whole is in its inception and that going forward it will be considered, like the internet a ‚Äòdisrupter‚Äô completely changing the way we do things and are as beings on this earth, in terms of the person-person transactions globally.
I am looking for career opportunities in the field but have seemingly started to hit walls when looking into it.
This has gone on for two years now. Iv spent so much time thinking about it and what route I could go down and in the end haven‚Äôt really made a step in doing anything.
There are a few courses I have come across in blockchain, but is there anyone that works in the field?
Would you recommend the course route? 
What courses are there that come with recommendations?

What are the emerging jobs within the sector?
What is required for these jobs? 
Are there any entry level positions in such a market?

I am willing to study and work hard from the bottom up but I am experiencing difficulty in where to begin.
My academic background is fairly good but my working background provides its own accolades. (I work in sales at the moment)
When I get into something and see a route for growth and expansion I do really try and push the boundaries and achieve and exceed the goals set by the company and those that I set for myself which i constantly re-adjust. I have now just hit a stalemate. 

I know this is slightly more personal in this thread, but if anyone has any suggestions I would be extremely grateful.
The new year is upon us and I just want to go into it with solid intentions and something to look forward to (2019 has been quite a damaging year though I suppose all damage can be perceived as growth in the end)

I hope you can provide me with some positive informative input.

I am wondering if you can help me please, I am currently building a website where I can teach people about Bitcoin. This will be mainly for beginners; where new users can educate then self about bitcoin and the basic on how to open account, secure the account and mail using 2FA, buy, sell, choosing the right wallet, hardware wallet and more, etc. 

The website will be in Spanish as I find out that here in Spain people don‚Äôt know much about Bitcoin and many believe it is for criminal and terrorist. 

I don‚Äôt want to make it complicate for the users as the idea is to help then understand why it is important to embrace this technology in which is here to stay. 

I do have a lot of material already, but I didn‚Äôt realise when you are building something there are many little pieces that you learn on the road that you didn‚Äôt even remember. 

I would like your advice for example, I am planning in creating two tutorial on Trezor T and Ledger Nano S for the serious people who really want to invest and explain why it is import to use hardware wallet but what will be yours advice on daily wallet?. I do want to take only 1 possible 2. I do want to take into consideration users on Android and Apple. I been using for a long time BreadWallet and Exodus is great, but I want your opinion. 

The idea is to provide quality content, make it easy for the new people so they don‚Äôt go crazy download wallet and keep the 12 words etc, open accounts with exchanges, I do use Binance but I want your opinion in what work and what doesn‚Äôt work. 

I do have some idea, but I would like to hear your opinion in anything, video tutorial, top exchanges, best wallet, anything that can help me to make it easy to them. 

Any information will be welcome and really appreciate, r/bitcoin help me a lot to understand Bitcoin and now I would like to do the same but in my mother tongue. What I really want is give back to the community here what I learn here on reddit and other places.  

Please note that I do not want to be another website with news and daily info on BTC, I do want people to understand bitcoin and blockchain and this can be using video tutorial or anything else. 

Thank you so much for your time.

ej08di,CryptigoVespucci,Why 2020 will likely see at least one high-profile tax evasion case of a high-profile early adopter,"From Messari's year-end report: 

&gt;If crypto tax reporting is a nuisance, then audits and fraud nightmares are just about to begin. It will likely start with those who failed to comply with the IRS‚Äôs strictest warning letters this past summer regarding potential penalties for non-compliance, and **I am 90% confident we‚Äôll see at least one high-profile tax evasion case of a high-profile early adopter in 2020.** The IRS will go with the lowest hanging fruit (true fraud), then work their way to more advanced cases as they begin to rack up legal wins and important precedents.  
&gt;  
&gt;The first batch of targets will date back to the subpoena of Coinbase [**and the 13,000 customer records they turned over in 2018**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/irs-sending-warning-letters-to-more-than-10-000-cryptocurrency-holders-11564159523). But you can rest assured that records of anyone and everyone who has traded on Coinbase, Poloniex, Kraken, Gemini, and Bittrex in the U.S. since then are now in the hands of the IRS. The next shoes to drop in 2021+ will be in cases where customers failed to report crypto-crypto trades, inappropriately flagged them as ‚Äúlike kind‚Äù, or failed to account for [**forks and airdrops**](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/42669/irs-issues-guidance-on-tax-implications-of-cryptocurrency-hard-forks). Short of a safe harbor provision for crypto investors who transacted before a certain date (or an act of Congress), these cases will linger for many, many years. And it gets worse!  
&gt;  
&gt;The truly scary new development lies in what we know the IRS is already pursuing, and the fact that the IRS has three years after a return‚Äôs due date to assess a deficiency, but *six years if income is understated by more than* *25%.* That means you can expect enforcement against beneficiaries of the 2013 Coinbase bubble by October of this year, and enforcements against 2017 Poloniex/Bittrex token flippers and shitcoin traders as late as 2023.

# 

# Why OTC broker (instead of a crypto exchange)?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Lack of liquidity** ‚Äî crypto exchanges have low liquidity. OTC desks are good for pushing through large trade orders searching for market liquidity.
* **Price protection, Anonymity** ‚Äî OTC is good for moving large orders which avoids impacting the price, e.g. 1,000 BTC. Order depth will not show up like it does on an exchange.
* **No fiat onramp** ‚Äî few crypto exchanges have a fiat onramp (though Binance is working on it and already have some solutions in place in Asia).
* **Avoid price ‚Äòslippage‚Äô** ‚Äî price slippage occurs on exchanges when the executed price is different to the expected price.
* **Avoid prohibitive crypto exchange limits** ‚Äî the majority of crypto exchanges have prohibitive trading limits. For example, Coinbase limits purchases to $25,000 per day. Kraken only lets you withdraw $2,500 per day and $20,000 per month. Circle imposes withdrawal limit of $3,000 per week.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Who are the main buyers and sellers?

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, the main buyers are hedge funds and the main sellers are miners. In Oct 2018, it was reported in [Reddit Rumours](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ksz6h/institutional_investors_are_secretly_buying/) that hedge funds were buying large volumes from miners. The main participants trading crypto OTC are:

* Hedge funds, smaller asset managers, family offices (buyers).
* Miners (sellers).
* Regulated broker-dealers (on account).
* Crypto exchange OTC desks (on account).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# What are the main problems?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Settlement risk** ‚Äî there is no guarantee the asset will be delivered, or cash will be paid. Coin transfer often happens much faster than the wire payment transfer (often by several hours).
* **No custody solution** ‚Äî most OTC brokers don‚Äôt provide a custody solution (or provide a very limited service), which can increase settlement and operational risk.
* **Multi-jurisdictional KYC issues** ‚Äî dealing with countries with poor KYC regulations can be a deal breaker.
* **If you execute through an OTC broker** you need, for example, to deliverthe ETH to the broker. There is no guarantee the broker's client will pay.
* **The larger the order** the greater the risk of default with multiple counterparties.
* OTC crypto is **missing the** **monitoring** and **surveillance tools** of traditional trading systems.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# What we do?

&amp;#x200B;

ROX Capital AG team is working on Decentralised Finance technology which brings fully trustless direct asset exchange tools to customers of OTC companies and crypto exchanges.

ROX is designed the platform that helps to build trust between exchange members based on a trustless technology which retains assets control by beneficiaries on any stage of a process.

The system of Smart Contracts provides a simple tool that help participants exchange Proof-of-Funds in seconds without moving funds to a broker or third party escrow until needed amount and price requirements achieved from both sides.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](wedo9uy3jd841)

&amp;#x200B;

# Features

&amp;#x200B;

* SaaS Provider for OTC and other Institutionals
* Trustless Smart Contract Network^(4)
* Impersonal Orders with Proof-of-Funds from KYC Verified Members
* Integration with third party OTC desk
* Referral program for Agents and Deal Merge Fee Trustee
* Onchain trustless deals initiate by manager or beneficiary
* Cross-chain^(5) Trustless DLT System

&amp;#x200B;

*4¬† Trustless Network is based on blockchain opportunities, the system provides manager or beneficiary to setup terms for each deal, including price, referral fee amount, choose exact whitelisted tokens for both sides of exchange, also minimum transaction volume or fix lot for change. The all details are transparent and available in blockchain comments and through the provided interface for both sides.*

*5¬† On the first stage we provide Ethereum ERC-20 based MVP which is demonstrate the concept and during the public Beta-test continue working with Bitcoin blockchain integration stability.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Two or more OTC brokers can merge any deal, set-up needed fee size and share it through built in partner program.

Time is saved for all market participants ‚Äî from agreement to transfer receipt both sides could spend less than 1 hour, instead of days or weeks.

Anonymity is protected ‚Äî large impersonal¬†reliable orders and no needed meetings anymore.

As the majority of brokers execute based on **Request for Quote** (RFQ) and **‚ÄòFill or Kill‚Äô** (FOK). That‚Äôs why we created four types of contracts:

1. FOK with two participants and fix lot order.
2. FOK with two participants and minimum order amount.
3. One side offer can be filled with unlimited transactions from second side and minimum order amount.
4. One side offer can be filled with unlimited transactions from second side with fix lot order.

*Contracts can be declined by initiator any time before lot or minimum order amount fulfilment. If declined, all funds returns to senders without any fees. Same as escrow but trustless.*

Options

ROXY provides:

1. Web app cabinet, where broker prepare a deal in three simple steps: choosing contract type, fill up details (tokens for buyer and seller, price, lot/minimum amount, fee, other additional details) and creates contract with transparent accepted by participants terms.
2. White label integration.

*The service is provided under an agreement B2B to a companies authorised to proceed exchanges of crypto assets for their customers according to regulatory agreements in the countries where entities operating.*

Bitcoins 7 Baby Steps will show you how to buy bitcoin, build wealth and take control of your money for good.

(We recommend having a household budget and emergency fund before embarking on the bitcoin baby steps)

Baby step 1: Buy a small amount of bitcoin ($100 or so). 

Buying bitcoin is easy. Tons of apps are available. 

After you buy, just leave your bitcoin on the app. You will use this same app later if you wish to sell.

Great üëçüèº now you‚Äôve got your first bit of bitcoin!

Baby step 2: Buy more bitcoin.

Now that you‚Äôre comfortable buying, it‚Äôs time to start stacking sats. 

Sats are fractions of bitcoins. You want to stack as many as possible. 

But only stack what you‚Äôre comfortable not touching for 5+ years. 

Bitcoin is a long term investment.

Baby step 3: Purchase a hardware wallet.

Once you have $1,000 or more in bitcoin. It's time to get serious about your bitcoin security by taking your coins off the app.

Purchase a hardware wallet.

These devices store bitcoin offline (cold storage) so they are safe from hackers

Baby step 4: Take control of your sats (bitcoin).

Up until now you‚Äôve only had an iou, time to get your bitcoins off the app and send to your hardware wallet.

Send a small transaction ($10) in order to get comfortable making transactions.

Then send the rest of your sats.

Baby step 5: Learn more about bitcoin. 

As you wait for the price to rise, learn a little more about bitcoin.

There are so many high quality podcasts, books, articles etc... 

This isn‚Äôt like school.

Bitcoin content sparks your imagination and makes you excited.

Baby step 6: Multisig service.

Bitcoin can rise pretty fast. You may find yourself in a position where suddenly your $1,000 is now 100k. 

Multisig provides an extra level of security by splitting access to your bitcoin amongst multiple hardware wallets. 

We like @CasaHODL.

Baby step 7: Run a full node. 

Full node sounds scary and confusing. 

But a full node is just a copy of the bitcoin blockchain that you will use to receive and send transactions. 

You can do this by downloading the blockchain on your laptop, or you can buy a node pre-synced.

These baby steps are meant as a starting point and a touchstone.

You‚Äôll do steps 1 and 2 at the same time.

Steps 3 and 4 at the same time

and steps 5, 6 and 7 all at the same time.

Congratulations! üéâ 

You‚Äôre now in a position to get rich as bitcoin continues to dominate.",1577953830,66,1

eldgw8,Neckername,Welcome to the new floor,"So new here. Not new to trading, and always trying to learn new things about Crypto. I'm seeing a lot of people saying bitcoin's price is in a downward spiral. It's important to note that was true. The end of 2019 we saw many resistances break and stay broken. And we seem to have gotten past some of the resistances between $7100 and $7400. Taking a look at the big picture on now on where we are at with bitcoin pricing, it seems we are making a new support. It's hard to fnd trace of any pivot points buried under a bunch of trend-following buys/sells. We need to see volume. Even though there is a lot of selling going on. It still hasn't trumped the buyers from this week. And the hourly and longer periods are pretty close to an equal buy/sell split. Meaning the price should maintain itself within reason to what it is now. If a drop occurs this most likely will be temporary. The news about Iran has helped us reach this price. This will continue as people look for highly secure, nation agnostic, but yet still relatively liquid ways to store funds. With that being said, it looks like numbers AND the stars around them are aligning for a new major support this year. If the majority of speculations I've seen are at least partially right, this could take us back to $15,000, although I wouldn't be optimistic about any sustainable price points above that. Anyone have similar thoughts? Contrasting ones are welcome as well with backing reason!",1578413149,12,1

em0rlc,MakeTotalDestr0i,.,"We want to compare the true performance of one asset to that of another, and
therefore it‚Äôs important to find time series that really resemble changes in equity
over time that an investment would have experienced. A stock market index
would be nice because it will give a broad overall impression. It won‚Äôt depend
too much on the specific fortunes of any given company.
Strangely, most stock indexes are simply weighted averages of (free-float)
market capitalization of a bunch of listed companies, but when one of those
companies pays a dividend of $10, say, and its shares correspondingly drop by
$10, the index drops too. We don‚Äôt want that, so we‚Äôll have to find an index
that properly accounts for dividends.
S&amp;P500TR The S&amp;P500TR includes dividends as desired, so we‚Äôll use it as the risky
asset and play it against 10-year T-bills as the riskfree asset.
DAX Another index that includes dividends is the German DAX, and we‚Äôll try
that out too. In this case we will use German overnight deposits for the
riskfree asset.
Bitcoin As any scientific model, stochastic market efficiency applies within some
range of conditions. We will use Bitcoin to discover the limits of this
range. We developed our hypothesis using our knowledge and intuition
of economies, stock markets, and central banks. Let‚Äôs take it outside of
this context and see what happens if we use Bitcoin as the risky asset. It
doesn‚Äôt pay any dividends, so we don‚Äôt have to worry about that, but its
performance has been very different from that of a stock market, so it will
be informative to see what will happen to our hypothesis.
Madoff We take the idea of finding the limits of the range of applicability one step
further, by using an asset that has officially been declared bullshit: investments in Bernie Madoff‚Äôs Ponzi scheme. Monthly returns were included in
a now famous complaint filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) by Harry Markopolos in 2005 [38]. The complaint was ignored by
the SEC, and Madoff happily continued his scheme until the turbulent
financial events of 2008 brought to light what he‚Äôd been up to. We digitized the returns in Markopolos‚Äôs complaint and ran the same backtests
for Madoff as for the other assets.
For all assets, we will overestimate real optimal leverage in the most straightforward backtest. Here are some reasons:
1. Whenever trading occurs to rebalance the portfolio, trading costs would
be incurred in reality.
2. Money borrowed for leveraging up (and shares borrowed for shorting)
come at a premium that the investor has to pay.
3. Stock indexes reflect well diversified portfolios of successful companies
‚Äì they are affected by survivorship bias because unsuccessful companies
leave the index.

final equity (BTC)
Bitcoin
Figure 30: Final equity x`(t0; `) for investments of initially $1 in the S&amp;P500TR
(blue), the DAX (yellow), and Bitcoin (red, scale on the right). The maxima
of all three curves are near the predicted optimum of `opt = 1, where by ‚Äúnear‚Äù
we mean that they are all within 2 standard errors of the prediction, without
any correction for the biases introduced by neglecting trading costs.
We could try to correct for this bias, and we have done that in [52]. The
necessary assumptions make the results more realistic but also more dependent
on subjective guesses, so we‚Äôll just stick to the simplest case here and note that
it will produce an over-estimate of `opt.
5.4.3 Full time series
The bottom panel of Fig. 29 shows the leverage-return curve for the S&amp;P500TR.
The optimal leverage is a little greater than 1, but still within 2 standard errors
from the prediction. Without further ado, let‚Äôs add to this figure the same
curves for the DAX and Bitcoin, this time on logarithmic vertical scales to see
a bit more structure, Fig. 30.
The overall impression that emerges is this: leverage efficiency is reasonably
satisfied for these assets. The shaded areas in Fig. 30 show the predicted ranges,
2 statistical standard errors to the left and right from `opt = 1, and all observed
maxima of the curves are within these bands. We also see a convincing bias: all
estimates are greater than 1, as expected given the bias in the estimate that we
mentioned earlier.
From a scientific point of view it‚Äôs not very interesting to show lots of cases
where a theory gives good predictions. We want to know the limits of the
theory. When does it not apply? Where does it break down? Before we looked
at the data we thought that Bitcoin might be an example of an asset that doesn‚Äôt
obey stochastic market efficiency. But it looks just as predicted ‚Äì unspectacular.
We didn‚Äôt have a specific reason to suspect that the theory wouldn‚Äôt apply to
Bitcoin, it just seemed like an extreme asset, unlike the assets we had in mind
when we developed the theory.
125
But let‚Äôs see what happens where the theory really doesn‚Äôt apply. In Fig. 31
we add to the curves of Fig. 30 the return-vs.-leverage curve for Bernie Madoff‚Äôs fund. This is instructive because it shows just how different the results
could have been. If it weren‚Äôt for leverage efficiency optimal leverage for the
S&amp;P500TR, for example, could be miles away from our prediction. We have
to show the Madoff data in a separate figure because the scales are so different
that the differences between Bitcoin, S&amp;P500TR, and the DAX become barely
visible, and we thought they may be of interest. Apart from showing the limits of the range of applicability of our theory, the Madoff data suggest that
leverage-return curves can help detect investments that are too good to be true,
i.e. fraud.
Of course, Madoff could have chosen the invented returns of his fund in a
way that‚Äôs consistent with stochastic market efficiency, just to have something
credible to show to prospective victims of his fraud. But apparently he didn‚Äôt
bother to do that, and people believed that he‚Äôd really found a way to print
money. As a former CEO of Nasdaq he himself had sufficient credibility, never
mind the data.
That stochastic market efficiency really doesn‚Äôt apply to Madoff‚Äôs returns is
a good sign ‚Äì showing that a theory fails to predict things it shouldn‚Äôt be able to
predict is important. A theory about asset price fluctuations that applies even
to fictitious prices like Madoff‚Äôs would be suspicious ‚Äì it would probably not say
much about prices at all but just be a statement that‚Äôs generally true for a much
broader class of phenomena. Having said this, introducing realistic transaction
costs, leveraging something by a factor of 100 or 200 is extremely expensive,
and the Madoff optimal leverage comes down significantly in a more realistic
setup. Nonetheless, in Fig. 31 Madoff‚Äôs returns have a statistical signature
that is unequivocally different from prices arising through trading that we have
investigated.",1578525629,2,1

They are excusing every time because the system has been hacked and for this reason requested from me to pay for the escrow fees again and another time the support engineer has been stealing my coin when he gave me his wallet address to deposit in his account instead I have to deposit to Bot, even the escrow company name , they refused to give the name of the company to me which is my right and should be in this situation to judge in this conflict , specially every time they excuse by their fees (escrow company fees).They are stealing from me more than 2 BTC.

why?

purchasing power!

has bitcoin a rather stable purchasing power?

elub3f,pastpresentposterity,How to prove you are a time traveler using the bitcoin blockchain,"It turns out there are more applications of bitcoin than simply revolutionizing every economic system ever conceived. It is also possible to prove you traveled through time with the help of the hashing mechanism behind our favorite blockchain. 

As a thought experiment, consider the following calculation. 

Assume every gigahash per second for the bitcoin PoW mechanism requires [1 Watt](https://www.thebalance.com/how-much-power-does-the-bitcoin-network-use-391280). The bitcoin network currently operates at 121*10^9 GH/s, thus using 121* 10^9 Watts per second.

For comparison, the sun is producing 3.846* 10^26 Watts per second.

This means the sun is producing 3.2*10^15 times more energy per second than the Bitcoin blockchain is currently using. 

Currently, blocks start with 19 zeros. With 3.2*10^15 times more energy, you could produce an additional 13 zeroes for a total of 32 leading zeroes per block. This is assuming that each additional zero requires 16 times more work.

Now, if you as a civilization are able to use the energy of your host star, that makes you a type II civilization on the Kardashev scale.

My challenge to the universe and its type II civilization time travelers is simple. Produce an empty block with around 32 leading zeros in the coming year and we‚Äôll take notice.",1578497960,16,1

1. first of all the miners won't be as interested in mining Bitcoin once that supply has almost been met or the difficulty of the final bit coins are too high compared to the cost of electricity Etc. Mining will have to be done by people on a basis that they will be compensated by the fees paid.

2. Ultimately Bitcoin will fail as the demand for money is constantly increasing as economic activity increases. Especially if Bitcoin where to go mainstream the demand for it would keep going up and up. And I don't mean for the next 5 or 10 years but for the next 50 or 70 years...

3. 3rd and the one I'm most curious to hear people's opinions about dot-dot-dot losing Bitcoins. There is an unknown number of Bitcoins now which are lost. For example if somebody had the private keys on a hard drive or paper and lost Them. I'm not sure what the current estimates of lost Bitcoins are right now but I know there are significant amount of Bitcoin that are lost and can no longer be circulated if you assume that by human error people will lose private keys as it's an event that no doubt happens quite regularly, imagine how this will look like throughout the years... In 5 or 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years... not only is the supply of Bitcoin finite but also the Bitcoin in circulation will gradually decrease as people lose their private keys buy one way or another.",1578167719,15,0

What is truly mind-blowing about this is that if the cointegration of the stock to flow model holds, then the following is also true:

All other factors that we think influence price are really just noise - all China FUD, exchange hacks, Bitcoin sentiment and google search trends, noobs mistakenly buying BCash and shitcoins, people not realising they can buy fractions of Bitcoin etc.

I repeat - EVERYTHING else is noise, only the scarcity of Bitcoin matters in terms of its price and value.

I'm trying to update my current node (v0.18.1.0). I'm running my node on Mac using an external HD.

Everything is on my HD except for the bitcoin.conf file and the Bitcoin Core icon in my Applications folder.

I was able to launch my node using the icon on my Application folder (bitcoin-qt) or using the command line (bitcoind)

Since I downloaded the new version (v0.19.0.1), I have the following issue:

When I launch my node using the icon on my Application folder (bitcoin-qt) everything is fine and the new version is running (using the data in my external HD), but when launch the node using the command line (bitcoind), it still launch the old version.

Is there a separate update from bitcoind? I've done some research online but I didn't find anything helpful.

Thank You!!!

ekh83z,Silver4R4449,Why Bitcoin POW will Always be better than Altcoin Consensus mechanism,"Each Bitcoin created by POW immediately has a value attached with it.  Whoever spent the cost of electricity and mining equipment knows the coin is either worth that much at minimum.  Even if they think the price would go down in the future, the miners already know the price they paid for it.  That estimate is in their heads.  As the price goes up miners will sell at a profit in Fiat.  If the price goes down miners will believe it is undervalued and will hold because they know the minimum that they paid for the coin.

With POS there is no immediate price tag for the coins.  Someone sold the coins to you at a price based on speculation and not natural resources(POWER) and technology(mining equipment).  Or the POS coins were air dropped or Pre-mined in which case they still start with a value based purely on speculation.

With other configurations of consensus the Network has either: 

1 Based value on something arbitrary or unpredictable

&amp;#x200B;

2 Not yet been Decentralized

&amp;#x200B;

3 Based on Voting.

- send 0.05btc to a given lightning channel
- spend/send various amount until 0.05 is almost reached ..
- once not enough funds available in lightning channel is reached ( I.e. .0001btc), close channel
- ""empty"" eclair wallet completely and refund it with another 0.05btc and so one ..

Is privacy preserved since eclair wallet has been emptied out and refilled , assuming a new address is used for replenishing?

ek7x8t,sotoc20173,Why Cryptocurrency is better than fiat currency?,"I think in this modern age the question of ‚Äúwhich currency should I own?‚Äù is something a lot of people that I know ask themselves when it comes to purchasing currency. There are a lot of choices to choose from such as US Dollars, Chinese RMB, Japanese Yen and many more, those are mainly fiat currencies.¬† However, all those currencies stated are all controlled by banks that regulate their value and are heavily affected by financial crashes such as the one in 2008. As a result sometime after the financial crash of 2008, Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum were created in order to have a currency that isn‚Äôt regulated by the banks and relies on how much trust we put into its value. Here are some reasons why Cryptocurrencies are better than fiat currency.  


1. Cryptocurrencies are now becoming more accepted as a means of trade worldwide.  
¬†¬†¬†A few years after the introduction of Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, people around the world are starting to see Cryptocurrencies as a trustworthy means of transaction which means that you can go to most countries which basic Internet infrastructure and do business transactions using your Crypto Wallet whether a digital one or a physical one which means that you don‚Äôt need to call your bank in order to make your account accessible to when you go to other countries as Crypto Wallets are accepted anywhere where Cryptocurrency transactions are being made.  


2. Cryptocurrencies have top-notch security and cannot be easily fooled  
Cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology in order to make sure that there are no inconsistencies when it comes to transactions. If there are any inconsistencies with the transaction, the blockchain will reject the transaction and your money will still be in your Crypto Wallet.  


3. Cryptocurrency transactions are secure transactions  
As stated earlier, Cryptocurrencies have top-notch security using blockchain technology. They also keep all transactions on record anonymous as the only person who knows their Crypto Wallet Address is yourself and wherever you post your address link to.¬† You can keep generating new addresses if your previous Address is compromised.¬†",1578197988,10,0

I wanted to invest because I wanted to buy a Nintendo Switch, since most of the people I knew had Pokemon Sword/Shield or Super Mario Maker.  I know it is very childish, but I'm sure most of you really enjoy the classic children games xD.  Anyways, I saw bitcoin on how it had a very high volatility.  Also, many news articles, reports, videos suggested that 2020 is the year since bitcoin halving is coming up.  I wanted to invest as soon as possible, but so many people I came across said wait until February or buy it tomorrow or wait 2 weeks.  The understatement is I didn't really get a straight answer.  But, now that I realize it I want to invest because I really want to help my mom out with income.

I would be sincerely grateful if the experts of this community can give me their feed back.  Should I invest right now or wait next week or wait until next month?  Thank you everyone!",1578694481,28,1

Because of these properties, Gold‚Äôs first uses were probably as money (and possibly jewelry).

In a similar respect, Bitcoin‚Äôs first use case was money (store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account) primarily because of the intrinsic rules of its protocol and how those rules attracted people who believe in radical verification, which created a network effect and gave it a huge head start to develop a community who could put their trust in a protocol that relies on 0 trust and 100% (or 99.99999%) verification.... in time we may see new uses for Bitcoin that we have not invented yet (similar to how we developed other use cases for gold, which didn‚Äôt exist when humans first started discovering it around the world).",1578685650,10,1

ems67f,holyHeidelberg,"Yet another take on ""bitcoin and crypto are scams""","Hi All,

I know, hundreds of posts like these have probably been written throughout crypto‚Äôs relatively short history: crypto is a fraud, a ponzi, etc.

I wasn't sure where to put this, but I ‚Äòd very much like to hear your opinions on my particular take on this matter. So Here it goes: 

Seeing how much the physical metals market has been and continues to be manipulated, the trillions of dollars conjured up by the fed the prop up the stock market, ‚Ä¶ and really, how the story of modern man has always been one characterised by an elite fleecing the proles at every step; doing everything they can to make sure they never get the chance to really build and safeguard capital for the long term, I wonder how the cryptomarket fits into to this story. 

At least to me, this notion that for the most part, the enormous run-up in prices until the last bubble popped, has been purely speculative, makes much sense to me. A bubble driven by the idea that there‚Äôs always a sucker somwhere down the line willing to buy a stash of coins preferably at much higher prices. I mean, was it really a question of user cases? Perhaps for BTC to some extent yes, with a few revolutionary minds thinking it will provide them a way of definitively escaping fiat, and the games central banks play. For the great majority however, it was and continues to be about hoping history repeats itself, in short, about an easy way to riches, about greed. 

Thinking of this little history, this reality I outlined here. It would make perfect sense for the FED to print a few billion dollars at no cost, and then use it to drive up the market by proxy, merely creating one more elaborate scheme to fleece the people. The few who got in early and took profits and got rich, well, I guess it is not that troublesome a thought to TPTB.

Anyway, I wonder where the money is going to come from this time around? Institutional investors? And with the world‚Äôs dwindling middle-class (please see Chris Hamilton‚Äôs blog - [https://econimica.blogspot.com/2019/07/how-this-plays-out-deceleration\_39.html](https://econimica.blogspot.com/2019/07/how-this-plays-out-deceleration_39.html)) subjected to ever more forms of financial repression, are there really that much people left willing to prop up this highly uncertain and volatile market with their hard earned cash? Then there are the one‚Äôs I hear of that bought in the green, near the top of some movement, only to get burned badly, shortly after. Do you think people like these - often still possesing enough capital to frivolously spend, will instead buy in when there‚Äôs fear in the market, when they should? No, I don‚Äôt think so. They got burned and are staying away for good. 

Ofc, it might turn out to be the classic Wall Street chart. Hopefully we‚Äôll see the disbelief phase soon, as a new bull market emerges. But I have my doubts. The manipulators of this market can keep this thing going for a long time, each time just draining away funds, giving hope and a bit of relief from time to time.

One of the things that still keeps me in, is the knowledge that as easy as it is for ‚Äúthem‚Äù to drain this market, they can pump it up in the same manner. Again, is it that implausible for certain parties buying and selling crypto with fiat provided by the FED? The money for these investors is free basically, just like it was for Blackrock or Blackstone buying tens of thousands of homes with FED money [https://wallstreetexaminer.com/2015/11/stench-freddie-mac-back-18-billion-crony-capitalist-thievery/](https://wallstreetexaminer.com/2015/11/stench-freddie-mac-back-18-billion-crony-capitalist-thievery/) Am I wrong in thinking that if they want to, they can just keep on pounding this market into oblivion? They don‚Äôt need it to succeed or even have a return, they need to see it fail, and for the time being, have it draw in as much capital and savings as possible, until a nice reset, with a date of their choosing. Until then everyone keeps on buying the ‚Äúdips‚Äù, and the suckers do it in reverse ofc.

They say the market is there to inflict as much pain as possible. Likewise I can also see a scenario play out, where they do pump it up again, but slowly at first, so those of a cautious nature, decide to just play it safe, and be content with a little profit, only for TPTB to then pump it up to new ATH‚Äôs. The story repeats itself, people buy in higher, their stash now smaller, and then the market turns again. But yeah, this sort of contradicts my story perhaps. But then what, after that? Rinse and repear, one boom and bust, parabolic rally after the other? 

Perhaps, if the FED just keeps on printing and the stock market continues hitting ATH‚Äôs, then maybe some of this money will splash into the cryptomarket, but then there‚Äôs the political aspect to this money printing, hence we get articles like [https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-07-05/blain-central-banks-will-keep-easing-until-parliaments-and-palaces-burn](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-07-05/blain-central-banks-will-keep-easing-until-parliaments-and-palaces-burn)

As far as XRP is concerned, because it is sometimes mentioned in regards to a coming liquidity crisis, and how XRP would be used to solve that. I just cannot see how any of the major banks will pay the small timers out there, holding Xk of XRP, a few or even tens of dollars or whatever per XRP. It would be such a break of this age old dynamic. This time the powerful somehow bowing to the weak. For once being in a position of subservience, of dependency. With J.P. Morgan or Goldman Sachs paying the little guy to please part with his XRP so they can use it. I just cannot see this scenario play out. 

This crypto history somehow also reminds me of the classic private business MO: governments and the taxpayer providing the funds for projects (universities, laboratories) which then down the road, get bought up by private business. So the cost of development is on our dime, and the rewards, the profits are syphoned off to a nice tax haven. 

Crypto feels a bit like that to me. Suckers funding it all, only for the big players to come afterwards (with a mature product) and buy it out or use the developed tech and stamp their name on it. If it succeeds and end up into something useful, great, if it turns out to be a dead-end, but somehow good lessons were learned, to improve on a next iteration, all is good. Isn‚Äôt this how things work often.

As Michael Parenti once wrote: 

&gt;*""They are not going to leave any little bit for you. There‚Äôs only one thing that the ruling circles throughout history have ever wanted-all the wealth, the treasures, and the profitable returns; all the choice lands and forests and game and herds and harvests and mineral deposits and precious metals of the earth; all the productive facilities and gainful inventiveness and technologies; all the control positions of the state and other major institutions; all public supports and subsidies, privileges and immunities; all the protections of the law and none of its constraints; all of the services and comforts and luxuries and advantages of civil society with none of the taxes and none of the costs. Every ruling class in history has wanted only this-all the rewards and none of the burdens.""*

I know, reality is often far more complex and ambiguous, nor is it captured in lineair, deterministic thinking, of which I‚Äôm guilty here perhaps. 

Some of you may be familiar with the writing of a certain J.C. Collins and his blog philosophyofmetrics. First it was the introduction/widespread adoption of the SDR that would fundamentally change the economy, then Collins started writing about crypto‚Äôs, and XRP in particular, replacing the SDR. With central banks having enabled the industrial revolution; this time around the crypto market would replace central banking to provide the world with the liquidity it needs to spur the new economics, and the enormous technological progress that is upon us. Something along those lines. About a year ago, he wrote how central banks would soon start to add crypto‚Äôs to their balance sheets, and how the crypto market would swallow the PMs market, etc. [https://philosophyofmetrics.com/crypto-market-will-swallow-gold-market-in-2019/](https://philosophyofmetrics.com/crypto-market-will-swallow-gold-market-in-2019/). Yet here we are now. 

Who knows, instead of a fortress world, or barbarization scenario, utopia (The Great Transition -  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_Transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Transition) \-  [https://greattransition.org/documents/Great\_Transition.pdf](https://greattransition.org/documents/Great_Transition.pdf) ) might really be around the corner, and we‚Äôll see the advent of the third industrial revolution, the internet of things, the sharing economy, where trust is currency, the demonization of all essentials as Peter Diamandis writes, and ‚Äúradical abundance.‚Äù All in all, a more humane system where, for example Collins writes at one point: *The onset of robotics and AI technologies will further release man from the long hours of labor.  This will fundamentally alter the existing relationship between capital and labor.  Capitalism and Communism, the diametric manifestations of capital and labor, will consolidate around a new form of socialism which is meant to accommodate the expansion of man‚Äôs creative and spiritual ‚Äúsovereignty‚Äù*. - [https://philosophyofmetrics.com/new-age-socialism-and-the-end-of-debt-based-money-creation-freepom/](https://philosophyofmetrics.com/new-age-socialism-and-the-end-of-debt-based-money-creation-freepom/)

I have my doubts though, more inclined to believe that it will be just more of the same and maybe a lot worse before it gets better. But what do I know.",1578668872,0,1

The answer to this question is always NO.

This is why:

The IRS already had official guidance on cryptocurrency, first posted back in 2014: the agency classifies cryptocurrency as property, rather than as currency, and thus taxpayers would treat crypto selling as capital gains (or losses) and disclose it on Form 8949.

""Currency transactions"" are not reported that way.

You must answer the question NO, because you did not deal in ""virtual currency"", your dealings, per the IRS were in ""virtual property"".

The question does not ask about virtual property.

They can't have it both ways. It is either property or currency. The IRS says its property, not currency.

Full Review
You may be leery about investing on a cryptocurrency trading platform that only came on the scene once bitcoin and many altcoins are on the map. BigONE is one of those exchange startups, but it bills itself as the ‚Äúmost secure and convenient cryptocurrency exchange in the world.‚Äù That remains to be seen, however, as it‚Äôs still early days, considering the trading platform only launched in November 2017. The CEO is Eric Meltzer.

But global exchange BigONE is off to a good start and became a trader favorite with its wide access to coins, including newly issued tokens, and trading pairs not to mention sophisticated trading tools including interactive charting. As long as users have gone through the highest level of two-factor authentication, they shouldn‚Äôt have any trouble making withdrawals from the exchange. Otherwise there could be delays.

They also did a zero-fee promotion that ran until year-end 2017 to attract new users, which helps it to compete with the likes of Robinhood, whose trading platform doesn‚Äôt charge exchange fees. While the honeymoon may be over, many investors are hopeful that it‚Äôs just the beginning for BigONE and cryptocurrency traders.

BigONE is backed by blockchain investment firm INBlockchain, which in addition to BigONE is also an investor in EOS, steemit, Zcash, MobileCoin, EOS, Candy Box, Global Social Chain (GSC), among others. In fact, several INBlockchain‚Äôs portfolio companies are also cryptocurrencies that are supported on the BigONE platform, for instance Monaco and EOS, to name a couple.

BIgONE‚Äôs CEO Meltzer is also an advisor at INBlockchain, as is Xiaolai Li, an entrepreneur who is said to be the ‚Äúrichest bitcoin owner.‚Äù This bolsters their security profile, considering the financial stability of the exchange‚Äôs backers, despite the fact that BigONE is a startup.

Meanwhile, on Github, users say the prior version of BigONE was yunbi.com, which is based in Beijing. BigONE‚Äôs domicile isn‚Äôt readily apparent, but Github suggests they are British. Most of BigONE‚Äôs website visitors, however, are based in China, as per Alexa data.

BigONE is a user-friendly and trendy exchange that isn‚Äôt afraid to offer some of the newer coins, including bitcoin forked coins across Super Bitcoin, Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond. In fact, there‚Äôs no shortage of coins on the platform, ranging from top cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH and Zcash to ICO coins including EOS (EOS), Monaco (MCO), aelf (ELF) and ChainLink (LINK).

Competing exchange Bittrex, meanwhile, is known to remove coins with insufficient liquidity, so it will be interesting to see how the more the merrier approach pans out for BigONE.

BigONE is unique for several reasons, not the least of which it has its own cryptocurrency, BigONE, which trades on Coin Market Cap under the symbol BIG. They have allotted a maximum supply of 200 million BIG tokens.

The exchange‚Äôs high-tech graphics and trading tools including interactive charts are top notch compared to most other bitcoin exchanges. On social media, users tout the exchange as a ‚Äúnifty‚Äù and ‚Äúreliable‚Äù platform.

BigONE Pros
¬∑       Thorough security comprised of hot and cold wallets, multiple signatures, two-step verification, real-time monitoring and more.

¬∑       Supports multiple coins 33 cryptocurrencies, as of launch.

¬∑       Numerous trading pairs including the following BTC, BCH, EOS, ETH, ZEC against USDT

¬∑       Instant trading, real-time quotes

¬∑       Customer deposits are kept in reserves and not used by the exchange

¬∑       BIG token is backed by fees

¬∑       Zero deposit fees

¬∑       Sophisticated trading tools and charting capabilities

¬∑       Fast transaction times

¬∑       Web-based trading platform (no need for installation)

¬∑       Offers an API

¬∑       Mobile friendly

¬∑       Chat room for traders

¬∑       Security is a top priority, as evidenced by the company‚Äôs tagline, ‚ÄúThe most secure and convenient cryptocurrency exchange in the world.‚Äù

¬∑       Exchange may be pursuing a US launch

¬∑       They‚Äôre accessible on multiple messaging platforms including Telegram and Bee in addition to social media sites Facebook and Twitter.

BigONE Cons
¬∑       Users have described a problematic account verification process that leaves them unable to make withdrawals. Customer service appears to keep users waiting with no response for days.

¬∑       Users complain of high withdrawal fees

¬∑       Users have also complained early on that not all the wallets were working properly to accept deposits, only the main coins.

¬∑       Only accepts cryptocurrencies and not fiat money for deposits; as a result, can‚Äôt do bank or credit card transfers.

¬∑       Only supports spot trading, which is a common limitation to crypto exchanges

¬∑       Only available to non-US citizens

¬∑       The KYC process could take anywhere from hours to days

¬∑       Users don‚Äôt get the response they would like form support. Often the issues surround a stalled identity verification process that is due to an old photo or something of that nature.

Fees
BigONE only accepts deposits in cryptocurrencies. As a result, you can‚Äôt transfer from a checking account or credit or debit card, which makes it less competitive with an exchange such as Coinbase, for instance, which does allow checking account and debit-card transactions.

While BigONE chargers 0% deposit fees and a flat 0.1% trading fee, their withdrawal fees are on the high side, as outlined below ‚Äì

Updates on the exchange‚Äôs fee table can be accessed here.

BigONE Security
BigONE claims to be the safest cryptocurrency exchange around, though there‚Äôs not much historical data to back this claim up yet. But they do explain why security is so important to them as well as some of the steps they take to keep user accounts secure.

While the BigONE management team hasn‚Äôt taken much of the spotlight, they did explain that their motivation for launching BigONE was in response to the security breaches that were plaguing the bitcoin trading platforms around them.

They felt ‚Äúthe community deserved better,‚Äù which explains their focus on security. BigONE boasts what they describe as a ‚Äútrustworthy infrastructure‚Äù and a ‚Äúhigh-class trading experience‚Äù fueled by speed, accessibility and secure management of cryptocurrencies.  In its short trading history, there‚Äôs no evidence that BigONE has suffered any security breaches.

Website
According to Alexa.com, the majority of visitors to the BigONE site are from China, followed by Japan, the United States, Hong Kong and Vietnam. Interestingly, users visit BigONE after being on Coinbase as well as Candy.one and Binance.

BigONE is a sophisticated site and may seem intimidating to the novice trader. But there‚Äôs a lot of help out there, including from other traders on a dashboard chat room. One user was asking how to buy ether, and another user explained they should first transfer their BTC to BigONE and then they could use it to purchase ether.

The features on the exchange platform are pretty self-explanatory and easy to navigate, such as the buy and sell buttons illustrating the DGD trade placed prominently on the dashboard ‚Äì

Trading Pairs
BigONE supports numerous trading pairs and appears to add new options quite frequently. In a nutshell they offer dozens of trading pairs with the following currencies ‚Äì

¬∑       BTC

¬∑       ETH

¬∑       EOS

¬∑       QTUM

¬∑       USDT

¬∑       BITCNY

They also support numerous individual coins, as listed by Coin Market Cap here.

While BigONE is a bitcoin-fork friendly trading platform, ‚Äúeach forked coin goes through a strict licensing review process.‚Äù If all goes well with the hard fork in question, users will credited the forked coins afterward. So, there‚Äôs a bit of risk there to the user.

BigONE‚Äôs co-founder and CEO Eric Meltzer appears to keep a low profile. But when the exchange added the Monaco coin, he commented:

‚ÄúAdding the MCO Token to BigONE is a tremendous value add to our users. With our focus on security and innovative rewards and deals, we are keen support Monaco‚Äôs efforts of making cryptocurrency available to the masses.‚Äù

Traders appear to be enthused about the ability to trade Candy coin. There are several videos on You Tube explaining how to perform transactions with Candy on BigONE, such as the below tutorial ‚Äì

Signing Up
The sign-up process is straight forward to start. Begin by entering an email address followed by a password. Once you‚Äôve made it through the account verification process, you sign in with your email and password and will be promoted to enter a code that maybe generated by a Google authenticator app, for instance.

Considering that the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process could take an undetermined amount of time, ranging from hours to days, BigONE cautions its users not to make any deposits before the account is verified if they intend to trade.

Users who have activated two-factor authentication can deposit and trade on BigONE. Meanwhile, traders who have completed the identity verification process can perform withdrawals, which the company characterizes as a ‚Äúfast‚Äù process.

Traders who have having issues with withdrawals most likely haven‚Äôt gone through the identification verification process properly. They must go through a series of steps to prove their identity, including a photo ID as well as selfie holding a picture of the photo ID with the date and name of the exchange written across it.

User Reviews
On Facebook, user reviews are mixed, with users handing the exchange a rating of between one and five stars. One investor who gave the exchange a single star ran into problems trying to withdraw funds because of an old photo on her passport. She said the exchange asked too many questions, but that‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing, especially if they‚Äôre trying to remain secure.

Other users similarly had issues with their image not matching the picture on their ID, so there‚Äôs a pattern. And it wasn‚Äôt just on Facebook. A Telegram poster complained about not getting approved for the verification process because his image didn‚Äôt match his form of ID. The very same ID, however, worked on ‚Äúmany other exchanges‚Äù where he was approved.

One follower provided the following advice to traders: ‚ÄúIt is difficult to pass the application for authentication. You need to open Google‚Äôs 2-step verification Make sure to consider it before joining.‚Äù

In addition to investors, ICO issuers also expressed their inability to determine how to get their coins listed on the site, with one follower on Facebook saying ‚Äì

‚ÄúWhere at your site Listing Application Form? and some info about How to get listed a coin?!!!!!!‚Äù

On the plus side, traders applaud the platform for supporting their favorite coins early, such as on this Reddit thread when IOS (IOST) was launched on BigONE.

BigONE Mobile &amp; API
BigONE has a mobile app that‚Äôs available for both Android and iOS devices. User reviews weren‚Äôt readily available yet.

In addition to the mobile app, BigONE also offers an API via GitHub for developers, which is available here.  The API supports BigONE‚Äôs trading capabilities in other apps. It‚Äôs been assigned on GitHub as of Q1 2018 but there are no projects or milestones listed yet. While there‚Äôs not too much information available on the BigONE API, it may be possible to glean from its predecessor, Yunbi.

Yunbi was two pronged, comprised of a public API and a private API. The public API didn‚Äôt require verification, while the private version did in the form of a signature. It was available to individuals and merchants.

BigONE Token
BigONE is behind the ERC-20 BigONE token, and it‚Äôs got a cap of 200 million in circulation. BigONE is committed to repurchasing BIG tokens in the secondary market using a percentage of trading commission fees.

BigONE Verdict
BigONE is a newcomer, which means there isn‚Äôt much in the way of user numbers or trading volume yet, so it‚Äôs tough to make a call. But the fact that they use security in their tag line suggests this is the No. 1 priority for the exchange. Another thing they have going for them is the backing of INBlockchain and its management team.

Traders can get their choice of tokens on the platform and trading pairs are added frequently, which is lacking at many other exchanges. If you prefer to use an exchange that accepts fiat money deposits, there are plenty of other options, and if BigONE‚Äôs 0.1% trading fees have you down, head over to Robinhood for zero trading fees by the exchange.

While BigONE is a global exchange, it doesn‚Äôt support US residents, though they may be efforting an expansion into the US market.

Numbers on x axis are months and numbers on y axis is USD. The purple line is the line of best fit using x\^3.  As you can see below I have my equation in there.  I understand my graph isn't super accurate, but it gets more accurate after the mid thirties. It predicts the trend of bitcoin very well throughout. Just the actual predicted money value is messed up in the beginning . This graph suggests that there is about to be a upswing! This is my first time doing one of these. I understand this isn't super complex stuff or anything. Do I have any massive errors besides predicted money value before mid thirties? Red is my prediction line and green is connecting all data points. The very last point is Bitcoins price when I ended up doing the graph. The yellow dotted line is the rounded up month of the peak illustrating that my graph peaks at the same times as Bitcoin. Thanks!

I have recently been reading about earning a passive income with Bitcoin. Among the different options I read, it seems that a low risk option is digital asset lending. So, I read and found that a few platforms such as [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) allow us to invest BTC and receive interest on a weekly basis. The APR values are not high (up to 8%).

My questions are:

Has anyone here tried the digital asset lending with BTC to earn interest and passive source of income?

Which platforms are reliable? Since lending BTC to these platforms would mean that they own the private keys. I would not be comfortable to lend for long periods of times such as 1 year.

Few platforms about which I read:

I've been working on a sidechain protocol with no trusted third party. You can find the [whitepaper here](http://coins.github.io/coins.pdf).  


*Abstract. Coins is a Bitcoin extension designed for payments at scale.¬† We propose an efficient solution to the double-spending problem using a bitcoin-backed proof-of-stake.¬† Validators vote on sidechain blocks with one-time signatures, forming a record that cannot be changed without destroying their collateral. Every user can become a validator by locking bitcoins.¬†One-time signatures guarantee that validators loose their¬†stake¬†for¬†publishing¬†conflicting¬† histories. Checkpoints¬† can¬†be¬†additionally secured with a bitcoin-backed proof-of-burn.¬†Assuming a rational majority of validators, the sidechain provides safety and liveness. The sidechain‚Äôs footprint within bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain is minimal.¬† Spawning multiple, independent instances scales horizontally.*  


Feedback is highly appreciated!  


Thank you",1578784593,15,1
enesw7,brianddk,A theoretical look at the last 1000 days of DCA (dollar cost averaging),"I ran a simulation of performing DCA based on a ***start date*** going back 50, 100, 150... 1000 days.  Here are the results.  The simulation assumes a 0.50% taker fees on each buy and investing $1 a day.  You can simply multiply all by 20 to do $20 a day.  The ***min*** column assumes you bought at the worst time each day (24h high), and the ***max*** column assumes you bought at the best time each day (24h low).  The ***APR*** is what standard APR would be required to yield the same returns over the same period.  The brackets show that your final value is below the amount invested.

For example, if you would have started your DCA at the ATH (756 days ago) your would still have realized an 8-10% gain.  If you would have started at the 52w high (200 days ago), you would obviously still be underwater, but not by as much as most would expect.

It's an interesting example of how DCA can ""iron out"" some of the volatility.

""A fortress soon becomes a trap.""  

If you ever get the chance and take the time to read ""The 33 Strategies of War,"" by Greene you will soon appreciate the value of mobility vs being trapped in a bunker with no way out.  

With Bitcoin, you can ""take it with you,"" your mobility is not thwarted -- especially if you have your pass phrase memorized.  With millions of dollars of physical gold... you're looking at trying to securely transport hundreds of pounds of metal.  You won't be able to sneak it through airports.  If you're carrying gold and you get stopped by bandits, pirates, soldiers, or border guards along the way, you can kiss your gold (and perhaps your life) good bye.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin is not detectable -- especially if you have your pass phrase memorized.  

If you're preparing for when SHTF and you decide that physical gold is for you, instead of Bitcoin, please remember to check each and every bar in case of counterfeit, gold-coated tungsten.  Remember, you need special equipment and know-how to detect it correctly.  Oh, and have ""fun"" hiding in your little bunker.  Good luck if/when you decide to emerge...",1578756927,24,1

The  Little Bitcoin Book tells the story of what‚Äôs wrong with money today,  and why Bitcoin was invented to provide an alternative to the current  system. It describes in simple terms what Bitcoin is, how it works, why  it‚Äôs valuable, and how it affects individual freedom and opportunities  of people everywhere - from Nigeria to the Philippines to Venezuela to  the United States. This book also includes a Q &amp; A section with some  of the most frequently asked questions about Bitcoin.

There are important points to discuss, as it could have huge implications for society in general:

1. The first is the trend towards a cashless society. The infrastructure required for using cash costs countries a fair amount every year. Also, younger consumers prefer the convenience of mobile payments.
2. What does this mean for privacy (particularly financial privacy)?
3. What does this mean for the most vulnerable in society who are heavily reliant on cash, such as the homeless?
4. As well as this, any trusted third party is a security hole - thus these centralised institutions are [honeypots for skilled hackers](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/capital-one-hacked-over-100-million-customers-affected/)
5. There is of course Facebook's Libra and the recent news of [China's plan to introduce the Digital Yuan](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/12/china-central-bank-close-to-releasing-digital-currency-pboc-official.html)

Outgoing Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has stated that [digital currencies can be used to reduce the reliance on the US Dollar](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/23/mark-carney-dollar-dominant-replaced-digital-currency)

So...

Demand is there, and Pandora's Box is now opened

IT SEEMS INEVITABLE THAT THIS IS THE DIRECTION IN WHICH WE ARE HEADING.

Here is my current take on the situation.

**\[DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE\]**

Things can change and you should conduct your own due diligence.

I think Central Bank Digital Currencies *will* happen and start the trend towards a cashless society.

This will also make it easier to collect taxes for Governments.

Unfortunately, I believe this probably will be a centralised network.

This means that funds can be frozen (which is bad for certain privacy conscious consumers), although it will mean that transactions will have reduced fees and that the 'middleman' aspect of the financial services industry will be hit (which is good for all consumers).

Therefore, Bitcoin will be (and already is my opinion) the decentralised hedge against bad monetary policy and centralised power structures.

Allowing for peer to peer transactions in a decentralised manner.

In terms of long term investment, I think that Bitcoin will hit $100K within 2-3 years, and $1MM within the next 15 years.

This will be a critical issue over the next decade that could have some very serious consequences for those who are not prepared for this transition.

As an investor, it is important to understand where the long term trend is heading.

Generally, this revolves around technological innovation that makes our lives more convenient and makes it more efficient to transfer value and thus drive progress and prosperity.

These developments are an indicator of that, but it is important to remember that those in positions of power and that control the flow of money are ruthless in their pursuit to maintain that power and maybe, just maybe, the guys at the NSA created a decentralised hedge against their incompetence...

It seems the question may open a person up to additional scrutiny, and there is a lot of political reasons for Cryptocurrency advocates to be under this additional scrutiny as many are affiliated with economic libertarian views (many similarities to the Tea Party targeting).

The answer to the question doesn't seem to affect the actual dollar amounts in any way. And a tax return is not a census or survey.

Is there some advocate organization that could help?

I started out thinking this would be a quick, one or two short paragraph Facebook post but then I ended up writing nearly 2000 words. There‚Äôs no easy way to give a quick explanation of Bitcoin, and money is an important subject to weigh in on so my communication needs to be clear. I‚Äôm giving my opinion about an entirely different monetary system than we‚Äôve had our entire lives. I wanted to spread some information that I‚Äôve found through a couple years of research and trading. Above all I just want to live in a better world and I think there‚Äôs always room for improvement in all of our systems. I‚Äôm willing to experiment to find out how to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

\--

&amp;#x200B;

By now I imagine most of you know what Bitcoin is or have at least heard of it, but still most of you haven‚Äôt thought to buy any and use it. I think it could make our world a much better place if we all adopted it as a means of paying each other. I‚Äôve bought a few things online with Bitcoin. It can be spent in person too. I prefer to spend it instead of debit/credit if the vendor I‚Äôm purchasing from accepts it, but many still don‚Äôt. I feel safer using it, it is more secure than Fiat currencies. I think if you‚Äôre a vendor, you should consider accepting it, because it gives you access to more customers (the Bitcoin spenders).  

I can understand peoples hesitation to buy it and use it, or get involved in other parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The price paired to Fiat currency1 is extremely volatile. It has a reputation for being used to purchase illegal goods and services, and it‚Äôs an obscure thing. Money in general is obscure because it has no intrinsic value (you can‚Äôt eat it, drink it, smoke it, wear it etc). Worth noting, exceedingly more Fiat currency is spent on illegal goods and services than Bitcoin is.2 I‚Äôve heard many other criticisms‚Äô as well.  The fact you could buy some today, and it could be worth two thirds as much in a just a week; the cause being that many average people (or a few very rich people) decided to sell it.3 However, since Bitcoin‚Äôs inception, it has proven over and over again that if you hold on to it, it will increase in value over a long period of time. By doing this, it incentivizes  saving. People don‚Äôt want to spend as much because it‚Äôs consistently increasing in value, so they save it instead. It increases in value when new Fiat currency flows into it from the public, and less Bitcoin flows out, which has been normal through its history. When more people are seeing that it‚Äôs value is going up, it incentivizes them to buy in. In theory, the ‚Äòsaving incentive‚Äô means that people would buy less goods and services and conserve earth‚Äôs natural resources better. It is still in a very early stage in terms of becoming a meaningful currency that average people use, so these observations are speculative. It may sound like a Ponzi Scheme to some, but then what is Fiat currency if you look from a broad perspective?

The main reasons it outperforms Fiat currencies is because it‚Äôs decentralized, and censorship resistant. No one entity controls it. It is not the property of the bank of any country. Each users holds their own unique keys to their money. It can‚Äôt be manipulated by any government, bank, or corporation. The creator of the software is anonymous.4 It can do cross border payments in a manner of seconds, and for a tiny fraction the cost of fiat, and make what were once inaccessible payments, accessible. There is no borders with Bitcoin. 

Governments tend to print money on a fairly regular basis which can artificially inflate prices of goods and services. Some very corrupt governments have printed so much money that it hyper-inflates their currency and becomes nearly worthless.5 Bitcoin has a fixed supply which will be about 21 million coins once it has all been mined6, so it‚Äôs not possible for it to be inflated. It‚Äôs built into the software to continue slowing production of new coins until it ultimately stops producing them. 

There is still a risk of the price of Bitcoin going to zero, everyone could decide to sell it and it would become worthless. However that risk theoretically exists with many currencies and part of my interest is what‚Äôs happening in the future for our children and grandchildren. Every Canadian could trade all their dollars for, say, US dollars, making Canadian dollars worthless. However unlikely, it‚Äôs a theoretical scenario.

Everything starts somewhere. Bitcoin is brand new, it has only been in use for 11 years, but it‚Äôs possible it could be in use for the next 100 years and beyond. It depends on humanity‚Äôs decisions. 

The picture shown is a chart of the price of Bitcoin over it‚Äôs entire history, relative to US Dollars. It has followed this parabolic curve it‚Äôs entire existence, and never fallen below it. One Bitcoin was worth a fraction of a penny when the software was first developed, to now over US $8000. It is, undoubtedly the best financial investment of all time for early adopters.7 If it continues to follow the parabolic curve, it will be worth US $1,000,000 around the year 2030. However, that‚Äôs a big if - no one knows precisely why it follows the parabolic curve, and if it will continue along it. There are only theories. One of them, the Stock to Flow model,8 is very plausible. It doesn‚Äôt explain the parabola per se, but gives evidence of what drives the price.  

What I would recommend if you‚Äôre interested, is to first do as much research as possible, then if you still feel it‚Äôs a good idea, try buying a small amount and see how it goes. You would be helping grow the ecosystem. You can buy as a little amount as you want. It is infinitely divisible. Remember, this is not financial advice. You must be willing to lose what you put in. There are also security measures that you should be aware of before purchasing. I can help you with this if you ask me. Also, as I side note I‚Äôm trying to encourage that people never sell for Fiat, and instead hold or spend it. This is what is best for the ecosystem. However I understand the desire to exchange back to Fiat to make profits that you can spend at the grocery store, or wherever. I do this myself. 

Technically, a trader is anyone who buys or sells. For those wondering what professional traders actually do, they provide liquidity9 for the market, so others can buy and sell easily. There is no get rich quick scheme. It takes just as much work, or more than the average job to make a living at it. In time you can get more efficient, and some people are able to master it and get rich from it, not unlike many other types of business. I am far from a master, but would be happy to teach what I know.  

This only scratches the surface, there are still many questions to be answered such as: how does our society work with this, how are governments responding, how can you loan and borrow Bitcoin, how are taxes paid, where can you spend it right now, what‚Äôs the best time to buy, where do you buy and sell it, how do you store it, how does mining work, what about all the other crypto-currencies, what is the blockchain, what is cryptography, what do you do about slow transaction speeds, and many more. I‚Äôll do my best to answer if you ask me, but some of the answers are just my opinion based on the different sources I‚Äôve read throughout the past few years. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm right or wrong about the future of Bitcoin but my estimate is that it will be around for a long time to come. I‚Äôm doing the best I can to piece the puzzle together. Some of the facts I stated could have different interpretations. I did my best to fact check before posting because I think telling the most precise truth is most important, especially for something that could change everything we know about money. I might have got some facts wrong. If you see something please let me know. 

Thanks for reading. I will be responding to comments tomorrow Jan 14th. Get in touch, ask me questions. Ask your friends questions and please share this freely. Cheers.

  
Footnotes:

1 Fiat Currencies are what most people use around the world right now, including USD,  CAD, EUR, JPY etc. 

2 Cryptocurrency research firm Chainalysis noted that dark web transactions now account for just one percent of bitcoin transactions, down from 30 percent in 2012.

3 When the software was first introduced to the public, there wasn‚Äôt nearly as many people involved, so a small minority of people who hold bitcoin, hold large stacks of coins from the very early stages of development. These coins are being distributed to the public as time goes on, so intra-day trading can be very volatile in part due to these people selling and buying large amounts whenever they want, and often at strategic times, and likely working together at times. They‚Äôre often referred to as Whales, along with whoever else has large stacks of coins.

4 There are several people who claim to be the creator of Bitcoin software, but there has never been verified proof. When the software was released, a paper explaining the purpose of it was released with it, called the  ‚Äúwhite paper,‚Äù and was authored by an anonymous person who went by Satoshi Nakamodo. Weather the name‚Äôs real or fake we don‚Äôt know, and we may never, and it may be more than one person. The paper can be seen at [www.bitcoin.org](https://www.bitcoin.org)

5 Examples include Venezuela, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Zimbabwe.

6 Miners run the Bitcoin software, it is free and open-source. Miners solve complex math equations to verify transactions, and get rewarded for it. The costs of  mining are hardware and electricity. Anyone can mine Bitcoin. Miners get rewarded with freshly minted coins and transaction fees. After all 21 million coins built into the software are minted, there will be no more. Miners are still necessary to settle transactions, and will earn their Bitcoin solely from transaction fees. This wont happen until the year 2140.

7 If you invested US one hundred dollars in mid 2010, and sold in late 2017, you would have made between US 30 to 40 million dollars, depending on the exact timing.

I just finished reading the Bitcoin Standard, and I have a few questions after reading it that I hope you can help me with.  They're in no particular order, just little curiosities and hopefully updates since this book was written.  The book answered a lot of my initial questions.  I highly recommend it to those just getting into this sphere. Thanks to anyone who answers!

\-Do we think people need to understand Bitcoin/sound money in order to utilize Bitcoin and grow the network?

\-Does less volatility and more stability change the incentives for nodes/mines over the course of time? 

\-Is it too much to ask future people/generations to continue to run the network?  The current centralized system employs so many people and creates so much wealth that it is self-sustaining (even if its not for the best).  Can the network expect to continue to run for years and years on the help of volunteer coders, nodes, and miners? Is that the plan, even with growing processing power needed?

\-With the news of China launching their own digital currency and Facebook possibly creating Libra, does that help or hurt bitcoin? Will these work (and altcoins, I suppose) similarly to Bitcoin with a finite amount of coins to create sounder money?

\-What 2nd ledger solutions or other scale-able solutions have been created/improved upon since the writing of the book in 2017?

\-What are the top overall updates since 2017 that I need to know to catch me up to Bitcoin and the network in 2020?

Thanks again!",1578944180,9,1

I know many consider it a strength, but the fact that when Bitcoins are sent the transaction is irreversible is in my mind also something I believe people will have issues with. Because for whatever reasons people WILL write in the wrong addresses. My questions are: 

Is getting it wrong as simple as e.g. a finger-slip and removing 1 character out of the recipient address for the coins to be lost forever or sent to the wrong person? What are the barriers to such mistakes? 

Could there in theory ever be a way for coding something that serves as the function of ""middle-man"" that can take back a payment if the buyer/seller do not meet the mutual agreements (like the Ebay system e.g.)

Basically I have around $350k to invest in something, so I'm looking at different options other than just real estate. I have a vacant house, it's a pretty big house and has lot's of space for mining equipment. It has excellent ventilation and air conditioners are brand new as well.

I live in Canada and my rates are as follows:

0.1 kWh -&gt; off-peak (so this rate is 24 hours on weekends and holidays and on weekdays it is from 7 PM to 7 AM)

0.144 kWH -&gt; mid-peak (this rate is 11 AM to 5 PM during the weekdays)

0.208 kWh -&gt; on-peak (this rate is 7-11 AM and 5-7 PM during the weekdays)

I‚Äôm not looking for an account that requires 3-5 day transfers. I like being able to purchase the crypto the day off like the aforementioned exchanges. 

Thank you in advance.",1579322014,11,1

eqbcv7,truth_revealedd,Does anybody in here actually trust Coinbase?,"I‚Äôm increasingly beginning to believe they are a fraudulent company. Based on the fact that it‚Äôs impossible to reach them by any means, particularly ALL OF THEIR EMAIL RESPONSES being automated (good luck trying to get a human to respond due to their claim of always having such a high frequency), their customer service is bar none THE ABSOLUTE WORST. How can any legitimate company have such terrible non-existent customer service? Coinbase is supposedly the biggest American exchange and one of the biggest adjusted volume exchanges in the world, yet they are incapable of responding to some basic complaints.

I‚Äôm hoping that by writing this, that it will get some attention and Coinbase will actually give me a non-automated response. Recently, Coinbase‚Äôs fees has OVERcharged me by $937. I was already in the &gt;$50K volume tier (of 0.20% maker fee) but because Coinbase‚Äôs fee system failed to properly update my 30-day trailing volume, it assessed me the fees of the $10k-$50K tier of 0.35% (for maker fees).  I had two separate orders totaling $415,762.86 but was charged 0.35% in fees for both or $1,455.17. THAT IS NOT COOL. Yes, the orders were relatively consecutive (within 5 mins) but that doesn‚Äôt matter breaking Coinbase‚Äôs fee tiers are immediate regardless of whether they‚Äôre within seconds.

In conclusion, Coinbase overcharged me by $937.65. My fees should have been $517.52 but I was assessed $1,455.17. Nobody holds Coinbase accountable and they can charge you whatever arbitrary fees their dysfunctional system assigns you. It feels like theft. Despite attempting to contact Coinbase by phone and email (which is impossible), I have gotten nowhere. Coinbase is not corrective and will not later refund you fee miscalculations. The first red flag in every pyramid scheme or scam...is awful customer service. For Coinbase, that is a huge checkmark.",1579319011,0,1

eq9ntk,Thinking_Overtime,Love how you can find Bitcoin conversation anywhere.,"I follow a psychedelic YouTube channel called True Life Storys. It's more of a get together between friends and there is always groups of people chatting and talking real life experiences and whats going on. It's kind of like an eye opening channel and I love the topics they talk about which is mostly psychedelics but always diverts into other topics. Today he had a 5 hour show what True calls a marathon. 

At first it started off a little slow so I fast forwarded it a bit and I literally landed on the exact part where they were talking about Bitcoin. I am a huge Bitcoin enthusiast and had no idea anyone on the show was also into Bitcoin and surprisingly enough there was a few guys who are really into Bitcoins and seems like they know what they are talking about. 

If anyone wants to follow the show I can tell you guys a good channel and besides that if you want to hear what they were talking about Bitcoin check it out. I feel any and all talk about Bitcoin is great because the more people aware about Bitcoin the more our community grows. 

Take a look at the video and I hope you like the channel. If you want to fast forward to the Bitcoin part it starts roughly at 2 hours and 24 minutes and goes for about ten minutes.

So, I've been seeing a lot of posts on 'arbitrage trading in crypto', I was hoping to gauge interest in this field and hopefully get some insights, especially with Blockstream's Liquid Network and if it might help improve arbitrage trading and also with the price discovery.

Adam Back mentioned that he did a practice arbitrage trade of $10k b/w BTSE and Bitfinex and he incurred fees of 0.33%.
(https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1202991846038933504)


**Questions**

1. Can anybody who use liquid confirm this and its ease of access with details of the payment flow and the fees?
2. Obviously, Liquid and arbitrage trading are whales, so are the profits worth this process?
3. Can Liquid Swap Tool help in triangular arbitrage trading on Liquid Network?

The last time I purchased was on the 10th of January... today I made another purchase and the Fee more than doubled! Haven't seen any posts about this yet... any word on why or did I miss something?? 

For example if you buy $10 of BTC right now the fee is $0.50 or 5% but if you buy $100 then the fee is only $2.22.  Just a week or two ago the fee for $10 was only $0.18 that may not seem like much, but it's a huge increase.

Has it always scaled fees based on purchase size and I just never noticed?",1579492460,6,1

I‚Äôm new to Reddit and I‚Äôm new to Bitcoin/ Crypto. 

Sorry if I posted in the wrong place, (I‚Äôm only 1 day old)  and wasn‚Äôt allowed to join any chat/groups yet.

I have 0 knowledge with Bitcoin/Crypto and would love some help on where to start. My first starting point was google to gain some understanding and to be honest, found it all a little overwhelming and didn‚Äôt really trust the resources I found. I read about a few scams after re-Googling for ‚Äúreviews, but read about some  success stories also. who do you trust? Where do you begin? How does it all work? What do I need to get started?

I understand the risks involved, I‚Äôm not looking to be a millionaire trading and buying crypto(although it‚Äôd be nice). I only want to start small to begin with. start with a few bucks to see how it all goes and really get the fundamentals down for trading/buying crypto. 

Anyway, a reply with any information (if this doesn‚Äôt get deleted ) would be much appreciated.

er54o8,FLNI,"A question about scaling, transaction costs and CoinJoin","So I'm about to finish the excellent ""The Bitcoin Standard"" by Saifedean Ammous, and in the chapter about Bitcoin's scalability, he says a couple of things I'd like to get some feedback on. 

Bear with me here: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. The current block size has a capacity of \~500,000 transactions per day which we now meet, therefore the transaction fees have risen significantly. 
2. Since all network nodes require to keep a copy of the entire ledger, it means that the cost of recording transactions will be far higher than for any centralized solution. 
3. CoinJoin can potentially raise the transaction volume for only a fraction of the space needed otherwise. This can raise the tx volume to compete with the likes of VISA, **and as the transaction costs rise higher**, this is more and more likely to be a popular option. 

So my question is, why would the tx costs rise higher if we can kill the cap of 500k tx per day through CoinJoin?

New features of particular interest
===================================

- BIP157 (Neutrino) can be enabled to serve compact block filters to peers. This requires both the `-blockfilterindex` and `-peercfilters` options enabled, and can also be turned on in the GUI settings under the Network tab.

- PSBT support has been experimentally expanded to include the new version and proprietary fields, as well as easier usage from the GUI for watch-only wallets.

- The Overview tab now has the ability to hide private information. This is still an experimental feature, and suggestions for how the new ""privacy mode"" should look can be made on the related Core PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16432",1579455093,8,1

eqymj1,TombStoneFaro,"If you knew that that BTC would be worth 50% of its current value in 10 years, would you still buy?","One of the biggest problems Jews immigrating from Germany had was that they were limit to taking 10 marks with them which was less than 5 bucks in the late 1930s -- given wages, it was probably about one-day's salary for, say, a teacher. It was probably enough to pay for one night in a hotel and food for one person. That is, it was practically nothing and people who did not have relatives or assets in a foreign country would not be allowed into most countries who did not want to admit paupers.

So this requirement resulted ultimately in deaths of many tens of thousands of people. 

So in the following artificial scenario:

1. You had to buy this year and could do so anonymously
2. You knew somehow that BTC would drop but would still remain at 50% of its current value against the dollar
3. You were pretty sure that you would need to leave the country at some point and all of your assets would be confiscated except for a nominal amount (as in nazi Germany) and no one knew you had crypto

Any person who was afraid of #3 would be thrilled to invest not all but a significant amount of their worth in BTC and would not even consider selling even if BTC went up 100 to 1.

This is sort of paradoxical -- an asset that would allow you the freedom to leave the USA or whatever country (probably there are countries way more like nazi Germany) and thereby let you sleep at night -- should keep increasing in value but I am saying even if it didn't, even if you knew it would drop, it would be about the best investment you could make.",1579452322,0,1

You agree and understand that if your account or any Related Account is determined, in our sole discretion, to be have committed a Conduct Violation, we have the right to terminate any such accounts and take any and all necessary and appropriate actions pursuant to this User Agreement and/or Applicable Laws and Regulations.

Account Remedies for Breach
You agree and understand that if you, your account, or any Related Account is determined, in our sole discretion, to have committed a Conduct Violation, we have the right to debit from your account or any Related Account (i) the value of any trading fee discounts or rebates that you or the holder of a Related Account has received in connection with this User Agreement at any time after one year preceding the date on which we become aware of the existence of the Conduct Violation and (ii) any other damages suffered by us as a result of the Conduct Violation. You further agree and understand that if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have colluded, coordinated, and/or collaborated with any other User to commit a Conduct Violation, you and that User will be jointly and severally liable for the whole value of any trading fee discounts, rebates, and/or damages to which we are entitled under this subsection and any such amounts may be debited, in our sole discretion, from your account, that User‚Äôs account, or in each case, any Related Account. We will deduct any such amounts from the respective Fiat Account(s) and/or Digital Asset Account(s). If withdrawing from a Digital Asset Account, we will withdraw sufficient Digital Assets as calculated using that day‚Äôs Gemini Auction¬Æ 4pm ET U.S. dollar denominated auction price or, if no such auction price is available, the Gemini trailing 24-hour U.S. dollar denominated VWAP as of 4pm ET (the ‚ÄúPrevailing Market Price‚Äù). In addition, you agree and understand that we may alternatively collect some or all of any such amounts by offsetting them against any amount owing to you from Gemini. If you disagree with any determination made or remedy exercised under this subsection, you may bring an arbitration action pursuant to the ‚ÄòDispute Resolution‚Äô section of this User Agreement.

Account Termination
You agree and understand that we have the right to terminate your access to Gemini and any account at any time and for any reason, and that if we do so, your rights and obligations under this User Agreement will continue. You further agree and understand that we have the right to take any and all necessary and appropriate actions pursuant to this User Agreement and/or Applicable Laws and Regulations. If your account is terminated, we will return your funds, less the value of any trading fee discounts, rebates, and/or damages that we are entitled to pursuant to this User Agreement. If your account is no longer subject to an investigation, court order, or subpoena, you authorize us to return your funds (less any trading fee discounts, rebates, and/or damages to which we are entitled) to any bank account linked to your account, unless otherwise required by law. If there is a Digital Asset balance remaining in your account, you agree to provide us with a Digital Asset address within seven calendar days upon receiving Written Notice, so that we can return the remaining Digital Assets to you. If you fail to do so, you hereby agree that we are permitted to sell any remaining Digital Assets on the open market at a price within 5% of the Prevailing Market Price and return the proceeds (less any trading fee discounts, rebates, and/or damages to which we are entitled) to any bank account linked to your account.

Legal Process
You agree and understand that we, as well as our affiliates, service providers, their respective officers, directors, agents, joint venturers, employees and representatives (collectively, the ‚ÄúGemini Service Providers‚Äù), may comply with any writ of attachment, execution, garnishment, tax levy, restraining order, subpoena, warrant or other legal process, which any of us reasonably and in good faith believe to be valid. We and any Gemini Service Provider may, but are not required to, notify you of such process by electronic communication. We and any Gemini Service Provider may charge you for associated costs, in addition to any legal process fees. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold all of us harmless from all actions, claims, liabilities, losses, costs, attorney‚Äôs fees, or damages associated with our compliance with any process that any of us reasonably believe in good faith to be valid. You further agree that we and any Gemini Service Provider may honor any legal process, regardless of the method or location of service.

Right of Offset
You agree and understand that we have the right to offset: (i) negative balances in your Fiat Account by selling the necessary amount of Digital Assets in your Digital Asset Account on the open market at a price within 5% of the Prevailing Market Price to offset such negative balances; (ii) negative balances in your Digital Asset Account by buying the necessary amount of Digital Assets at the Prevailing Market Price to offset such negative balances with the fiat currency in your Fiat Account; and (iii) any and all debts owed to Gemini through the offset of balances of your account or any Related Account.

Unclaimed Funds
If your account remains closed or dormant for a long enough period of time, we may be required, upon the passage of applicable time periods, to report any remaining funds in your account as unclaimed property in accordance with abandoned property and escheat laws. If this occurs, we will use reasonable efforts to give Written Notice. If you fail to respond to any such Written Notice within seven Business Days (as defined herein) or as otherwise required by law, we may be required to deliver any such funds to New York State as unclaimed property. We reserve the right to deduct an administrative fee resulting from such unclaimed funds, as permitted by Applicable Law and Regulations.

BSA/AML Compliance
Our BSA/AML Program is guided by the BSA, specifically, the AML and Counter-Terrorist Financing (‚ÄúCTF‚Äù) provisions, as mandated by U.S. federal law, the Patriot Act, and all other rules and regulations regarding AML and CTF. These standards are designed to prevent the use of Gemini for money laundering or terrorist financing activities. We take compliance very seriously and it is our policy to take all the necessary steps to prohibit fraudulent transactions, report suspicious activities, and actively engage in the prevention of money laundering and any related acts that facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, or any other financial crimes.

Patriot Act Notification
Please also note that Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT ACT requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. This federal requirement applies to all new users. This information is used to assist the United States government in the fight against the funding of terrorism and money-laundering activities.

What this means to you: when each person opens an account on Gemini, we will ask each person for his or her name, physical address, mailing address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify him or her.

Background Checks
In furtherance of our BSA/AML Program, we reserve the right to require you to provide us with additional information and/or require you to undergo a background check prior to being authorized to use Gemini, or at any point thereafter, in accordance with Applicable Laws and Regulations.

Source of Funds
You agree, represent, and warrant that all funds in your account, or funds exchanged or to be exchanged by you in the future on Gemini, are not the direct or indirect proceeds of any criminal or fraudulent activity.

You are not allowed to receive funds in your account from a sender other than yourself. Any funds you receive from a sender other than yourself will be considered unauthorized. We reserve the right to investigate the source of any funds in your account and determine, in our sole discretion, how to handle their disposition. Following our review of any funds in question and the circumstances by which you received them, we may determine that you are not the owner of such funds. If such a determination is made, we reserve the right to dispose of these funds in accordance with Applicable Laws and Regulations and in our sole discretion, which may include, returning them to the destination of their origin or to a charity of our choosing.",1579249088,118,1

The second example would be like a hold only/saving address where btc is only sent but never spent (and once the bitcoin is finally spent, the wallet would never be used again- it would be emptied). My understanding is that the seed allows a generation of multiple private keys, but I am not able to figure out whether using this seed would be more or less secure than a single private key which is never used to sign any transactions and never touches the internet.

Yesterday a neighbor who lives near me came to see me.

She brought a jar of coffee with lots of 5 pennies.

What to do with this government money?

Six months ago, the government passed a law under which 5 cents is no longer money.

Woman forgets she has a can of coffee with coins. She is elderly. She rarely listened to the news and didn't know the law.

The law says you can exchange 5 ""nomoney"" at a government bank. But it is difficult for a woman to find this bank.

Money is what society chooses. Gold does not need to be exchanged for other gold according to the law invented by politicians. Gold always remains gold. Gold chose society as money.

Society does not choose government money. The government is forcing people to use government money through violence and threats. The government then creates a law and says that old money is no longer money.

Today he came over to my house and I tried to help him gain access again, I found his seed-phrase in his documents and so we regained the access to the wallet. But the wallet was emptied. There was no transaction in the history, just straight up empty. 

Is there anyway to check if coins have been moved from his wallet? Is there anything else we can do?

After Youtube mass block of BTC youtubers videos/ account the next war on BTC is via localbitcoins.com and Finland is being used here as the base for BTC financial strangulation.

One thing is for sure, what they perceived as 3rd world countries are always being used as testing ground for any kind of outcome of a political and financial struggle later to be used and applied on every one else.

So Russians and other Europeans still using LBC. It's time to get all your coins out of LBC and use a wallet you have full control over your private keys. My one penny advice. One will also notice Kenya is not touched. Reason ? Kenya is long sold to the empire. Russians should be careful. They wont dare with the Russians cos Finland is not far from Russia.

Other countries should take note of this report.",1579700424,9,1

ervbj0,The_Wave13,"My Trezor (MEW?) account got compremised, funds were stolen","  

Hello ladies and gentleman,  
 

I hope you can help me out somehow. I put it in bitcoin as well despite its ethereum but its about trezor and the btc part is involved.  In mid september all my ethereum and ethereum based stuff was cleared from my MEW accounts for roughly 38k USD. Trezor couldnt help me at all and we went through all the topics and questions they had which lead to nothing exept an basic answer ‚Äúyour seeds got compromised in the past‚Äú, which doesn‚Äôt make any sense and I will explain why.   
 

Lets say, Im a person with some basic tech knowledge and worked as admin and I use common sense to handle my crypto stuff which is part of my business and daily task since 2 years.  
 I check all things again before sending. Adress, amount etc and never had any problems before.  
 I never was on a fake page where I had to give my seed or passphrases in  
 I dont open spam mails nor use my new laptop for something else then work, like visiting porn sites or shady stuff or use cracks etc. I didnt even found a malitous cookie after checking everything. The laptop I used was 3 months old and set up on my own with windows, firwall, antivir and anti malware stuff. Things I am doing form me and my friends since year 2000. No cracks used for programms, everything legal. I use a trezor one since then which is updated accordingly when the tool or page prompts me. I used to use chrome as my default browser (which i learned, over the past months trying to figure out what might have happened, is one oft the worst browsers).   
 

No one has my seeds  
 no one knows my pin to entert the trezor  
 I dont store any of this information online  
 I dont know my private keys from trezor  
 

So what happened was that september 9 in the evening, a few hours after I sent some usdt deposit to my adress, I want to check if everything is there, login to my MEW account (online, not offline and url was correct. no addon used, just the shortcut in my browser which i safed there and always used and later checked i fit was linked to something else which wasnt), and the account was empty. Three ethereum adresses where i stored some coins, eth and usdt.   
 

I realised that every transaction below happened while i was standing infront of my laptop (checked time happening), trezor connected cause i did some btc transaction before and chatted to customers on different chat tools like telegram or skype. Obvsly without signing any transaction at all everything was sent to other adresses. It seemed someone got the keys to those adresses before. Now, I dont even know my private keys to those adresses which are stored in trezor right? I wasnt logged into MEW before this incident for about 1.5 days. The btc part on my trezor is MUCH more valuable, but still there. After trezor couldnt help me about what happened and MEW treated me like the standard idiot who gets highjacked and then wonders why his money is gone, I went trough so many possibilities. For the most time I thought some kind of KRACK attack happened.   
 

The only problem is trezor says they dont extract the private keys. Some gurus in this topic ( i read on reddit here) say its possible to get them from the network. Even parts are enough to encrypt the whole key after a while which would underline the timeline that it took 6 days from working in this hotel and having the unusual situation with the sending (down explained) till the accs got cleared.  
 

The hotel incident happened the week before my accounts got cleared. I was visitting friends and coworking agents in Vietnam and stayed in a red doorz hotel in Ho Chi Minh. Using the Hotel Wifi and a nvpn.net VPN I sent some usdt funds via MEW to a befriended customer and something very stranged happened, which I never had before.   
 I sent 4k usdt to a customer and the transaction took 13 min working working working and then failed. I‚Äôve never had something like that. We thought it might be because of eth network or so but we never had that before, me and him sending a lot transactions every day.  
 

Then i copied all details in again and send another 4k and somehow he recieved both!   
 

check the screen. The one transaction processed nearly 13 min then failed. 2min later i sent a new one and without any evidence in this screen he recieved both.  
 IMG\]https://s19.directupload.net/images/200121/s5j7ogwh.jpg\[/IMG\]  
 

But here you can see he got both even tho it appeared a minute later   
 \[IMG\]https://s19.directupload.net/images/200121/j6hyzqmk.png\[/IMG\]  
 

So he sent me back the additional 4k and I shut down everything not thinking about this much anymore. Only when the accounts got cleared I was searching for any unusual happenings which could have let to this because pretty much all other ‚Äútypical‚Äú mistakes people normally do we could exclude. If somehow my seeds got compromised why only the ETH stuff? The btc parts on the trezor had much much more value. I never searched for trezor page on the web and used a link to access my wallets or to do updates. I always used the trezor bridge and made a shortcut to my wallet in my browser. For MEW i always used the same shortcut in my browser which worked pretty fine for the past years an everytime when setting the browser or pc new i checked it all before.   
 

Because of the unusual thing which happened in Vietnam I flew back there (from philippines) prepared with tools and checking because I couldnt let go and I didnt find any other plausible cause. I even got back my old room. In this hotel there are three hotel wifi network and I remeber 100% that I used the 2nd one before cause it had the strongest signal. Anyway. I switched on wireshark and later on Fiddler, repeated all steps I used to do before. Checking if some rerouting, dns poisening or readressing or so is happening. Nothing unusual happened in the first when entering MEW (I sent some bait funds there).  
 

In the 2nd network I used in september the trezor basically totally freaked out. He didnt let me enter MEW, I had to reenter my pin up to 5 times sometimes, It gave me error messages in MEW or it took 30 fucking seconds to enter it. Trezor writes about this:  
 

‚ÄúWhen you enter an invalid PIN a few times, the Trezor adds a forced waiting time between attempts.   
 You can see this feature on the photo where the Trezor is making you wait for 15 seconds before another attempt.  
 This countdown is then multiplied by the factor of two until you reach the 16th invalid PIN entry. After that, the device automatically wipes its memory - deleting all data from it.  
   
 The behavior of your Trezor at MEW is undoubtedly not standard or in any form pleasantly functional. Nevertheless, it also isn't anything superbly unusual or unexpected, taking poor internet connection into account.‚Äú  
 

The thing is, the pin is 6 digits but pretty basic and I never ever entered it wrong. And I used the strongest wifi and could open webpages very easily .   
 

As well as: ‚ÄúSadly, this does not tell us anything about how your funds could be compromised. None of this could have ever exposed your private keys or made your device vulnerable in any way.  
   
 The Reddit thread you linked discusses cracking BIP-39 passphrases, which is irrelevant to your case. Cracking such passphrases assumes the person trying to break the wallet already has full possession of the recovery seed (recovery words). See, a passphrase is not your recovery seed or some additional password on your device. It is an extension of the seed, and it is also 100% useless without controlling the full seed.  
 

The only threat you are exposed to when using Chrome is using Google itself. When googling ""trezor"" or ""trezor wallet"", you might stumble upon a phishing site which will present itself as a genuine Trezor website and force you to go through a fake ""recovery"" process. There you'd give out your recovery seed, which subsequently grants full access to your wallet and funds.  
   
 It's reasonable to assume that malware could guide you to such a website. To this day, we are not aware of any such incident ever happening, and even then, there are protections in place to defend you against phishing attempts.‚Äú  
 

Basically, something I never did and all funds would haven been gone.  
 

I checked the 3rd network as well, and like the 1st nothing special happened. Only in the 2nd.   
 

These are the funds and how the got cleared off the wallets.  
 

I always show last transaction from me to the adress as well on the screens. So adress:  
 

0x253ABB6d747a9404A007f57AaDEc1cA2b80694a1  
 

They withdrew this:  
 1k USDT and the small amount ETH to send stuff   
   
 IMG\]https://s19.directupload.net/images/200121/k7dkju3b.png\[/IMG\]  
 

adress:  
 

0x01fd43a713D8F46FF9a7Ed108da2FF74884D8400  
 

They withdrew this:  
 Majority of USDT and small eth for sending stuff  
 

\[IMG\]https://s19.directupload.net/images/200121/4ff5xacl.png\[/IMG\]  
 

adress:  
 

0xf73c8C30072488d932011696436B46005504A7ae  
 They withdrew this:  
 

Majority of ETh, then all coins from valueable to worthless and then some rest eth  
 

\[IMG\]https://s19.directupload.net/images/200121/cqyx42rq.png\[/IMG\]  
 

\[IMG\]https://s19.directupload.net/images/200121/y2n46ijj.jpg\[/IMG\]  
 

So this is what happened at 12th september between 16:49 and 17:15. Sick to see that all happened between 16:49 and 17:00 and its like someone came back checking and saw the 0.014 eth and withdrew it 17:15. Around 10pm i discovered what happened.   
 

So, do you have any ideas? Questions? Feel free to guess or ask Im glad for everything which might lead to what might have happened. I somehow can‚Äôt let go off the feeling something inbetween the network, MEW and trezor ist he cause, but what do I know.",1579616612,70,1

erq8o7,Harold_Bishop,BITPAY wallet transaction gone missing. Now I can't trust this wallet.,Last week I attempted to transfer a small amount of BTC from my Bitpay wallet to another mobile wallet.  Before sending the transaction I checked multiple times that I was sending it to the correct BTC address.  A few hours later I noticed that I still hadn't received the payment to the other wallet.  Upon checking the transaction on the blockchain I discovered that it had been sent to a totally different and unrecognised address. I have no idea who owns this address and how this happened and Bitpay support have been no help at all.   Anyone know how this might've happened?   I'm very concerned about moving larger transactions out of this wallet now for fear of it happening again. :(,1579585287,18,1

That being said, everything I have is on CoinBase right now, and I watched a video today that pushed the hardware wallet concept and I would like to know what the best way forward for me is.

I am looking at the Ledger Nano-S and Nano-X and wondering why I would need to spend double for the X vs the S ?

Once I receive the hardware (assuming Ledger) what is the first thing I need to do once I get it all set up? Do I transfer all of what I have from coinbase to the ledger live set up? How do I go about doing that?

From there, am I able to buy and sell my assets from Ledger Live or will I still need to go through coinbase to transact?

There are a couple of other coins I am interested in, but I will probably never really venture past BTC and maybe ETH, so I really don't think I need a device that can handle dozens of different coins.

erm3x2,xav--,Opinion: Is the halving the biggest contrarian indicator ever? And could prices plunge as a result?,"Its just a random thought here... I have always been a big fan of contrarian investing.

It always seems that every time something ‚Äúgood‚Äù happens, prices just end up crashing, and vice versa.

An example is Bakkt futures. Everybody thought it was going to be great for bitcoin. Yet, Bitcoin crashed like 30 to 40 percent right as it went live.

Other examples are the TARP bailouts of 2008. For those who remember, the US treasury came up with the brilliant (I‚Äôm being sarcastic) idea to use $700 billion to bailout the US banks. The markets went up on the idea. Politicians and Wall Street said basically that we had to do the bailouts or the markets would crash. As soon as the US government approved the bailouts the markets crashed.

An older example is 1999 with the nasdaq bubble. At the time people came up with this Y2K bug crash. And the general idea was that it would force a lot of people to renew their IT infrastructure. 2000 came and that Y2K bug was more hype than anything and it didn‚Äôt really affect anyone. The nasdaq crashed 90 percent.

Back to bitcoin and the halving... there is just a lot of hype with it. Everybody is so optimistic... I mean we hear just some crazy estimates of $100k bitcoin by next year.

The bitcoin halving is so hyped that they even talk about it on CNBC. My father even mentioned it to me because he used it on the news French radio.

While I understand that lower inflation is itself a good thing, it doesn‚Äôt justify in my eyes a 1,000 percent price increase.

My biggest fear short term is that a lot of the current buying activity is motivated by unrealistic price increases and that activity could quickly turn into panic sales as those expectations do not materialize.

I fear that the amount of weak hands that is being accumulated far more than offset the halving itself, therefore triggering a big crash in prices shortly after the halving.

I‚Äôm not recommending anybody to sell. I am not selling myself. But I‚Äôll be very worried when the halving comes, in all honesty. If I could keep my coins and insure myself against a collapse in prices, I probably would.

Whatever happens to the prices of bitcoin, I would expect alt coins to crash by an order of magnitude more.",1579564483,6,1

erkl53,lyambaker,Bitcoin is not created out of thin air.,"Bitcoin is created through a process called mining. Blockchain, the technology that bitcoin is built on top of, is dependent on a network of nodes that ensures the integrity of transaction history by achieving consensus. (To understand more about blockchain, you can reference this article.) Validation is one part of the process. After validating a transaction, the nodes then need to race, using trial and error, to solve a difficult mathematical puzzle that requires heavy computing resources. The first computer in the network that solves the equation will be rewarded with bitcoins. This is known as ‚Äòmining bitcoins‚Äô. This protocol is referred to as Proof of Work (PoW).

Bitcoin mining serves two purposes: it allows for the creation of new coins and facilitates the processing of transactions in the network. Mining requires energy, hardware and bandwidth. If you try to mine bitcoins on your computer, you will find the cost of electricity will likely outweigh the value of bitcoins you can mine. Other cryptocurrencies also use PoW. Another emerging protocol is Proof of Stake (PoS) which does not need energy or hardware to achieve consensus, but rather uses staking or bonding tokens to determine the next block.",1579558102,11,1

This protects against fraud and counterfeit information. When bitcoin is created by PoW, the mining is authenticated and backed by a verifiable network.

Anyone can create their own currency. But a community is needed to accept the creation in order for it to have value. The world has been transacting with bitcoin for over nine years with a global community. Bitcoin also acts like a stock in that the price can go up and down arbitrarily.

et841o,almkglor,Technical: More channel mechanisms!,"

This is a followup [of my older post about the history of payment channel mechanisms](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cc9psl/technical_a_brief_history_of_payment_channels/).

The ""modern"" payment channel system is Lightning Network, which uses bidirectional indefinite-lifetime channels, using HTLCs to trustlessly route through the network.

However, at least one other payment channel mechanism was developed at roughly the same time as Lightning, and there are also further proposals that are intended to replace the core payment channel mechanism in use by Lightning.

Now, in principle, the ""magic"" of Lightning lies in combining two ingredients:

1.  Offchain updateable systems.
2.  HTLCs to implement atomic cross-system swaps.

We can replace the exact mechanism implementing an offchain updateable system.
Secondly we can replace the use of HTLCs with another atomic cross-system swap, which is what we would do when we eventually switch to payment points and scalars from payment hashes and preimages.

So let's clarify what I'll be discussing here:

* I will be discussing mechanisms for the offchain updateable system, which are generally called ""payment channel mechanisms"".
  The exact contracts that can be transported across such systems, such as HTLCs, the Scriptless-Script point-based variant, and Discrete Log Contracts, will have to wait another post.
* Payment channel mechanisms are designed to be trust-minimized.
  They might not *achieve* this design goal (consider the broken Satoshi sequence numbers, or the pre-SegWit Spilman, which I still class as ""payment channel mechanism""), but mechanisms which invoke trust in one participant or other as inherent parts of their design are not true payment channels.
  Such constructions might be of interest, but I will not discuss them here.

Now I might use ""we"" here to refer to what ""we"" did to the design of Bitcoin, but it is only because ""we"" are all Satoshi, except for Craig Steven Wright.

So, let's present the other payment channel mechanisms.  But first, a digression.

# Digression: the new `nSequence` and `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`

The new relative-timelock semantics of `nSequence`.

Last time we used `nSequence`, we had the unfortunate problem that it would be easy to rip off people by offering a higher miner fee for older state where we own more funds, then convince the other side of the channel to give us goods in exchange for a new state with tiny miner fees, then publish both the old state and the new state, then taunt the miners with ""so which state is gonna earn you more fees huh huh huh?"".

This problem, originally failed by Satoshi, was such a massive facepalm that, in honor of miners doing the economically-rational thing in the face of developer and user demands when given a non-final `nSequence`, we decided to use `nSequence` as a flag for the opt-in replace-by-fee.

Basically, under opt-in replace-by-fee, if a transaction had an `nSequence` that was not `0xFFFFFFFF` or `0xFFFFFFFE`, then it was opt-in RBF (BIP125).
Because you'd *totally* abuse `nSequence` to bribe miners in order to steal money from your bartender, especially if your bartender is not a werebear.

Of course, using a 4-byte field for a one-bit flag (to opt-in to RBF or not) was a massive waste of space, so when people started proposing relative locktimes, the `nSequence` field was repurposed.

Basically, in Bitcoin as of the time of this writing (early 2020) if `nSequence` is less than `0x80000000` it can be interpreted as a relative timelock.
I'll spare you the details here, [BIP68](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki) has them, but basically `nSequence` can indicate (much like `nLockTime`) either a ""real world"" relative lock time (i.e. the output must have been confirmed for X seconds before it can be spent using a transaction with a non-zero `nSequence`) or the actual real world, which is measured in blocks (i.e. the output must have been confirmed for N blocks before it can be spent using a transaction with a non-zero `nSequence`).
Of course, this is the Bitcoin universe and ""seconds"" is a merely human delusion, so we will use blocks exclusively.

And similarly to `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`, we also added `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` in [BIP112](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki).
This ensures that the `nSequence` field is a relative-locktime (i.e. less than `0x80000000`) and that it is the specified type (block-based or seconds-based) and that it is equal or higher to the specified minimum relative locktime.

It is important to mention the new, modern meaning of `nSequence`, because it is central to many of the modern payment channel mechanisms, including Lightning Poon-Dryja.

Lessons learned?

* Poetic justice is a thing.  Go go new `nSequence`!

# Decker-Wattenhofer ""Duplex Micropayment Channels""

Mechanisms-within-mechanisms for a punishment-free bidirectional indefinite-lifetime payment channel.

The Decker-Wattenhofer paper was published in 2015, but the Poon-Dryja ""Lightning Network"" paper was published in 2016.
However, the Decker-Wattenhofer paper mentions the Lightning mechanism, specifically mentioning the need to store every old revocation key (i.e. the problem I mentioned last time that was solved using /u/RustyReddit shachains).
Maybe Poon-Dryja presented the Lightning Network before making a final published paper in 2016, or something.
Either that or /u/cdecker is the Bitcoin time traveler.

It's a little hard to get an online copy now, but as of late 2019 this seems to work: [copy](https://tik-old.ee.ethz.ch/file/716b955c130e6c703fac336ea17b1670/duplex-micropayment-channels.pdf)

Now the interesting bit is that Decker-Wattenhofer achieves its goals by combining multiple mechanisms that are, by themselves, workable payment channel mechanisms already, except each has some massive drawbacks.
By combining them, we can minimize the drawbacks.

So let's go through the individual pieces.

## Indefinite-lifetime Spilman channels

As mentioned before, Spilman channels have the drawback that they have a limited lifetime: the lock time indicated in the backoff transaction or backoff branch of the script.
However, instead of an absolute lock time, we can use a *relative* locktime.

In order to do so, we use a ""kickoff"" transaction, between the backoff transaction and the funding transaction.
Our opening ritual goes this way, between you and our gender-neutral bartender-bancho werebear:

1.  First, you compute the txid for the funding transaction and the kickoff transaction.
    The funding transaction takes some of your funds and puts it into a 2-of-2 between you and the bartender, and the kickoff is a 1-input 1-output transaction that spends the funding transaction and outputs to another 2-of-2 between you and the bartender.
2.  Then, you generate the backoff transaction, which spends the kickoff transaction and returns all the funds to you.
    The backoff has a non-zero `nSequence`, indicating a delay of a number of blocks agreed between you, which is a security/convenience tradeoff parameter
3.  You sign the backoff transaction, then send it to the bartender.
4.  The bartender signs the backoff, and gives back the fully-signed transaction to you.
5.  You sign the kickoff transaction, then send it to the bartender.
6.  The bartender signs the kickoff, and gives it back to you fully signed.
7.  You sign and broadcast the funding transaction, and both of you wait for the funding transaction to be deeply confirmed.

The above setup assumes you're using SegWit, because transaction malleability fix.

At any time, either you or the bartender can broadcast the kickoff transaction, and once that is done, this indicates closure of the channel.
You do this if you have drunk enough alcoholic beverages, or the bartender could do this when he or she is closing the bar.

Now, to get your drinks, you do:

1.  Sign a transaction spending the kickoff, and adding more funds to the bartender, to buy a drink.
    This transaction is *not* encumbered with an `nSequence`.
2.  Hand the signed transaction to the bartender, who provides you with your next drink.

The channel is closed by publishing the kickoff transaction.
Both of you have a fully-signed copy of the kickoff, so either of you can initiate the close.

On closure (publication and confirmation of the kickoff transaction), there are two cases:

1.  You fail to pick up any chicks at the bar (I prefer female humans of optimum reproductive age myself rather than nestling birds, but hey, you do you) so you didn't actually spend for drinks at all.
    In this case, the bartender is not holding any transactions that can spend the kickoff transaction.
    You wait for the agreed-upon delay after the kickoff is confirmed, and then publish the backoff transaction and get back all the funds that you didn't spend.
2.  You spend all your money on chicks and end up having to be kicked into a cab to get back to your domicile, because even juvenile birds can out-drink you, you pushover.
    The bartender then uses the latest transaction you gave (the one that gives the most money to him or her --- it would be foolish of him or her to use an earlier version with less money!), signs it, and broadcasts it to get his or her share of the money from the kickoff transaction.

* Pro: Number of updates is limited only by the amount of money you have in the ""payer"" side of the channel.
* Pro: no lifetime limit.
  You can keep the channel open indefinitely if you don't transact over it.
* Pro: The delay can be very small.
* Con: Unidirectional.

## Decrementing `nSequence` channels

Enforcing order by reducing relative locktimes.

I believe this to be novel to the Decker-Wattenhofer mechanism, though I might be missing some predecessor.

This again uses the new relative-locktime meaning of `nSequence`.
As such, it also uses a kickoff transaction like the above indefinite-lifetime Spilman channel.
Set up is very similar to the setup of the above indefinite-lifetime Spilman channel, except that because this is bidirectional, we can actually have both sides put money into the initial starting backoff transaction.

We also rename the ""backoff"" transaction to ""state"" transaction.
Basically, the state transaction indicates how the money in the channel is divided up between the two participants.
The ""backoff"" we sign during the funding ritual is now the *first state* transaction.
Both sides keep track of the current state transaction (which is initialized to the first state transaction on channel establishment).

Finally, the starting `nSequence` of the first state transaction is very large (usually in the dozens or low hundreds of blocks).

Suppose one participant wants to pay the other.
The ritual done is then:

1.  A new version of the current state transaction is created with more money in the payee side.
2.  This new version has `nSequence` that is one block lower than the current state transaction (in practice it should be a few blocks lower, not just one, because sometimes miners find blocks in quick succession).
3.  Both sides exchange signatures for the new state transaction.
4.  Both sides set the new state transaction as the current state transaction that will be the basis for the next payment.

When the channel is closed by publication of the kickoff transaction, then the transaction with the lowest `nSequence` becomes valid earlier than the other state transactions.
This is enough to enforce that the most recent state transaction (the one with the lowest `nSequence`, and thus the first to become valid) is published.

* Pro: bidirectional.
* Pro: indefinite lifetime, at least if no updates are done.
* Pro: it shows that life is not without a sense of irony.  The original design for `nSequence` replacement required an *incrementing* `nSequence` using the original Satoshi's Vision interpretation of `nSequence` (which doesn't work).  But this channel mechanism instead uses a *decrementing* `nSequence` using the new Bitcoin Core interpretation of `nSequence` as a relative timelock (which does, in fact, work).
* Con: Number of updates is limited by the starting maximum `nSequence` delay.
  Increasing this delay increases the encumbrance if the channel is closed without any activity, but reducing this delay reduces the number of payments in either direction you can use before you have to close the channel and recreate it.
  For example, let's have a maximum of 144 blocks of delay.  Each update, we decrement the `nSequence` by 4, because that handles up to the very rare case where up to 3 blocks arrive in very close succession to each other.  That only gives us 36 updates for a worst-case of one day of delay, a very bad tradeoff.
* Con: You can only be safely offline for a number of blocks equal to the ""step"", but the maximum delay you may incur is the product of the step times the number of updates you want to make.
  So you want a small step (because you don't want your worst-case lock time to be large) but you want a big step (because you want to still be safe even if you go offline for a long time).


## Mechanism-within-mechanism

Combining the ingredients of the Decker-Wattenhofer Duplex Micropayment Channels concoction.

Of note is that we can ""chain"" these mechanisms together in such a way that we strengthen their strengths while covering their weaknesses.

A note is that both the indefinite-lifetime `nSequence` Spilman variant, and the above decrementing `nSequence` mechanism, both have ""kickoff"" transactions.

However, when we chain the two mechanisms together, it turns out that the final transaction of *one* mechanism also serves as the kickoff of the *next* mechanism in the chain.

So for example, let's chain two of those decrementing `nSequence` channels together.
Let's make them 144 blocks maximum delay each, and decrement in units of 4 blocks, so each of the chained mechanisms can do 37 updates each.

We start up a new channel with the following transactions:

1.  A funding transaction paying to a 2-of-2, confirmed deeply onchain.
    All other transactions are offchain until closure.
2.  A kickoff transaction spending the funding transaction output, paying to a 2-of-2.
3.  A ""stage 1"" decrementing `nSequence` state transaction, spending the kickoff, with current `nSequence` 144, paying to a 2-of-2.
4.  A ""stage 2"" decrementing `nSequence` state transaction, spending the stage 1, with current `nSequence` 144, paying to the initial state of the channel.

When we update this channel, we first update the ""stage 2"" state transaction, replacing it with an `nSequence` lower by 4 blocks.
So after one update our transactions are:

1.  A funding transaction paying to a 2-of-2, confirmed deeply onchain.
    All other transactions are offchain until closure.
2.  A kickoff transaction spending the funding transaction output, paying to a 2-of-2.
3.  A ""stage 1"" decrementing `nSequence` state transaction, spending the kickoff, with current `nSequence` 144, paying to a 2-of-2.
4.  A ""stage 2"" decrementing `nSequence` state transaction, spending the stage 1, with current `nSequence` 140, paying to the second state of the channel.

The first 3 transactions are the same, only the last one is replaced with a state transaction with lower `nSequence.

Things become interesting when we reach the ""stage 2"" having `nSequence` 0.
On the next update, we create a new ""stage 1"", with an `nSequence` that is 4 lower, and ""reset"" the ""stage 2"" back to an `nSequence` of 144.

This is safe because even though we have a ""stage 2"" with shorter `nSequence`, that stage 2 spends a stage 1 with an `nSequence` of 144, and the stage 1 with `nSequence` of 140 would beat it to the blockchain first.

This results in us having, not 36 + 36 updates, but instead 36 * 36 updates (1296 updates).
1296 updates is still kinda piddling, but that's much better than just a single-stage decrementing `nSequence` channel.

The number of stages can be extended indefinitely, and your only drawback would be the amount of blockchain space you'd spend for a unilateral close.
Mutual cooperative closes can always shortcut the entire stack of staged transactions and cut it to a single mutual cooperative close transaction.

But that's not all!
You might be wondering about the term ""duplex"" in the name ""Duplex Micropayment Channels"".

That's because the last decrementing `nSequence` stage does not hold the money of the participants directly.
Instead, the last stage holds two indefinite-lifetime Spilman channels.
As you might remember, Spilman channels are unidirectional, so the two Spilman channels represent both directions of the channel.
Thus, duplex.

Let's go back to you and your favorite werebear bartender.
If you were using a Decker-Wattenhofer Duplex Micropayment Channel, you'd have several stages of decrementing `nSequence`, terminated in two Spilman channels, a you-to-bartender channel and a bartender-to-you channel.

Suppose that, while drinking, the bartender offers you a rebate on each drink if you do some particular service for him or her.
Let us not discuss what service this is and leave it to your imagination.
So you pay for a drink, decide you want to get the rebate, and perform a service that the bartender finds enjoyable.
So you transfer some funds on the you-to-bartender direction, and then later the bartender transfers some funds in the bartender-to-you channel after greatly enjoying your service.

Suppose you now exhaust the you-to-bartender direction.
However, you note that the rebates you've earned are enough to buy a few more drinks.
What you do instead is to update the staged decrementing `nSequence` mechanisms, and recreate the two Spilman directions such that the you-to-bartender direction contains all your current funds and the bartender-to-you direction contains all the bartender's funds.
With this, you are now able to spend even the money you earned from rebates.
At the same time, even if the staged decrementing `nSequence` mechanisms only have a few hundred thousand updates, you can still extend the practical number of updates as long as you don't have to reset the Spilman channels too often.

* Pro: chaining allows more possible updates!
* Pro: no ""toxic waste""! That is, old backups of your channel state database won't cause you to lose funds automatically.
* Con: unilateral closes have long lock times, due to the chaining of decrementing-`nSequence` mechanisms.
* Con: unilateral closes put a *lot* of transactions onchain, due to the chaining of multiple nested mechanisms.
* Con: HTLCs are affected by the total `nSequence` delay needed by the mechanism.
  This is because HTLCs have an absolute timelock in their contract, and this can only be enforced onchain.
  However, the existence of `nSequence` delays means that absolute timelocks need to trigger unilateral closes several blocks *before* the absolute timelock, by the `nSequence` total delta of all the stacked mechanisms.
  In Poon-Dryja you can safely keep a channel open until just before the absolute timelock expires.
* Con: It's not clear to me if the cancellable HTLCs used by Lightning can be hosted by Spilman channels.
  The HTLCs used in Lightning are ""cancellable"" because of a nifty ability of every offchain update mechanism: every contract has an additional clause ""... or if every signer of the offchain update mechanism agrees, we can ignore this contract and place its funds wherever we agree on"".
  This is not a degradation of security since the HTLCs in a channel are between the two users of the channel, so both of them need to agree anyway in order to accept such a cancellation.
  This ability is used to propagate forwarding failures back to the payer: instead of waiting for the HTLCs to time out, the node just says to the sender ""between you and me, this HTLC won't propagate anyway, because 'insert some reason here', so let's just put the money in it back to you"".
  However, this seems unsafe with Spilman channels, as a cancelled HTLC will still be available on older states of the Spilman channel, and potentially claimable by the payee end up until the timelock.
  Removing the Spilman channels at the end would remove this issue, but now you are limited to a few hundred thousand updates even with lots of decrementing-`nSequence` layers.

# Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer Channel Factories

Because you like channels so much, you put channels inside channels so you could pay while you pay.  ***I N C E P T I O N***

The Decker-Wattenhofer Duplex Micropayment Channels introduced the possibility of nesting a channel mechanism inside another channel mechanism.
For example, it suggests nesting a decrementing-`nSequence` mechanism inside another decrementing-`nSequence` mechanism, and having as well an unlimited-lifetime Spilman channel at the end.
In the Decker-Wattenhofer case, it is used to support the weakness of one mechanism with the strength of another mechanism.

One thing to note is that while the unlimited-lifetime Spilman channel variant used is inherently two-participant (there is one payer and one payee), the decrementing-`nSequence` channel mechanism can be multiparticipant.

Another thing of note is that nothing prevents one mechanism from hosting just one inner mechanism, just as it is perfectly fine for a Lightning Network channel to have multiple HTLCs in-flight, plus the money in your side, plus the money in the counterparty's side.
As these are ""just"" Bitcoin-enforceable contracts, there is no fundamental difference between an HTLC, and a payment channel mechanism.

Thus the most basic idea of the Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer Channel Factories paper is simply that we can have a multiparticipant update mechanism host multiple two-party update mechanisms.
The outer multiparticipant update mechanism is called a ""channel factory"" while the inner two-party update mechanisms are called ""channels"".

The exact mechanism used in the Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer paper uses several decrementing-`nSequence` mechanisms to implement the factory, and Decker-Wattenhofer Duplex Micropayment Channels to implement the channel layer.

However, as noted before, there is no fundamental difference between a Poon-Dryja channel and an HTLC.
So it is in fact possible to have chained Decker-Wattenhofer decrementing-`nSequence` mechanisms to implement the factory level, while the channels are simply Poon-Dryja channels.

# Conclusion

So this concludes for now an alternative mechanism to the classic Poon-Dryja that Lightning uses.
The tradeoffs are significantly different between Decker-Wattenhofer vs Poon-Dryja:

* Decker-Wattenhofer: No toxic waste: old data stolen from you, or which you inadvertently use, is not going to lose *all* your funds.
* Decker-Wattenhofer: Multiple participants in a single offchain mechanism, enabling things like Channel Factories.
* Poon-Dryja: Doesn't have ridiculously long lock times in the unilateral close case.
* Poon-Dryja: Supports HTLCs for trustless forwarding (not clear if Decker-Wattenhofer fully supports this without sacrificing the duplexed indefinite-lifetime Spilman channels at the end).

etyl7g,ztsmart,On fungilbility and the blacklisting of bitcoins,"Consider a Bitcoin that allows users to trace the transaction history of their coins vs one that has ""fungibility and privacy improvements"" that strip this information.  

Which Bitcoin would offer more utility to society?  I will argue that a Bitcoin with individually identifiable coins is superior and that fears of government blacklisting undesirable coins are misplaced.

First consider that the Bitcoin with identifiable coins offers the market more information than the one that does not.   Simply put, a money that provides more information to market is better than one what provides less.

Many people seem to argue this would allow government(s) to blacklist certain coins they deem illegal and then control Bitcoin.  If government were to do this, argue this is simply a soft fork of Bitcoin that would be ignored.  People often talk about forks in the Bitcoin code, but the code is merely the implementation of the social consensus.   It is the social consensus that determines Bitcoin's monetary policy and that is the base layer at which any fork occurs, with the software fork just being incidental and along for the ride.

Suppose government where to open up nodes and hard fork to a Bitcoin that gives them 1M extra coins raising the limit to 22M.  Obviously this fork would be soundly rejected by the community and would flounder.  Now consider that alternatively government owning 1M coins simply decrees that 1M coins owned by others are worthless and illegal to transact with.  This would decrease the supply in this forked representation of Bitcoin and, if accepted increase the percentage of the Bitcoin they own.

This may very well start off as government stripping 1M ""tainted or illegal coins"", but would no doubt continue once it is established that government has this power over Bitcoin's monetary supply.  Soon after, government would create some nonsense reason to blacklist the coins they haven't moved in X years, claiming they are abandoned, of course doing so would be of benefit to the state--increasing the value of their Bitcoins.  This would continue with the state taking more and more of they value of the money supply until it ends in the same disastrous state that always eventually results when governments have control of they money supply.

Of course, I argue that such an attempt would backfire very badly for the state &amp; those who sheepishly obey the command to fork Bitcoin to include only government-approved bitcoins.

Let us look at an often occurring situation where there is some shitty country that has mismanaged it's monetary supply to the point people are starting to use another harder money, such as perhaps the US dollar.  Imagine a situation where you live in such a country and you have half your money in USD and half your money in a rapidly devaluing Tropico Peso.   You would expect to see transactions in the Peso to increase as it drives out the ""good money"" USD--consistent with Gresham's law.  In such a situation, the USD's value would climb relative to the Tropico Peso.  This should be obvious as people would rather hold the dollars and spend the pesos.

Now imagine the Tropico government decreed that it is illegal to transact in dollars.  This would only serve to hasten and magnify the collapse of the Peso, as now people can hold and spend Pesos, but they can ONLY hold dollars.

It is simply the case that the value of a money does not depend very much at all on how much people are able to spend it or willing to accept it, but rather the desire of society as a whole to hold the money as a store of value over.

One such evidence of this fact that was very shocking to me, was the price of Bitcoin immediately after the Silk Road was shut down.  In late 2013, a large percentage of Bitcoin transactions were related to the Silk Road and after this avenue was closed off, the price quickly grew in value.

Therefore when government attempts a GASF, to fork Bitcoin into only government approved bitcoins, they create a situation where people following this fork are going to end up paying a premium for ""clean, government approved"" coins that are allowed to be spent, and a situation where there are ""unclean"" coins that cannot be used to buy things (but can still be held).  Paradoxically I would expect the illegal coins to gain in value as they are being held (and traded in black markets).

Most probably GASF would fail with the market simply rejecting the government's fork attempt, but if it didn't it would inevitably fail later when government continued to meddle with the monetary policy to enrich itself, which would be to the benefit of anyone who ignored government and bought the ""illegal coins"" at a discount.

In short, Bitcoin's monetary policy is determined by social consensus.  Blacklisting coins would be an attempt to fork that consensus and would surely fail causing great economic harm to anyone who followed it.",1579995256,11,1

I'm not interested in investing.

One major question I have is regarding the addresses. I understand I can get this thing called a wallet, and I can then generate any number of addresses *from* that wallet. Some how, the new addresses are generated via sha256 from this wallet?

This makes me wonder how many ways the addresses are linked to the wallet? If I generate 40 addresses from a wallet,  could one of those addresses be traced back to the wallet and then used to link up the other 39?

etvvf9,TheViralClovers,Script to test the Martingale betting strategy on gambling sites,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I have recently created a python script that allows you to test the Martingale gambling strategy on for sites like [freebitco.in](https://freebitco.in) e.t.c \[btc\]

Here is the site (i call it gamble bot) \[url=http://gamble-bot.000webhostapp.com\][gambl](https://gamblebot.000webhostapp.com)ebot\[/url\] 

&amp;#x200B;

This script simulates a Hi-Lo Dice (without the graphics) and provides the following stats:

&amp;#x200B;

\--&gt;How many rounds you will last

\--&gt;What is the highest balance

\--&gt;How much time it will take to reach that balance

&amp;#x200B;

I am still in 12th Grade so dont expect much , ill prolly work on this script again in MAY, till then enjoy this release (I am a noob in programming so, excuse any erratas) 

&amp;#x200B;

Well ill now show you how to use the site:

&amp;#x200B;

Its quite easy actually

&amp;#x200B;

Step 1:

&amp;#x200B;

Press the run button on the site

[https://imgur.com/a/9JZCPcd](https://imgur.com/a/9JZCPcd)

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2:

&amp;#x200B;

Enter your balance, please enter a number! \[decimal numbers are allowed too:)\]

&amp;#x200B;

Step 3:

&amp;#x200B;

Enter the currency, while this has no significance, it just gives it a better feel, also if you skip it, default is USD

&amp;#x200B;

Step 4:

&amp;#x200B;

Enter the initial bet amount, ( make sure its less than the balance lol)

&amp;#x200B;

Step 5:

&amp;#x200B;

Enter your odds of \[b\]WINNING\[/b\] and include house edge in the next line if you want to or just ignore it all together and put house edge as 0

&amp;#x200B;

Step 6:

&amp;#x200B;

Enter the minimum time interval between the bets, this is just for a clearer understanding for how long an auto-roll might take, an example would be,

suppose [freebitco.in](https://freebitco.in)'s autoroll processes 3 bets a second , then enter 0.33 as the bet frequency

&amp;#x200B;

after all the steps, it should look sumn like this: [https://imgur.com/a/H6y1LA2](https://imgur.com/a/H6y1LA2)

Then just wait for your balance to be emptied and see the results :)

&amp;#x200B;

let's say I had a hardware-wallet. It has a seed phrase, length is either 22 or 25 words, I think that these keys can have different lenghts, right?

Let's say 25 words.

I save the 25 words on a piece of paper, which I store at a safe place. Let's say I erase 3 or 4 words from the paper and memorise them instead.

Now let's say someone finds the paper (which has 21 or 22 words of my seed phrase written on it). How likely is this person to guess the 3 or 4 missing words correctly (if the person has the intention to find them)?

These seed-phrase words are always pretty standard. Worlds like 'community', 'nature', 'tooth', 'cat', nothing too special. What I find interesting to know: Is there like a library of words which contains all  words that can be part of seed phrases? Is it limited to all words in some kind of dictionary? Basically: What's the total number of words that can be part of seed phrases? Can it be determined?

&amp;#x200B;

Btw, I am not trying to steal anyone's crypto. I'm just trying to figure out how to safely store crypto. If you have some killer mechanism how to store crypto, feel free to share. However, please also answer my questions if you know anything about it.

I now have access to my files, I have access to the password and I know that Multibit classic v 0.5.13 or higher was used.

I see that multibit is no longer supported. I have gained access to my bitstamp account. I am ready to sell.

The problem is that I have no clue how to get from: 
* Point A: A file on my computer
to
* Point B: Money in my bank account.

I have googled a bunch of stuff related to how to sell a bitcoin from cold storage and all I am reading about is ""sweeping"" coins and suggestions on apps, wallet hardware, blockchain.info and why its good or bad, and a million other things that just drive me deeper and deeper into being overwhelmed. 

I have looked all over my bitstamp account and have not seen any options for anything regarding importing cold wallets. I have read that my cold wallet is actually ""nothing"" because everything exists on the public blockchain. I have read that the only thing I need is my signature because thats all that matters. 

**I am lost**

I'm feeling pretty stupid asking for help on something that seems so easy to understand, but I could really use some dumbed down direction on what I have to do to get this all accomplished.

1 
If you have a paper wallet and say  you dont lose or destroy the paper is it then 100 % sure that in 10 years you still can import the coins to a wallet by scanning the QR   code    ?   Or am i missing something? 

2 those hardware wallets  why are they saver ? If that hardware wallet gets burned or driven over by tank or just broken what then ?   Because if there is a backup why its different then a paper wallet? 


3

I think bitcoin is the bomb and is very usefull although i dont believe it will replace all others   i think its more a usefull hedge and niche pay system still there is 150 billion inside it and that makes the price around 8000 so am i right that if the total abouth doubles to 300 billion the bitcoin price also doubles?

There was a video I saw here on reddit that was set in medieval times and Monty Pythonesque. A man had a little booth set up, like a lemonade stand. He was a money exchanger or a banker. Another man walked up and wanted to make a deposit, I believe. The banker said he only accepts rocks or eggs or sticks (these were not the items, but you see the point). The man said he wanted to deposit gold. The banker saw no use in that. They got into an argument over how nobody wants gold or rocks or whatever. It was rather comical.

Employers expect form maid agencies in Malaysia to find and recruit domestic helpers with verities of good characteristics. However, finding a perfect domestic helper is a tough job. Maid agencies and employers need to find out the good characters of a maid.  The purpose of this article is to extend the employer‚Äôs knowledge about the attributes that a housemaid should have before recruiting and most importantly the ways they can assess these attributes.

Based on the job offer, scope and employer‚Äôs preferences they have for a maid, physical appearance of a maid easily can be scrutinized like height and weight; age range and family status of the maid; single, married, with children or without. Though, assessing Personality Traits and characteristics of a maid to match with employer‚Äôs family before hiring is the most difficult part. In a short sentence, ‚Äúattitude is everything‚Äù

Personality traits are distinguishing qualities or characteristics that are the embodiment of an individuals. They are the habitual patterns of behaviour, temperament and emotion. In order to give the best maid service in Malaysia, our expert team in DG- Malaysia Maid Agency based on their vast experiences tries to uncover the details of the most important personality traits that a maid should have and in the next article the methods that an employer can evaluate each of these traits will be discussed.

**1)** **A maid must be Empathetic**

First and foremost, a maid must be empathetic. The primary focus of work is on the wants and needs of the employer and family. A maid with empathy enables her to understand employer‚Äôs motivations, needs, and emotions more deeply, and she can use that understanding to do better work for them. empathy is an essential quality for maid to develop. Being empathetic lets her look at things from different perspectives and internalize it.

Having empathy comes from focusing on someone else‚Äôs needs, struggles, and feelings. It requires that she opens her heart to them (employer‚Äôs family) and put their needs before her own. She needs to be open to many different types of employers from many different cultures. But you can‚Äôt connect with people when you‚Äôre feeling worried, defensive, angry, frightened, or ashamed. Empathy is about standing in someone else‚Äôs shoes, feeling with heart, seeing with eyes. If there is any good maid, she lies in the ability to get the employer‚Äôs point of view and sees things from that person‚Äôs angle, as well as from her own.

**2)** **Be Passionate**

Being an effective maid requires great drive, enthusiasm, and focus. To sustain the level of effort and concentration that the work demands, maid must have a passion for her work. She must love the employers job offer work and she‚Äôll have the motivation to continually improve her skills and expand her areas of competency. When the work is with passion, she can reach her full potential. Work is going to fill a large part of her life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what she believes is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work.

**3)** **Be a Good Listener**

Listening well is the key to effective communication. Focusing on both what employers say and how they say it ensures that a maid accurately receives the messages from employer communicate with her. Paying attention to their use of language, tone of voice, body language, gestures, and emotional affect increases the probability that a maid will be able to correctly interpret their meaning and understand what she hears. Listen for employer‚Äôs ideas, not just to their words. When she listens well, she‚Äôll experience fewer misunderstandings and make fewer mistakes. ‚ÄúIf we were supposed to talk more than we listen, we would have two tongues and one ear.‚Äù

**4)** **Be Responsible and Kind**

Responsible is ‚ÄúCapable of being trusted.‚Äù‚Äî and kindness‚Äù is ‚ÄúThe quality of being friendly, generous, and considerate.‚Äù

It‚Äôs essential that a maid do her best to meet obligations of her employer. If a maid promises to do something, she should try very hard to fulfil that promise. However, sometimes things change, or circumstances may prevent a maid to do good. But in either of these cases, it‚Äôs maid responsibility to discuss the problem with employer and, together, determine the best way forward.

To prevent disappointing employers, a maid must avoid over-promising and under-delivering. It‚Äôs important to be respectful of the employer and treat employer as she would like them to be treated. Being kind to one another makes the workplace a happy place to be. When your maid is struggling, show them compassion and help them to get through tough times.

**5)** **Be Honest and Have Integrity**

Being honest means telling the truth and being straightforward and open with employer. personal integrity always tries to do the right thing, regardless of whether anyone would ever know what they‚Äôve done. They have a strong moral compass. Integrity is a valuable quality in everyone. Maid honesty and integrity will engender trust in employer. In looking for employers to hire a maid, they must look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. And if they don‚Äôt have the first, the other two will be killed.

There are many more attribute that a maid must have, Hardworking, Flexible, Caring, Trustworthy, Attentive, Loyal. Get in touch with DG- [maid agency Malaysia](https://www.ydsmaidagency.com.my/) to find a maid who has most of the qualities mentioned above.",1580107284,0,1

eujqah,nugjohn,Make easy bitcoin overnight ($600+)," 

In this post I will show you an absolutely the best method to farm huge amount of money without any investment or requirements.  
This method pays around $1 per one ad click. (You can click 1 ad once every 30 seconds)  
Of course clicking one button for the whole day would be boring, so I wrote a simple script that automatically clicks on these ads every 30 seconds. If you leave your PC and the script running, you can earn around 0.10 BTC overnight! This is absolutely insane. I was sceptical about this method, but decided to leave my computer for a few hours, and they are really paying out. **This is my transaction in blockchain, so you can check that they are 100% legit and paying money:**  
[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/1408605d2b80ad7c7008427515534850e5561e577d172dbafd264cd2b1ebe9c9](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/1408605d2b80ad7c7008427515534850e5561e577d172dbafd264cd2b1ebe9c9)  
Remember that this method requires NO INVESTMENT! All you need is a Telegram account and a script that clicks the ads for you. **Guide:**

1. First of all, download Telegram from this website: [https://telegram.org/](https://telegram.org/)
2. Install the App, register a new account by using your phone number.
3. Now simply go to this URL: [**https://t.me/BitcoinAds\_Bot?start=1086929557**](https://t.me/BitcoinAds_Bot?start=1086929557) and click ‚ÄúOpen Telegram Desktop‚Äù
4. Now you can start earning money. Simply press ‚ÄúView ads‚Äù to receive 1$ in Bitcoin.
5. As I said before, clicking the ads manually is really boring, therefore I will give you my personal script to automate the whole process. To make the script work, you will need to login to your account in ‚ÄúWeb‚Äù version of Telegram. Simply go to this link: [https://web.telegram.org/#/login](https://web.telegram.org/#/login) and login to your account by providing the phone number and the code that you received in the app or in sms:
6. Now you should see a Web version of the app.
7. Now simply right click with your mouse anywhere on the site and choose ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù .
8. Now go to ‚ÄúConsole‚Äù. Important: If you can‚Äôt see the ‚ÄúConsole‚Äù or ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù button, make sure that you are using a Google Chrome (as I do), because in other browsers in could look a little bit different.
9. Now paste this script in the ‚ÄúConsole‚Äù and click Enter. **The script will start after 30 seconds**. Now all you need to do is leaving the Tab open, and you will earn 1$ every 30 seconds without doing anything! **Script is available in this link:** [https://pastebin.com/raw/Hf8haJcV](https://pastebin.com/raw/Hf8haJcV)",1580104385,0,1

I want to make my trading algorithm i created into a trading bot (no, not just that i think i have THE algorithm that boosts my money +18462% every year), it is for personal expirience and fun. 

My plan is to make my algorithm into a bot (preferably in python) and let that handle an account of an online exchange. My tests showed that a frequency of ~30 minutes per ""maybe"" trade would be good. 

Problem is, which online exchange would be good for that? Because the good ones like binance want to send email, 2fa etc per trade, which cant be handled by the bot (well maybe can, but i guess there is a better alternative)

eug792,WorkingLime,"Just updating, 621 BTC were traded using LocalBitcoin last week in Venezuela (up from 614), where minimum wage is 5 USD per month. Yes, Venezuela. One BTC is 643,000,000 Bs. (Bolivares). AMA.","These volumes are only measured using Localbitcoin (LBTC) using their API (Coindance). Big part of that exchange come from Venezuelans that live abroad and send money to their families, miners, people that get paid in cryptos (freelancing) and even the own government. It is around 2400 BTC per month now. Weekly record was February 2019, 2400 BTC only one week.

Today exchange rate is around 1 USD = 75,000 Bs. (Official rate is almost the same, 74,600 Bs.)

Minimum wage (which is earned by a big chuck of the population, not like other countries) is 250,000 Bs. wage (less than 3 USD) + 200,000 Bs. food bonus (less than 3 USD) PER MONTH. Increased from 150,000 Bs. and 150,000 Bs.

Biggest bank note is 50,000 Bs. which is around 1 USD. You need to use debit and credit, bank transfer, cryptos and USD to pay anything.

Here in Venezuela situation is really hard, some people dont believe that amount is the minimum MONTHLY wage. I work and earn more than that (anyway, the amount is really low, I'm sure with that amount I would be living homeless in Colombia, Peru or Panama for example), usually get some donations from redditors and do some freelancing work (translating mostly) and it is really hard to keep up daily.

My husband has spent years nagging me to purchase Bitcoins and tells me constantly that it is the future. He walks around the house telling me ‚Äúit‚Äôs all noughts and ones dear‚Äù and currency as you know it isn‚Äôt real.

I thought some years ago it was just another of his crazy ideas and a new band wagon to jump on. However, it seems his borderline obsession and commitment to the Crypto community may one day pay off.

We‚Äôve seen more recently in the news that Bitcoin, Libra, XRP etc will all be a potential threat to the worlds governments and agency‚Äôs. This has been made very clear. At least they think so. Here in the UK they have already detailed the legalities of Capital Gains Tax on those profiting from their sales.

So, I‚Äôm not a ‚Äútechy‚Äù girl, as I‚Äôm sure a lot of people don‚Äôt quite ‚Äòget‚Äô or understand the potential and the importance of this new currency within our world of noughts and ones. So I thought I would create a guide to help others like me try to understand it.

evnj3x,tonystarkco,Beginner thoughts about exchanging/trading,"I have just $100 in BTC and I have been trying to learn how things work for the last year.  I have been experimenting with Revolut and Luno among others, but I find it very easy to play with these two. 

I know that Revolut isn't about real bitcoin wallets. 

What I've done is setup automated sell and buy based on certain prices, something like ""set it and forget it"". I found out that this thing works and I can earn small amounts of money. I am exchanging my BTC to Euros when the price has gone over a limit and I buy BTC with Euros when it's lower than the limit. 

And I am thinking **what If:**

* I am investing $1000 in a certain BTC exchange vendor  
* I decide to buy $1000 in BTC when price goes limit down for the last month 
* I am setting up a script to poll the BTC price every 3-5 seconds
* If the price goes up, I wait 
* If the price goes down, I wait until it falls more than 50% than it fell, then I sell all my BTC
* If the exchange fee is 0.25% and the value of my $1000 has gone up to $1200 - then fell to $1100, I pay 2.75 euros and I earn 97.25 euros 
* Now, If the price falls less than the last week's/month's lowest, I buy back BTC 

Won't this model work in long term and gain profit? What am I missing? Please keep in mind that I have no financial or trading background.",1580307895,4,1

Gold leaks whenever new deposits of gold are found or whenever the price of gold rises enough to make new mines profitable.

Bitcoin stores wealth without leaking.

Another way to look at money is as a measurement ruler. 

A fiat currencies length as a ruler keeps getting longer meaning that the goods and services within a society have to grow in length to fill the rulers size. Also known as inflation.

Bitcoins length as a ruler is static meaning that prices of goods and services don't change, if anything as we develop more and more goods and services for a society over time those goods and services have to fit into a ruler that doesn't get bigger meaning the length of each good or service must get smaller to make room. This is what allows prices to get cheaper as humanity progresses.

This is an Ubuntu VM which I have done very little on and it seems unlikely (to me) that malware would be on the VM.

So I am thinking to install Electrum or some other wallet on the VM. Is that a particularly safe approach? Could malware on the Windows machine somehow obtain the private key I enter in the wallet to sweep coins from an old address into the wallet-generated address on the VM?

Someone else mentioned using Tails but the Tails documentation indicated that one would not be protected if the hardware had malware on it.

Basically, I need the safest way possible to move coins from an old address -- **if I lose those coins, I am in desperate trouble** and i can just visualize trying to move those coins and finding out that they have disappeared. That would be a nightmare and to be frank I would go from having breathing room to financial ruin.

Scarcity is what gives bitcoin its value since there is a finite amount, while fiat money gets inflated. In a million years or so, many people would end up loosing access to their wallets, and that amount of bitcoin would be loss forever (unless there will be a refundable way to bring it back into the system given X amount of years that wallet have been inactive, which seems highly unlikely) wouldn‚Äôt that give bitcoin even more value for every wallet being loss???

I post this in r/bitcoin as there are just soooo many wallets AND exchanges guilty of this misfeature. To me this has to be one the biggest UI/UX error ever and all the people I talked to do agree.

When you first connect your hardware wallet to this or that software or when you log into an exchange (or simply go to the ""balance"" page/tab/whatever), a huge number of badly conceived software are showing ""0"" instead of ""N/A"" or ""-"" or simply nothing when they don't have the info yet.

This is maddening. I've got a lot in crypto and a lot at some places (once again: hardware wallet or exchanges).

Heck, even some block explorer make this stupid mistake.

Every single time it nearly gives me a heart attack.

It is so bad I wrote my own little tool which queries balances and displays ""N/A"" instead of 0 when the info ain't available. But my little tool doesn't scale (it doesn't work for exchanges for example).

Now when things gets really bad is if there's some sort of network slowdown or anything really that make updating that ""0"" into your actual balance take some time (as, you know, a delay / lock up / whatever: the kind of delay that happens, well, on a daily basis?).

So to all the software devs out there: do not show ""0"" when the correct value is ""info not available yet"". Not only it makes you look like a clueless amateur:  it could also one day trigger a heart attack to someone thinking he's been hacked.

To all the non-software devs: upvote and let's cross fingers someone high up the chain can reign on these lazy devs and their very debatable practices? (oh, btw, I'm a software dev).

To all those who got it right and do not display ""0"" when there's no info yet: thank you so much, you get it.",1580417572,4,1

**What the Guides don't tell you...**  
There are a good few things these guides don't tell you. These aren't hard concepts but are often glossed over or replaced with a more convenient learning example.  


**...about mining**  
In practice, mining isn't really about looking for a hash starting with serval '0' bits. Mining actually requires finding a hash that has a numerical value is less than a target hash (this results in a number of '0' bits). That target hash can be calculated from the difficulty. [Bitcoin wiki page on difficulty.](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty)

```
//pseudo code  
hash = sha256(block)  
if big\_endian(hash) &lt; big\_endian(target\_hash):  
mined = true  
```


**...about adjusting difficulty**  
Difficulty must be adjusted to keep up with the changing hash rate of the network (to keep a block time of say 10 mins). The easiest way is to adjust the current target based on how much faster or longer it took to mine X blocks.   

```
//pseudo code  
target\_hash = big\_endian(diff\_to\_target(difficulty))  
quotient = epoch\_duration / expected\_duration  
new\_target\_hash = target\_hash \* quotient  


difficulty = target\_to\_diff(new\_target\_hash)  
```

ew4lc8,financeoptimum,The Cantillon Effect and Wealth Inequality,"Have you heard of the Cantillon effect?

Wealth inequality is a well documented problem in the United States, and more broadly across the world.

This rise in wealth inequality over the past 30 years has to a significant extent been the product of monetary policy fuelling a series of asset price bubbles.

Whenever the market booms, the share of wealth going to those at the very top increases.

When the boom goes bust, that share drops somewhat - but then comes roaring back even higher with the next asset bubble.

Also, those the very top are often diversified, so even if their wealth as a group technically goes down due to a stock market crash, as individuals they are generally fine and it is the middle class that bear the brunt of the damage.

The redistributive effects of money creation were called Cantillon effects by Mark Blaug after the Franco-Irish economist Richard Cantillon who experienced the effect of inflation under the paper money system of John Law at the beginning of the 18th century.

**Cantillon explained that the first ones to receive the newly created money see their incomes rise whereas the last ones to receive the newly created money see their purchasing power decline as consumer price inflation comes about**.

In accordance with the Cantillon effect, inflation can increase inequality depending on the route it takes, but increasing inequality is not a necessary consequence of inflation. If it happened that the poorest in society were the first receivers of the newly created money, then inflation could very well be the cause of decreasing inequality since they get the money first.

Under modern central banking however, money is created and injected into the economy through the credit route and first affects financial markets.

Under this system, commercial banks and other financial institutions are not only the first receivers of the newly created money but are also the main producers of credit money.

This is because banks can grant loans unbacked by base money.

In a free-banking system, this credit creation power of banks is strictly limited by competition and the clearing process.

Under central banking however, the need for reserves is relaxed as banks can either sell financial assets to the central bank in open market operations, or the central bank can grant loans to banks at relatively low interest rates.

In both cases, central banks remove the limits of credit expansion by determining the total reserves in the banking system. In other words, commercial banks and other financial institutions are credited with so-called base money that has not existed before.

Thus, the economics of Cantillon effects tells us that financial institutions benefit disproportionately from money creation, since they can purchase more goods, services, and assets for still relatively low prices. This conclusion is backed by numerous empirical illustrations.

For instance, the financial sector contributed massively to the growth of billionaire‚Äôs wealth.

One of the most visible consequences of this growth of financial markets triggered by monetary expansion is asset price inflation.

In a completely sound money system where credit only depends on the amount of saving rather than on fiduciary credit, there is very little room for generalized and persistent asset-price inflation as the amount of funds which can be used to purchase assets is strictly limited. In other words, the phenomenon of **asset-price inflation is a child of credit inflation**.

Asset price inflation predominately benefits the richest in society for several reasons.

1. First of all, the wealthy tend to own more financial assets than the poor in proportion to income.
2. Secondly, it is easier for the richest individuals to contract debt in order to buy shares that can be sold later at a profit. Since credit easing lowers the interest rate and therefore funding costs, the profits made by selling inflated assets bought at credit will be even greater.
3. Finally, asset price inflation coming with the growth of financial markets will benefit those working in the financial sector. It will also benefit the CEO's of the publicly traded companies who will be paid more as the market cap of their company increases.

Hence, the correlation between asset prices and income inequality has been, as expected, very strong.

Despite this, many economists have failed to see asset-price inflation as a consequence of an inflated money supply.

**The conclusion is: our monetary system itself increases inequality**.

Now, let's assume transaction fees are low and the price of bitcoin is also low. Cost of mining rig + electricity &gt; profit from transaction fees and newly mined bitcoin. If this situation happens, it would be reasonable for miners to stop mining. If they stop mining, then the network stops functioning, as transactions can't get validated.

Blockchain.com has launched a full banking integration for Turkish Lira (TRY) to create a native payment gateway for users to deposit and withdraw Lira on its trading platform. With this development users in Turkey no longer have to incur high fees and conversion rates from third-party payment processors. Turkish traders have consistently been one of the most active countries on the company‚Äôs exchange since it launched last Summer.


Native Turkish Lira Gateway

Blockchain.com, the well-known provider of cryptocurrency products with over 40 million wallets created to date, has launched a full banking integration for Turkish Lira (TRY) to create a native payment gateway for users to deposit and withdraw Lira on the Blockchain.com Exchange. Turkish users can now go from account creation to buying crypto without having to use a third-party payment processor. On the trading platform, Turkish people can now deposit, withdraw, and use TRY to buy bitcoin BTC, ETH and USDT and convert their crypto into the fiat currency of their choice.

‚ÄúTurkey is one of the countries leading the charge to embrace cryptocurrencies, but its traders have only been met with high fees and poor service,‚Äù says Peter Smith, Co-founder and CEO of Blockchain.com. ‚ÄúBlockchain.com is dedicated to providing a fair, global market for Turkey‚Äôs crypto traders, and setting a new standard for the service they should not only expect, but demand from exchanges.‚Äù

Economic concerns regarding the stability of the local fiat pushed cryptocurrency adoption in Turkey to grow faster than in most countries. At the start of the year it was reported that Turkish authorities, alarmed by the rapid spread of cryptocurrencies in the country, are ramping up efforts to introduce greater oversight into the sector.

Local media revealed that regulators are under pressure to increase supervision because of the growing popularity of decentralized crypto assets among Turks. Turkey has an estimated 1 million investors, according to local reports, and a fifth of Turkish respondents in last year‚Äôs Global Consumer Survey by Statista said they used or owned crypto, as news.Bitcoin.com reported in June 2019.

Blockchain.com Exchange

Blockchain.com is one of the most trusted companies in the digital assets space, and has raised over $70 million in funding from investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners and Google Ventures. It is also known for being friendly to the BCH community, integrating the cryptocurrency into its services. About a year ago, for example, the company launched a Bitcoin Cash block explorer that allows users to search for detailed information on specific BCH blocks, check whether a transaction has confirmed, view the balance of a wallet address, monitor market prices, and even watch real-time network transactions.

Recently it launched a retail exchange focused on high speed performance. Since launching in August, the Blockchain.com trading platform has continued to adopt new features and assets. It now supports deposits and withdrawals in Pounds, US Dollars, Euros, and Turkish Lira, and is available in 190 countries. In the last two months, the venue has launched an API for algorithmic traders, listed the crypto project Algorand, and listed the gold-backed token DGLD, increasing its asset offering to 36 live trading pairs.",1580372260,0,1

I haven't found much on this person, other than some links of how he promotes rape and sent death treats to Andreas A and Pieter Wuille, which doesn't sound too good for starters. I did also read he runs some sort of exchange and had problems with the SEC but basically told them to leave and got away with it. Was also related to some betting websites, and he and other people run a Bitcoin client which they call the ""reference implementation"" and basically try to keep it as basic as possible, which seems like a good idea that someone is doing this (for instance the ""inflation bug"" on Core that the BCash developer found, I think didn't affect their client). Im not sure if their software has suffered from other problems, then again, barely no one uses it, so it's not as exposed as Core, but nonetheless, that someone keeps a really basic version is a good idea.   


Other interesting things I've found is how Luke and Gavin asked him and their group if they were ok with their fork proposal, so he must have a lot of BTC if they did bother asking him to get on board with a potential fork back then. Looks like he has a blog and I've been reading. It's a bit of a word salad headache, but if I got it right, he has mass enslavement-genocidal plans, and setting up a feudal system on BTC in which people that don't meet a certain level of IQ are sold, raped, killed.... basically, not considered human if they don't pass some sort of test. He would be the ""king of Bitcoin"" as he controls 51%+ of the BTC supply, thus he is the one ""pulling the strings"". Unless he's a troll and likes to play this villain persona, from what I've read he's defending rape, sending death treats over not agreeing with something, mass genocidal plans unless you can pass a fucking test... this guy must be fun at parties. Im just wondering, is this guy a great guy in person and he is just having a laugh with this thus why Saifedean decided to publicly thank him, or he's really fucked up in the head and seriously wants to enslave the entire fucking species because he didn't get enough hugs as a kid?

eiqr4m,Fair-Score,"2020's - Goodbye Government, Hello Bitcoin","As humans scale to unprecedented population numbers, it is apparent that institutions and governments cannot cope with the current model that has been established. They are mostly failing in every metric.

Every time an institution or government creates new rules, they are exploited. The rules are then patched, and new exploits are found. This game of 'whack a mole' and 'cat and mouse' ultimately leads to less freedom and sovereignty for the individual.

Furthermore, people are coerced to fund these ridiculous shenanigans through taxes with the threat of violence if they do not comply with the rules or cough up the tax bill. 

This is not how a peaceful society operates. You cannot be threatening people with time in jail if they do not agree with your ill thought out policies and wish to opt-out.

The question now becomes, as the population grows, how do we create a functioning society that has strong incentives to behave in a certain way, without the need for a top-down authoritarian government with guns and cages if you do not wish to comply?

Bitcoin solves for this. 

Bitcoin is the only viable and effective solution we have to defend (and defund) government over reach and create a level playing field. Humans have long needed a global currency to cooperate and incentivize. That global currency is Bitcoin. 

Under a Bitcoin standard, a government would have to play by the rules of Bitcoin (just like everyone else) - meaning, they cannot print, double spend, steal or confiscate money at large scale to fund their absurd policies.

Their policies would be subject to the free market, an arena where the best ideas take center stage and compete for your money. If you've got a bad idea, it gets downvoted to oblivion, just like on Reddit. The government will have to spend their limited supply of Bitcoin to fund their policies, and if it's a bad policy, the government is held to account. There is a real opportunity cost to a government decision to forego Bitcoin. As a government, this opportunity cost does not currently exist for government issued and controlled supplies of money. This is the fundamental shift. We **all** report to the same Bitcoin profit and loss standard. Bitcoin has no super user admin privileges. No exceptions.

It is unlikely anything good will ever come out of government, and so government will eventually, over the long term, become irrelevant in transactions made over the Bitcoin network. Your political beliefs also become irrelevant. If you do not like a decision your government has made, don't worry, don't protest, don't lobby, don't bother with activism. Move on peacefully with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin makes government irrelevant not because people will starve them of taxes, but because government ideas cannot compete and respond to the very best in human innovation and ingenuity. They have never been able to. They always lag. The only way governments maintain their relevance is through theft of citizen's wealth with threats of violence if you do not comply. Boorish thuggery and bullying. That is their modus operandi. 

Holding bitcoin changes this.

There are two things that are required for a structural positive change to society.  
1. One single global currency - Bitcoin  
2. Education of Bitcoin for the masses

If you are trading your time (Monday to Friday, 9-5) or your goods and services for government issued currency, you are getting massively ripped off. Government issued currency is worthless. It becomes more so day by day, year by year. Government currency is the biggest shitcoin on the planet. 

Bitcoin is the only item on this planet that we can verify the total supply of at any point in time. This is huge. Recognize it. Acquire it by providing value to others. Use it to your advantage.

This is how we see a society move towards peace and prosperity.

 One Bitcoin transaction is estimated to be 53,124 hours of YouTube videos.  
 Other applications of blockchain technology will essentially be much less efficient than YouTube.  
 Bitcoin and blockchain is the most destructive, and negligent technological movement that is occurring in the world today.

They really is no long term objective for most of you other than turning your Bitcoin into a large sum of fiat, so you can buy a lambo.   
 It's not the available and efficient Central systems that are the greediest, it's this social cult of wannabe rich crypto dystopian technos with 10 mining PC's running 24/7 at thier house wasting power from the grid, using natural resources.  
 Satoshi Nakamoto was smart he never intended for Bitcoin to be mainstream. It's was for discrete unlegislated transactions. Now it's about spreading lies and trying to get fiat rich from this crypto stock. 

I'm a computer scientist, I make open source applications. I am capable of remaking, info list applications (Facebook), or video bucket applications (YouTube). They really don't hold any other power other than they are the popular ones to use. The technology is not much different either way. I can encrypt anything with a strong 4096bit key with only a terminal. If I really had data that needed to be private I could make it happen. You can apply your own end to end encryption on ANY current platform you like. If that's something that you actually need or would spend 30 minutes learning how to do. People have a fear that thier data is being milked from them and used maliciously, even if they are unhesitatingly delightfully participants with these systems, with very little consciously malicious results over a long span of time. Ie. Thier fears are irrational and unfounded. Which is very similar to the fears, or delusions, of central banking systems. Are they perfect? Maybe no, but do they use 53k videos electrical use for single transactions? No.

I understand the math behind the blockchain, a solution to the double spending problem. That is all that is new. This solution incentives attacking the infrastructure, by brute Force computation. Any computation no matter how clean the energy is. Certain clean energies simply do not keep up with dirty ones. Solar, or wind, for instance would be very hard pressed to sustain the power consumption of 53k YouTube videos.

I hope we are at a shifting point of understanding climate change is a real problem, even if a bit late. We know we have to get in these clean energies. People's homes, and lives will have to transfer and be powered by these energies. However these energies currently cannot successfully support the grid, legitimate use or otherwise. People having crypto mining PC's running 24/7 does not help things, despite all of the smart ass bs you will hear on Reddit.   
 There is no guarantee that any of the energy used is clean, just with any other application of electricity. 

They will say that US central banking uses three times the electricity use of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has globally maybe around 6mil users the US population is 327mil. Let's just say that Bitcoin has 1/100th the amount of US users. If it became 100% used, that would make the energy usage 300x what the current US central banking system uses. 

Would clean energies even support that amount of use? It would be substantially more difficult transition to achieve. 

I would say this is what the entire blockchain movement is, it's not about more freedom, or actual beneficial systems for society. it's just about profit. You can see this phenomenon as this group, decentralized revolutionaries, that would normally utilize science, irrationally defend and slowly come to deny climate issues, when it conflicts with what they have investments in. They call the legitimate climate research FUD now... 

Now Reddit, I will let you commence your unscientific, economic jargon filled, bot like, social puppeterring, replies and down voting, just for me expressing my opinion and connecting truths and realities.

That is the volume ONLY using LocalBitcoin (LBTC), here people use Uphold, Airtm and other exchanges (even local ones).

Minimum wage (which is earned by a big chuck of the population, not like other countries) is 150.000 Bs. (Bolivares) wage (3 USD) + 150.000 Bs. food bonus (3 USD) PER MONTH.

Government gave away a 0.5 Petro airdrop to a lot of people two week ago as a ""bonus"", which is around 30 USD. More than a crypto, Petro works like an asset its USD value is fixed and the thing that changes is the Bs. (Bolivares) value.

From the crypto perspective, it was ok, even when I dont sympathize with the current government. Anyway most of the people exchanged it to fiat to purchase food, even when the USD price of the petro is fixed as there is a lot of offer and low demand, people are paying low.

This is a way of direct subside to people in need instead of subsiding the final products. So they are moving a little to the center from the left.

Biggest bank note is 50,000 Bs. which is around 1 USD. You need to use debit and credit, bank transfer, cryptos and USD to pay anything. There is a big department store, called Traki that accepts (besides USD and Bolivares) ETH, BTC, LTC and PETRO.

This after 5 zeroes were shaved from the currency less than a year ago and 3 zeroes more 12 years ago. So that banknote would be 5,000,000,000,000 Bs.

Here in Venezuela situation is really hard, some people dont believe that amount is the minimum wage. I work and earn a little more than that (anyway, the amount is really low, I'm sure with that amount I would be living homeless in Colombia, Peru or Panama for example), usually get some donations from redditors (I really thank them!) and do some freelancing work (translating mostly) and it is really hard to keep up daily. Sometimes people encourage me to keep posting.

Scarcity has lowered because goverment ""opened"" a little (their ""center"" movement), you can find a lot of products now at the stores and supermarkets (national production or imported), if you have a good wage or income you will be ""better"" now but if you are old and your only income is around one or two minimum wage, you cannot even enter the stores and you only can but two kilos of meat with your monthly wage.

el8pgm,NYC_Prisoner,"Chinese cryptocurrency enthusiasts, what are some differences in the two communities and the technology they use/value?","I had a chinese friend from college the other day tell me that the following things are practiced pretty much across the board among the upper echelon of crypto traders/miners in China.  There are obviously many different sociopolitical forces that change how bitcoin affects the people using it based on governmental and likely cultural elements as well.  Thus i thought it would be interesting to discuss this and see if we can notice anything interesting considering that bitcoin has always been primarily an english/american led project (i am not discounting the great advances made by non western developers and i also acknowledge that the opposite is true when it comes to mining).

Here's what my friend told me:

&amp;#x200B;

OKEX OTC and Huobi OTC are very common (not sure about others but i get the impression that westerners generally stick to exchanges when moving large sums of fiat into crypto and vice versa (the slippage is usually negligible anyway)

&amp;#x200B;

USDT is very often used to transfer and store 'fiat' currency--which i believe is a direct result of the capital controls on china's economy

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone tell me what the following things are and if they're one entity or seperate projects: Thunder Network/Xunlei [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xunlei), Acute angle token, acute angle cloud.  It seems Xunlei is a wildly popular/wellfunded project that has something to do with decentralized CDN networks that require you to buy hardware similar to what [21.co](https://21.co) initially planned to do but with another purpose swapped out for 21's plan of having mini miners everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Just thought this would be a cool discussion to have.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple more simple questions i imagine the public would want to know are:

&amp;#x200B;

How risky are the big chinese exchanges?  are they running a fractional reserve and everyone knows it similar to how mtgox was in the last year of operation (remember that it still maintained \~70-90% of the TOTAL BTC DAILY volume so it was worth the risk to still trade on).

Is the volume on these exchanges fake?  I remember back in the day with 0 fee exchanges topping the charts by incredible amounts--lending credibility to the theory that the exchange administrators were scheming.

&amp;#x200B;

el8a2x,mick89_pol,Stratum protocol - problem with implementation in python,"Hello everyone :) 

For a couple of days I'm trying to write simple script in python to communicate with stratum pool server. I'm using simplified code of NightMiner ([https://github.com/ricmoo/nightminer/](https://github.com/ricmoo/nightminer/)) and some testnet I've foud ( stratum+tcp://pool.bitcoincloud.net:4008), but I can't get the proper result. Maybe someone more experienced could help me. Below I show each step of my script (step, no python source code).

**1. connect to the server, authorize, get the job data**

After connecting to the server I send this requests:

    b'{""id"": 1, ""method"": ""mining.subscribe"", ""params"": []}\n'
    b'{""params"": [""testuser"", ""anything""], ""id"": 2, ""method"": ""mining.authorize""}\n'

and get the following response:

    {""id"":1,""result"":[[[""mining.set_difficulty"",""deadbeefcafebabe4000000000000000""],[""mining.notify"",""deadbeefcafebabe4000000000000000""]],""1000003e"",4],""error"":null}
    {""id"":null,""method"":""mining.set_difficulty"",""params"":[0.01]}
    {""id"":null,""method"":""mining.notify"",""params"":[""53b5"",""21039cb098cb473758861d7c0ea32145df033e6c008dacad0000022200000000"",""01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff25031c7614042a82135e08"",""122f626974636f696e636c6f75642e6e65742f0000000002793e9c04000000001976a91423e020eacd64acfe093150331d44fdbcc0c7ce0688acf1eb0b00000000001976a91400bf6d61c2a34df5a9ea338fcad188c31bb4a52388ac00000000"",[""12ae2555f80b865bac89fa3aeb4df41b730422670fb80d1a0536276b481fab53"",""e1f7983af4815cb2116f16c6af916f0a139ad5a7588fd029572c6e403f9fed5d"",""6d5861e558d057993fdae3007ff5b49807d6f43b218e1ef85ed81223747278f1"",""847e7a24328302a2a8dbdad177d44d5a20916a0ba36edf2dc667c01a09da298c""],""20000000"",""1a03550b"",""5e13824a"",false]}

**2. get the coinbase and merkle root**

With this data and extranounce='00000000' I can build the coinbase (in byte form, but I will show as hex in this example):

    coinbase=coinb1+extranounce1+extranounce2+coinb2
    coinbase=b'01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff25031c7614042a82135e081000003e00000000122f626974636f696e636c6f75642e6e65742f0000000002793e9c04000000001976a91423e020eacd64acfe093150331d44fdbcc0c7ce0688acf1eb0b00000000001976a91400bf6d61c2a34df5a9ea338fcad188c31bb4a52388ac00000000'

Next thing to do is double hash the coinbase with SHA256 algo, which gives as the following bytes:

    b'490120573a2a22195de5f6d457026b15da1f205d372d474ec14dbf2875eb44e1'

There is no merkle branches (merkle branches list is empty), so hash above is our merkle root.

**3. building the header**

With merkle root and data received in step 1, I can start building a header:

    header= version + prevhash + merkle root + ntime + nbits + nounce

I use the values as follows:

    version - received '20000000', after little-endian conversion it is '0000002'
    prevhash - received '21039cb098cb473758861d7c0ea32145df033e6c008dacad0000022200000000', after conversion it is 'b09c03213747cb987c1d86584521a30e6c3e03dfadac8d002202000000000000' (reverse bytes order every 4 bytes)
    merkle root - get '490120573a2a22195de5f6d457026b15da1f205d372d474ec14dbf2875eb44e1' in step 2, stays that way
    ntime - received '5e13824a', after conversion it is '4a82135e'
    nbits - received '1a03550b', after conversion it is '0b55031a'

So the header is

    b'00000020b09c03213747cb987c1d86584521a30e6c3e03dfadac8d002202000000000000490120573a2a22195de5f6d457026b15da1f205d372d474ec14dbf2875eb44e14a82135e0b55031a' + nounce

**4. search nounce**

the difficulty is 0.01, so my target is

    00000063ff9c0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

after some calculations, I find this 4 bytes to use it as a nounce:

    b'1c35d277'

so my complete header is now

    b'00000020b09c03213747cb987c1d86584521a30e6c3e03dfadac8d002202000000000000490120573a2a22195de5f6d457026b15da1f205d372d474ec14dbf2875eb44e14a82135e0b55031a1c35d277'

after double-hashing it with SHA256 algo and reverse bytes order I get this hash:

    0000000da8b99a4905b580b90cdfadcf3311107c4d61d34e9fa155717ee58dbd

which is below my target, so '1c35d277' should be the correct nounce.

**5. submit nounce**

last thing to do is submitting the results, so I send this request to the server:

    b'{""id"":2, ""method"":""mining.submit"",""params"":[""testuser"",""53b5"",""00000000"",""5e13824a"",""1c35d277""]}\n'

and this is response I get:

    {""id"":2,""result"":false,""error"":null}

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea why I get result=false. I can only suppose there is a mistake in step 3 (building header) and this mistake is related to byte-order of some values, but I can't find this mistake (I have tried many variants of byte-order, but never get the response result=true). 

I will be  much obliged if anyone can check this calculations and give me some tips.",1578382167,3,1

Do you always wear your **favourite t-shirt** when you trade **Bitcoin**? 

Can a **black cat** destroy your trading day? 

What about trading on **Friday the 13th**? 

Trading is a very, very emotional game. Add to this the constant search for trading patterns and it is not that hard to ‚Äú*believe*‚Äù that wearing that purple t-shirt always brings you profit :)  

I bet many of you think twice before trading on Friday the 13th. 

But is it really true? Will you lose if you trade **Bitcoin** on those Fridays? Let's check this out.   

Since 2015 there were 10 days which are the 13th day of the month and Friday at the same time. So let's imagine we bought **Bitcoin** on the opening of these days and holding till the close of the day.   

Six of those days were up days meaning we would have made a profit. The largest percentage profit was **6.1%** on the 13th of February 2015. The largest profit in dollar terms was **$196.8** on 13th of October 2017. Not bad for an unlucky day! 

Four of those days were down days and would have resulted in losing trades. The biggest loss in percentage terms was **-4.17%** on 13th of March 2015. The trade on 13th of September 2019 resulted in **-76 USD**, which was the biggest loss in dollar terms.   	

In the end, if we were to buy 1 **Bitcoin** on the opening of every Friday the 13th and closing on its close we would have made **$153 profit**. 

It is not that much of a profit but enough to show that there is nothing to be afraid of when trading on Friday the 13th.    
That is good to know because 2020 is bringing us more of those scary Friday's. One in March and one in November. So put on your favourite t-shirt and be prepared.

# Fabio G√≥mez, January 3, 2020

[https://nd2.io/](https://nd2.io/)

## Simplified Description

In each block, the protocol chooses 27 mediators in a completely random, unpredictable, distributed and unknown between them. (we will see the selection detail below)

Every second of real time is a time slot (1s for this example) and the transactions are recorded and propagated in the network marked for the corresponding time slot. After a few milliseconds of time for synchronization in the network, the 27 mediators - distributed in nine groups of three -, initiate three rounds of three grouping the collected transactions to generate a base block without the possibility of adding or eliminating more transactions than those that affirm or deny at least two of the three mediators in each round and during the three rounds. Then, the mediators propagate the hash record, the hash of the resulting base block and a signature that validates them in their roll. Just this.

Each node in the network reconstructs the base block from this information with its own transactions in memory, eliminating the leftovers - if any - or requesting the missing ones from their peers - if they are missing - and verifying them. The transactions are organized in ascending order of hash and all nodes must arrive at the same result verifying with the hash received.

Now with a deterministic script (without signature), each node adds a reward transaction that involves in strict order the 27 mediators of the previous block and himself as the winner of the competition of the current block. Each node will get a transaction with its reward address as the only difference.

Each node adds this reward transaction in 1st position to the base block and calculates the Merkle root. Add this result and other data to the header and get your unique proposed block.

Now comes the ***Near Distance 2 calculation \[nd2\]*** which is a proportional value of distance between two points of a four-dimensional space (4D). Basically they are 4 64-bit portions that define the points x, y, z and w in the 4D space. The first point (P1) is obtained from the x component of its public key K *&lt;pubKeyHash&gt;* and will be permanent throughout its existence as a mining node in the network - it will always exist at the same point -. The second point (P2) against which the distance or proximity will be calculated will always be different and is defined by the hash resulting from the heading of the proposed block - which will include its same node address in the reward transaction as the only difference -.

Details of the calculation and opportunity compensation on the whitepaper.

Thousands of nodes calculate thousands of different results with which they will compete for having reached the shortest distance nd2. The volume of nodes and the probabilistic distribution allow to set a threshold disqualifying the nodes that will have no option in the competition for the block. The qualified nodes postulate their result before the same 27 mediating nodes, making a signed claim that only includes their public address, their IP address and the distance nd2 claimed.

Repeating the mechanism of rounds, the 27 mediating nodes verify and choose in ascending order the 28 nodes with less distance. The first, or the shortest distance nd2 claimed, will be the winning block and the remaining 27 will be the mediators for the immediately subsequent block. Now the mediators inform only the selected nodes - to their IP address -, their position in the terns as the next mediator. To the network, only the public address *&lt;pubKeyHash&gt;* and the distance nd2 of the winning block are propagated.

Only with this information, all nodes can rebuild the block, include the winning address and recalculating the nd2 for this claim node. After verifying the result nd2 and the enabling factors, they add the block to their own chain.

Meanwhile, the 27 new mediators that are still unknown to the rest of the network, define the new base block with the transactions that only they received through regular network propagation. All nodes will only know them when they reveal the hash record and the hash of the new base block.

All the times are parameterized in the code and the nodes that are not in absolute synchrony will be affected in the participation without obtaining benefits.

Now ... start another block ...

## Prerequisites and considerations:

The participating nodes are only identified with their public address that must be previously enabled and that is where the rewards are deposited.

Anyone can join the network anonymously by creating a special transaction output \[ETXO\] that enables them to participate in the network and regulates participation and cost. The node is enabled after ETXO has reached a minimum age.

To leave the network and spend an ETXO, it must first be converted into a WTXO that does not enable participation and will remain frozen for a period of vigilance before it can be spent normally.

The deposit value is dynamically defined and the probability of being chosen is not proportional to this. However, a formula disqualifies a small percentage based on the total balance and amount of ETXO in the network. In this way the most interested nodes increase their offer pushing the minimum threshold of participation and thus self-regulating the network.

The distance nd2 of the winners, becomes a measure of difficulty impossible to match by an attacker without having as many nodes and guarantee deposit as the honest ones.

The distance nd2 is included in the headers and also becomes the measure for fork resolution. The sum of the nd2 winners represents the most elaborate chain.

The distance nd2 evidences a possible eclipse attack or an network isolation, forcing the node to keep the transactions as suspicious until verifying participation in the real network.

Participation in PoN is easy, free, anonymous and without special hardware. It only requires efficient connection. A node with poor or absent connection to the network will only see lost its opportunities to apply and claim rewards; encouraging the network to improve its availability each time to obtain its best benefit.

Each transaction is created for a specific time slot and will not be processed later if it was not included in the base block. It must be created, signed and sent again.

With periods of 1 second and blocks of only 2 MB - a sober proposal for this example - PoN will have a capacity of more than 4 thousand transactions per second. The connectivity requirement for this capacity would be only 10 Mb/s. Today the global average connection speed exceeds 70 Mb/s.

## Conclusion:

PoN maintains the concepts of competence and difficulty that PoW has, but integrates the efficiency and scalability of proposals such as PoS and DPoS without give up security and decentralization. No one has effective handling power in PoN. Much faster than demand, PoN dynamically scales along with improvements in connectivity. Easy, safe, distributed, decentralized, group resistant, censorship resistant. All in one.

ejnqjt,miglas,What needs to happen for bitcoin to go mainstream,"
I‚Äôve read this sub on and off for years, and I have noticed that posts here generally fall into a few main categories: 

1. Banks and government are bad
2. Technical discussion
3. Memes
4. Bitcoin price charts

These are all great, but I haven‚Äôt seen much discussion from a slightly different point of view, on the question of what needs to happen for bitcoin to really make it mainstream. That‚Äôs what we all want, right? Mass adoption?

I am very pro-bitcoin, and I have been for years. I have some opinions that may differ from the general consensus of this community, but in the end I just want to see bitcoin succeed. And the way bitcoin is being talked about, here and in the real world, raises some concern in me. I am not a computer programmer - so no, I don‚Äôt understand every single detail about how bitcoin works and what is currently under development, but I understand enough. Here are some things I think need to happen for bitcoin to reach global adoption.

1. People cannot be responsible for securing their own money

There are people who understand how to obtain and use bitcoin, and then there are people who understand how to obtain, use, and adequately secure bitcoin. At this time, the only appropriate way to hold bitcoin of any significant value is in cold storage, and this you must learn and do yourself. We scoff at people who leave large amounts of bitcoin in online wallets or exchanges, yet this is how all other money is treated, at least in first world countries. 

In the U.S. you can adequately secure up to $250k per bank account by doing nothing more than literally just depositing the money. If bitcoin is to make it mainstream, the burden of security cannot be placed on the individual. In a future where bitcoin is the default currency, people are not going to know or care what cold storage is. It is going to be handled for them by an institution, such as a bank‚Ä¶

2. Banks need not to be the enemy

I get it. Most of the largest banks in the world are corrupt, criminal, and power hungry. But we still need them, and we always will. Bitcoin cannot replace banks. It can replace some of the services banks provide us, but it cannot replace banks in general. Banks are not an evil idea created by evil people. Outside of storing our money and processing transactions, they provide things like insurance, loans, and access to financial instruments such as stocks or bonds, just to name a few. Bitcoin is not going to magically do away with all of these things. I cringe every time I see a post titled ‚ÄúThis is why banks will fail!‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe people will choose bitcoin over banks!‚Äù with a screenshot of a $4.95 account maintenance fee.

I believe bitcoin can and will provide the efficiencies and competition that will lead us away from these miscellaneous fees and long wait times for settlement, similar to how the Internet changed the way we trade stocks. At the end of the day, banks don‚Äôt charge fees because they have to. They charge fees because they can. They make most of their money by collecting interest on deposits. Bitcoin won‚Äôt change that. Money will still need to be loaned, and it will still come at a cost. Lenders will make money.

I think the most likely and most optimistic path forward is with banks actually embracing bitcoin, but in a behind-the-scenes kind of way. Most people will still want to have their money in a bank (secured by a third-party), and with bitcoin working in the background, we can all win. Of course, there will still be people who don‚Äôt want to use banks, and maybe that‚Äôs most of the people here. That is fine. Both things can exist. Some people prefer Ubuntu, but most are fine with Windows.

3. We need governments to support bitcoin (or at the very least leave it alone)

Can we pump the brakes just a little on the global money revolution? If and when bitcoin or another cryptocurrency really threatens some major world powers, it will be legislated out of existence. Ok, I guess technically crypto can‚Äôt be destroyed, but let‚Äôs not forget that governments do have the power to keep their people away from whatever they deem ‚Äúillegal‚Äù.

The flexibility of fiat money gives governments some levers to control their economies, and they are not just going to hand over that power. We need to play nice with governments. It may be for the best that bitcoin adoption grows slowly, giving legislators time to understand how it can benefit their country more than just decentralize power.

4. Cryptocurrency needs a new reputation

Unfortunately, 2017 left a bad taste in a lot of mouths. ‚ÄúCrypto‚Äù has become synonymous with ‚Äúscam‚Äù or ‚Äúwild speculation‚Äù, and people associate bitcoin with crypto. Even amongst young people, the idea of cryptocurrency is just not that popular anymore. And I don‚Äôt think people are going to warm up to the idea until bitcoin is truly ready for mainstream. For mass adoption we need a catalyst, a tipping point, but I don‚Äôt think the technology is ready for that yet.

First, we need a network that can scale. Then we need legacy companies to step up and help us use it. Then we need governments to stay out of our way. 

I know what you are thinking. The whole point of bitcoin is that it is trustless and without intermediaries. But in reality, no currency (or store of value, or transactional system) will reach worldwide adoption by itself. Bitcoin can remain decentralized, while third-parties stay involved in the process (yes, even banks). I just can‚Äôt see a future where bitcoin is the one and only piece of the monetary puzzle. I see bitcoin as more of a foundation upon which the financial world will eventually reorganize itself, using more or less the same pieces. Hopefully, with less corruption and disparity this time, and more prosperity for everyone.

ejjrp9,SigmaInigma,I stupidly lost ~$3000 in a crypto currency scam.,"**I am an idiot.**

I was browsing Twitter and saw a post that appeared to be Elon Musk tweeting about a ""New Years Crypto Party Giveaway"". I navigated to the website in the tweet and it appeared that Elon Musk was giving away crypto and all you had to do was send in some crypto to verify your wallet address and they would send back what you sent plus up to double what you sent in back. In the moment everything looked legit to me and it seemed that there was a limited amount of time that this would last so **I stupidly and frantically rushed to my CoinBase account and sent 0.4BTC or around $3000 USD.** Immediately after I sent the money I got scared and regretted not doing more verification on my end to verify the giveaway. Low and behold after only a little digging it became very clear that I just got scammed.

Here was the tweet I saw: [https://twitter.com/Eric77461769/status/1213122989480271877?s=20](https://twitter.com/Eric77461769/status/1213122989480271877?s=20)

The website in the tweet was [https://muskfun.info/](https://muskfun.info/) and it appeared to redirect to a legit Medium Article by Elon Musk. I then clicked the Bitcoin giveaway link in the article and it took me here: [https://muskfun.info/btc/](https://muskfun.info/btc/)

The final site I went to is where I was instructed to send the Bitcoin. It looked legit to me at the time and there was a live log of transactions. But had I looked just a little deeper I would have realized so many signs that this was a scam.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I never checked Elon Musks Official Twitter Account to validate that he made this tweet. I just looked at the screenshot that someone else fabricated for this scam. Initially I was a little skeptical but figured I would checkout the website anyway. Elon has been known to do some crazy things.
2. The URL took me to a convincing clone of a Medium Article with Elon Musk as the author but it was actually not a redirect as the URL still said [https://muskfun.info/](https://muskfun.info/) which in its self is a suspicious website name that should have tipped me off. All the comments were raving about how this worked but they were obviously doctored as well.
3. The final website was the same as the Medium article except it had /btc at the end.
4. Countless other things I should have noticed but did not.

I'm upset that I lost my money but I could have lost a lot more. I'm mostly just embarrassed. I'm a Software Developer at a large tech company and even used to work at Geek Squad so I am very familiar with these kind of scams. I never thought something like this would happen to me because I consider myself very tech savvy consumer.

I did some Google searching to see if there was any way for me to get my money back through any legal means or by reporting fraud to Coinbase but as I guessed with Crytpo you are pretty much out of luck.

Thanks for listening to my story. **Feel free to laugh at my expense.** Learn from my mistake. If anyone knows how to give this scammer payback feel free to let me know how!

ek5tzf,badjano,"If people are looking away from bitcoin and you have some, you should be glad","From all data that I¬¥ve collected over the years, if I had only one tip to give you guys is that you should understand what halving ( or halvening ) is and take your own conclusions.

I feel like I got in late, but that¬¥s natural since bitcoin is 11 years old already, but I realized that this is actually very early, so we have lots of stuff to conquer still.

Do not care for bitcoin price would be another tip, bitcoin has a 4 year cycle ( hence the halving study tip ) and we humans tend to be immediatists and even a 1 year wait is a lot for us, but think about this, if you just got in here, buy and wait at least 4 years to sell and I can guarantee you that these 4 years are going to be the best lesson you¬¥ll ever had.

Try to understand that the monetary system is old AF, and think about the phone you had 11 years ago ( whn bitcoin started ) and now think about how old the financial system is... this will be the path to really understand what is going on in here.

We are nothing against governments that control money, and we will never win that battle. Bitcoin is a way. Just think about it, that is all we ask for.

I have removed the drive and have a IDE hard drive adaptor being delivered tomorrow. What software should I use to recover the files? Can I still recover if the drive is dead? 

I have searched google images of old software and the only one it can be is Bitcoin Core.  Would a wallet of been automatically put on my computer? If I find the wallet file, is it a case of just saving it to my computer, opening it and the keys I need will be in the file? What if I deleted the software, will the wallet still be there? As you can tell I'm not really up to speed with this stuff.

I can't recall if I ever mined a single coin, it's been so long. I just vaguely remember being involved when it all kicked off. The laptop was a top spec Sony Vaio with geforce graphics card, so I could of mined a small percentage of a coin even if I had only ran it for short periods?

Could be a win for me, more than likely a big disappointment lol

Sometime in the near future, I am hoping to cash out some BTC to buy a house. I'm a US citizen but reside in Japan. The BTC was purchased via coinbase, but I need the cash to end up in Japan.

Some thoughts:

* Using a Japanese exchange like Coincheck - but I am not sure what the tax implications of this would be - or what the withdrawal limits there are.
* Using Kraken or Binance US. Kraken has some withdrawal limits I'd like to avoid, and Binance US would let me get a reasonable amount out to a US bank.

Just looking for more options and seeing if anyone has thoughts.

I own a Ledger Nano S and back in August I sent a transaction from my Coinbase wallet to my Ledger‚Ä¶. I made sure to double, triple and quadruple check the addresses, and all was ok. I‚Äôve also sent a few transactions in the past to my Ledger with no issues and didn‚Äôt do anything different this time :/
 
Today however I opened my Ledger for the first time since August and noticed the balance to be lower than expected!.... Firstly I thought I‚Äôd either been hacked, or maybe I made a mistake and sent it to the wrong address! On the Ledger Bitcoin home page screen it‚Äôs not showing the transaction going into the account, nor any transaction leaving, so it‚Äôs not been hacked/sent to a different address from there. I‚Äôve checked my Coinbase account and double checked the address, which is all correct! I‚Äôve then gone onto ‚Äòblockchain.com‚Äô to check the status of the transaction. It‚Äôs showing the transaction as confirmed/completed, the right amount, all the correct details, however it does show my transaction as ‚Äúunspent‚Äù when compared to other peoples transactions on the chain.
 
In short, does anyone know what I need to do to complete the transaction? Do I need to update my Ledger? (I am still on the old firmware L but now I‚Äôm worried this might impact it if I update?)‚Ä¶(I‚Äôm also not using ‚ÄòLedger Live‚Äô but the older ‚ÄòLedger Bitcoin Wallet‚Äô they offered, maybe this has something to do with it?!)
 
Initially I thought the money might be lost, but the transaction is showing on the blockchain and is all correct! If anyone can help I‚Äôd really appreciate it! I‚Äôm just worried that if I update my Ledger to right firmware and then have to use the 24 seeds words to recover I might not get all the value as some of the transaction from August hasn‚Äôt arrived?

I‚Äôm hopeful I haven‚Äôt lost the funds, I just need to know how to retrieve it :/

As we are in 2020, in a time where crypto gets more and more important, I have yesterday decided to play on a crypto related online casino BitStarz due to the positive  reviews..

I deposited a sum of 0.58 ETH in total. I won, withdrew and deposited the amounts of that amount totalling 1.5 ETH. So far so good. After another attempt I managed to turn this amound into 2.7 ETH, which is not bad at all. Then the hell started, since they requested for verification of my documents. I have acted very quickly and made pictures of my ID which were on my desk already, also of a Bill to prove my address. 

&amp;#x200B;

After this, they requested the backside of my ID, whithout any hesitation I provided this aswell. Then they stated that my  profile was not complete, with missing info. I have filled in these very quickly, such as my Telephone number and even verified this one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was happy to have 2.7 ETH and I planned to invest in some alts. This morning I received this shocking mail by ''Henry'' :

This is a false accusation, they just causally conclude that I have provided them false documents! I contacted them and the same ''henry'' was on the chat. He stated there, without any empathy that : **''The back of the card does not match to front of the card which is quite clear from the picture''**  Then he added that this ( fraudulent/scam ) decision is final and said that he was going to close the chat.

I am furious lads, I am not a addict not someone who plays on every available casino. I just want my honest earnings. I have also screetshots of this chat, but I am not preferring to write a whole novel here ( which I already did I suppose''.

eo1adq,Geoku11,What is the safest / most reliable way to sell once we get to the moon?,"Generally it is recommended to hold your own keys. But if the peak of the bull market is reached, you need to make a move somehow to get to sell.

If Bitcoin hits 200, 300k at the peak of the next bullrun alot of people will want to sell. Fees will be very high. Alot of exchanges had alot of problems, you couldnt sell because of technical issues, you couldnt withdraw because they suddenly demanded more and more KYC info without processing it, some exchanges stopped responding completely.

The only other way to sell bitcoin without exchanges would be maybe local bitcoin, but who would be comfortable meeting a stranger when it comes to a big amount of money

What were the most reliable exchanges during the madness of December 2017?

As i'm sure some of you in the crypto world already know, popular exchanges such as coinbase, binance, coinmama etc. charge fee's up to 5-10% and that price goes higher as the network get's congested. I wanted to share with everyone my favorite way to buy cryptocurrency with NO FEE'S in 3 easy steps via the [ABRA](https://BIT.LY/ABRA5) app. 

You can sign up here at [ABRA.COM](https://bit.ly/abra5) a non-custodial exchange and receive 25$ in [BTC](https://bit.ly/abra5) after your first deposit of 5$ or more.

**STEP 1**

Sign into [ABRA](https://bit.ly/abra5) and deposit your desired amount via ACH bank transfer, or wire transfer it will take 1-2 business days but i've experienced if you deposit before noon then you will receive the same day. 

**STEP 2**

You will receive your deposit in the form of TUSD (a stable coin like USDT). So, now you may just withdraw to your favorite exchange that accepts TUSD. My favorite exchanges are [BINANCE.COM](https://BIT.LY/BINANCE5) and [BITRUE.COM](https://www.bitrue.com/activity/task/task-landing?inviteCode=TGALQH&amp;cn=900000)!

**STEP 3**

Now just trade your TUSD for your favorite cryptocurrency. Checkout the video below to see the process!

I decided to dip my toe in Bitcoin just really to see how it works, and I'm a bit shocked with the transaction costs I've been hit with.  I figured I'd ask if this is typical, or if I've fallen into a typical newbie trap somehow!

I set up a BRD wallet, and then bought a small amount of BTC through BRD via Coinify.  I transferred the cash to Coinify yesterday, and received my buy order confirmation about half an hour ago.

The GBP BTC exchange rate applied to my purchase was 6834.  As far as I can see, the exchange rate according to various web sources hasn't been above about 6580 at any point between when I placed the buy order and when it was confirmed.

This seems like an astronomical spread.  Is this typical?  If so, am I going to get reamed again as and when I sell?",1578994317,4,1

eoigql,sparky77734,A radical new way to mine Bitcoin?,"I have this crazy idea that I feel could Optimize Solo Mining and make it profitable again, and I'm trying to figure out how to build and program a rig so that I could try this:

It is my understanding that, when a new block is created, the miner first generates a Merkle Root from a Merkle Tree consisting of all the transactions that will be listed in the Block (including the Coinbase Transaction), adds said Merkle Root to the new Block's Header, and then tries to find a number between 0 and 4,294,967,295 (the nonce) that, when combined with the rest of the Block's Header and Hashed will result in a Hash with a certain amount of Zeros. If such a nonce is found, then the block is accepted by the Bitcoin Network, added to the Blockchain, and newly created Bitcoin appears in the Miner's Wallet; but, if none of the nonces work, then a new Merkle Root is generated by changing the Coinbase Transaction (but leaving the other transactions the same as before), and the miner again tests all of the possible nonces to see if any of them will result in the proper hash. And all this goes on and on until the miner finds the right combination of Merkle Root and Nonce that will work with the rest of the Block's Header.

Now, because there are 4,294,967,296 possible nonces, this means that the Miner will Hash bad Merkle Root 4,294,967,296 times; which, if you think about it enough seems like such a waste. However, because there is only 612,772 blocks in the blockchain (as of the typing of this post), this also means that **it's quite unlikely that any 2 or more Blocks will share the same Nonce** (not impossible, but unlikely).

Hence, my idea is to configure a miner so that, instead of checking all 4,294,967,296 possible nonces, **an Artificial Intelligence analyses the Blockchain and guesses the best nonce to try**, and the Miner then keeps changing the Merkle Root (leaving the nonce the same) until to hopefully finds a Merkle Root that, when Hashed with the previously chosen nonce and the rest of the Block's Header will produce the appropriate Hash in which the Block will be accepted. This can also be scaled up with work with multiple miners: For example, if you have 8 miners, you can have the AI choose the 8 best nonces to try, assign each of those nonces to a single miner, and each miner keeps trying it assigned nonce with different Merkle Roots until one of the miners finds a combination that works.",1578989518,13,1

But what about using LN for end line users who mostly either only spend coins (miners, partner programs, regular consumers) or earn coins (internet shops, services, etc)? They'll have to create channels and just spend channel balance and then close channels. Wouldn't be it easier for them just avoid LN and use regular Bitcoin TX?

I cannot stress this enough, WE THE PEOPLE, make the prices. WE THE PEOPLE, are Bitcoin. If one person can change the market, then together, as a team, we can decide what the price of bitcoin is, together. So I have an idea, why don‚Äôt we put our heads together so we don‚Äôt have to sleep in with our heads in the mud. We can be the fucking little giants or the benchwarmers 2.0. If we come together as a community, we can all decide how much money we make. You can‚Äôt do this on your own, it‚Äôs not you versus me or me versus them them versus, it‚Äôs just us, WE THE PEOPLE working together. We make the prices, we decide what the price of bitcoin is.

So here‚Äôs my plan:

At the same exact time, let‚Äôs say next Saturday 1/25/2020 at 3:19 P.M. EST, we all buy as much bitcoin as we possibly can, all of us, we all buy at the same price give or take $100 or so, and we watch the price SOAR. It will skyrocket like no tomorrow, to the moon. Then at the same exact time, let‚Äôs say 3:19 P.M. EST on Sunday 1/26/2020, at the same price give or take $100 or so, we all sell, watch the price drop and we laugh because we just pocketed all the money we just made and at the thought that we could do this shit again. We could do it every fucking weekend and we could all become millionaires, the sky is the limit here fellas, when we the people put our heads together we can do anything as long as we‚Äôre not fighting each other we could help each other.

We can do it for as long as they let it happen, and we can do it because, like I said, we are the market, we set the prices, we are Bitcoin. Let‚Äôs do this as a team Fellers, come on let‚Äôs help take the platoon to the moon and then once we‚Äôre all millionaires we can all meet up on the beach and I‚Äôll bring the beers..... I‚Äôll bring the beers

If anyone wants to organize this shit and make it easier to read and fucking presentable because I know I‚Äôm just fucking rambling on. take it organize it, make a fucking flyer I don‚Äôt care. Get the fucking word out get everyone you know, tell your fucking mom dad your brother your cousin tell your fucking buddies twice. Tell the lady at the drive through. Tell your DR whiles she‚Äôs fondling you‚Äôre balls I don‚Äôt care. And tell yourself every time you tell someone else fucking make a badass flyer. we‚Äôre gonna make it into the fucking storming bitcoin 51 event we‚Äôre all gonna make a whole fuck load money and more importantly give a middle finger to all the fuckers who are scammimg people out of their hard earned money with bitcoin. It‚Äôs time WE THE PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET WHAT WE WANT. IF WE WANT BITCOIN TO GO TO THE MOON. THEN WE FUCKING BUILD IT A FUCKING ROCKET. DUH. IT CANT MAKE IT TOO THE MOON BY ITSELF.

1. How much energy will the Bitcoin network consume if BTC is valued at $100000?
2. How will the Bitcoin network sustain if all the Bitcoins have been mined?
3. We know that energy is a finite resource. Technologies that consume less energy for similar or better output get preference. That's what propagates the innovation in combustion engines. Bitcoin is far behind several of the available alternatives. 
4. Bitcoin is unfit for everyday transactions. Because it is slow. 
5. You can find studies that highlight the fact that the majority of Bitcoin mining is concentrated in few geographical regions. 
6. I don't agree with the notion that Bitcoin is a store of value like gold.  People do mention that there is an infinite amount of gold in the universe without even knowing that it will take a huge amount of energy to extract that gold and don't even think of bringing it back to earth. Gold is useful in several scientific applications. 
7. Are there scientific studies to show that Bitcoin has improved the living standard of the poor of the world? Those are the ones who will suffer the undeserved consequence of global warming.",1579167498,67,1

epgdb0,iFuckyou6969,I got robbed,"Side Note:This is my first time ever writing something on the reddit and my english is not good too.So please don't roast me for being too short or too large.Although I will try to be as short as possible but if gets long,Then sorry in advance but you will definitely will  learn a new way of how these hackers can steal your bitcoin.So It will worth it

So I recently purchased bitcoin from paxful.com in advance to pay my friend for something and he wanted to pay him in bitcoin as bitcoin concept really blowed his mind and I was also excited to purchased my first bitcoin.It was not a huge amout($7) but I purchased bitcoin of $15 cause I heard rumor that bitcoin value will increase even some claiming to go to even $1 million and I wanna be a part of it.Mind you,That the deal was on 2 weeks ahead as  my friend had gone to his home  country to meet his parents and other friends.He is a transfer student and very kind and  friendly.So now to the robbery,I didn't used any bitcoin and it was safe on my wallet but few days later,I randomly opened my paxful to see if there is inflation in my money and as i said,This is my first time buying so I was curious to see how my value change.Yeah,I know i am stupid but the movement i opened my wallet.My heart sank,all my money was gone and in the transaction,It says that -$15.I was very confused as I haven't used for anything.I don't know what to do,whom to contact as I don't know a single person who use bitcoin and deal with bitcoin.So after a 30 minute of sorrow.I figured,I might have gone hacked.So I changed my password and contact the same seller to buy more.BIG MISTAKE as i should've put 2FA right then and there.I was stupid and thought if I had got hacked then if I changed password,he/she wouldn't be logged in anymore.So,as i said,I conatcted seller again and purchased another bitcoin but this time i only bought $10 bitcoin cuz this was my only money i had left as i am unemployed and had to live off my parents pocket money so that I spent all my time doing study and work hard so i can get good grades and get good job.So now come the payment day and I told everything about the robbery to my friend and he offered me more discount on already discounted offer but i told him that i bought bitcoin again for $10 and will pay full money as i know he is already had given me the best offer($7).The real value of the item is $30 which is a great deal for me but when I opened to send money.It said it doesn't money send to anyone.I opened my wallet and it was empty.My money again disappered and said -$10 in transaction.My face went dull and almost on the verge of crying and I think to myself.This can't happened twice.I have changed password,there is no way that the hacker can get access again.I was gone mad.My friend video called me and we talked about like whole solid 40 minute and Then a bulb clicked in my head.I remember that back when I was searching for options to buy bitcoin.I had mistakenly allowed on that popup ad notification.I don't know how to post pic here.Please tell me how to post pic so i can show you what I am saying.so i tell my friend about this and  he also agree that it can be a possiblity that that pop ad had steal the money because the ad was looking suspicious from the start.It was saying click Allow  to win a whole 1 bitcoin.So I reset my whole phone and put 2fa which i should've done way earlier when i got robbed first but now I will never purchased bitcoin as it cost me $25.My friend offer me for free but i refused it as He also had paid for it and already was giving me at very low price and I know for some people it might not be much but in my country people work for 10 hour straight for three days  to get that money as i am not from rich country.

So moral of the story is always put 2FA and never allow notification from any site if you find that site suspicious and sorry again for taking so much time and for my bad english and you can message me if you wanna know more about it and Be safe because there are many hungry and greedy people who don't care about emotion and all they do is hurt people and please if anyone know any way to get back my bitcoin,please help me if you can",1579161803,16,1

epg1zf,Squeaky-Bed,"I was targeted with a SIM-Swap Attack last night, I think I survived it (possibly related Gatehub hack)","It's 10 pm, I am watching BTC pump like a beast. Out of the blue, I get 3 consecutive text messages. Recovery code for yahoo, recovery key for Abra, And a Third one I wont name.   


All kinds of alarms went off in my head, I check my yahoo and my Abra account. All is good. No suspicious activity. I think to myself maybe someone is trying to brute force his way into those accounts. I start changing passwords.   
\~20 minutes later, My wife calls me. **On Facebook not the phone.** she asks me whats wrong with my phone and if I had lost it because she tried to call me and couldn't reach me. And that she got an SMS on her phone saying my SIM card was reactivated or some shit like that. I glance at my phone an sure enough, I don't have service.   


At this point I realized I was being hacked, My body went numb and my heart skipped a few beats, I froze for a sec then I promptly asked my wife to call T-Mobile and ask them to disable the SIM-Card while I login to every one of my valuable accounts and lock/freeze them.   


\~5 to 8 minutes after I initiated operation lock down my wife calls back to give me the good news, SIM-Card successfully disabled. I go through a holly fucking shit that's a relief moment then recompose myself and complete operation lock down all the way until basically I locked out of every valuable account I own.   


All in all the attacker had a good \~25 minutes of unrestricted access to my phone number and he used this time to try and reset a yahoo, Abra and Coinbase accounts. 

However, We crashed his party and cut it short when we disabled the SIM-Card. We did it just in time too because I am certain, 5 more minutes and I would have been toasted and roasted and I would be homeless living under a bridge (**Not even exaggerating**). The Abra account I know for sure I lost, But nothing else as far as I can tell.   


T-Mobile acted surprised of-course and said they would ""investigate this"", And the police were like ""You didn't lose any money so, We ain't doing shit until some is stolen"".

Now here I am 48 hours with barely 6 hours of sleep obsessing over how can this happen, How is it possible. How did he know to target me and how did he know so much about me to pull this off. 

Several scenarios came to mind but they all require a great deal of skill and influence and are a bit far fetched, Except for this last one that I stumbled upon in the last 2 hours.

[Avast Security](https://preview.redd.it/9x8mbdu843b41.jpg?width=946&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01b4b5a274d3a007341e6b8a902c0470358cab15)

This is a screen shot from the avast security app and it shows that the primary E-Mail that I use was compromised/leaked more than once, However the most recent one is the one that caught my attention. Fucking Gatehub.   
I now remember that was stupid enough to register an account with them, Fully verified. Full legal name, Email, Phone #, Proof of residence, And even copies of my drivers license :(  


And that's more than enough for the attacker to pull this off and carry a successfully hack. He only needs to impersonate me when calling T-Mobile or have an inside man that works at T-Mobil. The only variable that he didn't have control of is how fast I notice and react to the hack to try and stop it.

  
Now please forgive me for the horrible format and poor story telling skills because I have been up for 2 days now functioning on only 5 hours of sleep last night, I spent all of this time to Change passwords and revamp my security. This is a nightmare and it almost ruined my life. But the important thing is to tell my story and warn you guys to **Take Steps protect yourselves because it is a real threat and you don't think YOU will be next until it happens to you**.   


I think I dodged a bullet (more like a tank shill), But I won't know for sure until I take back complete control over my locked accounts.   


Finally, Here is a few things you can do to protect yourselves.  


1) If you ever used Gatehub, Assume that your info was leaked too and it is now in the hands of bad actors. Don't use that Email address of phone # that you used to register on Gatehub on any valuable accounts that you don't want to lose and remove them from any existing accounts.   


2) Contact your mobile service provider and establish a PIN and special instruction not to allow any changes to the account over the phone/Internet unless you go to the store and show some form of ID.  


3) Step #2 wont 100% protect you if whoever wants to attack you has an inside man, So never use your phone # as a recovery method for important/Valuable accounts. If SMS is the only recovery/2FA method available on the website you are about to use. DO NOT USE THAT SERVICE, Instead take your business somewhere else where they have better security option. 

4) Use separate/dedicated E-Mail addresses for accounts that are important and are valuable and make sure the E-Mail service provider has good security measures/options.  U2F hardware tokens, authenticator apps, Pr-Generated one time codes. ETC. **No phone numbers**.   


There is a lot more you can do to protect yourself but these are the only ones that I can remember now and I am sure readers will share other ways to secure our shit too and I will add them as they are shared :)  


TL;DR

I was targeted with a SIM-Swap Attack last night because my personal info was leaked on Gatehub and partly because of my poor, lose and careless security habits. I survived the attack without any losses (hopefully) by reacting and disabling my SIM-Card in time before the attacker got to my accounts.",1579159589,174,1

epd7gd,giszmo,Don't trust. Verify!,"### What can be done to improve the general users' awareness of security issues?

The average Bitcoin user is quick to spread memes like ""verify all the things"" or [""don't trust. Verify!""](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=don%27t+trust%2C+verify) but then goes on and uses custodial services to store his bitcoins or doesn't care that nobody does verify the software they use, as long as it's open source.

Probably people think that somebody else in the community is doing the verification and indeed, bitcoin core is highly scrutinized and the binaries are independently verified by many more than one person, yet the majority of wallets deployed are not bitcoin core or desktop wallets in general, where verifiability is more common. The majority is mobile apps.

My field of expertise is Android and there, the situation is really grim:

* Coinbase - a custodial service - has more than **10 million downloads**. Another **3 million downloads** are spread out over other custodial ""wallets""
* Luno, Coinomi and Coins.ph all claim to not be custodial but they are closed source - having a **million downloads each**! (Yes, Coinomi is closed source!). Another **1.5 million downloads** can be found across other closed source ""non custodial"" wallets.
* ""Blockchain Wallet"" by blockchain.com has **5 million downloads** and while they claim to be open source, their builds cannot be independently verified. There is another **3 million downloads** across other wallets in that category.
* Only **2 million downloads** are shared between verifiable wallets on Android.

""Being your own bank"" is not the only viable option but ...

* **Custodial services** are of course the least verifiable. They are subject to
  * hacks
  * ""hacks"" (inside jobs)
  * regulatory oversight (read: sorry, without further KYC you can't have your bitcoins back)
  * fractional reserve (the bitcoins you ""own"" don't exist)
  * lack of control (those fork coin ""airdrops"" we won't do and by the way, ""Bitcoin wood"" is the real bitcoin.)
  * legal action (what happens to ""your"" money stored at Coinbase if Billbase sues Coinbase out of existance?)
 
 If you are fine with all the above, your choice of custodial service might still be better than all the rest but it sure requires a lot of trust!
* **Closed source** wallets might do the right thing but if ""Don't trust. Verify!"" means anything to you, stay clear of those. They could at their sole discretion decide to need your coins with the next update and there would be no way for you to know it is happening until they emptied all their users' wallets at once. Under distress this might happen despite the best moral and intentions. In a sense this might be worse than institutional custodial services with a good cold storage system where a release manager catching a virus wouldn't put all customer funds at risk.
* Not verifiable **open source** wallets right now are kind of ""under observation"". Most of them did not even have an issue in their GitHub repositories about verifiability but [WalletScrutiny](https://walletscrutiny.com/) made sure they now do. Check [any](https://walletscrutiny.com/posts/2019/11/blockchainwallet/) [of](https://walletscrutiny.com/posts/2019/11/brd/) [the](https://walletscrutiny.com/posts/com.bitcoin.mwallet/) [non-verifiable](https://walletscrutiny.com/posts/2019/11/bitpay/) [wallets](https://walletscrutiny.com/posts/2019/11/edge/) for a link in the header: ""We discuss the issue with verification with the provider [here](https://github.com/blockchain/My-Wallet-V3-Android/issues/1256)."" to see how they respond and **chime in on the discussion so they know you care!**
* **Verifiable open source** wallets might still be evil. Just because they are verifiable, doesn't mean anybody does verify them. [WalletScrutiny](https://walletscrutiny.com/) took a snapshot of when the build was verifiably matching the public source code but the code might still leak the keys to the servers or otherwise put your money at risk. Also the next update might do harm. For verifiability to matter, somebody would have to actually verify the code is doing no harm. But that only makes sense if the code matches the released app. This is why [WalletScrutiny](https://walletscrutiny.com/) is starting there and will care about actual code review later.",1579143722,18,1

I have been called today by Senior Account Manager from Marketrip to transfer my initial deposit.

I didn't pick up the phone as I am very suspicious about calls from unknown numbers, but they kept calling me about 6 times and I have picked up at 7th attempt.

It was not professional because in the background I could hear club music playing, lol

We had short conversation and she was saying that she is sending me a link to deposit, however I was not recieving anything to my email after 3 attempts.

At this point she started asking me over the phone for my debit card detail which I have refused to give, she said to reply to the email when I get it so we can continue the conversation.

She was also saying about assigning some mentor to me so he can get me through the process of making money.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this sounded to me like one big scam and trying to pull money out of me.

I just want a secure way to buy and hodl and get started. Even if you suggest how much time I should set aside and where I can look for the trusted information.

I'm a swedish citizen that have been buying cryptos for some years but on later days I've been having some issues with depositing funds to crypto exchanges due to that our banks doesn't like this at all. 
They're blocking me out from exchanges bank accounts and claims it's due to the high risks of money laundering. This is my second bank that now have blocked me out from coinbase pro and kraken so I'm not able to buy cryptos. The banks that I'm talking about is 
Swedbank (who is currently under investigation of money laundering themself lol) and another bank called ICA banken.

Is there any other swedes or scandinavians that knows how or where to get your money in to the exchanges?

This seems to be a growing trend. Is it because of fees? I still see millions of dollars being sent for only a couple of dollars in fees, so I don't think so.

I've been lurking here for a while and I've also seen the store of value narrative. Is this a real, viable usage for BTC? Being the OG, gold like crypto where others take the place of payments as we've seen Pornhub and others adopt?

esspoh,SpockSays,Crazy to consider that the amount of bitcoin holders in the world is still so low.,"This might be a bit rambling, but I was thinking about this a lot very recently and i'm not sure what to make of it. Grateful for any insights you can share...

The global population is over 7 billion people. 

The minted supply of BTC is around/above 18 million.

It is estimated that at least a couple of million BTC are lost forever.

A small amount of individual holders possess vastly large BTC balances. (aka whales)

Most BTC hasn't moved on chain for over a year and is presumably ""not for sale"".

&amp;#x200B;

This is the part that baffles me though:

There are over 45 million ""millionaires"" world wide.

At past and current trading prices, buying just 1 BTC would be a minuscule purchase to this class of wealthy people.

Not to mention the many people world wide who aren't millionaires, but who could also easily afford 1 BTC at past and current trading prices.

&amp;#x200B;

Here we are 10 years after bitcoins launch and it seems as though everyone knows the word ""bitcoin"" even if they don't understand what it actually is or how it works. 

I just find it so surprising that amongst the vast population of humans on earth, so few humans possess any amount of BTC at all, at this point in time.

&amp;#x200B;

Given the fascinating speculative ""number go up"" phenomena of BTC we have witnessed in past growth cycles/bull runs, how is it possible that the global population of wealthy people still have no/little interest in participating in BTC at this stage of the game? 

The ticket to get on the roller coaster is relatively cheap (and divisible to any amount they choose to acquire as per their risk appetite). But again, even at all current and past trading prices, 1 BTC would be cheap for them. 

How are there not more holder in the world?

Why isn't the process reversed in some way where the receiving wallet can control the fee?  That way senders just send what they want and then the fee is taken out according to the receiver's wallet, allowing them to control the priority for funds they receive.

eub7hy,EhManana,What is the point? To invest? To mine it? To stockpile? I'm a bit lost,"Howdy,

Let me preface that I am at the very least intrigued by blockchain and I'm also interested in the general idea of bitcoin - money system w/o a central bank behind it. I'm not looking to start a fight or to criticize/shame bitcoin, so as long as you get where I'm coming from, that's good.

1. Obtaining it - mining is out of the option for me, I don't have $15,000+ lying around to buy an ASIC, and then the electric bill behind that. I suppose I *could* join a mining pool, but I'll return to this later.The second is to accept bitcoin for say if I was selling products/services - sure, I'd have to a wallet set up, but I will come back to this later as well.The third is to purchase' in it - I've seen other redditors remark they put aside half of their left over money each paycheck into bitcoin as an ""investment"".
2. As an investment, I feel like bitcoin is playing the stock market without the modicum of protection that the SEC/other Wall Street regulations (lol) offer you - if you're wallet is part of a leak, like the [input.io](https://input.io) one, you have no recourse to fall back on, and I don't think the courts at least in the U.S have been receptive to recovery efforts by potential plaintiffs.
3. The use of it. To piggy back on the investing, I'm using the dollar to buy it in the first place - and I don't really see myself using bitcoin for some of the more unsavory places that accept it to be frank about that. Places that *might* be inclined to accept it are likely just gonna convert it back to cash at the end of the day as well I feel like.

&amp;#x200B;

There has never been an easier time to access the world‚Äôs forex market either. At the click of a button, you could be trading on the direction of the Euro, British pound, Japanese Yen, US dollar or even the Russian Ruble! There are hundreds of currency pairings to trade from, so you‚Äôre free to find the ones that interest you most.

However, while the financial gains of trading the forex market seem lucrative, it‚Äôs not considered easy. Having a sound trading education, a properly funded trading account and an understanding of risk management techniques are essential. Unfortunately, there are many unscrupulous individuals who will try to scam individuals through forex trading scams.

Forex scams will be around for as long as the Forex market exists. As schemes are evolving, scammers are always somewhere nearby, trying to extort your money away. But could there be a solution to this problem?

Investment scams take many different forms. Some of the scams are even named after their creators ‚Äî such as a Ponzi scheme, after the infamous scammer Charles Ponzi. Forex scammers tend to target beginners or uneducated traders. The best way to combat this, and avoid getting scammed, is by getting a good[ ](https://admiralmarkets.com/education/articles/forex-basics/why-getting-a-good-forex-trading-education-is-so-important)Forex trading education so you are aware of everything before you enter the markets.

Once you master the markets, you are no longer an easy target. Forex scams often use phrases like ‚Äúa too-good-to-be-true investment opportunity‚Äù as a way of convincing you to part ways with your money. When you lack trading experience, swindlers will try to exploit your optimism and fears. Here‚Äôs where Forex scammers step in and make you exciting offers.

How To Spot A Forex Trading Scam

The most important giveaway of a Forex scammer is the guarantee of unusually large profits with little or no financial risk. First of all: there‚Äôs no such thing as a 100% guarantee. If there was, there‚Äôs no way traders would share it with other market players. Some of these offers may sound very attractive, especially to beginning traders. But as the saying goes, the only free cheese is in the mousetrap. The bottom line is this: if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Here a few simple rules to follow in order to avoid scammers:

* Remain safe and don‚Äôt run after empty promises
* Be especially wary of software that claims to have found a ‚Äòsecret formula‚Äô
* Do not install any programs until you are certain they won‚Äôt damage your computer

Another giveaway is that scammers never register with any regulatory authority. Remember ‚Äî true brokers always provide proof of their legitimacy. If you suspect that a Forex broker is lying about their regulation, you can contact a regulatory authority who may be able to provide a list of regulated companies, and a list of cases opened against regulated companies. This will help you understand which Forex brokers to avoid.

If you‚Äôve been a victim of forex scam or any other scam either through bogus investment companies or through romance scam grantspace tech recovery company has been known to recover funds from this nefarious scammers and through the help of world-renowned hackers working under grantspace tech to make sure victims get the relief they need and you don‚Äôt have to pay a dime till your funds have been recovered.

eu9hq1,Whole-Television,Question about hardware wallet (trezor),"Hey there, I was thinking of purchasing a hardware wallet to store my crypto but I had a question.

- How can I be absolutely certain that the device hasn't been tampered with? Like, if an employee decided to inject some malicious code or per-determinently set the device to have specific seed recovery words, or somehow managed to bypass a firmware check. Even outside of a rogue employee, other possibilities could be the package was hijacked in transit and this was done. Or even something that was done that I haven't listed above.

Maybe they wait months, years for the device to accumulate enough enough bitcoin before deciding to cash out and from the start I wouldn't have known they had access the entire time.

This assumption is based on me purchasing directly from the website too, not some sketchy third party.

Would to like to know people's thoughts on this, maybe I'm just being paranoid but I want to be absolutely secure  before self-managing funds like this.

Thanks in advance.",1580058948,10,1

evarme,adamblake87,I want to share my view of Bitcoin with you,"I was one of the Bitcoin pioneers but things aren't good at all.  I don't know where to start so I will start with new users.

1.New users

No one will use their $9.000 hard earning cash and told look honey I just buy 1BTC. So there is no room for new owners. And please stop talking about fractions of Bitcoins

2. Price

Without new users, there is no rise in price. That's very easy to understand. The close $20.000 is the highlight of Bitcoin's price. I sold all mine in that period and secure a good life.

3. Community

That's the worst part. The bitcoin community is full of wannabe, scammers, liars and so one. There are 10-15 good people but that's not enough for industry standard.

4. Industry acceptance

What is this? Nobody cares. Why? There is no money, it's hard for legal tax return and so one. You can't get 60 days guaranty and so one.

5. Future

Now we live in the pre-quantum computer era. Private keys are still secure (7-10 years') but there is plenty of programs waiting for quantum computers. If you don't know how to program I can sell you one of my programs. Someone calls it a lottery but I think that is better than the lottery because they are free.

6. Competition

There is a lot of coins who have a strong community and a much better future than BTC. We don't use money from the beginning so we will not use BTC in the future. That's for sure

7. Life-changing

You can't change a life with 30-50 BTC. You can get a better life but that is not enough. 1BTC will never be $1M so you know what I mean ;)

8. Hard to learn - easy to lose

Crypto is a completely new industry. I need 60 days to make a program to get all private keys. My brother is very smart and loses their private key.

9. HODL

This is the worst part. And everyone who has some education knows that isn't good.

Crypto is a good thing but quantum computers are better than crypto. I want to be more secure in my Tesla. I want my smart house can more than give me a food and air conditioning space.

***Edit - Don't get mad at me. This is my opinion but it will very much coincide with the future. But it's not my fault.***",1580242078,139,0

ev9er7,9DD90,My Full Node Bandwidth Usage,"I have this desktop at home that is ON 24/7, so 2 years ago I started seeding open source torrents (eg: linux distros) and also set up a full Bitcoin node. While I don't use Bitcoin (fiat is good enough for my needs), I like the idea of having an alternative. I had enough disk space and don't have any caps, so I thought I could help the network.

There are a few posts about bandwidth usage here already, but maybe someone thinking of running a full (seeding) node will find this info useful.

The computer runs Windows 10, so I use Netlimiter Pro to keep an eye on data usage and limit speeds. Stats since 2019/03: https://i.imgur.com/3RzPvpK.png

My node usually uploads 350-400GB a month with a 1MB/s upload limit. Sometimes it uploads more (2019/04: 642GB; 2019/08: 594GB) and sometimes less (2019/09: 358GB), depending on what the peers are doing. Some days it uploads 5-10GB, other days 30-40GB.

It's clear that I could go over 1TB on heavy months if I wasn't seeding torrents or didn't have a speed limit in place, but since this is a home connection, I can't go near my upload limit (~2MB/s) without affecting normal usage (slow web browsing, high latency on gaming, etc).

ev8jby,Cryptolexicon,Coinberry soft Credit bureau inquiries and account holds,"I am 100% for more players in this industry.

CoinBerry seems to have a good thing going on. However (no offense meant, Coinberry) I will not be using their services for the following reasons:

. Terms of use, item 15 ([https://www.coinberry.com/legal](https://www.coinberry.com/legal)): "" We have engaged a third-party supplier to provide your identity verification for us. To verify your identity your personal information will be matched with the information contained in your Credit File Report and other third-party sources through what is known as a soft inquiry. Unlike hard inquiries, soft inquiries do not affect your credit score. You also consent to your personal information being compared to records maintained by third parties, including telecom and other service providers, and you consent to having those third-parties provide personal information to us and our third-party suppliers for the purpose of identity verification.""

To tie your credit file to your Crypto purchases, and to give your consent for the information collected to be shared with ""Telecom and other service providers"" is handing over a huge amount of sensitive information. Your Credit file and your crypto buys/sells/transfers, as well as data on the payment sources are combined (permission is given to do so) to provide a better picture of who you are and what you have.

If you don't mind sharing that information, it's completely fine, and I am sure there's a lot of people out there who won't even think twice about it.

However for a lot of us, the reason we are in crypto, the reason we hold, is because we do not \*\*trust\*\* institutions with information of this nature. Banks (National Bank, Desjardins, to name only two) and other institutions (Capital One, Equifax) get hacked left and right, and seeing this how can we trust, again, an institution with this amount of information, and with information of such a sensitive nature?

. Initial 72 hours hold and refund policy, which states that CoinBerry reserves the right to hold a refund for 14 days or ""until we can verify the source of deposited funds"".

Coinberry and BRD Wallet (which I won't use anymore) are in a partnership meaning when you try to purchase BTC, ETH from the BRD wallet you are sent to Coinberry, so I suggest that before doing so you take the time to read their legal section carefully, to see if what they do aligns with your values as a crypto holder: [https://www.coinberry.com/legal](https://www.coinberry.com/legal)

I mean absolutely no offense Coinberry, and sorry for the long post. It looks like you guys and girls have a great thing going on and I wish you success (website looks great). Your integration with Fintrac and collaboration with the RCMP means you do take AML and KYC very seriously (AML is a good thing). However centralizing information and data collection, asking users to trust you with our data, just like we did with those banks that got hacked, and also your hold policy make this service a no go for me.

Such a provider would have to guarantee that the transaction went through and of course that they would not abscond with the coins; of course the person might also be the buyer.

They would have to move coins to both the buyer and then move the change to an address the seller provided.

The person would make enough in theory that they would not abscond with coins.

&amp;#x200B;

 In order to truly grok how BTC works, it might help to **visualize the BTC blockchain as a ""very special"" vault with 21 million ""very special"" bars in it. This Vault is sealed from the outside and it's contents unchangeable for all time**. The walls of this vault are as transaprent as glass... yet, impenetrable. While anyone can see in there, only a Private key has the ability to speak to this network. And it may only speak about the Satoshis labeled as the ones belonging to that key.

In it's early days after creation, this vault had very few people listed as owning anything within it. **Nakamoto himself had mined (by mining, he had done work for the network and in return that network put his name on some of those special bars that it forever holds).** Take a second and picture the network using a Sharpie marker and writing ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" directly on the side of some of those ""special bars"". To test his new Vault's abilities, Nakamoto then sent the network a command (a command only made valid by his private key's signature on that command) to re-label a few of those bars to a new owner: thus the network drew a line though ""Nakamoto"" and wrote underneath it a new owner: ""Hal Finney"".

Soon, other people jumped onboard. Many of these new people came and gave that network thier computer power to help process the ""work"" for the network... as a reward, the Network wrote their names on (awarded them control over) some more of the Vault's 21 million units. ""Un-Mined Satoshis"" already exist. They live already in that special vault. But they have never yet had anyones name written on them and they are simply refered to as ""un-mined"".

In time, many saw true value in this permissionless, anonymous, and unconfiscatable unit/method of accounting. Somewhere along the line, and as this perceived value grew, someone somewhere offered someone else another unit of exchange (cash) for thier Bitcoins. Thus for the first time Bitcoin was suddenly valued *AGAINST* what most of us know as money. It wasn't long before this virtual currency had enough value that someone was willing to trade for REAL goods. Goods such a few pizzas...

\*\*\*\* **Final mindblow: the BTC network doesnt deal in ""Bitcoins""** ... It sees and operates in Satoshis as the TRUE unit of measure. Go back and look real closely at that special bar again. It's actualy 100 million little mini bars (satoshis) stacked together.... each with their own little tiny name tag telling the network who has the control over them.

Those that constantly say **""Stack Sats and Chill""** get this.",1578440048,1,1
