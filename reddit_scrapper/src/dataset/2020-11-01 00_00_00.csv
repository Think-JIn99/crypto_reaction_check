jo4nfz,BlandTomato,Bitcoin has a lot going for it. There's a bunch of reasons the price is going to keep hitting new highs.,"We all know Bitcoin is decentralized, open source, neutral, available to anyone with internet, hack proof, unforgeable, impossible to debase, disinflationary, and censorship resistant.

But did you also know that Bitcoin frees you from other people having control over your wealth? Once your wealth is stored in Bitcoin, no other entity on Earth could steal all or part of it. Not governments with inflation or cops. Not some Russian hacker. (Maybe a Nigerian scammer if you're gullible and just hand it over.)

This is why Bitcoin is digital gold. In fact, the ""gold"" part of that description tarnishes Bitcoin. Bitcoin is far superior to gold. Dividing gold is hard. Bitcoin has sub-penny precision. Can't buy stuff online with gold. https://purse.io lets you buy anything from Amazon with Bitcoin and you get a discount. To verify gold, you need a $15,000 tester. With Bitcoin you just open your Bitcoin wallet. Selling gold has huge transaction fees based on a fixed percentage. I usually spend around $0.04 in Bitcoin for my transaction fees. And if I wanted to sell Bitcoin (like an idiot) for fiat money, the fees on that are 0-2% depending on which Bitcoin exchange you use. There's lots. They're online, so it's right there on your phone. Do you know how much it costs to send $1.15 billion in gold? Me neither. Maybe $50 million? It only cost about $3.50 to do it the other with Bitcoin. Physically moving gold takes way longer than getting paid in Bitcoin instantly, with final settlement taking 10 minutes on average. Plus, gold sets off metal detectors. Good luck flying with gold. They will confiscate/steal it. Meanwhile Bitcoin can be held in your memory with 12 words. Good luck catching that on a metal detector.  

When gold goes up in price, the gold mines mine more gold and push the price back down by increasing supply. Bitcoin doesn't have that limitation. Bitcoin is mined on a set schedule that gets cut in half every 4 years. Imagine the price of gold if half of all the gold mines in the world all ran dry at the same time. Cutting the supply rate in half creates a massive valuation increase. 

Bitcoin wins over gold by probably 1000x. Bitcoin is email. Gold is the Pony Express. Today's Gold market cap is $7 trillion. Today's Bitcoin market cap is $261 billion. 

Bitcoin is the hardest money ever created, and as such, Bitcoin will destroy the value of all other stores of wealth until only the next hardest ones survive and all the weakest ones (shitcoins and weak economies fiat money) are destroyed. 

Bitcoin is already at all time highs against a few fiat currencies. Thousands of shitcoins came pretending they were a Bitcoin killer. BITCONNEEEEEEEEEECT and a thousand more are already dead. BCH and it's double shitcoin cousin BSV are at all time lows to BTC and dropping until the network becomes completely unprofitable, at which point they just shut it off and everyone abandons it. 

Bitcoin isn't just A consensus mechanism for wealth, Bitcoin is THE consensus mechanism for wealth. 

Hyperbitcoinization is inevitable. The more people realize this, the faster it happens.",1604522852,5,1

jo3m0w,Ancient_Silverback,Losing faith in Bitcoin,"Last week, I tried to make a transaction with bitcoin. It was sent with a ridiculously low fee (I couldn't change it) and it has been stuck in the mempool ever since. It also seems like a node is rebroadcasting it every 3 days, effectively resetting the 2 week waiting period every time. The fact that your bitcoin can actually be stuck for weeks or even potentially forever is just straight up garbage. I simply don't see how bitcoin can undergo mass adoption when something as simple as trying to make a transaction can result in your payment being stuck for weeks/forever. Hate to say it, but bitcoin cash actually seems pretty attractive if the result is I don't have to risk waiting potentially until the end of time for a transaction to finally go through. I've also tried importing the wallet to different services to attempt to ""cancel"" or send back to myself with a higher fee, but I'm having 0 luck. I'm completely frustrated because I've been singing bitcoin's praises over the years because all I did was hodl. The first time I decide to try and move it, it's all gone. For the first time, bitcoin has made me feel powerless in what I can do with my money.

jo28s6,Rhettre,Dollar Cost Averaging - Best Way to Establish a Position Over Time,"Hey everyone,

I've been buying Bitcoin everyday for a little over a year now and I've seen the results of steadily buying Bitcoin drastically eclipse the returns from my 401K and other traditional investments (my current asset allocation is \~53% stocks, 5% bonds + REITs, 27% Crypto + Stablecoins, 15% cash) so I wanted to share some of the results in case anyone else had been thinking about trying something like this. 

I've done monthly DCA with the top Altcoins (ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC, EOS, ADA, XTZ, XLM, LINK) since around May of 2020 - these results have been much more mixed (from +19% to -26%). I don't doubt that some would work if you stuck with them, but I've found the most success with Bitcoin.  

High level results: 

401k returns since 2016: +17% (investing in Vanguard mutual funds)

BTC returns from only DCA daily buys in 2019+2020 (as of today $14,000 price): +57%

Tracking these buys automatically and graphing the prices you buy at (if you buy at regular intervals) will give you a really good idea of when you should take advantage of a large buy. Example: When the price crashed in March I saw that the price had fallen below my cost basis (or breakeven price). That along with months of daily price data gave me the confidence to buy the dip (I am usually very skeptical of market timing, and you should be too). But identifying that opportunity and taking action was obviously very lucrative (as of today).  

I think this being a halving year / post halving year (and the macro backdrop USA printing trillions in stimulus) have helped push the gains higher than they would have been otherwise, but I still think this is the most conservative way to get into Bitcoin and will continue the strategy for the foreseeable future.

The complete seed just carries too much access. 

So I was thinking, what if I just switch out one of the words? One that I feel I’m gonna easily remember. That should make the seed completely useless to a thief right? A thief would ofc not know if the wallet has been deleted (if that’s even possible) or if many words are wrong, not just one.

So basically I have followed the advice I was given, waited for Bitcoin Core to sync, which it has done fully (to today's date around 12:15)

After which, Armory began starting in offline mode again, I followed some 'advice' on a forum and now it wont open at all 

Even now after I reinstalled armory it still wont start it says:
""See the logfile 'D:\Armory\ArmoryQt.exe.log' for details""

So I did and the latest log I believe is:
IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: u'C:\\Users\\myname\\AppData\\Roaming\\Armory\\ArmorySettings.txt'  

No idea at this point lol any ideas? 




ORIGINAL POST 

So I wanted to get some bitcoins and thought it would be easy. I am very stupid. 

1. I searched for wallets without doing any research, and downloaded Armory. 

2. I bought bitcoins from bitcoin.org, and scanned the QR code in armory to have them sent to my wallet

3. I received an email from Moonpay with my details

4. Then I learned about armory being offline

5. Then I learned I needed bitcoin core

6. Then I learned I needed to sync the last 8 years of bitcoin blocks(?) which is going to be 2 days 😅


Basically, have I done this right (although blindly and stupidly) or horribly wrong? 
The  coins are sat somewhere do I just need to wait for all this to update and sync? Will they then appear in my wallet?",1604926836,13,1

Example scenario is that let's say in 10-15 years the amount of BTC I have reaches USD500k and then maybe at that time there might be a risk of drop in the price of BTC for any reason. What would you do with that money?

Would you sell all of it and invest in something else? (at the same time continue buying BTC little by little?)

Would you sell X% (80-90) of it and invest in something else?

Would you start selling little by little and use that money for life expenses (like house loan, car loan, etc.)?

Would you sell all of it and pay off your house loan and invest the rest in something else?

jqsjzj,Asafffff,Why are you all so convinced that Bitcoin will hit 100k?,"Disclaimer - I know nothing. I'm here to open a discussion and increase my knowledge, because i'm probably missing something.

I understand the hype about the coin. I'm seeing no reason it would go down back to March's price, with the whole enterprise adoptions that was announced recently, but 100k looks very exaggerated to me. While this is 'just' 8x of the current price, and we've seen a much larger increase (percentage wise) back in 2017, this is still a very different situation. 100% increase from $300 to $600 is, at least in my view, far from the increase from 15k to 30k.

jqsfv8,presse_citron,Is the Math correct? Every tx should pay a fee of 2.5mBTC (~$25) to substitute current miner block reward.,"Personal calculation:

Average number of transactions per block: 2,500 tx/block ([https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions-per-block](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions-per-block))

Current block reward for miners: 6.25 BTC

So, to get the same protection provided by the miners, in a time where all their revenue come from fees, not block reward (the block reward is programmed to come to zero in the end):

6.25/2,500 = 0.025BTC (\~$25).

jqqn2h,Hot_Fist,Words to the wise and the newcomers.,"I've been in Bitcoin since 2014 and I have learned enough to maybe be of help.  We always hear the now old adage, ""not your keys not your coins.""  That's sadly accurate as a vast majority of exchanges are scary to trust.  So if you have a considerable amount of Bitcoin, and sometimes get a bit anxious about losing it in bout of stupidity or bad luck, then you are like me.  Here is what I did to stop losing sleep over mucho dinero disappearing.

1.  Get a hardware wallet.  I like Trezor the best.  I have had a Keepkey and a Ledger Nano as well.  But this is a matter of personal taste in terms of interface preferences.
2. Write down your keys (obviously), and put them somewhere safe and sneaky.  Also memorize them if you are so inclined.
3. If you have a fireproof safe, cool.  If not, get a small one that can handle at least an hour of blazing fire action.
4. Get a fire proof bag/pouch, put a copy of your keys in there and put said bag in the safe.  
5. The get something like Cobo Tablet - Indestructible Steel Bitcoin Crypto Cold Storage Seed Backup ... and put that in the bag as well just in case a possible fire chars your little piece of paper.
6. Get a few little usb drives, password encrypt a text file of your keys on to each with a password you will not forget.   Make it something simple or common to you as these drives will be hidden where no one will ever find them ... except you if there is a worst case scenario.
7. Hide these away from your home.  Maybe at grandmas house inside the grandfather clock.  You know what i'm talking about.  And hide one in your car.

Now there is no reason to worry.  And yes, it sounds paranoid and takes a little bit of effort; but it's way better than losing 100's of thousands or millions of dollars.  And you will fall asleep much faster as you watch the BTC ticker.

Hodl and stack on, brothers and sisters.

jn830g,koinalio,Bloomberg: Bitcoin has had a tendency of adding zeros to its price,"**Investors and market watchers focus on Bitcoin price predictions; there is a widespread expectation that the price can increase, and many investors search for news and information on trends. A recent Bloomberg news article noted that Bitcoin(BTC) rose from $1,000 to $10,000 in less than four years.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fkd1r2al60x51.png?width=1540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80f761997153119536c1c45d26eceb40322edbd9

The writing projects the trend line and estimates that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by 2025. According to the article, Bitcoin will reach $100,000 in 2025 if it can add a zero to its price twice the time it took to add the zero from $1,000 to $10,000.

The discussion point is that Bitcoin may have slowed in its price expansion but still can continue climbing into the foreseeable future. Bitcoin has had sharp rises and falls; the overall trend line is one of remarkable growth. A Koinal account can start a path to Bitcoin investment or expand an existing plan. Our portal is convenient and straightforward; Koinal uses bank-issued cards to make cryptocurrency purchases.

## Long-Term Projections

The well-informed cryptocurrency community has seen bolder predictions. For example, a widely distributed Stock-to-Flow Model forecasts a $100,000 price by late 2020. The Bloomberg article suggests that both historical trends and the current supply and demand direction favor Bitcoin growth. Institutional demand is rising, and it will likely increase while the supply approaches the production limits. The limited supply will drive prices higher.

At Koinal.io, we work with you to carry out your investment and financial plans. Our program works with small or large volume purchases. Koinal works with the leading cryptocurrency exchanges that offer a wide variety of leading currencies.

## Short-Term Projections

While the long-term price point gets the attention, the article notes that the short-term prediction is that BTC will once again reach the $14,000 price point in 2020. The year 2019 was the last time Bitcoin sold at that level.

A Koinal account can set you on a path to participate in cryptocurrency. The Koinal purchasing process is easy to understand and convenient; it does not require bank wires or other special arrangements. We are here to help you open an account and start trading today.",1604399743,17,1

Many analysts believe that the economy will be considerably stronger under Donald Trumph, which means that the price of BTC could potentially be slow to rise, while Biden is likely to bring falls in the stock market, which may give bitcoin a chance to spike faster.

jn62ym,aiolyfe,"""Not your keys, not your coins"" .. Yeah, okay Grandpa. Time for bed.","""Not your keys, not your coins"" very, very true. But it's  the future of bitcoin .. and that's okay.

Not having the keys to a wallet isn't going to stop the great majority of future users from ""owning"" and using bitcoin via Paypal/et al for everything they want to use it for -- be it spending or saving. In the coming years, I think MOST people will be using services akin to PayPal to manage their bitcoins, never truly ""owning"" their coins, and not care about it at all as long as the VALUE of their account is retained. Eventually, ""not your keys, not your coins"" people (myself included) will resemble old-timey folks who buried valuables in the forest to keep them safe (not your hidden hole, not your gold nuggets). 

Whether or not people have their own keys will mean nothing towards the value and usability of their ""bitcoin."" Just like people who lease cars instead of buying one. ""Not your title, not your car."" 100% accurate, but who cares? People who lease cars couldn't care less about owning a car; they still are able to drive around just as much as anyone who bought their car.

In fact, lots of people may NOT WANT the responsibility of keeping track of their own wallet keys and would prefer to outsource the security of it to PayPal or eventually their local bank. We do that already with all of our fiat money. ""Not your keys, not your coins"" .. after you cash out, it's not YOUR money anyway! Anyone who cashes out their bitcoin to fiat immediately hands over their fiat to their bank. You think it's still your money? It's not, and we all know it. It's the bank's money, and you just trust them that the value of your account will be retained. ""Not your mattress, not your money."" We trust them so implicitly, so blindly, that we still feel it's our money and move about in life as if it were. Zero difference to the keyless majority future of bitcoin.

People just want security. We trust banks, so we sign our life savings over to them. Eventually we'll trust crypto banks the exact same way. Eventually crypto deposits will be FDIC insured (or the equivalent). Eventually we'll have bitcoin fraud purchase protection and reimbursement just like our credit cards. Eventually we'll have LifeLock for our bitcoin accounts. Holographic cryptography will eventually make accounts unhackable. None of this will require anyone to have the keys to a bitcoin wallet. 

Heck, having the keys to your wallet written out and stashed somewhere may become the weakest link. Might as well leave a disguise kit that looks like you somewhere for a stranger to find and include a roadmap to your local bank branch paperclipped to a pre-signed withdrawal slip.

Anonymous wallets with 12 word keys will become the ""cash"" version of bitcoin that's only as secure as they keys are hidden, while the actually safe and keyless bitcoins could be stored in checking/savings accounts locked behind fingerprint/voice/face/ retinal scan security with a PIN on top.

As long as trust, security, and liability are in the mix for people's crypto accounts, ""not your keys, not your coins"" will become the muttering of a cranky grandpa. 

All of that trust, security, and liability will most certainly be developed over time because consumers will demand it and corporations will want to profit .. but UNTIL THEN, ""not your keys, not your coins."" ;-)",1604388365,28,1

I understand a primary security flaw of using a mobile device as a cold storage wallet is if it can connect to the internet, it can be hacked. I have long since removed the SIM cards from my devices and I'm considering physically extracting the antennae signal cables inside the phone so that it is incapable of connecting to the internet.  

I'm familiar with the inner working of the phone, having replaced its screen, battery, charging port, Sim card tray (I really like these phone), so removing the antennae cables is trivial.

Would extraction of these cables eliminate the typical security concern for mobile cold wallets? I've never seen this option discussed online and I want to know if I'm onto something here....",1604367065,6,1

jsrrot,OceanRaver,How many of you see Bitcoin surpassing gold as the ultimate safe heaven asset in the far future?,"The younger generation i.e Millennials, gen Z being more interested in digital assets instead of holding physical metals, it safe to assume that bitcoin can easily head to more than 100k over the next 20 - 30 years. This could be easily provable if there is some sort of survey done (I can't seem to find any though) on the younger generation to get their opinion on Bitcoin vs gold. If more millennials prefer Bitcoin over gold in their portfolio, Bitcoin has to go up more than gold. It is common sense. With the boomers heading into the grave one by one, there ought to be tons of spare gold lying around but who is even going to buy up all the boomer gold? 

The future belongs to the younger generation and it is what we do that matters in society. Civilization progresses over time and it is silly to think that it would stagnate by clinging onto old ideals that are obsolete. Back in the stone age human beings were using flint as currency and they slowly transitioned to gold. Right now bitcoin is better than gold in every way from portability to easy storage. Why wouldn't it replace gold?",1605173271,1,1

jsrmvm,Ribtin,Should I transfer the BTC on my Ledger from a Segwit account to a Natvie Segwit account?,"It's been a few years since I touched my BTC, but I recently made a small transaction from my Ledger. And when I followed the confirmations on [https://blockstream.info](https://blockstream.info) it produced a message saying:

&gt;This transaction saved 26% on fees by upgrading to SegWit and could save 13% more by fully upgrading to native SegWit-Bech32

Like I said, it's been a few years since I tinkered with this, and as far as I can remember, there wasn't any ""Segwit-Bech32"" option around back then.

But since this message from Blockstream made it seem like I was spending more than I had to on fees, I created a new ""Segwit-Bech32"" account on my Ledger (as far as I can understand, Ledger calls it ""Native Segwit""), and was about to transfer all my funds to that, but realized that the fee for making this transfer would already be a sizable sum.

So this made me very unsure if it would actually be profitable to make this move from Segwit to Native Segwit, or if I should just keep my BTC where it is?

Additionally, since this ""Segwit-Bech32"" was not around back when I did this last time... Might that mean that there'll be yet another Segwit iteration in a year or two, so that I might as well wait around for whatever comes next?",1605172499,12,1
jsrkl1,ShldVBoughtBitcoin,Bitcoin finally hit the Daddy came home after 2 years at the store Price Pattern,"This is a pattern I like to call: daddy finally came home from the liquor store pattern

It’s when Bitcoin recovers back to a price it hasn’t seen since dropping from a previous all time high. Not the all time high price it’s, but a price during the drop from an all time high. Back in November 2016, that price was $700, and it had not been seen since 2 years before then way back in February 2014, dropping from a $1,300 all time high price reached back in December 2013.

Every time this happens, the market gets excited and it triggers a year long bull run to discover a new all time high. This will happen again, and I suspect it will happen throughout 2021, possibly spilling into the start of 2022. 

Too see this price chart, check out this video:

jsr7s8,facepalm5000,"Post-hyperbitcoinization, looking forward to a quieter world","Before the process of hyperbitcoinization started in 2009, the world had no reliable store of value.  With the average rate of fiat debasement being about 5%, investors needed they needed to beat that 5% ROI just to preserve the purchasing power of their saved wealth. Realizing they can't beat it with **passive** cash investments like CDs, money market funds and bonds, they turn to **active** investment strategies by buying other asset types.

So other asset classes started to become inappropriately used as stores of wealth, such as real estate and stocks. The evidence for this being that the average prices on these asset classes have been pushed up much higher than their actual value (look at PE ratios and income/home price ratios). But now in order to store wealth in these assets, frenetic activity is required. For a business to hold its value, in needs to produce revenue, which requires frenetic activity...resource consumption, hiring, management, analysis, heroic efforts of employees to pull projects across the finish line. In real estate too, frenetic activity is required. Owners have to rent out the property, and they have to deal with tenants, or pay someone else to deal with tenants. They need to do regular maintenance on houses that are falling apart. New roof, fix siding, fix termite damage, repair the foundation, fix the plumbing, repair the water damage, replace the washing machine.

Without a reliable store of value, in order to just maintain purchasing power, people in society have to get on a hamster wheel of their choosing and start running.

**With btc, in order to preserve purchasing power, all that needs to be done is simply hodl.**

I look forward to a world where there is far less noise from people needing to tread water just to stay afloat. Maybe then society can focus more on solving larger problems in medicine, science and engineering, rather than on political squabbling of who deserves to be closer to the money printer at the center of a giant, socialist, negative-sum fiat ponzi game.",1605170110,74,1

jsqbau,heptagon_h,Why stacking matters,"Human intuition is not very good at understanding exponents and log functions I'll demonstrate why stacking sats is so important and how it eventually lands you in a very exclusive club of Bitcoin HODLers.

It is already understood that if you own 1 BTC you are among a very elite club. How elite? Only 21 million owners can own 1 BTC theoretically. So you are in a ultra elite club of 0.3 % of the world

What's interesting is what happens if you own 2 BTC. The number of people who can own 2 BTC drops significantly. You would think its closer to 21 million people but actually its half of that - only 10.5 million owners can own 2 BTC making you part of 0.15% of the world

So similarly if you own 7 BTC only 3 million people like you can ever exist (0.04% of the world)

Do you see the pattern? Every increment reduces the exclusive membership by half.

This applies down to the Satoshis. Every stack of satoshis you HODL, makes you member of a group that significantly gets smaller. 

We are witnessing a real power dynamic here that will shake the foundations of the world and only a very small group of humans will be driving it",1605165270,28,1

jume6c,warrchaser,I'm selling my GOLD for Bitcoin. Here's why,"For the last few years I loved both gold and Bitcoin although I had much more of my net-worth in gold. After MUCH thought, I've decided I will be soon liquidating my gold and buying more Bitcoin. Here's why:

\*

I believe after this whole COVID shitshow is said and done FIAT currencies are going to be fucked and all governments are going to realize that they MUST back their currency by some sort of reserve asset. We really only have 3 options - Gold/Silver, Oil, and Bitcoin. Let's just disregard Oil because we all know oil is slowly on it's way out. With the way China is hoarding gold, I believe China will back it's new central bank digital currency by gold reserves. The whole world will start rethinking using the US Dollar backed by NOTHING (you can say army, but that's not going to work for long). The US isn't going to copy China and back their currency by Gold again imo, so I honestly think they'll choose Bitcoin (although I could easily be wrong).

\*

Anyways both Gold and Bitcoin are a good bet against FIAT currencies, the only problem is that when gold prices go up (demand goes up), a shitload more miners start mining gold and the price of Gold eventually comes back down to it's cost of production (and usually overshoots it to the downside due to human psychology). If gold becomes a reserve asset, governments will see these miners going out of business and subsidize them, which artificially decreased the cost of production, further decreasing the price of gold. Miners are NOT the friends of gold investors, they are the ""enemy.""

\*

Since only 900 Bitcoin are mined per day (currently 6.25 per block), if miners doubled network's hashrate tomorrow, the supply would remain the same. THIS IS HUGE. Miners are securing the network, which adds utility to Bitcoin. When utility is added, the intrinsic value of Bitcoin goes up, which causes a positive feedback loop for price. Miners are the FRIENDS of investors. This is a MASSIVE fundamental difference, not even taking into account the 21 million supply max vs. gold's infinite supply, the additional ease of transportation, digital utility, etc.

\*

If Bitcoin and Gold both become reserve assets, do I believe the Chinese government that they have the exact amount of gold in reserves as digitally-printed money? We have the ""trust"" that they're telling the public the truth. With Bitcoin, governments can provably verify their reserves and we don't have to ""trust"" them, anyone in the world can verify it for themselves. This is fundamentally superior in a world where lies are everywhere, at least you know your currency is sound.",1605449309,443,340

juh1f7,WiseBlueWhale,Am I getting scammed?,"Hi fellow bitcoin users, I just want to start of by saying there's very little I know about bitcoin and whatever I do know is because of my partner who's been doing it for years. 

Recently I've been job hunting and got hired by a company (let's call that company 'X') through a recruitment website, everything looked pretty legit at first and my starting day was supposed to be on 24th Nov 2020. Few days prior they sent me a wooping check of 2980$ before I've done a shread of work and said 'we're a trust based company' and that they wanted me to buy specific softwares and fax machines and laptops from their partner companies so I could make a mini office and work from home. The agreement said if I was terminated or quit I could only return the money and not the equipment which seemed a bit sus but I let it slide. 

Few days ago, they said 'okay no equipment, invest it in bitcoin' and that is exactly where I freaked out. Why would any company give out nearly 3k to a 'stranger' and ask them to invest that money in bitcoin. What's going on? 

I have contacted my bank to confirm if the 3k check was deposited and they said it was. 

TLDR; company I got hired at gave me nearly 3k before I even started work and asked me to invest that money in Bitcoin. What's goin on?",1605419352,16,1

&gt; With all the new users buying Bitcoin for the first time, I wanted to bring something to the community's attention, and I felt that this was the right time.

MoonPay is a payment processing system that allows fiat to crypto transfers. This is a good thing! We need more on ramps (may not actually now we have PayPal but I digress).

However, MoonPay is being very dishonest. Take a look at their TrustPilot page:

https://trustpilot.com/review/moonpay.io

The first red flag:

Reviews: 2,534 huh, that sure is a lot of reviews for a company that's only been in business since 2018. Coinbase only has 2,653, and they've been in business for far longer, and are more well known.

The second red flag, is that reviews are posted almost every hour. Take a look:

https://i.imgur.com/Oe1aR3F.png

Now, get this. 90% of the 5 star reviews are from accounts that have only made ONE review!

https://i.imgur.com/I36z1Em.png

And, they often have no profile picture!

Even weirder, they follow the same name scheme:

https://i.imgur.com/RPDCkIc.png

Now, I can't comment on how good or bad MoonPay's service is, but what I can say is if they're buying fake reviews, I wouldn't trust them with $5. This is a serious breach of trust!",1605413898,0,1

jueq15,Vegetable-Ad-4005,Why is Bitcoin worth anything?,"&amp;#x200B;

Let’s start by comparing Bitcoin to United States Dollar and Gold.

Bitcoin, US Dollars and Gold all have value because other people believe that they do. They have no objective value and are all social constructs.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin, USD, and Gold. Why are they worth something? For three mains reasons.

1. **Store of Value.**  
Store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved
2. **Medium of Exchange**  
A *medium of exchange* is an intermediary instrument or system used to facilitate the sale, purchase, or trade of goods between parties.
3. **Unit of Account**  
The value of something is measured in a specific currency. This allows different things to be compared against each other; for example, goods, services, assets, liabilities, labor, income, expenses  
We do all need some currency to store value, unit of account, and as a medium of exchange, unless we want to go back to bartering!  
Although bartering might be a lot of fun for a day, it would surely make everything a lot less efficient!

&amp;#x200B;

[Bartering](https://preview.redd.it/nm43b119fbz51.png?width=211&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07a212a8a6f981c803b61f2fbda7136a250da875)

**- United States Dollar.** The US Dollar is used as a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account.

The united states dollar does not have a limited supply. More money can be printed and created by the federal reserve and also by banks when they create loans.

&amp;#x200B;

[Creating Money](https://preview.redd.it/969yfeptgbz51.png?width=532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75608df064dfcc4d5177ee2cc31e7597c90eb3d7)

As more is created it might mean that the value goes down (inflation) and this might mean that over the long term it might not be a great store of value, compared to gold, or bitcoin, and there is usually a relationship between inflation, uncertainty and the rising value of alternatives as a store of value.

**Gold** \- Gold has previously been used as a medium of exchange in the form of gold coins but it is no longer used as a medium of exchange or store of account. The primary purpose of gold is as a store of value. With a limited supply, gold can act as a store of value and can protect against inflation.

Additional gold can only be found by mining (and there is a limit to how much gold can be mined from this planet). It can also be created from other elements but the process requires a nuclear reaction and it’s currently not profitable to do that.

While gold is limited on earth, it is possible that it can be found abundantly in space. Nasa is targeting a golden asteroid in 2022 that can have enough gold everyone on earth can a billionaire (or more likely to turn the gold industry into chaos) [NASA and SpaceX explore asteroid for gold and other metals](https://www.kidsnews.com.au/space/striking-gold-in-space-in-2022/news-story/951ffaefc679bbcc02eb7bb4bc592c62). 

It might be some time before space mining is realised but the prospect of finding abundant gold outside this planet in the future is a very real possibility

&amp;#x200B;

[Gold Asteroid](https://preview.redd.it/xw65kgtbfbz51.png?width=446&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb789cf1e883715557a35fe5d4e576839d43ef8d)

**BITCOIN** Bitcoin can be used as a medium of exchange and a store of value

As a medium of exchange, Bitcoin - can be exchanged digitally, internationally, and anonymously and securely. One challenge to bitcoins as a medium of exchange is the volatility and setting up the infrastructure - I don’t come across many places where I can use bitcoin or know of anyone who is trading with bitcoin.

I also read that there are some technical challenges to using bitcoin for exchange. It isn’t that efficient, slow and costly, and its not evolving fast.

The volatility of Bitcoin is also why it is challenging as a unit of account.

Bitcoin does have a limited supply. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. However, cryptocurrencies don’t have a limited supply. It is possible to create an infinite number of cryptocurrencies just like Bitcoin. Just like copying and pasting the code - For example, Bitcoin 2, 3 could be made etc.,. As of today there are 6,955 different cryptocurrencies.

What Bitcoin has that other cryptocurrencies doesn’t have, as the first mover, is a certain infrastructure and *community* but how valuable is that? Every dead currency has also had infrastructure and a community. Myspace had a pretty thriving community before Facebook existed. It is possible another, or many other superior cryptocurrencies could be created and replace bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Bitcoin worth compared to Gold and United States Dollar?**

**Gold - Store of Value** (with advantages)

Gold, has advantages compared to United States Dollar and Bitcoin as a store of value, gold has by far the longest history of the three and was recognised as far back as the ancient Egyptians as an object of beauty - representing a sungod but it was first used as a currency in 700 B.C.

Gold is deeply embedded into our cultural psychology and we can say that it does have some value of beauty that has survived throughout different cultures in our history and exists to this day which shouldn’t be underestimated.

Another advantage of gold is that it also has limited supply unlike the USD.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bitcoin - Store of Value &amp; Medium of Exchange (with advantages)**

Compared to the US Dollar it has advantages as a medium of exchange that also has a store of value (that has a limited supply unlike the United States Dollar).

Bitcoin serves a purpose as a store of value just like gold. The advantage compared to gold is that it can be used as ***both*** a store of value and a a medium of exchange (international, fast, anonymous money transfers). However it is quite new and it is remains to be seen how important this is as it is mostly used as a store of value now.

&amp;#x200B;

**United States Dollar** (medium of exchange with advantages and disadvantages, unit of account, and store of value) (with disadvantages)

The united states dollar main advantage is as a medium of exchange and unit of account. Bitcoin is not great as a medium of exchange and it is still easier in many circumstances to use US Dollar compared to bitcoin.

But Bitcoin does have some advantages as a medium of exchange (international, fast, anonymous money transfers).

For USD, as a store of value, with no limit on the supply, it is almost certain that as more is created USD becomes less valuable over time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why bitcoin is worth anything is the same reason that gold and united states dollars are worth anything - because we believe it is.**

Fiat currencies **do** have disadvantages as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Gold can only serve as a store of value, while bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) can serve as a store of value and medium of exchange.

Personally I think we don’t fully have one currency that fully works globally as both a medium of exchange AND store of value AND unit of account. So there is space for something new and better that may or may not be based off blockchain technology. 

Currencies have come and gone in the past, and it’s totally possible that a new superior digital currency could be created in the future to replace them all.

However, exactly how much they’re worth and if they’re worth anything depends entirely on how we use them and on what we all think they’re worth.",1605408844,72,1

Then as bitcoin keeps increasing in price and becomes the standard currency everyone has to have a bitcoin address, same as a bank account, this new address would of course be associated to your identity. You also have your old address with the bitcoin hodled so hard that is not kyc. The government could see and track all deposits done to official bitcoin addresses of people and institutions. As soon as you used your non kyc bitcoin to purchase anything they would be linked to you. So the non kyc would only be good to trade with other non kyc addresses, nothing official allowed and trading to an already known address could show a new address alert to investigate thus quickly discovering every address and who it belongs to. Also if you buy anything with shipping you would have to enter your address, that would also be a really quick giveaway as to who the address owner is.

Am I wrong in my thoughts? Cause it looks like any attempt to hide by avoiding KYC would become useless as soon as bitcoin becomes important enough for governments to track.",1605405468,9,1

Then i contacted them again 1 week later, then i get an email saying that i should not have shared my 24 word recovery phrase and it is the same as giving away your credit card pin code (by the way i got this mail after, i lost my money). My bank application does inform me when there are some kind of attack which Ledger didn't do through there application (Ledger live) .

jyasy6,MadgeSpeaks,Exploring Bitcoin during a K trip.,"Once a month during Lockdown, for a reset and spiritual practice, my partner and I use substances to explore and dicuss the month that has been. Given we are living, working and growing 24/7 in the same house right now, it has been a useful tool.

Last night when I got into that ""in between"" space on K (Psuchonauts will know what I mean), I brought in the intention of Bitcoin to explore. 

Suddenly, time and space stopped. I was transported into a different matrix environment where all this energy appeared and sent love with the celebration ""you've got it, you've worked it out, now help spread it"".

Hard to say if this was just my own intentions manifesting or messages from the ether. 

What I came out of the experience with was ""Bitcoin is a state of being"". The language really does an injustice here doesn't it? ""Bitcoin"".

It was a useful name to get things started but it's true nature is camouflaged linguistically. This is part of the puzzle and makes it brilliant. 

It's a bit like the maze in Westworld on the road to discovering consciousness.

Bitcoin is really the Akashic Records of this realm that holds and encrypts the efforts you bring to the advancement of humanity. Amazing idea to connect with.

The other thing I left with is ""bitcoin"" can be used as a mantra during meditation practices.

Does this make sense? Have you also had this experience or connection to the deeper meaning?

&amp;#x200B;

HODL for life.

jya9jy,CrashOverride93,[HELP] Freeze BTC/ETH value into Stable Coins?,"Hi all,

I  have a question about keeping (""freezing"") the value of BTC, ETH (or  any other altcoin) into a stable coin. So, when them (BTC, ETH, ...) are  high, convert it into some stable coin to keep its value at the time of  selling (ex.: BTC to USDT); then, when the price goes down enough, buy  it again. (ex.: USDT to BTC).

By  now, I was only storing (holding) all the BTCs and other alts mined  (also bought). But I was looking for getting deeper into the world of  ""trading"", but in terms of trying to keep the value of my coins in the  role play game of: selling high, buying low.

I  was looking at the following stable coins (or considered as previous  ones) to work with: USDT, USDC, DAI, SUSD, TUSD, ...), but I'm not  really sure about which one to choose to do what I would like to  achieve. Also, if I'm in the right road...

Another question, related to the same...

Is  the same, exchanging coin to stable\_coin within an exchange platform  (ie: Exodus Exchange system) as selling/buying from a specific exchange  platform (ie: Binance)?

jya4xp,the420chronicler,Halvings put upward pressure on the value of each additional Bitcoin created by Miners.,"But this is a complicated way of explaining Bitcoin to a noob. It’s much easier to get people comfortable with the concept of scarcity. But dig deeper as you’ll see why the halvings and stock to flow matter.

BTC Miners get paid via block rewards for the electricity they contribute, which has increased over time, but the block rewards get cut in half every four years. Therefore, the value of each additional bitcoin must be commensurate with the value of electricity contributed to produce an additional bitcoin. Because of this, the marginal benefits of each additional bitcoin produced and marginal costs to produce an additional bitcoin converge over long periods of time. 

This is why stock to flow is a valuable lens to analyze the Bitcoin market through. Sure efficient market theory suggests this should be priced in, but the world is messy. Asymmetries abound. Knowledge is not distributed evenly.",1605962693,3,1

\- **March** and **April** are statistically the best month to buy! (I repeated the analysis with standarized values, see below).  


&amp;#x200B;

[Prcie$ by Month. Month 3 and 4 are statistically different in comparission to the first month.](https://preview.redd.it/tkni1brtik061.png?width=865&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e5f3986a0e4a20dd454b417ab10b1fcb152a665)

\- Each **year** is normaly better that the last one. Surprise :D  
\- The **day** is not relevant  


However, these analyses are skewed because of the differents scales, so i Z transformed the price for each year.   
Importantly, here we can descriptively see the price pattern for each year, and 2020 seem to be like 2015 and 2016.

In a tweet, Williams announced that he sold his 2007 Chevrolet Suburban for 0.4 BTC. At the time of writing, this is worth $7,200 with bitcoin at $18,000. The price of a used 2007 Suburban may range from $5,975 to $7,950. If the price would go up to $130,000, Williams’s old car will be worth 7 times its supposed market price. But of course, it will still depend if bitcoin will reach the predicted price.

k05rzt,pushinbombadils,"Inflation, BTC, and Exchanges","Hi - first time poster here, but I've been following crypto since around 2014. I genuinely believe BTC will hit 100,000 USD within the next two years, and much, much higher in the longer term. I typically don’t have much to add to the conversation, but since the institutional money has been pouring in over the past few months and most trading apps now offer crypto (in some form), I’ve been having a passing thought that I couldn’t quite form into an idea until the past couple of days of reading commenters’ discourse across trading apps.  

This bull run doesn’t feel like 2017 all over again, since BTC and crypto are now accessible to anyone with a trading platform/app. New investors on exchanges are throwing their money at crypto, and they’re being pressured to do so by institutions now having so much flexibility to offer it (and consolidating the wealth, which I'm sure they are loving). However, the theme I’ve noticed regarding crypto in trading comments section of apps I use has been... ignorance? Lots of new buyers are treating it like a stock in a company; they don’t know what BTC is or how decentralized currency works. To a lot of new buyers it’s an investment vehicle - not a store of value outside the control of centralized currencies - and they are *absolutely* going to cash out at some point.

So – assuming day to day “movement” occurring over exchanges and institutions accelerates, what happens when too many people try to cash out at the same time on a major exchange if the value inflates too fast and the value of commodities can’t keep up - say if the price quickly moves to 10x, 20x, 50x the current perceived value. My initial thought was a flash crash style scenario, where the faulty exchange goes under for not holding the value of underlying asset in a reserve currency; but if the volume drops enough and people start jumping ship from one exchange to another trying to cash out (like dominoes, a run on exchanges), then that poses the risk of an inflation feedback loop. The people who want to cash out can’t, and HODLers/investment institutions absolutely refuse to – and why would they, because BTC is now in the millions, and going up. But if volume limits toward 0 and the value goes up so far and so fast that no one can use the currency, then the value detangles itself from perceived reality, near infinite inflation occurs, public faith erodes, and crypto collapses.

They have no intrinsic value and are involved in the large part of every criminal activity from drug and human trafficking, weapon, wars, you name it. For its distribution, fiat currencies use heavy and highly discretional commercial banking infrastructures that have been found many times responsible of money laundry schemes and that consume a lot of energy consumption which cause pollution.  Their paper and coin form is a danger for the public health, carrying around a lot of pathogenic agents.

Please invest in fiat the amount of satoshis you can afford to lose.  

For a little perspective in 2011 you could buy 1 USD only if you paid a whole BTC but today that USD is worth 0.000055 BTC.

We all have doubts about the global economy and its ability to support us. We are looking for opportunities to support ourselves, and there are lots of bank programs that respond to the request.

Digital Asset Investment Management (DAiM), the first registered advisor for digital assets, announced a retirement plan with Bitcoin. The 401(k) retirement plan has been tested since October 2019, and the company states that people’s interest in investing into this program is growing.  
DAiM acts as an advisor and administrator, it helps companies to create a model offering. DAiM works together with Gemini Trust, this helps to deal with the BTC custody. Bitcoin funds are stored in a cold custody portfolio. The main difference between this fund and the existing ones is that people are able to withdraw their assets at any time they want.

k03s5s,77rtserg,Privacy,"I've been researching this topic for the last month or so and asked many questions (some in this reddit, sometimes using another handle). It's hard to get a guide a to z guide about privacy. Still, I got a lot of bits and pieces that taught me how BTC is *not* private by default, what's mixing it and what's coinjoin in general, what services are better than other for that, etc.   


Below is what is, more or less, my workflow. I hope someone here who has privacy in mind will read, shake (or nod?) their head, and add their feedback and opinion.  


My current idea of keeping my bitcoin activities private: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. use coinbase to get BTC from my bank account. Super non-private... but easy.
2. send the money in chunks of different sizes to wallets I have on Bisq
3. send the money from these wallets to wasabi wallets
4. use wasabi to send the money through coinjoin
5. get the money back from coinjoin in different chunks (I understand this happens automatically?)
6. add and subtract the above chunks to different chunks (mixing?) and send these to a  product
7. on the company I'm getting service from (say a VPN), credit will be added from different transactions until I have enough for purchase. 

I haven't done any of this before. I'm currently at step 2. Can't send money directly to wasabi because bitcoin doesn't ""understand"" the addresses, this is known, this is why Bisq. Also, the transaction offered on Bisq are largely not transaction I can use (zelle, for example), so I can't use it directly. 

Questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Would this work in terms of privacy and anonymizing the money? Is there a glaring hole somewhere?
2. Is there a way to make this easier and shorter (and cost less in transactions)? 
3. if you answered #2 with yes... how do you do it? mind sharing a workflow?

k03a2x,cryptosuviio,Satoshi’s thoughts re: self rebasing currencies implemented: velotoken.fi,"Satoshi Nakamoto himself described that self-rebasing currencies would be the ideal implementation of digital currency. 

Rebase projects like Ampleforth have tried to do this by pegging AMPL to the US dollar.  Velotoken is an advancement over ampleforth as it pegs the token price to a economic principal that is intrinsic to token usage (i.e. the velocity of the currency). 

Satoshi Nakamoto said: 

""...indeed there is nobody to act as a central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would require a trusted third party to determine the value, because I don't know of a way to for software to know the real world value of things. If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that.""

[satoshi](https://preview.redd.it/ik4h4blhhmd51.jpg?width=730&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26604d7fa17b1ad62d0d0a1d2cff8924fe0b7475)


Ampleforth partially solves this problem by integration with Chainlink, but Velotoken takes it one step further and removes the need for outside oracle of any kind to determine value. Nor does it need pegging to an external currency (USD). Rather, velocity, which essentially boils down to usage (i.e. transactions), can serve as an intrinsic pegging of the token value.

This project is distributing the tokens now. Once rebases start in December, we will see what happens.

Turns out bitcoin consumes enough power to power an entire nation. Bitcoin consumes about 77.78 TWh of annual energy, a similar amount is consumed by the nation of Chile. 

As for a single bitcoin transaction, it takes about the same energy to run 730K VISA transactions.

I'm based in Germany and looking for the cheapest exchange I can buy Bitcoins from to store it immediately after on my Ledger Nano X. Fairly new to this topic, but so far I learned that I shouldn't trust any exchange, especially if I want to hodl. Doesn't need to be an anonymous exchange and should also offer Ethereum if possible. Also, if you have any better suggestions than the Ledger Nano X as my hard wallet please let me know. 

So far I have been buying my cryptos from BISON, which has sometimes a (kinda) okay spread of only 0.7-1.0%. With Coinbase I could reduce this through their Coinbase Pro model to 0.5% as far as I understood the concept. Binance is also an option here, but there I can't somehow find their fees and register on their website. 

Highly appreciated and keep hodling :)",1606472650,13,1

k1xxzc,Rachel_Pham,Please help me with Bitcoin or Ethereum!,"  

My family has been facing difficult financial hardship because my father unexpectedly left my family. He stopped supporting my family’s living expenses and left us a big amount of debt. In my culture, a father’s responsibility provides the main financial resource for the whole family while a mother and children are dismissive of him. Therefore, our family is facing a big financial burden for our survival due to his left. I also had to stop my studies as my family is unable to afford my academic expenses. My family and I have been trying so hard to find a job but the situation is more challenging due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I tried to reach out to many local financial aids and money donation organizations but there is likely not much help. My family and I are very stressed and depressed and we only hope if magic will happen to us. Luckily, I know by chance that there are many donators who want to donate Bitcoin or Ethereum for free in the world so I am trying my luck to ask for Bitcoin or Ethereum. Please financially help us overcome this tough time. I promise that if my family and I will be able to survive after this time, I will give back to the community to help others. Thank you for your time reading my words and I hope I will hear positive news from you.

I believe that we will ""Silently"" break an all-time high within the coming 30 days. It seems like bitcoin news is not being covered and that institutional investors are getting their fair share of Bitcoin prior to retail making another entry into the market.

I have googled this company and I can’t find anything negative or shady about them but they only surfaced in July of this year.

Then I wanted to ask about ATMs, I have one near me and I think its the easiest way to buy, the only thing is about checking the transaction at the same moment, for that I thought to use a normal wallet with an android app and then transfer to my long term wallet. What do you think about that?

One last question, how is it possible to track a transaction, lets say I only use once the public address once, then I move those btc to another wallet, is it possible to know that the original public key does not have the btc anymore? or in other words, is it possible to know that my long term wallet received btc?",1604782698,5,1

jpo2so,financeoptimum,The Petrodollar Era - What is the Endgame?,"After World War II, a new international monetary system called Bretton Woods was created.

Bretton Woods established three main things:

(1) the U.S. dollar was to be an international reserve currency, 

(2) the U.S. dollar would be backed by gold at a price of $35 per ounce, and 

(3) any country could exchange dollars for gold.

&amp;#x200B;

Countries running trade surpluses with the US sought to exchange their dollars for gold, and this rapidly shrunk US gold reserves. 

This then led to the so called Nixon shock - President Richard Nixon effectively ending the Bretton Woods system in 1971.

The world economy entered a new era: the US Dollar became the global reserve currency.

&amp;#x200B;

The US made no effort to rein in deficit spending, in fact quite the opposite.

Therefore, the US needed to continue to find ways to sell government debt (i.e. to find buyers of US Treasury Securities) *without* driving up interest rates.

That is, the US needed more buyers for its debt.

But by 1974, the enormous flood of dollars from the US into top-oil-exporter Saudi Arabia suggested a solution.

That year, Nixon sent new US Treasury secretary William Simon to Saudi Arabia with a mission...

The task: neutralize crude oil as an economic weapon against the US and find a way to persuade a relatively hostile kingdom to finance America's widening deficit with its newfound petrodollar wealth.

&amp;#x200B;

The basic framework was simple: the US would buy oil from Saudi Arabia and provide the kingdom military aid and equipment.

In return, the Saudis would plow billions of their petrodollar revenue back into US Treasuries and therefore finance America's spending.

A win-win: the Saudis would receive protection from geopolitical enemies, and the US would get a new place to unload large amounts of government debt.

This became known as ""petrodollar recycling"".

By *spending* on oil, the US was creating new demand for US debt and US dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, since Saudi Arabia dominated the OPEC - the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries - this dollar deal was extended to OPEC overall, which meant that the dollar became the preferred currency for oil purchases worldwide.

And so the petrodollar era began.

This petrodollar system has had *massive* implications for US foreign policy, which has essentially involved imposing 'freedom' on any major oil-exporting state that moves towards ending its reliance on dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2000, Saddam Hussein, then-president of Iraq, announced that Iraq was moving to sell its oil in Euros instead of dollars.

Following a particular catalyst event in 2001, the US invaded Iraq, deposed Saddam Hussein, and converted Iraqi oil sales back to the US dollar.

Of course, this exact pattern was repeated with Gaddafi when he attempted to create a unified African currency backed by Libyan gold reserves to sell African oil.

Shortly after his announcement, rebels armed by the US Government and allies overthrew the dictator and his regime.

After his death, the idea that African oil would be sold on something other than the dollar quickly died out.

Other regimes that have called for abandoning the petrodollar include Iran and Venezuela. 

The US has called for regime change in both of these countries...

&amp;#x200B;

Although they have tried to keep it under wraps, Saudi Arabia is believed to be one of America's largest foreign creditors.

Undoubtedly, Saudi holdings of US debt and other assets are significant.

All else being equal, the US should be growing less dependent on foreign holders of debt, certainly in terms of Saudi and OPEC-held debt, since the global role of OPEC and the Saudis has been diminishing in terms of global market share.

But all else *isn't* equal, and the US has been piling on ever-larger amounts of debt in recent years. 

In 2019, for example, the annual deficit topped *one trillion*. 

&amp;#x200B;

This immense growth in debt obviously makes the US regime more sensitive to changes in demand for US debt, and ever more reliant on foreign demand for both US debt and US dollars. 

In order to avoid a crisis, the US must ensure that interest rates remain low and that foreigners want to acquire both US dollars and US debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Were petrodollars and petrodollar recycling to disappear, it would have a twofold effect on US government finances: 

First of all, a sizable decline in petrodollar recycling would put significant *upward* pressure on interest rates. 

The result would be a budget crisis for the US government, as it would have to devote ever-larger amounts of the federal budget to payments on the debt. 

(The other option would be to have the US central bank monetize the debt by purchasing ever-larger amounts of it to make up for a lack of foreign demand. But this would lead to growing price inflation.)

Furthermore, if participants began to exit the petrodollar system (and, say, sell oil in euros instead) demand for dollars would drop, exacerbating any scenarios in which the central bank is monetizing the debt.  

This would also generally contribute to greater price inflation, as fewer dollars will be sucked out of the US by foreign holders.

The result could be ongoing declines in government spending on services, and growing price inflation. 

The US regime's ability to finance its debt would decline significantly, and the US would need to pull back on military commitments, pensions, and more. 

Either that, or keep spending at the same rate and face an inflationary spiral.

&amp;#x200B;

Or...how about another option?

Anyone fancy a Great Reset?

jnma0b,Jazzlike-Fun-4500,Tom Hagen case,"As you might know Tom Hagen is still a suspect of faking a kidnapping/murdering his wife. A murder plot involving bitcoin.

The plot involves ransom money in Monero and conversations in with the alleged kidnappers in Bitcoin. The case is still unsolved after two years, but the police are optimistic.

1. The police have spoken with the alleged kidnappers in Bitcoin. Just a few sentences. The killers/kidnappers have re-used bitcoin adresses, which i understand is a bad thing for them?

2. The kidnappers have re-used the money that have transfered to open up the conversations. From my understanding that is a data point that might reveal them?

3. What are the odds the police can find their identity or would they be able to hide behind burner computers and such?

I sent a fairly large amount of Bitcoin over a week ago with a pretty fast confirmation speed. Normally, this wouldn't take longer than 30 minutes to confirm. However, after over a week it's still showing up as unconfirmed.

Also, although I sent this transfer on October 27th, the send date keeps updating to more recent dates. Really strange.

Is there some way to resolve this, or at least to calculate how long it will take to be confirmed? It's never taken this long before.

I recently traded 10 bch to exchange for trueUSD.  When I traded, BCH was valued at $268.00.  I was given a trade value of $2610 which equated to a $70 loss.  Additionally, I was given a $44 TrueUSD fee.  After these fees, I expected to have $2576 transferred.  Instead, I received $2513.  Can someone explain to me where the extra $61 went?

Lastly (hoping for help from the pros here), I am following a strategy where I buy bch at $210 and sell at $265.  My cycle is as follows:
Buy bch using trueUSD at $210
Hold bch until it reaches $265
Trade bch for TrueUSD.

This pattern equates to a profit of $55 per bch before all of the fees.  However, based on the above, I am losing about $28 of those profits to fees.  Is there a better way to hold the value of bitcoin when selling at a high point?  Are there better wallets than the one I am using that would have lower fees?  I was previously given advice that I can transfer my bch to online poker sites and cash out when I value drops to $210 to avoid trade fees, but don’t want to do this for obvious reasons.

I appreciate all the help Bitcoin community!

I have been around since 2017 or so but never thought of BTC as more than a way to make more Fiat.  Now I am actually starting to understand BTC for itself, and not as a mechanism just to make more dollars.

Just finished bitcoin billionaires and am now listening to 'the bitcoin standard' audiobook.

My biggest question :  It doesn't seem like BTC is very effective yet at being used as actual money.  In the bitcoin standard, at the beginning of the book when he is going through all the different currencies through out history, their primary purpose and function was the ability to be used for buying goods and services.  BTC obviously meets many other criterias, and exceeds many such as gold, seashells,  usd etc...  

From what I can tell BTC is no more usable today than three years ago.  What is being done right now to make it more usable?  I think the network still clogs easily etc?

Will there be a day when BTC core increases the block size but does it in a way that doesn't create a war in the community like Ver did?  

Or are we no longer trying to use BTC as day to day currency and only adopting the 'store of value' narrative?

These are genuine questions and I would appreciate non trolling genuine answers

jqjb3e,LongPastDueDate,Defining Bitcoin?,"Everyone’s pretty excited about Bitcoin right now, myself included.  But when I try to think about where it goes from here (up or down, fast or slow), and draw comparisons to other asset classes like stocks, commodities like gold, or fiat currencies, I get stuck on the question “What exactly does Bitcoin *do*?”

If I try to think of Bitcoin as an asset like a stock, the valuation doesn’t make sense because it can’t be measured in terms of production or sales.  There’s no price to earnings ratio.

If I try to think of Bitcoin as a commodity like gold, the valuation models seems a little better owing to Bitcoin’s scarcity and fixed quantity.  I’ve heard expert investors make this very comparison.  But gold is also valued for it physical beauty (art, jewelry) and its functionality (electronics), while Bitcoin doesn’t have much physical functionality yet in the real world.  (I said “yet”, so don’t hate on me.)  Why should I value the scarcity of a thing if that thing is of no use to me?

And that brings me to the comparison of Bitcoin to fiat currencies.  It might have  value me if I can trade it for other things that I want.  Even taking into account its immaturity from a global adoption perspective, which would eventually bring more applications and real world interfaces, I don’t see using Bitcoin any time soon to buy a cup of coffee or even a car.  The very blockchain that makes Bitcoin so powerful and trustworthy also makes it cumbersome for everyday micro-transactions.

So what does Bitcoin *do*?  Will it get over its slowness and cumbersome use cases to find a real world usage niche?  Will I eventually use Bitcoin to buy coffee?  Or will it become the value basis for a more usable digital or physical currency, like gold is the value basis for the dollar (and yes, I know how loose and uncertain a basis that is!), while trading quietly behind the scenes?

I tend to think Bitcoin still needs a “killer app” to be developed that can showcase its utility in the real world, but I don’t know what that app would be.  Is there one already?  Or am I missing some vital aspect of Bitcoin beyond its scarcity that doesn’t need it to “do” anything at all in order to still make it valuable?  If so, what is that aspect?

I would truly like to know what you all think.",1604868698,18,1

You can import multiple Bitcoin wallets (Trezor, Ledger, Electrum, etc.) into the app and see all your transactions by only exposing the master public key. It can calculate and show you all the Bitcoin addresses you own base on the master public key you imported.

You can also add labels to Transactions and Addresses.

It supports SegWit (addresses beginning with 3) and Native Segwit (addresses beginning with bc1) so ypub and zpub are also supported in addition to xpub.

I find this app pretty useful for myself, and I hope this app could also be useful for you.

Anyway, the thing is I'm surprised by the low liquidity of their markets. I've never seen more than 100 offers in the popular fiat currency markets. So I'm wondering:

* Why do you think this is? What could be done to make it more popular?
* Is there any p2p/decentralized alternative to bisq that has (significant) better liquidity?",1604252851,11,1

I have been searching for a great watch only Bitcoin wallet on iOS for years, and I have finally found one recently: **“Coldbit Pro”**. You can find it by **searching ""Coldbit"" on the App Store**.

You can import multiple Bitcoin wallets (Trezor, Ledger, Electrum, etc.) into the app and see all your transactions by only exposing the master public key.

You can also add labels to Transactions and Addresses.

It supports SegWit (addresses beginning with 3) and Native Segwit (addresses beginning with bc1) so ypub and zpub are also supported in addition to xpub.

I find this app pretty useful for myself, and I hope this app could also be useful for you.

Next, store them  securely (well hidden) in geographically separate locations, in case of  fire, flood, tornado, volcano, etc.  Write a somewhat cryptic note to  yourself to remind you where you hid the papers.  Consider storing each  paper in water-tight plastic (eg, ziploc bag) in case the hiding place  gets wet (a pipe breaks, roof leaks, etc.) or to thwart insects from  literally eating holes in the paper.  Check on each of them, from time  to time, just in case.

In ADDITION  to that (not ""instead of""), memorize your seed phrase.  It isn't  difficult at all.  For example, quietly recite it to yourself every time  you take a shit, from now on.  Better to have it (memorized) and not  need it than to need it and not have it.  

There are other excellent ideas for storing a backup of your seed phrase (one, for example, involves using a punch to hammer a morse-code-like message into something more or less permanent).

jmyjur,airseasky,How Bitcoin Has Performed Throughout the Pandemic (With Graphs),"As the market enters another Bitcoin era, today we look at how $BTC is doing during times of the pandemic. From year to date, Bitcoin has outperformed traditional assets. Is this surprising or not? 

Let's say you bought $100 of Bitcoin on 01/01/20. It would have grown to $190 on 10/28/20. 🙌 If you placed your $100 in the Nasdaq 100 or the Dollar Index, your balance would be $133 and $96, respectively.

[See how $BTC compares to assets like commodities and equities](https://preview.redd.it/ssvvwwvzqww51.png?width=1658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d7e39ec6c2a74fe014b9de3e03e5485c3e5177)

The orange line indicates BTC performance, which dropped to heart-palpitating lows when COVID19 spread in the US, but reached a new record for 2020, at the end of October

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rw6alut4rww51.png?width=2056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=405123ec40677fa7865be925b31b075519ff99e7

At the start of 2020, BTC strongly correlated with commodities, but broke away in October — potentially from a risk-aversion to traditional markets due to a surge in COVID cases and political environments.

https://preview.redd.it/i4yumb67rww51.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72fef7d90d931a49ce8fdf8315890f93738c57cb

Also, Bitcoin showed significant correlation with the equity markets in Q1, mostly because all markets sold off in a flight to liquidity. However, once financial stimulus packages were announced, asset prices recovered rapidly.

&amp;#x200B;

As shown here, BTC's correlations with gold and silver dropped drastically after the PayPal crypto announcement.

jmxn5l,anonamonkey,Bought some crypto from Paypal and I’m a little disappointed,"I am a fairly seasoned bitcoiner at this point and wanted to test the waters to see how Paypal was allowing folks to get into crypto. So I bought 5 bucks of crypto from them just to see what it was like.

To make a long story short, though it’s a cool first step, what they have done seems very confusing and rudimentary. I really don’t get why someone would want to use Paypal to invest in crypto at this point. The only capabilities they seem to have are to 1) buy BTC from Paypal directly or 2) sell it back to them once you have it. The only good part of the experience was that there were no fees to buy it, though the price I paid for it was slightly higher than the going rate. However, there are no seed phrases given to me, there are no transfers to external wallets, and selling back has a hefty 2.9% fee payable to Paypal. It just feels like my dummy test investment money is lost in limbo and it just made me think, if it’s not behind my keys, it isn’t my bitcoin. It wasn’t a very good feeling.

Anyone else try it? Curious on your thoughts...",1604355533,74,1

US election is ending soon and we know that Biden is going to win by now, and I'm not really sure that he's the best president for the economy. Anyway, my concern is what will happen to the Bitcoin value if  it inflates too much like it happened in other countries? 

Lots of countries are trying to get rid of the dollar to have more independence.

Let's say tomorrow the Dollar looses 50% of it's value, Bitcoin will still be worth 13K but half in other currencies such has the Euro or the Yuan.

jrud5c,thebitcoiner2020,Just a little rant.,"I explained Bitcoin to my family and they decided that they wanted to invest. They have a bit of cash to invest since it's in an ISA earning a chocolate bar per year and they're unsatisfied. By the way, 

Anyway, my mother went ahead, created an account, enabled 2FA, and tested a small transfer. Then she went to add the amount she wanted to transfer and as expected, it got blocked. The rant starts here:

Firstly, you have to give a bunch of information, she does that, and then the guy on the phone asks again. Pretty standard stuff. Then after explaining that she has had her transaction blocked, they forward her to the fraud department... where she is on hold for an hour before it cuts out.

She tries again. 45 minutes later, she is talking to someone giving all her security info again. Already we're kinda annoyed, but anyway, they ask what she's doing and my mum bless her is not very assertive and whenever there's someone around and she is uncomfortable, she goes into ""tell me what to do and what to say"" mode. We're all keeping our mouths shut because she is on loudspeaker and we know that she has to convince them that she is not being coerced.

They ask who she's paying she says ""Coinba- Coinbose, Coinbase"". They ask why, she says ""investment"" (not ""I'm going to seize an investment opportunity"" or ""I have an account with them and I'm transferring money to that account"") so they ask again, she says ""for investment"", they ask what she's investing in and my dad blerts out ""Bitcoin"". That's where they ask if its her own decision and whether she is being told what to say. She tells them that her son recommended it (but also changes how she phrases it a couple of times making it sound shady). They say ""Do you understand that Bitcoin won't double your money?"" -- 1. That's a shitty way to say it, it isn't guaranteed, but it also isn't guaranteed to not grow. 2. This is where my mum should have said she understands the risks, that Bitcoin is volatile, but she instead froze. So my dad motions for her to talk and she says ""I know what it is and I am happy to pay them"" (my mum isn't the best at phrasing). So they put her on hold and then finally tell her she will need to go to the branch to unfreeze her account.

My dad gets it, he's going with her tomorrow, but FFS, this was a stressful and annoying series of events. I really hope they don't just assume that she is being ""coerced"" by her husband or something.

Sorry, just needed to rant. I've been using Bitcoin for about 3 years, not exactly a seasoned veteran, but I wanted my family to gain the way I am, and they're being responsible by not investing any and everything. We have a small amount of Mortgage left, that my dad is keeping in case he wants to borrow for my sister to buy a home... otherwise we could just own the house, and the Bank decides to interrogate my mum, and deny her the right to transfer her money.

I get they are protecting her from scams and such, but I think the main thing that ticked me off was the way the lady didn't say ""Do you understand the risks of investing in a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin"" or ""Do you understand that Bitcoin is highly volatile and can drop to zero""... she said ""Do you know that Bitcoin isn't going to double your investment?"" (something like that, I just remember it was a shitty way to say it).",1605044720,22,1

jrsriy,Xanaxtastrophy,Yubikey U2F,"So I got a Yubikey thinking that it would help me protect myself, but as I’m using it with multiple services it’s becoming apparent that it’s almost impossible to use it as intended most of the time.

What is the point of having a U2F like Yubikey if the service mandates that you maintain a 2FA like Authy as a security key on your account. Your security is only as strong as it’s weakest link and some services (notably Gemini and 1Password) are forcing you to keep the weakest link intact. What the fuck? Why even bother offering U2F as an option?

Am I missing something here? Is Yubikey not worth it at all really?

Don't worry about me. I practise ironclad opsec, I do NOT surf adult sites or anything sensitive or dangerous, and my mic and camera are unplugged and in my drawer, only plugged in at need. So there is no basis to these claims. Other people might believe it though and might send Bitcoin to that address, hence my warning.

Interestingly, the email is written is good, prescriptive English, with no orthographical or grammatical errors that I can detect. A mixture of American and British idiom though.

If mining bitcoin is so expesive to keep it decentralized we have to pay the miners. Since we pay miners around 900bitcoin per day that is 328500 bitcoins per year going to the miners. Thus the total amount of coins has increased and our existing bitcoins have been deluted. IMO this delution is a form of inflation for bitcoin. 328500/21 000 000=1.56% yearly inflation rate.

jrpbzl,johnwick3,How long until Bitcoin overtakes gold?,"You know, something hit me this morning...pretty much the vast majority of people born from 2000 to now, if not further back than that, would much rather have Bitcoin than gold already.

Gold has thousands of years as a store of value and being hard money.  However, it obviously presents issues such as portability and divisibility, not to mention... nobody can verify how much is actually out there... and... it's still being mined today.

All that being said, it's pretty clear to me that gold will now largely go away as more and more people transition to an overwhelmingly digital world.  Of course, gold still has use cases beyond being money, but... enough to justify the price now?  No, not even close.

Does Bitcoin not essentially kill gold damn near entirely as a store of value, long term?  I think so.  Why wouldn't it?  Bitcoin is 'harder' money, and it's more difficult to confiscate. 

How much longer until Bitcoin essentially supplants gold as the global 'standard' for hard money?

I think it's inevitable... as more and more old people die off, that belief in gold will fade as the belief in Bitcoin rises.  

I mean, we're talking, what? 40 or 50 years at the absolute latest, if not significantly sooner?

This time though, nothing.   Somehow this run up hasn't hit the popular conscious.   I can't see how that's not going to happen eventually though if the increase keeps happening.   I know timing is never smart or easy, but just wanted peoples opinion, does it look to you like this is a good chance to catch the next wave, waiting for the inevitable boost when BTC hits the mainstream conscious again?

He bought them back when they were about $250 a piece.

I've had two different people who I know well (who also know him well) that have confirmed he has this much. Thing is, he doesn't know me well. We're just acquaintances but I see him from time to time. 

Knowing he was into Bitcoin, I decided to strike up a conversation by saying **""So I hear you're a fan of Bitcoin. It's been doing well lately hasn't it?.""** 

He says **""Well, I suppose I follow it a little bit, I don't have much, like a few hundredth of a Bitcoin""**. I knew he was lying, but I thought ""Good on you man, you don't know me that well so you're not revealing how much you have. Smart move."" 

I continued with the pleasantries and followed suit with him by saying **""Yeah, I don't have much either, but it sure is an interesting technology and I'm excited to see where it leads""**.   


He showed great OPSEC in that situation, however, he made the mistake of telling multiple people in the past how much Bitcoin he has and people talk. Even if you trust the person you tell to never rob you, all it takes is for them tell to tell the wrong person or for that news to travel to the wrong people.   


I recently watched a youtube video about [the case of Michael Carruth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSEtfm9cEUg). He was a bail bondsman who recruited criminals to help him with his plans. You see, folks around town were talking about people they knew who might have money and Michael Carruth was listening. He and his criminal recruits robbed and murdered two different families because of the cash that was rumored they had on hand.

In one case, they forced a man to surrender the cash he had hidden in his closet (around $40,000) and then they took him &amp; his 12-year-old son out to the woods, slit his throat, fired 3 rounds into the head of his 12-year-old son, threw them into the same grave and proceeded to bury them both. Luckily, the Dad survived, he dug his way out of the grave and was able to find help, survive, and get the killers convicted.   


That crime was over $40,000. Might as well have been $10,000 or $20,000. Bitcoin will probably hit $20,000 again someday and more. Even if you only own a fraction of a Bitcoin, don't tell anyone how much you have, and be very selective about who you discuss it with.",1605014462,93,1

It could go up as bitcoin gets mined at a slower rate so the amount in circulation is mostly what’ll be in circulation from there on. This wall could make the value of having any bitcoin at all greater.

It could go down because with the lessened rate miners will go elsewhere and we will see transactions fees go up a lot. Given that plenty of other crypto’s offer everything btc does, I can see people starting to peel away from btc.

I imagine both will happen. At first people will peel away, and this will negatively impact price. But a core of bitcoiners will continue to remain and the notion of having btc as it gets released slower and slower will become somewhat appealing to the crypto community. This could have a positive impact on the price. I have absolutely no guess on where I think price will stabilize around this time. Just speculating on some things.

I am a 19 year old, living with my parents in a country where if I don’t own or rent a apartment, the government doesn’t provide any documents to verify my residential address. 
I’m not sure how it is in other countries but isn’t it similar ?
I provided them my passport, selfie with passport and a selfie with a writing they asked me to write on a piece of paper. Basically enough proof to let them know I am not a hacker or impersonator. 

u/freewallethelp replied to my previous post saying they will help me out(Typical PR response to deceive the mass) but when I contacted them, they were utterly useless. 

They will make you repeat all your answer 5 times minimum.
The whole experience dealing with them is literally taking a toll on my mental health. I can’t sleep or rest. They are mentally torturing me with their robotic/irrelevant replies.

I know it is totally my fault - Don’t own keys, not your coins.

If you have been scammed by Freewallet, message me so I have a strong proof to shut them down and follow with a court case to get back at them!

I may or may not know what I'm talking about, so I'm posting here for feedback and constructive criticism. Thanks in advance!  


*Your bitcoin resides on the ""blockchain""..... up there in the sky somewhere, accessed with ""keys"" attached to a wallet.* 

*If you are currently keeping  your bitcoin on an exchange, that means the exchange is acting as your wallet. This also means the exchange has the ""keys' and is allowing you to access your bitcoin through them. If they close up shop, you are out of luck because you can only access your bitcoin through them at this time.* ***They hold the ""keys"".***

*So, this is where your own wallet comes in!*

*When you get a hardware device (Trezor, Ledger, KeepKey, etc), you use that device to create an online wallet with your own ""keys"" which are on the device. While the keys are on the device, they can also be transferred to another hardware device using the 12/24 seed words, pin &amp; passphrase. You can also have keys to the one wallet set up on multiple devices.*

*What keeps it safe, is that you are the only one who holds the keys. The keys are the combination of 12/24 seed words, pin &amp; passphrase, which cannot be hacked, but remember it also cannot be retrieved should it ever be lost or forgotten.*",1605126613,12,1

I submitted a PR to add it in RaspiBolt Guide but no review for now.

Using a Home VPN server is nor anonymous neither censorship resistant (if you need this feature, you must use Tor). However you can access the service of your RaspiBolt node without exposing them to internet and with a much better connection (WireGuard is a lot faster and reconnect to your home network instantly while Tor can be quite long to restart ). You can run both in any case.

I rated it for advanced users, but you should be able to successfully install everything by copy-pasting the command lines (and filling blanks like private keys). You need to know how to forward the port on your home router to the RaspiBolt for WireGuard and setup the client devices that are allowed to connect to the VPN as explained in the guide.

They ghosted me with zero explanation. Loss of money was avoided thanks to a private key backup. Always back up your private keys. Always use non-custodial exchanges. Eventually I realized I was locked out because of a time-sync problem on my end.

-------------------------

If you're into Peer-to-Peer exchanges, you may have heard of Australia-based exchange LocalCryptos.com. I've been using them for a while now to trade Bitcoin, sometimes for cash, sometimes for bank transfers. Until now I had no complaints about them. In fact, I would've readily recommended them to any semi-experienced bitcoiners looking for a spot to securely buy or sell crypto while retaining custody of their funds.

This changed at the end of August 2020. I went to log into LocalCryptos. I enter in my email/password and Google 2FA code. LocalCryptos says my 2FA code is invalid. Huh? Weird. I haven't changed phones or account passwords, nor reset 2FA or anything like that. The 2FA app isn't the problem here - I've been using the same Google authenticator app for more than a year. But LocalCryptos still isn't letting me log in.

Now I start to freak out a little. I had several thousand dollars' worth of BTC stored in LocalCryptos before I was locked out. At this point, I'm starting to worry if:

- I have just been phished
- LocalCryptos' servers were hacked or their domain was hijacked
- LocalCryptos is scamming me to take my BTC somehow
- Someone hacked my account and changed my 2FA keys or password

If any of the above were true, then my BTC would surely already be stolen. The first thing I realize I should do is check the transaction IDs for my most recent deposits into LocalCryptos. LC is a non-custodial exchange, so if the those UTXOs had been spent without my knowledge, then case-closed: I was hacked and the money is gone.

But I'm surprised to find that my coins are still sitting there, in the same addresses I left them in.

""LocalCryptos must've locked my account"" is the only explanation I can come up with. I email their support. 

- They ask ""What error are you getting?"". 
- I send them a screenshot of the login page error which says ""Wrong OTP"" (for the uninitiated, OTP stands for 'one-time-password').
- They send me this:

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I have escalated your ticket to a high department for them to help you.
&gt; Please allow 48 hours for them to respond.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Anibal

- I'm confused, but placated. I send a simple 'thank you' message and sit on my hands.
- 48 hours goes by and nothing happens. My account is still locked and I've heard nothing from LocalCryptos.
- I wait a few more days and then I send a reply back - this is 5 days after being told to wait 48 hours - asking if anyone is listening. At the time of writing, I still have not received a reply to that email thread.
- Another 48 hours later (a full week after initially reaching out to them), I hear nothing back, and my account is STILL locked.
- I start a new support ticket referencing the previous one, describing the situation, etc.
- They send me the same copy/paste reply:

&gt; Hi,
&gt; I have escalated your ticket to a higher department for them to help you.
&gt; Please allow 48 hours for them to respond.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Tim

- 24 hours later, they send me an automated email saying ""Do you still need help? We replied to your ticket 24 hours ago, and we haven't heard from you. If you still require assistance, let us know by replying to this email.""
- Normally if you ignore those emails, they close your support ticket, so for good measure, I reply back saying yes, please help me, I am locked out of my account.
- At the time of writing I still have yet to hear another word from a real LocalCryptos employee on the matter.
- I had a discussion with their CEO on Telegram several months prior, so I messaged him, hoping to get lucky, but he ghosted me as well.

My theory was that someone filed a bogus report on my LocalCryptos account, or maybe LocalCryptos has some kind of 'fraud detection system' that mistakenly flagged my account. In either case, their support team's policy when that happens seemed to be the old 'stall-and-ghost-them' technique.

By the grace of god, the last time I was logged into LocalCryptos, I happened to find the 'download backup' button, and downloaded a backup of my LocalCryptos account's private keys. I used that to generate the keys for the addresses that my coins were stored on, and successfully recovered them! Phew. So no money was lost, thanks to the power of private key ownership.

A few weeks later, I realized what the problem was. My phone's clock was no longer properly synchronized. Since Google Authenticator and other 2FA apps use the current time to determine the OTP code, this meant the codes they generated were invalid at the time I used them. After re-synchronizing the clock, I was able to generate correct 2FA codes and log into my account again!

So after all this, I'm still inclined to say LocalCryptos isn't a *bad* exchange, because their exchange was designed with a situation like this in mind. Even if you are locked out without explanation or help, you can still get your money back. Their smart contracts are very reliable and they enable non-custodial peer-to-peer fiat/BTC/LTC/ETH exchanges.

But if you use them, be aware that you'll get no help from their customer service. My account was perfectly normal, and a little help from a customer service rep would have probably uncovered the time-desync issue in no time. Instead I had to figure it out on my own simply because they were too lazy or incompetent to reply to me.

Heed my story as a warning if you use an exchange: you had better beware of the risk that, even if you are smart, even if you play it safe, even if you use a strong password and 2FA, your account might suddenly become locked and you'll need to rescue your BTC yourself. That's what non-custodial exchanges are for!

-------------------

LocalCryptos staff, if you're reading this, ghosting locked-out customers is NOT OK. Fix your sh***y customer service policies. If you tell someone to wait 48 hours for a reply, then you bloody well better reply in 48 hours, even if it's to say ""Hey, sorry this is taking longer than we thought, but please rest assured we're working on it. Expect an update within N days"".",1605122520,17,1
jsem55,maamoulashta,"Absolute Noob, Getting Started","Hi Everyone, 

I'm looking to start investing in Bitcoin (Absolute beginner) and I wanted to ask a few questions to make sure I have this correct. I'm a bit worried about any technical mishaps and I'd lose my coins and such. 

From my understanding, process goes

1. Sign up to an exchange (ie: Coinbase/Gemini/Etc). I keep reading about people complaining about certain fees, can that be avoided? 

2. Link Bank account or pay with debit or credit card (Which would U recommend for fastest approach)

3. Once you have the coin, store it right away on a wallet (I've read and seen that Trezor seems to be the most recommended). 

My other questions are how do I know how to actually transfer the coin onto the wallet? Is there a guide that would come with the device? 

I'm just worried about doing some dumb mistake and getting hacked or losing my coins and I think that's what has stopped me from investing thus far. I know that if I don't invest now, I'm going to deeply regret in the months and years to come and I don't want to know what that feeling is like. 

I know many people recommend to buy bit by bit slowly to avoid DCA, I'm wondering what that means exactly (Is my understanding correct that it's in order to avoid buying at a peak price) and if I should go slow to all-in before BTC goes up to 20k and beyond that...?

As well is there any guides or links you'd recommend I read as everything i know so far I've picked up from here on reddit but it's getting a bit overwhelming at times. 

By the way if I'm missing anything at all, please let me know as I don't want to miss something that might bite me later on.",1605122266,11,1

jtlpms,thehbro,Economic Incentives for Proof of Stake," 

Hi All,

Literally I can't post this anywhere without hitting a wall so this is the only place I could think of to post.  I need help working this thought out and maybe you can change my mind (I'm new to eth by the way so please no stone-throwing). I under the belief that the economic incentives for proof of stake are not viable and will result in lower prices for proof of stake currencies. Here's why:

Proof of stake requires economic incentives for staking tokens, if the incentive is not high enough then people will put their funds in other financial vehicles with better yields. Staking rewards come from transaction fees (correct?) if the transaction fees are too low then the yields are low, if the transaction fees are high then no one will want to use the network. So there's an incentive to keep transaction fees low to spur adoption but not low enough to deter stakers from staking their tokens. Meanwhile, there are other projects that have transaction fees at .0001 cents (and they are speculated to go lower). If I'm trying to save money, I'd choose them, wouldn't I? But if they are competing for network usage then they would keep lowering their fees. Eth would have to lower their fees too to compete, but that would result in bad staking yields. Basically, to me it all seems like a race to the bottom, can you help me change my mind? Thanks",1605293584,1,1

jtle2n,CryptigoVespucci,Why Does Bitcoin Draw Comparisons To Gold?,"In Bitcoin’s latest high profile adulation, famed investor Stan Druckenmiller stated, ""frankly, if the gold bet works, the bitcoin bet will probably work better.""

If you’re in this space, you’re no stranger to comparisons between bitcoin and gold. Both are scarce, highly divisible, transferable, expensive to mine, and have supplies that cannot be tampered with, particularly by any government or institution.  

That’s where the similarities end. Bitcoin is a purely digital creation that exists only as entries in a ledger shared across a distributed network of computers. Its scarcity comes from code that dictates a supply of 21 million. The cost to mine it comes from the electricity expended in a global competition amongst computers (miners) racing to guess an arbitrary number. 

Gold on the other hand is a metal that we pull out of the ground. But if bitcoin was created by a pseudonymous programmer, then that begs the question… 

https://preview.redd.it/vz7gj0t6x1z51.jpg?width=524&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=808a80f5497efedf015cf294acb3c211b8172994

One of the fringe benefits of crypto is that it forces you to take a deeper look into how the rest of the world works. At the end of the day, most of what you see in this industry is simply the recreation of things that already exist, but in a purely digital environment. 

For example, want to understand what an automated market maker (AMM) like Uniswap is? First you need to understand what a market maker is. Turns out it's a basic function in finance that’s been around for as long as there have been markets. Thousands of years ago there was some guy in Mesopotamia with a big stockpile of wheat and barley who, for a small fee, was always willing to trade wheat for barley or vice versa to keep the market moving. Swap the wheat and barley for YAM and ETH and automate it on Ethereum and there you go. Uniswap. 

Want to understand what digital gold is and why it's valuable? Start with its physical analog and go down that rabbithole. You’ll end up in space a couple billion years ago before the earth was even formed. 

Disclaimer: getting a bit weird for your Friday; regular scheduled program resumes Monday 

**Gold: the extra-terrestrial** 

There’s a reason the Winklevii told David Portnoy that Elon Musk was going to make gold rain down from space, [**making it as plentiful as sand**](https://twitter.com/stoolpresidente/status/1294051648533401600?s=20). Gold does originate from space, but that’s not the interesting part. 

The interesting part is how it gets created by a collapsing star and a cataclysmic explosion called a supernova.

**Quick primer on stars** 

The familiar example of a star is “The Sun” - the big ball of gas that our planet revolves around and sets the rhythms of our days, seasons, and years. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6nszwg39x1z51.jpg?width=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0e78855db5186eb8096e0c4b0bdeb095ee40096

While it’s a big deal for us, from a cosmic perspective our sun is a dime a dozen. As ole Carl Sagan once said: 

“The total number of stars in the universe is greater than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the planet Earth.”

So in short, stars are big balls of gas and there’s a whole lot of them out there. What’s happening inside the star is what ultimately produces gold. 

**The recipe for gold** 

To understand this next part, we have to go back to high school chem class and revisit the lightest element on our periodic table: hydrogen. 

Stars are made up mostly of hydrogen gas. Since stars are so massive, gravity creates tremendous pressure at the star’s core. This pressure causes hydrogen atoms to bang into each other, which creates helium and gives off tremendous energy through a process called nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is what makes stars both hot and shiny.

So nuclear fusion creates energy and turns hydrogen into helium, which is a slightly heavier element than hydrogen. Once nuclear fusion creates enough helium, that same process starts creating carbon, which is slightly heavier still. Next comes oxygen, then iron, then nickel, which are each slightly heavier than its predecessor.

So as the hydrogen atoms at the core of a star bash into each other over the course of millions of years, creating other heavier elements, the star’s hydrogen slowly depletes. Once the star’s core runs out of hydrogen, the star collapses on itself. Boom. A supernova. A rare cosmic event that happens a few times a century.

This collapse creates a ton of pressure which jams protons into electrons, forming neutrons. All of the heavier elements that had been formed by the star like iron and nickel combine with these neutrons and that’s the process that creates gold as well as silver, lead, and uranium - the heavy metals. Supposedly, this all happens in seconds. 

So if you’re still reading, heavier elements get formed through nuclear fusion over millions of years. In the rare event in which a star collapses and goes supernovae, heavy metals like gold and silver get formed in an instant. 

Ok, but how did gold find its way to Earth? 

**How It Got Here** 

Well the star that exploded propelled all of the elements it’d cooked up throughout the universe, so there’s a bunch of gas and stardust just kind of floating around. After enough time, gravity does its thing and all of that gas and dust starts to coalesce, forming planets. 

When the Earth was forming, a bunch of gold dust got thrown into the mix. Over the course of a few billion years, the Earth’s molten core caused that gold dust to clump together in the form we can expensively extract from the ground today. 

It’s estimated that from this entire process, we’ve mined just enough gold to fill three olympic sized swimming pools. With that limited supply, we’ve created money, jewelry, electronics, dentistry fillings, and Peter Schiff’s favorite hard asset class. 

**Wrapping it up** 

So there you have it. Stars turned a bunch of hydrogen into heavier elements over the course of millions of years before exploding and instantaneously creating heavy metals that got propelled through space, some of which made their way to Earth where a bunch of monkeys dug it out of the ground to create money and jewelry and an asset to argue about on the internet. 

The reason gold is scarce is because, while there is a ton of it just floating around the universe, for us humans it’s not so easy to recreate the cosmic process that forged it. That same process produced a metal that's pretty, malleable, and divisible. All qualities that, for one reason or another, we find valuable. 

Some of these [**qualities**](https://www.casebitcoin.com/what-is-bitcoin) Satoshi imbued into Bitcoin. Mainly its scarcity and divisibility. He also added some qualities that make it much more transferable and verifiable. And that, my friends, is why our favorite magic internet money draws comparisons to a shiny space metal we pulled out of the ground.

i ask these questions because my phone has a very bad camera, so getting a good enough photo of my ID is hard. i want to purchase btc but dont have a bank account and the best i can do is a netspend card. and the netspend wont even link with cashapp. im getting really frustrated about not being able to get coins. i had a friend who had a ton of coins and he would come over/we would meet up. i would hand him cash, and he would send me coins. Said friend is being very unreliable as of late and i am here asking everyone i know with a bank accct to buy me some BTC. and most people hear 'bitcoin' and their first question is, ""aren't they illegal...?"" \*rolls eyes\*

Cypherpunk Sanctorium, the piece I personally consider strongest of the three was created as a way to visually explore and show others the reasons cypherpunks had for creating the technologies leading to Bitcoin's creation. This animated artwork has been nominated for [best art NFT,](https://www.nftawards.org/nomination/cypherpunk-sanctorium) which can be voted for with 1 easy click [here](https://www.nftawards.org/nomination/cypherpunk-sanctorium).

[Cypherpunk Sanctorium by Lucho Poletti \(nominated best art NFT\)](https://reddit.com/link/jtjbfl/video/bvvyat3mc1z51/player)

&gt;Set in a futuristic, cyberpunk-styled metropolis, Cypherpunk Sanctorium explores Bitcoin’s role in providing users privacy and censorship resistance. This animated piece follows the main character on his journey to freedom of money and features my newly created “Andro Satoshi” character as the centerpiece, 21 of my artworks animated on tv screens and plastered on building walls, and a tribute to 6 prominent cypherpunks who developed the technologies which lead to Bitcoin’s creation.

jtj7rn,heptagon_h,Best strategy right now is to earn Fiat," I see lots of posts on trading strategies, leverage, alt coins, bitcoin lending and my contrarian take of what the best strategy right is the following: 

Be very efficient at earning and saving fiat.
Move all savings to cold storage bitcoin.
Build mental skills to HODL for the upcoming moonshot. 

The best strategies are simple and win over long term. building a complex plan or strategy to increase your bitcoin holdings via fiat-like-instruments such as options , dividends and interest may not work. Bitcoin is a totally new beast. Like gold but faster and more divisible. No one knows how to deal with the latter yet and it may not look like traditional finance in the future.

In trying to multiply your stack you may learn the bad habits of not holding and lose much of it. The opposite advice seems more prudent at the moment- be a very efficient earner of fiat and save right into bitcoin",1605286077,2,1

jtins6,brazed_blotch,Bitcoin and Leverage. Is it a bad idea?,"Hello all. 

I am debating moving my bitcoin holdings into Kraken or Bitmex (or a similar platform) in order to take advantage of the current rally in price with leverage.

I'm not looking to day trade, just to buy and let it sit for a year or so. Given the volatility of bitcoin, obviously I would stick to low leverages, however x2 or x3, even x4 seems feasible.

I would go with options or futures on a bitcoin ETN, but European brokers seem to be pretty strict about this. CFD overnight interest will be too high for me.

Honestly, I've done my research and I don't see a bitcoin crash coming anytime soon in the next six months, although I don't have a crystal ball. If you think this is a good idea, I would appreciate any advice you have on how I should go about doing this. If you think it's a bad idea, please justify yourself. If this isn't the right sub, please let me know where else I can ask this question.

But unfortunately/fortunately thanks to the recent price surge I now have enough to put down a deposit for an apartment. I started investing small amounts of money during the last bull run crash during college a few years ago. But only seriously got into it in the last few years when I had a job that pays relatively well. I actually decided I was going to cash out at 15,000 but then decided I’d watch the market and glad I did. I’ve decided now is a good time to cash out as the market is at a record recent high, the greed index is also incredibly high, there’s also various signs we could start to see a drop and unfortunately I can’t a afford for the price to go any lower.

jthvjx,Mobe-E-Duck,A word of caution from a Bitcoin optimist,"Gentlemen, ladies and assorted reddit lunatics, lend me your attention and pay heed to a meme as old as time (in internet terms) coined by my favorite annoying anorexic Brit. Be Craeful. Hodl, sure, but don't let your emotional and/or ideological exuberance for decentralized currency run you off the road.

**You have no idea what the bitcoin price will be in the future. And the longer timeline you forecast the less accurate you are.**

I've been following BTC since it was less than $1 a coin and people were trying to convince me to get into it then. I was a sceptic on it's utility and that kept me from investing. I was finally convinced when many, many people were (and which priced in what I consider the floor) and BTC was around $5,500. As the runup to the 2017 ATH began I accumulated 2 BTC and was a true believer in the moon. I watched it round 20k and come down and spent the next several painful years like many others watching the price slowly dwindle and simply hodling. Perhaps more out of stubbornness than anything else.

I did and do absolutely believe in the idea of an owner-controlled, free from enforceable regulation currency. I think there's demand and need. And it's very, very nice to see this current run-up. And what worries me is that there will be people who invest more than they safely can. Or who extend themselves beyond their true risk tolerance out of irrational exuberance or FOMO. Yes, this is partially altruistic. I do care about people. But there is self interest as well.

**We are the market.**

The price movements of bitcoin aren't magic. It's simply what people / institutions / bots are willing to pay or accept as price. And if those entities overextend themselves they're far more likely to sell as the price inevitably pulls back. ""It won't pull back!"" you may cry, well, that's a matter of perspective. I don't consider a $100 price movement *like happens basically every hour* a pull-back but the guy with ten paychecks invested now living hand to mouth just might. The more people gambling their ability to make their car payment, grocery bill or rent on BTC the more likely there is to be an avalanche. A smallish move triggers a need to sell, those sales reinforce that trade price, more and more sales are realized as people's risk tolerance is tested, bots notice the volume and movement and do what bots do and institutional investors offload to avoid a poor balance sheet / told-you-so's. 

What's the point? Invest what you can lose. Invest what you can not get back without beating yourself up and accept that it may become a mansion in LA or a gallon of gasoline. If you do that then you become the strong hand lending value to the market. Put Johnny's college fund in there and you become the weak hand.

**I do believe that BTC will go higher from here.** Much higher. And *I've been wrong before*. Do I wish I'd bought as much BTC as I could afford when it was $5k? $7k? $11k? Of course. Am I glad I didn't? Yes. If I'd overextended myself and then failed to sell, again, at $20k I'd be miserable. Maybe I'd have sold at the first dip. Maybe I'd have YOLO'ed every penny I had when it dipped under $20k and taken a huge loss having no choice but to cash out. Either way I'd have certainly lost all my hair and most of my stomach lining.

What I'm saying to you can be summed up as follows:

***tl/dr: Don't be greedy because you'll get scared.*** If you think BTC will moon then what's the difference if you have $5, $50, $500 or $500,000 in it right now? Do you need three Lamborghinis to fill up your mansion's garage? Any amount of greater wealth can improve your situation, but don't forget that losing wealth will upset you in equal proportion. If that's not the case you're already rich enough and why buy BTC?",1605282069,68,3

jthfwc,bjaxen,The coming CBDC's and the control they may wield.,"Just a thought really. I am long time Btc Hodler, and have no intension - currently - to swap my valuable Btc for the shitcoin we call Fiat. So with that in mind, my thoughts are:

Central Bank Digital Currencies are coming, and I suspect early next year they will start rolling out. So could they not stop on ramping, as once your fiat account has been changed to CBDC, they can block any transaction they wish to blacklist? This would also be the same for off ramping, I.E they could stop payments coming in from Crypto exchanges by blacklisting them. I believe that CBDC's are for control and just like the censorship rolling out across all social media, they could so the same by blacklisting any company they choose? 

Obviously as the price of Btc goes up, then the chance of transacting person to person will go up, but it's still something I think needs thinking about. I even wonder whether that is the idea, seeing as legacy banking has been left so far behind. Change all banking to CBDC's and then they have total control as to where you can spend your money, including buying or selling Btc.  Just a thought,",1605280893,3,0

The only way for it to work would to go under the radar for as long as possible.

for 10k BTC today = 160,000,000 US$ approx.

a pizza pepperoni costs in the US around 11.99-14.99 US$ approx.

so he could've now purchased ladies and gentlemen 

13,333,333 pepperoni pizzas, now tell me thats not worth it.

The moral of the story don't sacrifice current pleasures for future pleasures. 

Now lets dig deeper

Now little Cesar's offer a 5.99 small pizza you know for the kids to enjoy. He could've got

66 million pizzas.

Another moral of the story is these pizzas can feed the whole African continent for a week (not a joke) if we slice the high-fat calories of pizzas into cement bags (idk why cement bags sounded cooler in my head)

I bought buy first bitcoins in 2013 where the prices are around 10-25 bucks. As a mathematician, I want to share the concerns I have to everyone here.

For those that understand Markov chain and basic probability theory, you could just go see my youtube video which shows you how blockchain's double spending is modelled using Markov chain and what is the systematic risk: [https://youtu.be/l-rRwSZEkLE](https://youtu.be/l-rRwSZEkLE)

Bitcoin and blockchain in general is safe. But there is potential risk. That is double spending. Satoshi's paper shows you that such risk decreases exponentially, however, the pooled mining gives attackers the ability to hijiack the main chain (which I explained mathematically in my video). Moreover, such risk is not low at all. **If an attacker obtains 40% of the hashing power in the entire network, he will have a 44% chance to reverse his previous transaction!** And there's no way to solve it. Blockchain is great but it's not perfect. I hope more people knows about it. We shouldn't stop here, blockchain is just the beginning of decentralized cryptocurrency, we need more innovation, not just blockchain.",1605572027,52,0

The question is can I purchase a hard wallet here in the U.S. for her? (I will be visiting her sometime next year hopefully). From IRS perspective, how do I associate this hard wallet with my sister so that IRS won’t recognize that it is mine and I have already gifted it to her — does the hard wallet needed to be purchased by my sister herself outside the U.S.? I understand that if the value is less than $15,000 I am not obligated to pay any gift tax.

I checked and tested my hypothesis and it's right.

I took a loan on 13th October, 2nd November, and 10th November. If you take a look at the daily candles, you can see that it clearly links up to the uptrends. Ironically, whenever I pay my loans back the market stagnates. Not paying back my latest loan until just before it expires around 3 months from now.

The very concept of using the Internet to store and exchange value seems a little paradoxical. But today, I think that I've finally unlocked something very fundamental about bitcoin that solves the puzzle.

I will state the problem with the following question: **How can we use the Internet, this network created with the sole purpose of sharing and replicating information instantly, to exchange value/information that is necessarily rare and scarce?**

You just have to design a network that is REALLY expensive to maintain!

I’ve ordered copies of “The Bitcoin Standard” and was gonna give them £70 each in Btc, I was thinking I would get ledgers and load them but the budget will double and get out of hand real fast as I have a lot of kids to buy for and I think they’d struggle to go from not knowing anything about btc to installing ledger live on their laptops 🤔 anyway I’m thinking it would be cheaper and easier to get them something that’s preloaded with Btc and if they want to get hardware wallets later down line they can do.

I use crypto to play poker; and finding [SimpleFX](https://simplefx.com/n/l16_18200) has been a godsend -- because I am able to stash away money, invest it, and over time the market has been very good to me : )

Quick Takes:

1. Instant Deposits / Withdrawals. No minimums. NYC rules only if you use fiat currency to fund your account. Otherwise just use a VPN Canada and deposit crypto.
2. Up to 500x leverage available (margin). This can be dangerous obviously, but if you get a trade right it's like hitting the lottery! Think of a parlay in sports betting.
3. Demo Account to get comfortable.
4. Mobile app is great.
5. 240 tradable instruments in several markets. (stocks, etfs, etc)

Over the last few years, the broker has reached over 210,000 traders in 160 countries, attracting both novices and experts to the advanced features on their reliable trading platforms.

You may lose everything. Investing is risky especially using margin.

jxcdtb,S0CRATEES,What is RSK (Bitcoin's L2 platform) doing wrong?,"RSK and the solution it provides in being a companion network to Bitcoin's fiscally conservative blockchain seems to have gone overlooked. It has an EVM implementation meaning that many ETH smart contracts are compatible to Bitcoin's liquidity, but there hasn't been much activity in re-engineering them. They are trying to appeal to the whole ""Defi"" momentum and get awareness out there as its a approach towards enabling new possibilities for BTC, but there isn't much hype around RSK. Is it because its not decentralized? Its strange because there is more hype around tokenized BTC on Ethereum vs creating Bitcoin's own smart contract sidechains. 

To me Ethereum is just a sidechain network to Bitcoin thats only marginal more decentralized than a liquid or rsk. Why are we adopting altchains when layer 2 chains leverages Bitcoin's market dominance more efficiently. RSK has been around for years, why hasn't it caught on yet publicly?",1605823463,10,1

jxadr3,36rnt,Bitcoin implementation in the 'real' world,"I've been on the Bitcoin rollercoaster since 2013. Got Goxed pretty bad in the MtGox ""hack"" and lost all my BTC. Never touched Bitcoin again the years after, and got stuck in the endless class action lawsuits to claim my BTC back.

Until last year, I sold my MtGox claim and with the fiat I got in return, I bought the dip this march (BTCUSD around 3.5k)

I also am a software developer for over 15 years, so I understand the architecture and source code of Bitcoin, and I think it's amazing.

The thing that always bothered me is the implementation of Bitcoin in the physical world. It's not completely anonymous and the transaction speed is really slow and expensive compared to other altcoins. 

I still don't see myself checking out in a restaurant with Bitcoin in 2030, it's just too slow.. Now if I transfer my BTC from 1 exchange to another, I convert it to XRP, transfer it, and convert it back.. just for the sake of speed.

There are people that say that the Lightning network is solving this, but the way I see it is that it's quite cumbersome, and only applicable for microtransactions. Also setting up a wallet is quite difficult, even for a geek like me. Transfering BTC to lightning, send it, and transfering it back to the BTC main network sounds a bit like a dodgy solution. The general public is never going to implement this, they can hardly understand what a Bitcoin is (yet).

IMHO I think that BTC will end up pure as an inflation-protected asset, that you will keep safe on a wallet in your vault. The same way as it is now with gold. Because you don't see people pay with gold in a restaurant either...

«In 2008, the first cryptocurrency bank was created in one of the former republics of the former USSR. It was named BTA-Bank. It is still called that. The first bitcoin was born in January 2009. Then it was not BTC, but BT. But a little later, before the establishment of the traditional exchange rate against currencies on October 5 - when one dollar could buy 1,309.03 bitcoins, an Asian double was found in the Unicode system and renamed into BTC; and the bank kept BT in its name plus the first letter of the name of its creator»

Humans are not rational. We handle our crisis, our societies via collective beliefs rather than the rational approach. Our rationality only exists in small moments of crystalized information in a system of high entropy.

To think that you can arrive at a value for Bitcoin that makes sense, uniformly for everyone, is a fool's errand. 

Hype begets hype.

Do you recall playing the game of whispering a story to your neighbor in a large circle of school mates? The stories take their own form &amp; myth drastically morphed into something that no one imagined.

If Bitcoin lives it will have a value that makes no sense. This only means it is going to have a shockingly high value instead of a low one since lower trending values will eventually kill Bitcoin and therefore it did not live.",1605810071,15,1

Maybe that future is tomorrow to buy a pack of gum, 5 years from now to buy a house, or 10 years from now to pay for your kid's college. Regardless, don't you want your hard work now to be worth something later? Take a dive into the underlying fundamentals of bitcoin and you understand why so many people are using it as a store of value.[https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) (Bitcoin whitepaper) 

This is what millions if not, billions of people are struggling with right now, in countries all over the world. Their hard work can not be stored for later use; There is massive inflation. The second they earn a paycheck in their native currency it is worth less than when they received it and the longer they hold it, the worse it gets. This in turn creates impoverished countries that try to relieve their poverty by printing more money.  By printing more money they are driving down the value of all the hard work people have done to convert that hard work into that currency.

&gt;**Bitcoin isn't a ""get rich scheme"" it is a way for people to store their hard work for future use and enjoyment.**

There are many other uses for bitcoin besides a store of value, but I believe this to be one of the more important.

What are your thoughts or ideas on looking at Bitcoin in this light?

Also with the price rise I don’t wanna miss out on the gains

I see a lot of 100k+ predictions floating around. Are they expecting a rapid increase or just a steady growth?  
I remember not long ago someone wrote ""we are very lucky to be able to buy BTC at 13k."" I didn't consider that statement properly at the time. I thought the price was too high for me. These days, every time I see the bitcoin price, I am filled with regret because I didn't heed the advice. So, you could say I am waiting for another window of opportunity.  
So, if a significant drop does happen, how long do you think it will stay that way? Not for long, right? Given how much faith the community has in the currency.

Currently i use binance as an exchange to buy my crypto: btc eth and 2 other coins. (im from europe)

I have a little bit  invested in those coins now, but as im expecting a dip after btc's ath and a pullback of abt 20-30% before we go to the moon. Once that dip happens i want to buy that dip.

So for now im keeping my crypto on there, and when i buy the next dip i can move it all to my cold storage. To reduce fee's i want to do it only once.

But once 2021 goes on i want to DCA. And i was wondering what a good exchange is for buying btc and eth (maybe automatically if possible) and has low fee's to withdraw to external wallets.

Off course the amounts wont be large that i DCA and that are on the exchange but every now and then i do want to transfer it to my personal wallets.

k02gno,MadgeSpeaks,Visualising Bitcoin after crossing the Event Horizon.,"I bought BTC as soon as I had that ""moment"" after falling down the rabbit hole. John Vallis calls it crossing the Event Horizon. I guess many of you know that - but not everyone.

I thought initially everyone who owned Bitcoin must have crossed the Event Horizon, as once crossed, buying up BTC feels like the most sane thing to do. But apparently not.

My network that includes incredibly smart people including Post-Doc MIT engineers / MSAIL folk, don't seem to get it. So there must be some other synapse beyond ""intelligence"" needed.

For further insight, I'll explain the visuals I saw. 

I could see a copper coloured sphere, that I guess looked a bit like the Death Star, which had 21M grids, stacked with pixels that kept pulsating as more energy was transferred into it.

However, after listening to Michael Saylor I saw this big virtual vault, housing 21M safety deposit boxes stacked with USB ports, and an intense indigo coloured energy being blasted into it. The indigo colour would also pulsate with an intensity colour change depending on how the energy moved in or out.

What do you see when you visualise Bitcoin?

&amp;#x200B;

HODL for life.

k01uts,MrBitcoinMann,Bank account closed? Sold Bitcoin on Paxful!,"I’m not sure what I did wrong really. I understand the MSB laws but I sold under $1,000 per person per day following federal MSB laws and my state’s MTA laws, even see their government website confirming that $1,000 per person per day is not accumulative per day (California).

I was selling Bitcoin on Paxful for about 3 months and have a total volume of about $250,000. A few of my payment processors got shutdown along the way (Venmo, ApplePay) but I was guessing it was because these apps didn’t allow for business transactions, although they never told me the exact reason why but for the most part allowed me to withdrawal or wait 90 days to do so.

I used Zelle perfectly for 3 months until last week my Bank of America account was locked and today they told me I’d be receiving a check but I’d have to wait at least until December 30 for the account to be fully closed. Again they couldn’t tell me why, but for a big bank to do this it has me thinking something else. Granted I did have a personal account which might be the reason why, I was actually planning on making my own website and applying to become a LLC this week in hopes to get the PinWheelPay payment processor to accept my business since I saw it’s marked as high risk and Stripe, Square, etc don’t support this business model.

But I don’t know, I really think the personal account might be the reason because the bank acted like Venmo and ApplePay, “a banking decision has been made you will receive information with your check” is what I was told after talking to account closure supervisors the first time, they second time they told me the closure MIGHT be taking so long because a claim I had open still (I got scammed myself, I was trying to get my money back) but I got transferred to someone in the claims department to tell me there were no claims on my account and my claim had actually been completed that day and would update in the systems overnight. They couldn’t yet specify the reasoning though yet, granted the first guy I talked to was treating me like a criminal and got me very worried the first time I called, but the guy I got and supervisor I was transferred to was very kind and reassuring.

However after digging down the Reddit rabbit hole I see very worrying some posts. I need to confirm I did have a KYC process in place, which was sort of integrated with Paxful’s own KYC (I matched Paxful verified names to bank accounts the entire 3 months), granted I had a few noticeable slip ups in the beginning and again due to a very elaborate photoshopper. So I’m also worried that there might be some kind of fraud hold on my account. I’m obviously more than welcome to take the losses if they’re genuine and I can’t prove they are wrong with my KYC process if it is the case for my account closure, I mean it’s of course my fault if I screw up my process so I’m more than willing to take responsibility and refund whoever was defrauded. But it seems if chargebacks were the case I don’t know why they wouldn’t contact me first to talk about them, granted I know they aren’t required too I just don’t see why not?

Luckily I bank with USAA who I hear are very crypto friendly, but don’t offer business accounts sadly. Regardless I don’t think I’ll be back to Paxful until I figure out more information on why exactly my BoA account was closed which will be 1 of 3 reasons from what I’ve found from my paranoid researching: personal account usage for business activities, high risk transactions/business, fraudulent chargebacks.

It’s kind of damning though, this is my only source of income at the moment, I was really looking forward to getting a high risk payment processor on board so I could start taking credit cards, but this had to happen. I sort of dropped out of college to pursue this full time because it was so profitable, but it looks like I’m going to need to go back if it’s for some crazy reason like I’ve read here on Reddit, granted there’s not many posts on similar cases. I’m probably ranting at this point so let me go ahead and ask the basic questions:

I entirely believe I haven’t broken any laws here, am I wrong??? (Paranoia)

Is this bank closure going to screw up me joining other banks? I’ve read about ChexSystem and that is scaring me to be honest.

Granted this is just a problem with Bank of America’s business policies (account type, risk level), what other banks would most support me?",1606209893,11,1

k01mmy,ANTCoinExchange,"Voices from an investor: ""I"" and the story of 7Coin Exchange","The 21st century is the era of blockchain. We missed e-commerce and real estate, and we can't miss the blockchain anymore. Nowadays, with the rapid economic development and the improvement of people’s living standards, more and more people are beginning to realize the importance of investment, which has also promoted the development of blockchain to a certain extent. In recent years, blockchain has also gradually been mature, digital currency has now become a mainstream investment. Unconsciously, I have invested in 7Coin Exchange for more than two years. Today, I will share with you the story of me and 7Coin Exchange during this period. I hope it will be helpful to your investment in digital currency.

The role and meaning of digital currency will not be repeated here, let me first talk about why I chose 7Coin Exchange. In fact, 7Coin Exchange was introduced to me by my high school classmate. She studied law and now working for a state-owned enterprise. Due to her recommendation, I just registered and learned about it. I remember that I just bought a car at that time, and I didn’t have much spare money, but I saw that contract trading on the 7Coin Exchange were very attractive, interesting, and full of potential, so I gradually invested some of my cash.

At that time, people around me would tell me to be careful when I was investing in digital currency. And tell me don’t invest too much. In fact, I’m very cautious about what I do. It is under the effect of accumulating less and adding more, I rewarded considerably. Also, it was in the course of such attempts that I gradually gained a deeper understanding of 7Coin Exchange. It turned out that 7Coin Exchange was the sixth exchange in the world to complete Series B financing. When I first started investing this year, the number of active users on 7Coin Exchange has exceeded 100,000. Recently, the largest self-media in the crypto currency industry released the ""Global Crypto Currency Exchange Top 100 List"" report, and 7Coin Exchange ranks in the top 50.

The qualifications and honors that 7Coin Exchange has obtained in its development are too numerous to list. I think this is mainly due to the strict risk control model of 7Coin Exchange. All investment projects have been strictly screened and inspected. Of course, in addition to the strong shareholder background and high-quality projects, its original perpetual contract trading also played a certain role in the rapid development of 7Coin Exchange. Now that more than half of my digital currency has been traded on the 7Coin Exchange, I am secretly delighted to see the reward arrive in my account every day.

By the way, one thing I particularly like about the 7Coin Exchange is that they have a lot of activities, both online and live, and the prizes are particularly impressive. Including token rewards, red envelopes, etc., 7Coin Exchange gave me the feeling that no matter what activities the platform does, it is very sincere. Because I have invested a lot of times and often participate in activities, I am very active in the 7Coin Official Community. In short, trading on 7Coin is very rewarding.

The world has always been developing and changing, and we naturally can’t stay where we are. No matter what we do, we must keep up with the trend. In the era of blockchain, digital currency will surely become the most mainstream new investment. But I want to remind everyone, before investing digital currency, you must fully understand the exchange and make rational investment.",1606208744,1,1

Whenever i send basically my whole net worth in btc from Exchange to Ledger or other way around.. i need like a whole day and it's a terrible experience.   


First i send like 0,001 btc. Then i wait for confirmation of exchange that it arrived. Then i do this with another 0,001 btc. Then perhaps another round. All with countless ledger-logins. Then on the final round i click 'send' on my entire life savings.   


At the bank i fill in like 7 fields. Carefree sending. Even if it would go wrong, just call my bank that it was a mistake.   
Bitcoin: one small mistake in 1 number and my life is destroyed. No one to call, no one can get that money back ever.   
And this after more than 10 years of existence.   


I want in wallet:   
\- Being able to name different addresses and save them, i want to send to names in my contact book, like in my whatsapp  
\- A 'send ping' Option where it sends smalles amount that is feesable and i can checkbox 'did receive'   
\-&gt; and then a 'send more to this address but different amount' function that appears  
And this is me after 5 Minutes of Thinking and i am not smart (and i already have a job

In early 2018, I lost my recovery seed and the pin I thought I used wasn't working (stopped trying after several attempts so device isn't wiped). After assuming it was a lost cause, I was doing research recently because of the pump and saw that Kraken security among others have shown it can be hacked with physical possession.

I'm looking for someone to assist me in the NYC area. I have a large amount of evidence that this is and has always been my wallet in addition to willing to sign legal documents attesting to that fact. I'm only looking for people who have a digital footprint/can be handled in the most secure manner.

Some of you may know this already, but there is a yearly giving event that they host called BitcoinTuesday happening next Tuesday, December 1st.

We are one of the many organizations accepting bitcoin (and ETH, LTC, BCH, ZEC, GUSD, BAT, LINK), so I encourage you to check out our crypto landing page and The Giving Block's BitcoinTuesday page and donate to any organization you want to support.

We are a global movement that believes every man, woman, and child in North Korea deserves to live a **free and full life**. Any crypto you donate will help North Korean refugees reach freedom through our 3,000-mile secret rescue route and will empower them in their new lives in order to be advocates and changemakers, so that one day soon *they* ***will*** *achieve their own liberty*.

k0xqbw,Imaginary-Friendship,Why Bitcoin has to make people rich,"I see the argument that Bitcoin isn’t going to work because people aren’t buying stuff with it because (1) it’s not fast/cheap to transact, and (2) people don’t want part with it because they don’t want to miss out on gains.

I‘ve thought about this a lot and feel like I have a good reply. Let me know if my thinking is correct.

The short of it is this: **Bitcoin has to make people rich for it to have a chance to have critical mass so that people would actually switch to it as a currency.**

I don’t think the average person would switch to a new payment system without BIG benefits. I talk to a lot of folks about money (I’m in the finance industry in the US) and hardly anyone knows about fiat, inflation, fed reserve, how interest rates are set, et cetera. I mean, they may have heard the words but can’t explain what they are or the pros and cons of each.

Because the average person just wants to know that they have X dollars available so they can by thing Y, it leads me to believe that they aren’t going to rock the boat. Why download an app to spend a currency that isn’t what they are used to? It would be like convincing everyone in the US to switch to the metric system. The metric system is superior to the imperial system but we keep using the latter (myself included) because it’s the most common and has no critical mass.

With this is mind, why would the average person use a cryptocurrency? Personally, decentralization, non-custodial, non-inflationary, sovereignty, etc are big selling points to me - but I don’t think they mean much to the average person.

The benefit that I think HAS to be included in a crypto for it to work as a currency is that it has to make the early adopters rich. We need a LOT of people to get on board to make it work and the only way the average person is going to get on board is if it’s going to make them rich (because superior principles don’t seem to matter to most folks). 

That all being said, Lightning has been working pretty well for me. I’ve spent probably $5-10k via Lightning in the past few months without issues. I know it’s beta, but it seems to be working pretty well so far. I just make sure I increase my BTC holding by the amount I spend so I don’t have less or I use Strike and use my fiat to buy things via Lightning.

So, to answer the issues above, Bitcoin has to be designed in a way that encourages long-term holding and the enrichment of early adopters. And, aside from that, Lightning is already doing pretty well at making Bitcoin a currency. Maybe Lightning isn’t the answer in the end, but layer 2 probably has to be the answer (vs a layer 1 that is a currency first).

Just my two (fiat) cents.",1606328890,25,1

k0xb9f,ConkerRob,Questions to Understanding Bitcoin a Bit Deeper,"Hello,

I have a few questions maybe somebody can help me answer/reaffirm I am right or wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

The argument of how long it takes to settle/confirm a transaction:

According to this website: [https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/fee-calculator/](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/fee-calculator/) the fee for a transaction to be confirmed in 504 blocks \~ 5040 minutes which is 3.5 days is .05 USD (assuming its a SegWit transaction)

&amp;#x200B;

When you pay with a credit card it settles in roughly 3 days, doesn't seem like a big difference here. Also, if you initiate a transfer on chain accept the .05 fee, once you see it in the blockchain explorer or in your own node and verify its being confirmed, could you not assume that its a valid transaction after one confirmation?

&amp;#x200B;

So if I am a business, this is pretty much on par with what the credit card companies would provide, 1-3 days to settle. Bitcoin 3.5 assuming you are looking for the smallest fees possible. The faster you want your money you pay  a premium in fees because you want to be placed in the blockchain faster.

&amp;#x200B;

So the idea that Bitcoin is not to be used as peer to peer cash valid? It seems to me like it still is peer to peer cash.  So as a comparison: 

&amp;#x200B;

Visa/Paypal charge say 2.5% per transaction: on a 10 dollar transaction that is 2.5 dollars, and it will settle in 3 days.

Bitcoin transaction fee is .05 for a 10 dollar transaction and it will settle in 3.5 days.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing something?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My next question:

&amp;#x200B;

If I pay for sticker, and its 10 dollars.

I change my mind and return it, I get my full 10 dollars back.

&amp;#x200B;

With bitcoin it seems to be different,

I pay for a sticker, and its 10 dollars - there was a fee of .05 (which went to a miner) so the merchant must charge me 10.05 to get the full amount.

I change my mind and I return it, the merchant only has 10.00, the unknown miner has .05

How would we square the fact that I paid 10.05, the merchant only has 10..is it fair to only receive 10? or does the merchant have to put up the other .05 cents that I am still owed? Not to mention that the refund would require another 5 cent fee to return me the full 10 and the five cents would be taken from the merchant.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if my second question makes any sense but if somebody could help me square these questions in my head i would greatly appreciate it.",1606327636,8,1

k1wetp,Rachel_Pham,Please help me with Bitcoin or Ethereum!,"  

My family has been facing difficult financial hardship because my father unexpectedly left my family. He stopped supporting my family’s living expenses and left us a big amount of debt. In my culture, a father’s responsibility provides the main financial resource for the whole family while a mother and children are dismissive of him. Therefore, our family is facing a big financial burden for our survival due to his left. I also had to stop my studies as my family is unable to afford my academic expenses. My family and I have been trying so hard to find a job but the situation is more challenging due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I tried to reach out to many local financial aids and money donation organizations but there is likely not much help. My family and I are very stressed and depressed and we only hope if magic will happen to us. Luckily, I know by chance that there are many donators who want to donate Bitcoin or Ethereum for free in the world so I am trying my luck to ask for Bitcoin or Ethereum. Please financially help us overcome this tough time. I promise that if my family and I will be able to survive after this time, I will give back to the community to help others. Thank you for your time reading my words and I hope I will hear positive news from you.

AND coinbase has like a good insurance policy on your Bitcoin just in case if hacker do hack. And it's very convenient. That's the thing. P2p is cool and all but this coinbase app thing is so simple and at the palm of your hands just so.. convenient and reliable as a platform when it comes to hackers and theft. So here's the other thing. I have been homeless for about 3 years now HODLIng. I have had my previous phones stolen and I love how you can just randomly ask a person on the street to say it's am emergency borrow their phone call coinbase and freeze your own account yourself. It feels real good. Better than ADT. That's why I still love regular coinbase and idk what I'm gonna do the convenience of storing your wallet with a platform does have a good convenience at the palm of your hands so what should I do if I'm gonna hold on to my btc should I switch over to kraken or gemini and trust their wallets over coinbase? I do not trust bisq since it already got hacked and hackers stole monero and btc from the users themselves already. Should I stay with coinbase or switch my wallet over to kraken or gemini? Do they have a insurance type of thing like coinbase does with your crypto and is kraken and gemeni safer or just as safe and secure as coinbase and out of the two which is better for u.s, gemini or kraken? I heard bittrex is being sketchy too it's a good thing I emptied my wallet from there. So what should I do? Stay with coinbase if I'm gonna store my btc with a platform ? What is the best option for me as a homeless person as far as safety what wallet should I store my btc on and is coinbase safe enough to trust with my btc wallet for the next 5 years? Would love to hear your opinions! Thanks",1606436738,8,1
k1qku7,Anonymous190127,Long term hold,"Hi all, looking for a bit of wisdom. Been asked by someone who is looking to store some BTC for a long time with no access, circa 10 years I believe.

So what is the best way to do so assuming the owner has absolutely no way of accessing it, think maybe traveling or prison or something similar.

I was going down the path of hardware wallet + safe deposit box but could the holder be tripped up with firmware updates or derivation paths or something similar? Storing the seed and the device together in a safe deposit box... safe or plain stupid?

Thanks in advance",1606436011,20,1
k1qhxy,Obvtw,What’s to stop a country from printing trillions and buying BTC?,"Was thinking about this the other day. BTC being decentralized means there’s no authority to stop bad actors. Obviously the 50% problem exists but is nearly guaranteed to not happen due to the size of the network today. However, couldn’t a country like say Iran or China decide they want to buy all the Bitcoin possible on every exchange and fund it with central bank printing? This would be In an attempt to destabilize the world and no one could stop them. 

In such a scenario taken to an extreme example couldn’t we have a world where BTC is worth $1B each  - wouldn’t that destroy the modern financial system as we know it? Trying to wrap my head around the implications or is this unlikely to happen due to something I’m missing?",1606435713,36,1

1) Go to [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com)

Its free and you only need the free account for this.

2) Change the indicator to XBT and set the time to weekly.

You want to choose weekly because you want to see the past history of the price. 

https://preview.redd.it/73ps2dh62o161.png?width=1816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd199066a06d939873d40671c3bcd6f3f48791fb

3) Draw a line from the top of the candle. Recently we saw the price nearly hit the ATH of 20k. 

But it didn't quite get there. Often when a market fails to hit the resistance level, the price will drop.

This isn't apparent in the weekly chart.

When you see long wicks, it meant that the price hit a top, but the price dropped within a week.  
The longer the wick represents how far the price dropped from the top.   
Its often an indication of selling.

https://preview.redd.it/w2a5vsct2o161.png?width=1816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=208f2baa3bba1e51d1649576bb59eed2a6e48607

4) Change your time to hourly

Move your mouse to the price and slightly move the price, this will allow you to pull down the chart which is locked in position. (you can reset by double clicking the price and date)

Draw a second line of resistance, here we formed a double top chart pattern.   
It happens when the price hits the resistance line two times and drops creating the letter M, or two mountains.  


Now the bitcoin price has created a strong resistance and it needs to break through this 2nd level!

https://preview.redd.it/zjaoi8bh4o161.png?width=1788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6dbccc76a3ef875512adecfe9f3a9d3a69f7a75

5) Now click on time and choose 15min chart.

We can now see another level of resistance that the price recently struggled to go above. 

You want to be looking for re-entry to see if the price can go above the 3rd level of resistance.

We also formed a support level. Meaning that the buyers started to come in and it was tested two times. The more times a price tests the support and resistance, the more stronger it is.

https://preview.redd.it/gntfkywc5o161.png?width=1606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1434671d6d923c7067946f851ee08c7e256dca8e

6) Now we're in a period of consolidation. The price was unable to go past support and unable to break resistance. 

Everyone is looking at the same thing now and everyone is watching these lines.

k1pmoa,SanPedroBoofer,How the hell am I actually supposed to figure out my taxes? (USA),"So I just started getting into crypto around June and had no concept of record keeping until or anything since I’m brand new to this. I had no idea I was supposed to record keep until yesterday. I’m only working with like $500-700 worth of crypto which I doubt Uncle Sam ACTUALLY cares about...but as I’m quickly learning how lucrative this is, I want to report and avoid further issues down the road when I’m moving larger amounts.

First I used trust wallet and I bought maybe $200 of BTC and ATOM. I bought BTC multiple times and used it to buy some stuff on the internet 3-4 times and replaced it in small amounts as it came while the ATOMS sat around staking.

Then I get a Coinbase account, don’t buy anything, but find out they offer like $80 worth of many free cryptos (how the fuck do I even calculate captital gains on crypto they gave me for free?) and from there I opened up a KuCoin account and transferred everything from both wallets into there. Once the trust wallet was emptied, I deleted it without keeping any of the codes to actually retrieve it, effectively deleting all records in the wallet in the process. 

Then on KuCoin I started trading things around at multiple prices, at multiple times, in multiple currencies, maybe a good 70-100 times with absolutely NO concept of the actual dollar amount being gained at the moment of these taxable exchanges.

Cryptocurrency is established for elections.  Each registered voter gets  a election crypto 'dollar' for each race or contested issue.  The voter  is allowed to give all or a portion of every crypto dollar to the  options for each race.  ( This does ranked voting ).   The transactions  are kept in a global blockchain that can be verified by anyone.  The  ‘winner’ is the candidate that lands the most crypto currency.

k2w46x,Their_bad_spellers,An overlooked drawback of custodial wallets.,"Twenty years pass and Bitcoin becomes the largest store of value. Some people use custodial wallets; large investors and nerds use non-custodial wallets.

A flaw is discovered. Or maybe someone wants to create a cryptocurrency with different properties (privacy,l coin, smart contracts, different proof of work, etc.) In either case, they might hard fork Bitcoin and make their own crypto.

It's moderately successful. Maybe it fulfills some other niche. Maybe it's better. Maybe it's actually worse but chumps don't know. The fact is all owners of Bitcoin when the fork happens have a stake in the new crypto. See Bitcoin cash.

This is fantastic if you have a non-custodial wallet. Sell the new crypto and make some cash or hodl and hope for the best. In either case: because you held your own keys *you get access to the hard fork coins*.

What if you have a custodial wallet? This is unprecedented territory. PayPal's policy states: 

""In the event of a fork, PayPal will evaluate the feasibility of supporting the fork and determine whether and to what extent any new assets resulting from the fork may be supported and/or allocated.""


If you hodl with PayPal, there is no guarantee that you get the hard fork coins. *Sad*


Suppose that the majority of coins are held by custodial wallets. A hard fork will never succeed under this condition because it would never be in the interest of the customers to let it succeed.

While I consider myself a Bitcoin maximalist, I do believe that alt-coins have their place in the crypto ecosystem. Custodial wallets pose a significant obstacle in a successful bitcoin hard fork because they centralize allocation and thereby disincentivize adoption.",1606599042,4,1

DISCLAIMER THIS IS HIGH RISK/REWARD you can lose all your money if you time it wrong but you can get 10x the gains. 

So what I did was I just put my cash on MSTR call options, a bit for Jan for a short pop here, some more for July, I would have bought a December strike but didn't have the cash. 

If you believe btc will pop in the short term due to this fomo craze and you're thinking of putting that into actual btc, you can add leverage very high risk high reward by doing this. For example I bought a call when mstr was at 240 and made 89% gain even though btc went down from when I bought it, because mstr hype went up to 270. So I sold that and reinvested on some longer dates I mentioned. Once I cash those out I'll put all the earnings into actual bitcoin . So it's a way to capitalize on short term fomo hype then have more btc to buy and hold forever.",1606596238,11,1

k2uycn,mr-highball,open source algo trading (cb pro)," 

one of my side projects for a few years has been trading crypto algorithmically and I've decided to open up my engine and the ui which I made to test things and trade with. It's pretty easy to use and the engine allows multiple strategies to run at the same time, which differs from some of the other frameworks out there. ""out of the box"" the ui (SimpleBot... yes creative I know) is bundled with ways to trade with a ""buy the dip"" style strategy, momentum, and a trailing SL variant which all operate in tandem (or can be turned off independently). I run it right now and have been pretty surprised with the profits it's been able to achieve with relatively simple building blocks.

I've setup a repo to be able to track feature/bug requests here and the link to the source repo is listed there as well:  
[https://github.com/mr-highball/simplebot-support](https://github.com/mr-highball/simplebot-support)

also it contains a simulator to backtest configurations or new strategies bundled into the app that are exported to csv (the wiki shows a bit of this). documentation is relative sparse right now, but it can run on the cb sandbox or trades can just be simulated with the backtester if you want to play around with some settings. disclaimer, this is software I've used privately, so there's some things that don't work or may be not so intuitive... but I hope to get some good suggestions and feedback so that I can polish things up.

The masses don't really know what 'cold storage' is. 

""Not your keys, not your bitcoin"" is Latin to them

This is evident from the posts here by newcomers who represent a small group of the mass atleast curious to learn, but demonstrate that these concepts are alien to them.

For most of the world though, Coinbase = Bitcoin = Cryptocurrency

Therefore this NYT piece trashing Coinbase \[[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/coinbase-cryptocurrency-black-employees.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/coinbase-cryptocurrency-black-employees.html)\] is not what it says it is. It is either : A strategic move to keep bitcoin down while the elites get in, or to find a way to defeat Bitcoin. The latter is more stupid than the former. 

The enemies of Bitcoin cant perform a frontal attack, because, really how do you? There is no front.

**Capital Gain Tax Rates**

The tax rate on most net capital gain is no higher than 15% for most individuals. Some or all net capital gain may be taxed at 0% if your taxable income is less than $78,750.

A capital gain rate of 15% applies if your taxable income is $78,750 or more but less than $434,550 for single; $488,850 for married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er); $461,700 for head of household, or $244,425 for married filing separately.

Bitcoin is not black or white, it’s not rich or poor. It has no predisposition towards gender, ethnicity, cast or socio-economic position. Discrimination is a human weakness.

Bitcoin cannot be bribed, solicited, coerced, threatened, duplicated, multiplied or otherwise altered. Bitcoin accepts neither bonuses nor bailouts. Greed is a human weakness.

Bitcoin does not become more valuable by force. It cannot be acquired or occupied through tanks, missiles or military effort. Because it is not bound to pseudo rare-earth minerals, instead mathematics, Bitcoin obsoletes resource-driven war. Dominion is a human weakness.

Bitcoin is free of ideological hierarchy. It is not capitalist or socialist or communist. It does not ascribe to any belief systems, even if it’s creator may or may not have. Ideological alignment is a human weakness.

Bitcoin is not Chinese, American, Russian or European. It knows no borders and carries no banner. It does not care because it cannot care. Bitcoin works just as well in Pyongyang as it does in Sydney, Toronto or Cairo. Nationalism is a human weakness.

The worst of it: 

I was ready to buy .5 of BTC with a bank transfer. But the money went missing for weeks while the price of BTC soared from 13K-17K. 

The reason? I sent USD to my account set up for Euros.  (It's not clearly stated you can't do that. ) 

So they bounced the transaction with zero communication and my money went who knows where. 

After a friend's 800€ standard transaction also went AWOL for nearly two weeks (they say transfers 24/48 hours).  

I have my suspicians.

There have been a dozen other problems I won't go into.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, when I casually signed up a few years ago, it was because of their good reviews. 

What  I didn't realize then was how expensive their withdrawal fees are:

 2% to a hard wallet / 5 Euros bank transfer /  7% to a Visa 

There is no option to send crypto to any hot wallet account except to someone on Skrill.

**QUESTION:**

I have about 1 BTC there that  I want to onto a hard wallet.

However, if I withdraw to my wallet, it will cost me 360€.

But if I transfer to my bank, then quickly reinvest it on Kraken, it will only cost 5€, but I could lose a week of the money not being invested.

Or, I could just keep the money there and use their Master Card to pay rent, and invest my rent money on Kraken.

So that the  BTCU blockchain will operate on the LPoS mining algorithm combined with PoA, where users will use LPoS for mining and PoA for transaction validation.

2. High bandwidth

When validating transactions, the PoA protocol will increase blockchain bandwidth by getting a speed of 200 tps with the ability to scale up to 10,000 tps. When carrying out transactions, this increase in speed aims to eliminate additional inconvenience create by the current bandwidth in Bitcoin network which is around 3.8 tps.

3. Private transactions

By adding the ability to carry out private transfers within the network, the BTCU development team has been able to achieve the first and most important element of any blockchain, the anonymity. Making crypto payments as an alternative, the users prioritize anonymity rather than seeking for absence of commissions and intermediaries.

4. Smart contracts

With many similarities to the concept of Ethereum network, Bitcoin Ultimatum Blockchain is to provide smart contracts in the blockchain protocol with most important functions for the implementation of transactions and dAPP applications. Overcoming the limitation of validating transactions within the framework of a single blockchain protocol, BTCU team is developing the direction of smart contracts and implementing atomic swap technology natively to the blockchain protocol to allow carrying out of transactions interacting with other protocols which will globally expand the possibilities of this technology. The BTCU blockchain is to use smart contracts that keep away users from intermediaries or other ways to protect them from scammers.

In late-2016, early 2017, we retraced 61.8% (fib) before building back up throughout 2017 to $10000 for the first time and beyond. You can expect a similar retrace this time as a secondary bear trend grips the market over the next month or two.

# Wouldn't James be kicking himself right now?

James is one of the first six people to run and mine Bitcoin. He mined over 7,500 BTC during 2009-2013. If we do the math, his holdings were worth $10 million back then. It seems he was content with his 'Bitcoin Millionaire' tag and thus, he stopped mining Bitcoins in 2013. With the hope that his Bitcoin holdings will multiply in value in the future, he stored his Bitcoin wallet file in a hard drive and discontinued mining.

[Want to start digging this weekend?](https://preview.redd.it/7gx3j11kwa261.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1955b65368905c471f82cb970cc296cecf85a62e)

After selling his broken 'mining' laptop on eBay in 2013, James went on to declutter his space. (Yes, you heard that right. Back then, people used to mine Bitcoins on their laptop!) While cleaning his home in 2013, he mistakenly threw his hard drive into a waste bin at his local landfill site in Newport, South Wales. Well, this mistake was worth $10 million at that time. Today, his Bitcoin holdings would be worth $139 million.

# Don't you feel sorry for the guy?

&amp;#x200B;

[How would you be feeling right now if this happened to you?](https://i.redd.it/rgkcnd3dgb261.gif)

James is not alone, though. In a similar incident, Campbell Simpson, the Editor of Gizmodo Australia, lost 1,400 BTC in 2012 as he threw away his hard drive containing the code to access his holdings.

Wait, why didn't James or Campbell recover their hard drive from the landfill? 

Well, impossible is the answer.

Regaining their hard drives is unthinkable as landfill sites compress all the waste before dumping. Plus, with 50,000 tons of garbage added every year, recovering the hard drive is a distant dream!

James would've never imagined losing all his mined coins in his wildest dreams. I recon if James or Campbell kept their BTC on exchanges (in either the [UK](https://zipmex.com/) or [Australia](https://zipmex.com.au/)) that offered insurance, he could have avoided the situation. He still regrets not keeping it on an exchange platform. You may argue Bitcoin insurance wasn't a thing back then. However, crypto enthusiasts like you, now know better. Insurance does make a lot of sense!

Imagine what you could be doing with 139 million? Chances are you wouldn't be on your phone or sitting at your computer. You most likely would be ordering some drinks on your private island.

As you have read till here, there are some lessons you can learn as we approach the $100K BTC. For starters - don't throw away your hard drives and secondly do your research on insurance backed exchanges! Be a smart BTC holder.",1606715505,24,1

&amp;#x200B;

Choice A;

$100 goes into Bitcoin.  That $100 = 540,000 sats.  That $100 grows into $1,000, then $10,000, then $100,000.  That $100,000 will still equal 540,000 sats.

Bitcoin eventually becomes the global reserve currency.  Banks decide to switch all the money to sats.  By then say $1 = 1 sat, then the initial $100 you used eventually became the equivalent of $540,000.  Congratulations on the big pay day.

&amp;#x200B;

Choice B;

$100 goes into alt coin.  That $100 = X amount of shitcoin.  That $100 grows into $500, then $1000, then $10,000.  Wow, you managed to turn your initial $100 investment into $10,000, congrats!!  Time to sell and take that $10,000 profit.

Say by this time Bitcoin became the global reserve currency.  Banks decide to switch all your money into sats like in Choice A.  Well then you turned your newly acquired $10,000 into 10,000 sats which would equal $1.85 in this point in time.

Although TOR makes your IP address anonymous, your ISP can still track your activity.

It has quick speeds, allows unlimited connections, is one of the cheapest, and doesn’t keep logs! SurfShark is based in the British Virgin Islands so they aren’t legally required to monitor their users or comply with any governments.

k3nedb,mega_mang0,Casual BTC HODL-er just had my (relatively small amount of) BTC stolen...,"So, I preface this by saying that from what I understand this is done and there is nothing I can do to rectify it.

Years ago, someone gifted me some BTC. It was about $2 worth at the time (£1.50 or so), and I never spent it. I also did a little bit of work for BTC doing transcription or something, about £30 worth at the time. I kept it in my Blockchain Wallet online (mistake number one) and over the years I'd occasionally check in and see how it was doing. 
As of last week it was worth £200 or so. I never spent it and I didn't intend to, it was just nice to be part of it and have some BTC.

Recently I was notified by Google that my passwords had been released in a 3rd party data breach.

I spent some time fixing stuff up, but was busy with work so wasn't able to do everything.

I finally got the chance to change everything today, and when I got to Blockchain... I realised that had been compromised.

Whoever had access to my Google account used their access to my email to gain access to my Blockchain wallet and transfer themselves all the funds. And the date of the transaction was the day before my birthday last week. Woop-de-fucken-doo.

I'm absolutely gutted. I didn't lose a large amount of money (comparative to some!) but it's still a shit feeling to know you've been robbed. And now I have no BTC, and I'm not exactly in a financial position at the moment to buy in.

k3makd,ChTender,Make Most of the Gains With None of the Stress: Join HODL Gang Today,"Seeing a lot of new users asking about how to make some profits with Bitcoin. You’ll find that 98% of Bitcoiners agree, join HODL gang today.

What’s HODL? Simply put, it’s an investing strategy of buying and holding without monitoring trends or otherwise timing the market.

Why HODL? For all the reasons you’re hear, because Bitcoin is in an immensely bullish position. Also, because the global market for Bitcoin is one of the most opaque markets that has ever existed. Trading the Bitcoin market is nothing short of gambling for 99.99% of us. 

When to start your HODL? Today. Consider using Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) by buying a small amount of Bitcoin every day, week, or month. For example, instead of piling in 20K today, go ahead and do 2K each month for the next ten months. 

Why DCA? Because it gives you time to learn and to build confidence. Bitcoin corrections are painful for investor who lack confidence. Many will sell the floor because they are unable to believe in an investment they still need time to fully understand. You could potential more profits by piling in today, but you’ll have a healthier relationship if you go slow.

When to sell? As with making your initial investment, consider DCA when you think it’s time to sell. Your 20k became 49k and that feels like a huge run, your confidence is down because of some piece of news you read, instead of selling your 49K today, sell 4K each month. You might be surprised at how quickly you revert to buying. 

What if I have a health emergency? Sell and take care of yourself. Health comes first. This isn’t a cult. The excitement you see here is largely from users like me, who spent years studying Global Finance and who one day began to truly see the innovations of Bitcoin. This dream is bigger than you probably realize at this moment. But health comes first!

What if I need to pay off high interest credit cards? This is tricker, you might kick yourself later, but I recommend selling for this purpose. A 22% interest rate is insane and abusive, terminate that relationship and restart your Bitcoin DCA buying after.

Should I mortgage my house? This is even trickier to answer. First, because I don’t give high risk investing advice to strangers. Second, because interest rates are so low that the mortgage cash will almost certainly earn more in Bitcoin than it will cost in interest. For posterity I have to discourage this plan. You need a place to sleep, to have peace, and to be healthy. I’d recommend DCA but I won’t discourage you from crunching your own numbers and making your own well informed choice.

jpiubd,HeroicMeatloaf,High Network Fees for Bitcoin Deposit on Ledger Live,"Hey everybody, 

I’ve recently bought bitcoin from Coinbase and sent them to my Ledger Live Wallet. The Network Fees on Coinbase was normal but I noticed my Network Fees on my Ledger Live wallet we’re ridiculously high (over $100). The thing is it doesn’t seem to have been taken from the amount sent by my Coinbase wallet (the amount sent - Coinbase fees).

I was just wondering if anyone knows why this is. I know the fees are going to change from transaction to transaction based on the Network demand. But my real questions are...

1) Why is the fee on Ledger Live different than Coinbase

2) Why is it so incredibly high. I know demand is high but even $100+ doesn’t seem right.

3) Why doesn’t it seemed to have deducted from the amount sent by my Coinbase wallet?

This isn’t my first time depositing bitcoin to my Ledger Live wallet but this is the first time I’ve noticed this high of a Network Fee on Ledger Live 

Sorry for long post. I’ve tried googling this question but the only kind of results I get are for sending bitcoin and adjusting the fee to increase the priority which doesn’t seem to apply here. 

Thank you in advance!",1604716358,3,1

&gt;On Apr 10, 2013 8:52 pm my friend ""XXXXXXXX"" sent me 0.25 BTC and at that time I was able to log in and verify that and still have a screen shot of my account from that day and also a text file on my PC called Bitcoin\_Mnemonic.txt that has 12 random words in it. Since then I have not gone back to look at this until today and tried to use the original email link with no success and tried to regain access to the account I had accessed and taken that screen shot of with no success. So then I created a new account with the same email address but that shows a 0 BTC - $0.00. Please advise how I can regain access to the bitcoin I had access to in 2013. Thanks.

&gt;  
&gt;Hello,  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm sorry to hear about the trouble you are experiencing. Unfortunately we are unable to help recover or reset passwords. This is not a matter of policy but simply that it is impossible for us to reset a wallet's password due to the way the file encryption is designed. Please try every possible password combination you may have used.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can use the legacy mnemonic to reveal the password at the time of recovery phrase creation here,  
&gt;  
&gt;https://blockchain.info/wallet/recover-wallet  Keep in mind the mnemonic recovery phrase only reveals the password at the time of phrase creation, if the wallet’s password has been changed since the recovery phrase was created then the information it provides may be inaccurate and out of date.  
&gt;  
&gt;The older version of our wallet has been discontinued. This transition period was ongoing throughout most of 2016, and now upgrading your wallet to the latest version is required to access funds. You can learn more about the latest version via this link: https://support.blockchain.com/hc/en-us/categories/201149143-My-Wallet-Guide.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wallet.aes.json backups can be imported here: https://blockchain.info/wallet/import-wallet. Please note, this process does require the correct wallet password in order to decrypt the file.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you do not have the correct password or an accurate recovery phrase, then access to the wallet and any funds it may contain has been lost.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can read more about how our Blockchain digital currency wallet works - https://blockchain.info/wallet/how-it-works

&gt;Hi Sam,  
&gt;  
&gt;I just went to that link you provided: ""https://blockchain.info/wallet/recover-wallet"".  
&gt;  
&gt;That page says ""If you have a legacy wallet recovery mnemonic saved enter it below to view the password and login link.""  
&gt;  
&gt;After I entered my 12 word phrase it displayed a text box with my password that was just as I expected it to be but provided no ""Login Link"".  
&gt;  
&gt;However, on the upper left hand corner of the screen it says ""Existing Users Already have a Blockchain Wallet? Login Now"" but that takes me to the new account I created yesterday showing 0.00 BTC.  
&gt;  
&gt;It seems that I may need a ""Wallet ID"" from somewhere but I do not think I have had that provided to me as it is not in the original email I got from your site which seems to just have a link with a ""Claim Number"" nor does it seem to be on that screenshot I took of your site in 2013 which seems to just shows a ""Bitcoin Address"".  
&gt;  
&gt;I also clicked the link you provided: ""https://support.blockchain.com/hc/en-us/categories/201149143-My-Wallet-Guide"" but it does not take me to any info about upgrading anything nor do I even know what exactly would have to be upgraded or where the thing that's needs upgrading even is.  
&gt;  
&gt;Can you please explain to me in explicit detail, step by step, how I go about regaining access to my bitcoin using the 12 word passphrase I have or the password it showed to me on your site or whatever other means is available?  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks.

&gt;  
&gt;Hi there,  
&gt;  
&gt;We have to figure out, what your original wallet identifier is.  
&gt;  
&gt;To locate a wallet identifier we require both the email address and the IP address used to create the wallet. As a last resort we may be able to track down a wallet identifier if provided with both the password and the date this wallet was created. Please limit potential creation dates to a one week window. We are unable to search for a wallet based on bitcoin addresses used or transactions made within the wallet.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for your information and patience.  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;MYUSERNAME March 05, 2018 05:49  
&gt;  
&gt;So what now?  
&gt;  
&gt;I read on your site that the BTC was retrievable by the 12 word passphrase alone but now that seems to be untrue.  
&gt;  
&gt;I also would have expected that your site would still have my account setup under my email address but that's untrue as well as I was forced to create a new account in which I used the exact same email address and I even the same password again too.  
&gt;  
&gt;After the first email from your site I never got another email again including any ""Upgrade Required"" notification or ""We are going to delete your account"" email either. Why would you guys delete my old account and never even send me a warning email about it?  
&gt;  
&gt;When I try to use your site for a ""Wallet ID Reminder"" (https://blockchain.info/wallet/#/reminder) it wants to use my email address which is now set to my new 0.00 BTC account and not the old one you guys deleted.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have my original email from your site that I received on Wed, Apr 10, 2013 8:52 pm, which is the BTC creation date I assume.  
&gt;  
&gt;That email contains a link that says ""Click Here to claim this payment"" and the link address was: https://blockchain.info/wallet/claim#GYcJGNA9MKs2BcgPnJ3Co84fzqWPNixcwZ8G6VQDvEoJ  
&gt;  
&gt;Is that string of characters after the # symbol the Wallet ID or just some Claim ID that's of no use?  
&gt;  
&gt;I have the correct 12 word passphrase and I also know what my original email and password was (and still are with the new account).  
&gt;  
&gt;I am not sure what my IP address was at the time and assume my internet provider Comcast changes them occasionally but it is currently: XXXXXXXXXX

&gt;Which email did you use to initially create the previous wallet?  
&gt;  
&gt;The only wallet ID associated with your email was created yesterday.

&gt;Why does this page: https://blockchain.info/wallet/recover-wallet, say ""If you have a legacy wallet recovery mnemonic saved enter it below to view the password and login link.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Note: It's says \*\*AND THE LOGIN LINK\*\*""  
&gt;  
&gt;But when I type in my mnemonic phrase it only displays my password (that I already knew) but DOES NOT display the Login Link as it says it will?  
&gt;  
&gt;Seems like either very poorly worded and confusing info or a buggy broken web page to me.

&gt;Any luck using my creation date and password I sent you?  
&gt;  
&gt;It is highly unusual for a support person to ask for a customer's password,  
&gt;  
&gt;especially one for accessing money. And since providing you with my  
&gt;  
&gt;password yesterday I have not heard anything from you in over 20 hours.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is quite disturbing. Please tell me what is going on ASAP.

So coinbase decided to close my account cause I've logged from ""syria"" and that's not allowed
Ok i respect that and I'm cool with that BUT
I'm not from syria and i haven't traveled to it or logged from it all my whole life
I'm from tunisia (which is in north africa) and I'm tunisian and all my family are tunisian and i have never left Tunisia all my life even for traveling
I've mailed them but they didn't reply to me
When i have tried to mail them again they said they closed this ""case""
I've got tired from this site or Wallet or whatever it is
At the first my money stuck on pending and now this
I have lost almost 100$ on that account (5$ already on it before it cloaed/20$ i have buy it from a tunisian site/75$ on the way from site referrals and some tasks)
I'm really feeling bad and angry for that
Coinbase already made me lost a lot of my time 
I just want to say...
I didn't want to use this site again
Give me a chance to send my money to another wallet and i forget that problem
But if not. Sorry but in my opinion
THIS IS A SCAM
And that's a crime by the law
And I will sue this site
Even if i will pay all my money for that

Bitcoin happens to be my saving technology of choice. I'm 100% allocated and you could say its reckless, risky, dumb even. But I don't feel that way. For me this is the way.

This month I hit a few ATHs. Basically every month is an ATH in sats, the stack keeps growing. This month my fiat net worth also hit an ATH due to the price hike. And also, the purchase I made this month was with the highest price I've ever paid for Bitcoin meaning that I'm on profit with every single Bitcoin purchase so far.

I make these 'progress reports' every month, enjoy:

jnfe7y,Jumpy-Football,(Newbie question) Storing fiat value of XBT,"Hello everyone. Happy November. Thank you for allowing me to join your community.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are three ways to attempt to store the fiat value of my bitcoin:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Purchase tether (USDT) or similar stablecoin with my bitcoin

&amp;#x200B;

2) Join a derivatives exchange like BitMEX and short sell a number of contracts exactly equal to the fiat value I wish to store.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Use an exchange like Kraken to sell bitcoin in exchange for a wire transfer or other bank transfer.

&amp;#x200B;

Suppose 3) is not available. **What do the experts here recommend between 1) and 2)?** 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember that a lot of people don't trust tether due to some controversy about its backing reserves; **is there a better stablecoin that people here recommend?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Is the method 2) above a reasonable way to store fiat value on a time scale of a month or even more?**

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks and be safe out there.",1604426883,2,1

jneswt,anderover,Kraken locked me out of my account. Seeking legal help,"Kraken have locked me out of my account because I lost access to my email address. To be clear: I still know my valid password, login, 2fa password, master-key, api secret keys, and I control confirmed withdrawal addresses. They have requested I have a video call with them to confirm I am the owner. I have never registered my face or ID with Kraken before so that they consider ""seeing me"" to be more valid a security measure than all of the data I mentioned is pretty strange. In some ways it really brings into question the security practices at Kraken as a whole.

How this came about: In September Kraken introduced\[1\] a measure to confirm your device. For this they send a code to your email address. I lost access to my email address. I lost access because I choose to limit the amount of personal data I leave on internet websites (see [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com) for why) and I used a second gmail account I keep for general internet meanderings. This account had a phone number associated with it from a throw-away SIM card I no longer have. Gmail have locked me out of that email account with no method to recover (spent hours trying). Gmail policy on this issue is unclear and some times they will allow one to login without the phone number and some times not. I had hoped this would happen with this email address, but alas two events have collided to make costly these policies and my attempts to protect privacy.

If this all sounds strange, it is. I am not a drug dealer or engaged in illegal activities. Instead, I work with and protect journalists, human rights lawyers, activist. I explore the edges of privacy and anonymity so that I can better understand the threats they face. I am absolutely ready to give up the non-trivial amount of money that was in the Kraken account or to hire a lawyer instead to challenge the coercive behavior of tech companies that increase the degree to which they ask people to compromise their privacy. We are told to enable 2fa, and we do, then told to add their app, then told to never clear cookies or browser cache? Where does this stop? I hope that presenting such a challenge may protect others in the future. I have no issue having video calls with or meeting with lawyers but absolutely will refuse to do this with Kraken when I have all the valid credentials needed for my account and then some. (again, I lost access to my account because of a change in cookie policy at kraken, not due to anything that happened with my account)

If you know of a lawyer or are interested in helping with this case, please DM

jnbtoa,MeisterEder,Question on security,"Hi, fairly new to all this and beginning to think about my security. Currently I have my stuff on Coinbase, also have a Kraken account.

jls27o,nklmz,A couple of newbie questions about Bitcoin and blockchain,"Good evening community.

 I've been recently studying blockchain technology (using example of  
Bitcoin) and i will appreciate if you have some time to clarify my  
understanding regarding three things:  


1) If i got it right no one could possibly have a bitcoin (in general  
understanding), it's more about possession of some piece / stake of  
the whole value. And the only thing you could do with this stake is to  
transfer your ownership to another person for something in return  
(let's just say ""pay for some good or service"")  
2) These pieces (which i've mentioned above) could be from different  
parts of the whole value. Like a couple of pieces of a cake which were  
taken from different quarters, but in my wallet I see a whole amount  
(let's say 3.25). When i would like to pay some goods or services  
using bitcoin (let's say which cost me 1.5 bitcoin) payment mechanism  
will seek such number of pieces which value will be equal or excess  
1.5 bitcoin, in case if number of pieces will be greater than 1.5 then  
payment mechanism will return change to my possession after  
transaction is complete (let's say i have 5 pieces which overall value  
is 1.7 then they will be transferred to receiver of payment in full  
but during this transaction 0.2 value will be returned to my wallet /  
possession)  
3) In your white paper you had stated that ""We consider the scenario  
of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the  
honest chain.  Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the  
system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin  
air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker.  Nodes are  
not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest  
nodes will never accept a block containing them.  An attacker can only  
try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he  
recently spent."".  
Could theoretically ""creating value out of thin air or taking money  
that never belonged to the attacker"" be possible in case if an  
attacker did create a mirrored chain of blocks at the same time and  
date as original Bitcoin was introduced with his own version of all  
transactions? In other words alternate chain and honest chain have the  
same starting point consequently giving to the attacker a chance to  
replace the whole honest chain with creating value out of thin air or  
taking money that never belonged to the attacker?

Facebook's ban of the #bitcoin hashtag, while allowing actual financial scams to run wildly on their platform, is an ugly defamation. Bitcoin is an ideology, a system of trust and faith, a community that is being persecuted for its beliefs. Yes, some Bitcoiners are criminals, but this should not stain other Bitcoiners: freedom fighters and legit investors that were betrayed by the big financial corporates, and decided to take personal responsibility on their own savings.

If we don't act now, it will only get worse. If we don't shout out that we're innocent, the general public will start believing the lies that are told about the Bitcoin community.

1. What is bitcoin? Lol jk, but Can I use the same address? For example if I generate an address to receive bitcoin can I save that address and pass it out anytime someone wants to send me bitcoin? Or do I have to always create a new address, which If that's the case how long are the addresses valid for?

2. I came across this ""incognito crypto wallet"" that makes buying and sending bitcoin entirely anonymous and that you can buy a node from them and earn crypto by just having it run? Is this something that is legit? If not is there any sort of similar thing that exists? And no I don't mean mining (because they said it's similar it just doesn't take so much energy) 

3. How can I safely and properly purchase bitcoin anonymously? I would like to have the option of using a hardware wallet or something as a ""savings account"" and I'd like to be able to have it entirely hidden meaning there's no trail that it belongs to me for example coinbase makes me verify my identity to purchase crypto and so do other places.

4. And finally the last question I keep having trouble finding legit answers to is, how do I turn crypto into real world non magic internet money? I thought I could on coinbase but I guess not unless I keep missing the spot on how lol

jqgxq7,babyass,We need to make 1 Bitcoin a real smart coin that calculate its own value.,"We need to save bitcoin before it get ruined!

Today 1 bitcoin is worth arround 15,000 USD but the average fees is 12 USD/tx.

What will happen when 1 bitcoin hit 150,000 USD? can you handle a transaction fee of 120 USD/tx?? How about 1,500,000 USD with 1,200 USD/tx? No shop on internet will accept it as a currency. What good or service that can be sold at 1,200 USD/tx? None! If bitcoin hit 1,500,000 USD there will be no shop that accept it, and bitcoin will just be a useless currency.

The problem im pointing at is not bitcoin, is not the average fees, is not the block size. What im pointing at is the Fiat Currency. Pricing the value of bitcoin in USD and let centralized exchanges that hold most of bitcoin speculate the value of bitcoin in a Fiat currency. Speculators borrow tons of money and go buy bitcoin. And it price go up in a hyperdeflation spiral.

That is the current problem of bitcoin. We need to fight it before USD and speculators ruins it . We need to make bitcoin independant from any fiat currency, and help shops build a strong market and economy on internet with pure bitcoin.

Bitcoin already have tools necessary to let it calculate it own value without any need of USD or any speculator from those centralized exchange. It’s just that concept of self-valuation is very new and never have done before (as bitcoin was the first currency in its kind)

Bitcoin have already a market build in. The market of average fee per transaction. We can from it make a imaginary smart coin denomination that can calculate its own value according the behavior of the fees market. And shops on internet can just price their goods and services in that smart coin denomination instead of USD. And the smart coin will calculate it own value accordingly.

Today the average fee is 81000 satsohi/tx (12 USD/tx). What if we make an imaginary smart coin denomination that have an imaginary purity of 99.8% and the 0.2% is always the average network fee. This will give the coin an imaginary weight of 81000/0.002 = 0.4 btc (6000 USD). then call that denomination “The Real Bitcoin” as a real smart coin. 

The utility of this is facilitate transaction with bitcoin. if I send 1 real bitcoin to someone, i will be confident that he will receive 99.8% of it in the the first block. And the miners will get 0.2% as transaction fee.

That real bitcoin can be divisible to minimum 0.01. As if i want to send 0.01 real bitcoin on the first block, it need 20% of it as average network fee. And this behave as a real coin on internet.

If I open a shop I can just set price in that real bitcoin instead of USD payed in bitcoin. I will sell smartphones at 0.1 real bitcoin. And i will not worry about fee and volatility. And from this we can build a free market with pure bitcoin without worrying about fiat and volatility. 

This smart bitcoin can self value without any need of USD or valued by speculator. 

If average fees goes up, the imaginary weight of 1 real bitcoin goes up. And the price of satoshi/bitcoin will go down.This mean people will have less real bitcoin in their wallet.

If average fees goes down, the imaginary weight of 1 real bitcoin goes down. And the price of satoshi/bitcoin will go up. It mean people will have more real bitcoin in their wallet.

It's the exact same as the current BTC/USD build in wallets, but with satoshi/bitcoin. And the more fascinating it's self-valued without any Fiat currency or speculator of centralized exchange. Bitcoin will finally be free and calculate its own value according to how people prices goods and services on internet in that bitcoin.

This dont need any soft fork or hard fork. Just a small build the different different bitcoins wallets. A build that show how many satoshi you have, and how many Bitcoin you can send at 0.2% average network fee. (for example, showing you have 25 bitcoins and their weight is 1 million satoshis)

We need to raise awareness about this among bitcoin community, and tell bitcoin wallets developers to implement this. We need to make this to save Bitcoin from Fiat USD and speculators before they ruins it. And use bitcoin as a pure coin of internet.",1604860927,9,1

jq8rrj,markpaul00,Warning - Buying Bitcoin through TrustWallet - misleading quotes - high fees *UPDATE*,"Hi guys! 2 weeks ago I posted this thread:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/jjdtja/warning_buying_bitcoin_through_trustwallet/

Copy/paste:

&gt; Hi all,

&gt;Usually I use Cashapp to buy my Bitcoin (weekly, I DCA) and then I store in in Trustwallet, which is a mobile wallet owned by Binance.

&gt;I noticed they added a ""buy BTC"" option directly in the TrustWallet app, so I gave it a shot.

&gt;Unfortunately, they outsource the actual crypto buying process to a sketchy company, which uses misleading tactics.

&gt;As you can see from this screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/eknji0Z.png

&gt;US$5000 was to purchase 0.41635 BTC, an amount that I'm happy with.

&gt;However, at checkout, they change the deal to this: https://i.imgur.com/oSQoNPd.png

&gt;In simple terms, they wanted to sell me 0.43092 BTC for $5000, and then added a $175 ""processing"" fee. That's more Bitcoin than I wanted to buy, more fiat than I wanted to spend, and it brings the base price of the bitcoin from $11,603, to $12,009, a far larger number.

&gt;I would have no problem with this if they were upfront about the fees and what they are doing, but now I have sour taste in my mouth. I've been into crypto for a little while. Can you imagine how predatory this would seem to a new user who's going through their first buy?

&gt;This is my first post, so I hope I did it properly.

I want to provide some context and an update.

The above IS an issue. However, it is ONLY an issue if you use MOONPAY to buy crypto through Trust Wallet. The other payment providers do not perform a bait and switch, or perform deceptive techniques. 

Trust Wallet and Moonpay are still implicated, but Trust Wallet does have other payment providers in their ""buy"" function that DO NOT bait and switch you. Moonpay, however, does perform the bait and switch.

I hope this clarifies things. It's still shame on you moonpay, and shame on you Trust Wallet.",1604826553,13,1

 I am writing here because this is a small chance, but I hope that it is!
 My son advised me to write here after I told him about this problem.  Teenagers, apparently, still believe in a kind world.
 I'll tell you my story, the story of despair!
 They want and can kill or maim me.  Why, you ask?  For debts!
 But I will be brief so as not to force you to read a lot.
 I had a small business that was developing successfully.  The moment came when the question arose of expanding the business and investments were needed.  In December 2017, I found someone who could help (this was my first mistake, because they turned out to be very dangerous people, but I was very confident in myself).
 And at this time, familiar people began to tell me about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.  I succumbed to the hype (and this was my second mistake), like so many, I decided to invest in bitcoin and some ico projects.  I bought bitcoin almost at its peak.  Then you yourself understand what happened.  Over time, I had to sell my portfolio at a much lower price.  Then I had to sell the business, the apartment, to pay off the debt.  I got a job with a salary of about $ 400 a month (this is approximately the average salary in our country)
 As a result, I was left with nothing and with an amount of debt of about $ 190,000.
 Now these people are threatening me and my family.  And they can do what they say, believe me.  And the police will not help here.  I tried many ways to solve the problem, very little succeeded.
 I am in despair, thoughts of suicide come to me, I do not feel sorry for myself, but I cannot do it, because they will not leave my family alone.  I look at my son, at my five-year-old daughter, and I have tears in my eyes, because I am very afraid for them, because everything is for them.  So please help!  Maybe for someone this is a small amount, but for me the last two years are all.
 Even a few cents will help me!
 I only have 2 weeks!
 I don't know what else to write.
 PS: and if a miracle suddenly happens, and I can collect more, then I will definitely donate all the excess to charity, I will help people in difficult life situations.
 I wanted to post it on bitcointalk, but I don’t even have the money to do this, so I am doing it here on reddit.
 Thanks in advance.

jmiko9,brianddk,"A breakdown of Bitcoin ""standard"" script types (crazy long)","When challenged recently to provide an little known bitcoin fact, I presented that ""Addresses are not stored anywhere in the blockchain"".  This got me thinking a bit more about the bitcoin op-codes and the scripting language they describe.  There is a good [wiki article](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) on it all as a refresher.  It's basically a stack based language similar to Forth or [RPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPL_%28programming_language%29) language.  Here's an example of a [Mancala game](https://brianddk.github.io/2016/05/hp-42s-mancala/) I wrote in RPL to show more complex code.

So below I will set out to try to explain the seven most easily identifiable bitcoin transaction types and how the script assembly for them works.  Originally the script assembly was basically just `&lt;scriptSig&gt; &lt;scriptPubKey&gt;`, but with BIP16 and BIP141 the concept of deserializing either the `redeemScript` or the `witnessScript` were introduced.  Most of this is done outside the scripting engine by the bitcoin client, but here I image a new op-code called `OP_DESERIALIZE` for the task.  I realize it's fictional, but felt it was easier to present the material with this small imaginary op-code.

This makes our complete script assemble a bit more than just `&lt;scriptSig&gt; &lt;scriptPubKey&gt;` in most cases.  I'll go through what that assembly looks like as well as how block explorers or client software identify the seven major transaction types, and how the address is parsed and assembled.  I've also written a [sample script](https://github.com/brianddk/reddit/blob/master/python/transaction_types.py) that will decode these by walking through testnet blocks.

***
### [Pay to Pubkey](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Obsolete_pay-to-pubkey_transaction)

The original bitcoin client defined two fields `scriptSig` and `scriptPubKey` which each contained half of the script needed to validate a transaction.  The two scripts were concatenated together to create a complete script.  Here's an example of a Pay to Pubkey script

| P2PK          |size| script |
| :---          |:---| :---   |
|`scriptSig`    |72  | `&lt;sig&gt;`                                                     |
|`scriptPubKey` |35  | `&lt;pubkey&gt; OP_CHECKSIG`                                      |
|assembled      |    | `&lt;scriptSig&gt; &lt;scriptPubKey&gt;`                                |
|btc_address    |    | `b58_encode(pfx + hash160(spk[1:34]))`                      |
|Test           |    | `len(spk) == 35 and (spk[0:1] + spk[34:35]).hex() == '21ac'`|
|Total vB       |107 | 72 + 35                                                     |
    
Since the OP_CHECKSIG operation takes two arguments, this can be interpreted as `txin.OP_CHECKSIG(&lt;pubkey&gt;, &lt;sig&gt;)` from a non-stack based language perspective.  In regards to TXN size, the total size of one of these assembled scripts is 107 vB (bytes).  In regards to bitcoin addresses, the address is derived by chopping off the first and last bytes (op codes) from the `scriptPubKey` (`spk`) then performing a `Hash160` operation on the data.  The script is recognized by it's length and the first and last op codes (`OP_PUSH`, `OP_CHECKSIG`).

In the original client P2PK was used for what was termed ""[Pay to IP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.1.5/ui.cpp#L1421)"".  In this process, you would enter an IP address in the PayTo field, and the client would connect to the remote node to receive a `scriptPubKey` from them.

***
### [Pay to Public Key Hash](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Standard_Transaction_to_Bitcoin_address_.28pay-to-pubkey-hash.29)

Along with P2PK, the original client also supported P2PKH termed ""[Pay to address](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.1.5/ui.cpp#L1397)"".  Since addresses were always stored as the `Hash160` of the pubkey, this format had the advantage of requiring no secondary piece of information.  All the sender need was the bitcoin address, where as in P2PK the sender needed the `pubkey` and could derive the address.  But `pubkeys` are long and generally not checksumed like bitcoin address notation is.  Having the sender only need a small checksumed hash was simpler and became much more widely used, although it does require a larger `scriptSig` making it more expensive to spend

| P2PKH        |size| script |
| :---         |:---| :---   |
|`scriptSig`   |106|`&lt;sig&gt; &lt;pubkey&gt;`                                                  |
|`scriptPubKey`|25 |`OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;pkHash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`           |
|assembled     |   |`&lt;scriptSig&gt; &lt;scriptPubKey&gt;`                                      |
|btc_address   |   |`b58_encode(pfx + spk[3:23])`                                     |
|Test          |   |`len(spk) == 25 and (spk[0:3] + spk[23:25]).hex() == '76a91488ac'`|
|Total vB      |131|106 + 25                                                          |

the total size of one of these assembled scripts is 131 vB (bytes).  In regards to bitcoin addresses, the address is derived by chopping off the first 3 and last 2 bytes (op codes) from the `scriptPubKey` (`spk`).  The script is recognized by it's length and the first 3 and last 2 bytes (`OP_DUP`, `OP_HASH160`, `OP_PUSH`, `OP_EQUALVERIFY`, `OP_CHECKSIG`).

***
### [Pay to Script Hash](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki#specification)

So this simple script concatenation worked well for the first three years, but then, eventually more flexibility was desired and [BIP-16](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki) was introduced.  It was a simple enough concept, but if you're looking at a TXN validation completely within the scripting engine then the simple concatenation is not enough.  You will need to invent a new op code `OP_DESERIALIZE` and then insert some op-codes to glue it together to exist purely in this scripting engine.  The concept of `OP_DESERIALIZE`, introduced here, is to take the top data element (`redeemScript`) and reinterpret it as code instead of data.

| P2SH         |size|script |
| :---         |:---|:---   |
|`scriptSig`   |?? |`&lt;sigData&gt; &lt;&lt;redeemScript&gt;&gt;`                                  |
|`scriptPubKey`|23 |`OP_HASH160 &lt;rsHash&gt; OP_EQUAL`                                |
|assembled     |   |`&lt;scriptSig&gt; OP_DUP &lt;scriptPubKey&gt; OP_VERIFY OP_DESERIALIZE`  |
|btc_address   |   |`b58_encode(pfx + spk[3:23])`                                 |
|Test          |   |`len(spk) == 23 and (spk[0:2] + spk[22:23]).hex() == 'a91487'`|
|Total vB      |96+| 73 + len(redeemScript) + 23                                  |

The total size on the blockchain for a P2SH spent output will be at least 97 bytes.  The actual size will be dependent upon the size of `redeemScript`.  The majority of non-segwit P2SH transactions are multisig related.  At the time of BIP-16, multisig (P2MS) was already widely adopted, though it was mostly done in the `scriptPubKey` element.  As before, this put the burden on the sender to maintain an intricate `scriptPubKey` instead of a simple bitcoin address.  P2SH allows complex scripts to be used while still providing basic pay to address type semantics.  The address is derived like most pay-to-address outputs, though a different prefix (`pfx`) is used.  The script is recognized by its length and by clipping the first and last two bytes.

One thing to note with P2SH is that the `scriptSig` can only support OP_PUSH up to 520 bytes.  This puts a hard cap at the size of `redeemScript` and the flexibility of P2SH in general.

***
### [Pay to Witness Public Key Hash](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#P2WPKH)

The last four script types were all introduced with Segregated Witness ([BIP-141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki)).  In order for Segwit to allow backward compatibility, the `scriptSig` and `scriptPubKey` elements are either empty or consist of nothing more than data elements (`OP_PUSH`).  Since non-zero data will always pass validation, this makes all segwit TXNs default to valid if witness data is not included.  Like `P2SH` a lot of the op-codes are implied and to make the point I'll artificially insert glue-code here as we did with `P2SH`.

The P2WPKH is modeled after the P2PKH, but the `scriptSig` is moved to the witness program and most of the op-codes are implied.  Scripts are generally prefixed with `OP_0` to signify segwit enablement.  The goal of segwit was to allow blocks to expand to something approaching 4MiB while not breaking older implementations.  So you can still only have 1MiB of ""legacy"" block data, but you can have up to 3MiB of witness data... well kinda... The real [WU math](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weight_units) is a bit more complex, but I'll defer to the wiki for that.

| P2WPKH       |size |script |
| :---         |:--- |:---   |
|`witness`     |107  |`&lt;sig&gt; &lt;pubkey&gt;`                                                                       |
|`scriptPubKey`|22   |`OP_0 &lt;pkHash&gt;`                                                                        |
|assembled     |     |`&lt;witness&gt; OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;scriptPubKey&gt; OP_SWAP OP_DROP OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`|
|btc_address   |     |`b32_encode(pfx + spk[2:22])`                                                          |
|Test          |     |`len(spk) == 22 and (spk[0:2]).hex() == '0014'`                                        |
|Total vB      |48.75|22 + 107/4                                                                             |

For those keeping score, you'll notice that the witness program is 107, yet the same `scriptSig` elsewhere is 106.  This is because the witness program has to push an element count (0x02) so it can be deserialized.  I won't get into those specifics since I think we are already getting off in the weeds.  You'll also notice with the WU math, we get to apply a 75% discount to the witness program.  This gives our ""virtual size"" in the block at 48.75, making P2WPKH far and away the least expensive script type.  The address is derived from the last 20 bytes of `scriptPubKey` but by identifying the `scriptPubKey` as a P2WPKH type, the address will use bech32 encoding instead of base58 encoding.

***
### [Pay to Witness Script Hash](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#p2wsh)

As part of segwit P2WSH was introduced as a complement to the BIP-16 P2SH standard script.  But because the witness program is constructed and not pushed, it does not have the 520 byte push limit that P2SH has.  This means you can construct arbitrarily large M of N multisig scripts in the same way as P2MS worked, but at a greatly reduced WU size.  Just like P2SH, the script itself (`witnessScript`) is hashed and that hash is used to construct the address.  But unlike P2SH, the `witnessScript` hash uses a 32 byte `SHA256` hash not a 20 byte `HASH160` hash.  This makes P2WSH addresses uniquely long.  As before, there is a lot of implied op-codes used in the imagined script assembly.

| P2WSH        |size| script |
| :---         |:-- | :---   |
|`witness`     |?? |`&lt;sigData&gt; &lt;&lt;witnessScript&gt;&gt;`                                                            |
|`scriptPubKey`|34 |`OP_0 &lt;wsHash&gt;`                                                                          |
|assembled     |   |`&lt;witness&gt; OP_DUP OP_SHA256 &lt;scriptPubKey&gt; OP_SWAP OP_DROP OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_DESERIALIZE`|
|btc_address   |   |`b32_encode(pfx + spk[2:34])`                                                            |
|Test          |   |`len(spk) == 34 and (spk[0:2]).hex() == '0020'`                                          |
|Total vB      |52+|34 + (74 + len(witnessScript))/4                                                         |

Looking at the size calculation, the minimum overhead for P2WSH is 53 vBytes which is significantly smaller than P2SH.  It also does not fall victim to the size limitation of the BIP16.   The witness program can support OP_PUSH operations up to 10,000 bytes.  You will also notice that the address construction is 32 bytes.  This script type is easily identified by its `scriptPubKey` length and the specific pattern of the first two bytes.

***
### [P2SH Encapsulating Pay to Witness Public Key Hash](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#p2wpkh-nested-in-bip16-p2sh)

The next two script formats are clever bridge formats that were popular during the transition to segwit while not all wallets supported it.  The receiving side (`scriptPubKey`) is P2SH, but the spending side (`scriptSig`) is segwit.  This works because BIP16 simply needs a hash, any hash.  Normally a P2SH would receive a `redeemScript` hash, but in this case, what it receives is a `scriptSig` hash, which in turn contains the `pubkey` hash.

| P2SH-P2WPKH  |size| script |
| :---         |:--  | :---   |
|`witness`     |107  |`&lt;sig&gt; &lt;pubkey&gt;`                                             |
|`scriptSig`   |23   |`&lt;OP_0 &lt;pkHash&gt;&gt;`                                            |
|`scriptPubKey`|23   |`OP_HASH160 &lt;ssHash&gt; OP_EQUAL`                               |
|assembled     |     |`&lt;witness&gt; OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;scriptSig&gt; OP_DUP &lt;scriptPubKey&gt; OP_VERIFY OP_DESERIALIZE OP_SWAP OP_DROP OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`|
|btc_address   |     |`b58_encode(pfx + spk[2:22])`                                |
|Test          |     |`is_p2sh() and len(ss) == 23 and (ss[0:3]).hex() == '160014'`|
|Total vB      |72.75|23 + 23 + 107/4                                              |

Since the `scriptPubKey` is BIP16, the address is computed just like any BIP16 `scriptPubKey`.  The fact that this encapsulates a segwit transaction is not known until the `scriptSig` is revealed.  Only then is the serialized `OP_0` and `OP_PUSH` interpreted as a P2SH-P2WPKH transaction.  Due to the encapsulation, the imagined script assembly is a bit harder to understand, but it carries the same format as we'd expect, `{ witness + glue + scriptSig + glue + scriptPubKey + glue }`.  The ""glue code"" just has more work to do since it must verify both the `scriptSig` hash and the `pubkey` hash.  Although this format is more portable, it does take up 24 more vBytes than the native format.

***
### [P2SH Encapsulating Pay to Witness Script Hash](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#p2wsh-nested-in-bip16-p2sh)

Just like P2SH-P2WPKH, P2SH-P2WSH is simply a way to contain a P2WSH in a BIP16 address.  Again, this works exactly like a BIP16 address until the `scriptSig` is exposed.  Only then does it become clear that this is a P2WSH script.  Just like the native P2WSH scripts, this format fixes the 520 byte script limitation that was previously imposed on the BIP16 `redeemScript`.  The new P2WSH `witnessScript` is not capped until it reaches 10,000 bytes.

| P2SH-P2WSH   |size| script |
| :---         |:-- | :---   |
|`witness`     |??  |`&lt;sigData&gt; &lt;&lt;witnessScript&gt;&gt;`                                |
|`scriptSig`   |35  |`&lt;OP_0 &lt;wsHash&gt;&gt;`                                            |
|`scriptPubKey`|23  |`OP_HASH160 &lt;ssHash&gt; OP_EQUAL`                               |
|assembled     |    |`&lt;witness&gt; OP_DUP OP_SHA256 &lt;scriptSig&gt; OP_DUP &lt;scriptPubKey&gt; OP_VERIFY OP_DESERIALIZE OP_SWAP OP_DROP OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_DESERIALIZE`|
|btc_address   |    |`b58_encode(pfx + spk[2:22])`                                |
|Test          |    |`is_p2sh() and len(ss) == 35 and (ss[0:3]).hex() == '220020'`|
|Total vB      |76+ |23 + 35 + (74 + len(witnessScript))/4                        |

Again, the imagined assembly of this seems to be a lot to take in, but simply seeing it as `{ witness + glue + scriptSig + glue + scriptPubKey + glue }` may help to make it a bit easier to comprehend.  This format is recognizable by the longer `scriptSig` with the serialized `OP_0` prepended to it, and the address is computed as any BIP16 `scriptSig` is.  Even though this more portable, it is 24 bytes larger than the native form.

***
### Other formats

The two major forms not discussed here are `OP_RETURN` transactions and P2MS (Pay to Multisig).  `OP_RETURN` is simply a unspendable UTXO that can encode some data into the public ledger.  P2MS is the legacy form of multisig before P2SH was more commonly used.  P2MS avoids some of the limitations of BIP16.  As a general rule, if a TXN is not one of these recognized forms, it can be assumed to be of the form `&lt;scriptSig&gt; &lt;scriptPubKey&gt;`.  If that execution fails, then the transaction is invalid.  There is also some debate as to whether or not miners will include these arbitrary transaction types.  One thing for certain is that there is no convention for displaying any type of address for these UTXOs, since there is no convention for creating one.

It seems like most of the world is going to see the effects of a major economic downfall in the near future, as soon as the effects of covid really take their toll. Do you think they will print more stimulus money to keep evening afloat for a little while longer? (I know I'm not the only one who would immediately trade another stimulus for bitcoin, which would be great for bitcoin). Do you think that bitcoin will detach from the economy at a staggering rate at some point and could be triggered by a near economic collapse? Or do you think bitcoin will likely continue to slowly rise and take at least 20 years to reach its full potential regardless of the economy? Or is it possible that if the economy were to go down that bitcoin would go down with it?",1604272634,12,1

I recently transferred some BTC to bitpanda because i needed some cash for some unexpected family expenses. I had purchased the coins in 2016 through a friend and stored on a ledger since then (HODL!).
I was able to sell the BTC on bitpanda but when trying to withdraw the fiat to my account i received a notification that withdrawals are disabled. It is also not possible to send the remaining BTC back to my ledger: withdrawal disabled!
Apparently they require a ‘proof of funds’ and have automatically disabled any type of transaction functionality.
So I’m in the process now to basically unblock my life savings from bitpanda by painfully tracing back some sort of proof (invoice lol), and screenshots from the various transactions since then so i can “prove” the source of the coins and the full chain until it arrived on my bitpanda account.

I understand that’s probably a requirement by EU/Austrian laws but holy fuck! 

Hopefully this can help somebody to avoid the same pain and fear by choosing a different platform or decentralized exchanges.",1605009154,58,1

js9sxn,brianddk,Bitcoin Archaeology (building old code),"TLDR; How to build old OpenSSL releases in MSYS/MinGW v1.0.11 used by bitcoin

In a similar vein to the Github Artic Code Vault, and the Nakamoto Institute, I thought it would be educational to do a build of the first three versions of Bitcoin (v0.1.0, v0.1.3, and v0.1.5) [ref1].  Don't worry, I will keep these on a VLAN and not spam the IRC channel.

Wanting to be as accurate as possible, I spun up some VMs to try to recreate the vintage Oct 2009 toolchains that were used.  The original Satoshi posts seem to imply that the builds could be done using Visual C++ version 6.0 or MinGW and MSYS (which were at v1.0.11).  Since it looks like most versions of VC 6 have been purged from the internet, the only option left is MinGW which is still up on sourceforge.  Most things seemed to build OK, with the exception of OpenSSL, which looks to fail due to some issues in mk1mf.pl [ref2]  Perhaps there was a bad version of perl in MSYS v1.0.11, I'm not sure.

So my question is..  Has anyone been here long enough to recall the steps to build OpenSSL v0.9.8h in MSYS 1.0.11?  Or, does anyone know where to find a non-sketchy copy of Visual C++ 6.0?

My options so far seem to be.

1. Try to find out how Satoshi did the MinGW OpenSSL build back in 2009.
2. Try to do the OpenSSL build through Cygwin which could cross-complile to MinGW at the time
3. Try to do the  OpenSSL build through Msys2 with later versions of perl and libc
4. Buy some sketchy version of VC 6 on ebay and try that
5. Patch Bitcoin 0.1.0 to use OpenSSL v1.0.0 where they fixed the perl bug
6. Give up and use a precompiled OpenSSL release
7. Give up and use the Linux build methods introduced in Bitcoin v0.1.6

I realize this all sounds like a fool's folly, but it seems important (at some level) to be able to reproduce these old builds.  But perhaps it's just my OCD.

Thoughts?

For those interested.  The mk1mf.pl bug seems to be in parsing the list of headers through either the var_add, clean_up_ws, or do_copy_rule subs.  I see both the headers and header directories being parsed, but the directories are dropped when building the make rules causing make to assume all headers are at root, failing the build.  Perhaps there is a version sed, basename or dirname that is missing in MSYS, but I've failed to find the dependency yet.

js954q,quartzlump,Can bitcoin core be used in a multi-user setup? (Linux),"I last used bitcoin in 2017, and I was the only user on my computer. I had a full year away from cryptocurrencies before finally returning in 2018, in the form of Monero. Monero was a doddle to set up multi-user. I have a daemon user called bitmonero and it handles the blockchain via monerod. Each human user on the computer has their own login, and they can use monero-wallet-cli (or monero-wallet-gui) to handle just their own wallets. Only one copy of the blockchain is ever downloaded and only one single user ever writes to the blockchain data folder, so there are no permissions issues or unintentional file clobbering going on.

&amp;#x200B;

However there are some sites that still don't accept Monero, so today, I've tried to set the same thing up with bitcoin. I've created a bitcoin daemon user and left it synchronizing in the background. I'm now trying to run bitcoin core as a regular user, and it wants write access to the blockchain data folder. In this case, `/home/daemon/bitcoin/.bitcoin`. Obviously I don't want to give my regular user read access to another user's home directory. I could move it to somewhere more global like `/usr/share/bitcoin`, but again, regular users shouldn't really be writing there.

&amp;#x200B;

This same setup works for Monero (ie a home directory of `/home/daemon/bitmonero/.bitmonero` accessible only by the bitmonero user), so I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, or if bitcoin simply isn't set up for this, because right now, I wouldn't want to download a full copy of the blockchain per user. That'd be over 700 GiB right now. I also don't really want to go down the route of using zfs for its data deduplication feature, because that really wants 5 GiB RAM per 1 TiB hard disk space. I've only got 32 GiB of RAM available.

&amp;#x200B;

Specifically I'm using Debian, but this concept likely applies to any distribution. My searches for `bitcoin separate users` leads to something called ""accounts"", but that was written in 2013 and now has the word deprecated written all over it.",1605105176,11,1

And allegedly it's open source... but I confess I am not a developer by any stretch.

Lately I've seen youtube videos and read comments both about hardware wallets not being particularly secure and the potential pitfalls and vulnerabilities that come with having one.

So that being said, what is the absolute most secure way to generate a seed phrase and what is the most secure way to transact in Bitcoin?

Seed phrase using Electrum?  Some other wallet?

Having a standalone laptop that literally does nothing but Bitcoin via Electrum?

I would just run Bitcoin core and have a node setup but unfortunately life does not permit me at the moment to be downloading the blockchain 24/7.

Something else?

Couldn't remember the password, did a reset, it obviously asks for 2FA, which is on a previous handset. Get previous handset, open authenticator app, and the 2FA number is invalid according to the Coinbase app on my new phone.

Shit.

The Coinbase app on the original phone has now logged out, and now I can't access my account/coins on either of these devices.

Coinbase are now asking for identity to reset my password without 2FA, and I'm wondering whether it's worth doing this, or whether anyone here has had experience with another way to do this.

Now, what I'm thinking is, provide what they ask for, then just move the coins off Coinbase (which was on my mind to do anyway) and keep an offline wallet instead. It's not like I'm spending them on anything right now.

Anyway, advice will be welcome.",1605096487,10,1

Assume I'm a MEGA bitcoin whale with \~$500m in bitcoin. I'm sold on its future and have a $500k price target. What should I be doing to make sure this happens? Here are a few strategies I would take:

1) **I wouldn't HODL**: Instead, I would sell into rallies and buy the hell out of dips... this isn't with the intention of profit, but rather to reduce volatility and ensure a higher price down the road

2) **I would try to get bitcoin into the hands of powerful people:** Think billionaires, CEOS, senators, people with influence. This would be a win-win transaction— these influencers would benefit from the financial security (and they would keep in on the DL), and I would benefit from ensuring that my bitcoin will have much more support.

3) **I would increase bitcoin's exposure to investors, not speculators:** This means sparking conversation in academic circles, board rooms, endowment managers, etc. These are the people that will drive the long-term adoption. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure most whales are already doing this, and more. Luckily, many of the smartest people in the world are long bitcoin, so they probably are 20 steps ahead of this simple though experiment. Would love to hear feedback",1605230209,3,1

Would I have to actually live there to do that? Any exceptions?

Not sure what I'd do with this property. I could turn it into a rental/Airbnb, I could live there part of the year, I could turn it into a business. I have no idea, probably just do whatever I need to do to not pay crypto taxes.

Also... I have about $5k USD net wroth right now. I'm hoping that will change, but I'd estimate 3 to 10 years until I buy this 2nd property in a non-USA country. Hopefully that info helps because maybe some countries' laws are changing (for better or worse) then I may need to revise my list to add or take away countries based on my estimated time frame.

The Bitcoin whitepaper explains that the convention is that a coin is awarded to the first transaction in each block successfully created. I assume this is what meant by ""winning the bitcoin lottery"", but I have several questions: 

* 1 If two blocks are saved at the same time, do both miners receive a coin for the first transaction in their block, whether or not their chain continues? 
* 2 If bitcoin has a finite issue of 21 million coins, when the pool runs out, are miners incentivised only by the transaction fees offered by the network? 
* 3 a) If an attacker can assemble more CPU power than all other active nodes, what's to stop he or she from both claiming new coins, AND / OR defrauding the system by reversing his or her transactions, especially with application of a smart contract that can transfer value out to other currencies? 
* 3 b) Has this model of fraud been done, and can you share a link concerning what happened?
* 3 c) What community checks and balances are there against new contracts like this coming into existence, and is the security against this level attack best guaranteed by confirming history of open-source contracts?

Whale Manipulation Conspiracy Idea - Does this have merit?," OK so I'm super bullish on BTC and ETH right now; loving the pumps, but expecting a correction soon for BTC - but something came across my mind that I'm having a hard time shaking and wanted to see if others in the community think this is a possibility - I mean of course it's possible but it would SUCK!

So given the fact that whales are moving insane amounts of bitcoin - millions right? - into the market, everything is good while BTC in particular gains press, institutions are moving into BTC, paypal, Twitter CEO, etc. etc. and there are lots of predictions of 400k, even 1 million in 5-10 years (maybe sooner?), doesn't it kind of make sense that all of these huge institutions will wait for the price to moon and then sell off all their millions, oversaturate the market and walk away with billions (trillions?) and leave the small fish to fry as the price drops back down to nothing? Maybe not 0, but if the hype cycles over to fear, BTC doesn't really do anything other than hold value and be popular, doesn't that stand to reason it could easily drop back down with this huge sell off?

I'm sure you all don't trust financial institutions, banks and millionaires to care about small investors, so are there any arguments against this I'm not seeing? I'd like to retire with a million off 1 BTC, but I just feel like there's no way in hell these whales are going to see trillions in their portfolio and just stick it out for the smaller investors to sell off...

I have a notebook full of seed phrases (15 or so) that had been used for various wallets over the years, possibly using different BIP protocols. I don't actively use most of the wallets anymore, but can't help but wonder if some may have orphaned unspent txs. For example, perhaps at some point I sent to the wrong address, or someone donated to an address I had published somewhere months ago and forgotten about. It'd be great if there was a tool that I could enter all my old seed phrases in, and it'd check all relevant/possible BIP standards, address/wallet types (segwit and legacy), and show/alert me if anything was left unspent (or gets btc sent to it in the future). Even better if it could look across major blockchains. I know BIP standards are evolving and often not fully followed, so ideally it'd aggressively try all major standards for each seed phrase archived (almost like a master collection of all major protocols/implementations).  For maintaining link privacy of previous transactions, it would ideally run on bitcoin core or a full node (obviously not possible to check all blockchains and maintain privacy of address association).

That would allow me to have some closure with my growing list of seed phrases that I now no longer have original wallets (nor do I need them). 

I think this is close to what I'm looking for, but ideally a tool that would auto check all protocol implementations that this site lists, for all my seed phrases. https://walletsrecovery.org/",1605218574,1,1

Hey guys, I appreciate all the feedback I got from everyone in previous posts. I finally committed to Bitcoin. After a lot of researching I finally invested a lot of money into it with what I had saved up and I also bought a hard-wallet.  
On top of that, I also took a subsidized loan from school and plan on buying more bitcoin with that. Once it's time to graduate I plan on converting that bitcoin to however much loan I borrowed and then pay back my loans while also maintaining a profit.  


I'm no where close to having 1 BTC but this is a start! I don't expect myself owning 1 BTC for a while because I'm still a college student, but I'll hopefully graduate in about 2 years. Nonetheless, with however much Satoshi's I own, I really hope this will help me make a huge profit so that in 5-10 years I would be financially stable.",1605218016,8,1

jt3s57,UShouldBoughtBitcoin,Bitcoin is forming a pattern that in previous cycles have launched it into year-long Bull runs discovering new All-Time Highs," While history may not repeat itself, it does rhyme. And it is currently writing the start of another crescendo in Bitcoin's song.  

What we're seeing form now with this increasing rate of price growth is a pattern I like to call, the “Daddy actually came home after 2+ years of searching for cigarettes at a liquor store” Price Pattern.

It’s when Bitcoin recovers back to a price it hasn’t seen in on average over 2 years since dropping from a previous all-time high. Not the all-time high price itself, but a price on the way down during the drop of an all-time high. It’s a price many lose hope in ever returning after the drop and believe will never happen again because of how long it stays gone. The price itself feels like a father who left for “cigarettes” long ago, who you never expect to return.

And just like in that situation, the kids tell themselves that if their dad ever did return, they’d be so happy and excited to see him that they would do everything they can so that he never leaves again. And that’s exactly what happens to Bitcoin’s market when this pattern emerges. \*\*\*The market gets so excited to see it return, that it sends itself into a supply shock, and demand explosion frenzy that makes Bitcoin run-up in price at record levels and rates for as long as a year+. An endless loop that always repeats itself thanks to the halving and Bitcoin’s finite 21 million total Bitcoin supply network causing an endless feedback loop of price and stability increase attracting new buyers, traders, and holders growing demand for this infinitely finite asset. A perfect balance.\*\*\*

Back in November 2016, that price was $700, and it had not been seen in over 2 years since last appeared way back in February 2014, dropping from a $1,300 all-time high price reached 2 months prior in December 2013.

Every time this happens, the market gets excited and it triggers up to over a year-long bull run to discover a new all-time high price. This will happen again, and I suspect it will happen throughout 2021, possibly spilling into the start of 2022 before correcting, and restarting the cycle.

To see this price chart pattern throughout all of Bitcoin’s history, check out this video:

[https://youtu.be/C0Woc1JjsLI](https://youtu.be/C0Woc1JjsLI)

It reminded me of this pattern I had completely forgotten about since it last happened in 2016, and the $700 price return in November 2016 after a 2-year hiatus lead into the year-long 2017 run up to $20k",1605216883,9,1

We are living in a digital age, it's unquestionable... A lot of things around us is connected with the internet, and more and more things will be connected to the internet in the future. People who understand how the internet works (I mean things like interconnection among ISPs, companies, data centers... BGP and so) and also computers/servers, OSes running on them, etc., are often also cryptocurrency-aware, and therefore they often hold some.

Now we are living also in the age where banks, large corporations, lawyers, politics, etc., are ""holding our balls"" and they rule us, letting us, ordinary people, almost nothing to change. But what if (we) IT people can change it now or in the near future? What can happen when more and more people will buy cryptocurrencies and it will quickly turn to a mass madness and all banks will go bankrupt terribly due to rapid money withdrawals? Then the value of cryptocurrencies will rocket much much higher and fiat currencies will fall so it will be nearly priceless... Then people from IT (and of course not only them) will get rich and guess what... They will start quitting their jobs at corporations, federal services, and so on. Then the World will have a lack of IT people, the internet and all the dependant services will start failing more and more, until the new IT generation won't rise, which will take some years. Therefore also the price of all the IT services will increase and it will shuffle the cards.

Of course, for many people, this is the worst scenario and they will have to stop it. But cryptocurrencies seem to be unstoppable and people, as I believe, need them for their overall progress. Also, I don't think that all the people from the financial or (large) corporate sphere will want to miss their train, and they will buy cryptocurrencies as well or they will try to destroy it somehow... but only If they will hurry up.

In any case, we will see who holds whose balls, and it will probably happen during our lives.",1605214582,1,1

Relative Bitcoin n00b here, but have been accumulating for the last 15 months or so. Back in August, I invested in a Ledger device to eliminate the risk of holding them on exchange.. I was able to send all my Bitcoin off exchange onto the device seamlessly. 

Since then, I've been accumulating more BTC and ETH and want to move the new buys off exchange as well. However, going through the same process of generating the Ledger address to send to, Coinbase tells me that the address doesn't look like a BTC address (or an ETH address when I tried that), and won't let me send. I've tried both the QR code as well as the manual entry (which I'm terribly uncomfortable with!). 

I did some troubleshooting - someone mentioned it might be due to the segwit status of the Ledger wallet, but that didn't stop me before when I sent in August? Also, it's unclear to me how to change that so the Ledger wallet can receive again.

jr4sah,luc1232,Do NOT use electrum or am I crazy?! Please come in!,"Am I crazy or does Electrum suck? You are not going to believe this and I've been panicking for 2 hours. 

So I made a cold wallet with electrum and tails. I went to great length of security when I made it, I even learned how to verify a software with the PGP standard to check if the tails and electrum versions I download are legitimate.   


So, I made my wallet and left it there, always offline. I have the seed buried in the ground in a spot I know. Now... I go into tails, offline, and open my wallet, of course (being offline) it shows me no balance but it shows me the addresses and the public key.   
Well the public key and the addresses were NOT the ones where my money are. WTF!   
So I tried I tried again and again but it didn't make sense. I have the seed so that's it in theory right?

So now, I kid you not, with the same fucking seed, I open a new electrum wallet, same seed, one time it opens me a wallet with a public key. I do it again and it opens me another wallet with a different public key. Two different wallets with two sets of different addresses! WTF!   


So this is insane, here's what happens:

1. if i create an electrum wallet, when there is the box in which you write the seed, if I do NOT click the ""option"" button"", SOMETIMES it goes forward and some OTHER TIMES it does NOT. I am NOT joking. 
2. when it does NOT go on, I click ""option"" and I click ""seed BIP39"", I press ""ok"" and next to the ""option"" button the script ""BIP 39 (checksum: failed)"" appears. So I click ""next"" and now, IF I click next again, it shows me a different wallet, not mine, with a fucking different pubkey and different addresses. IF instead I click on the top ""detect existing accounts"" it tells me ""Choose an account to restore"" and I can select the option ""Standard BIP84 native segwit (Account 0).   
I select it, press ""OK"", press ""next"" and it gives me my original wallet with the right pubkey and the right addresses.

WTF is going on?! I created that seed offline on electrum, so when I do NOT click the ""bip89"" option it should work right away. Why it doesn't? And why does it show me 3 different fucking wallets with the same seed? 

  
I thought I had understood the mechanics well, far from being an expert but well above the average user yet I found myself lost. My trust for bitcoin and electrum is severely decreased. Maybe it's better to keep it on an exchange so even if they lose them they're gonna reimborse you. Fuck! How are we supposed to hold our money without being a crypthographist?   


Please you experts give me a logical explanation that makes sense, I didn't lose any money and even if I had lost them they were a small amount so my life wouldn't have changed but this event completely changed my perspective on bitcoin. 

It doesn't make sense! An offline wallet created with electrum and with the same seed it opens up 3 different wallets with 3 different pubkeys and different addresses? WTF!?

jr2eq6,Nossa30,How I bought 1 BTC making $15 an hour after 2 years!,"# It all started,

In late 2015 when I first started mining Bitcoin when I first downloaded Miner gate. After installing it and still couldn't figure out how to move it to my own wallet, I just gave up for about a year or so. It was still too complex at the time to use. I only mined about $100 bucks or so. 

2017 rolls around, BTC starts going crazy. I started investing JUST before the $20K ATH. As 2018 starts, it pretty much went downhill from there. However I never gave up because I knew Bitcoin was something special and unlike any other asset. 

All throughout 2018 I did all the wrong things you should never do as an investor. I bought at the ATH, I caught a falling knife and bought bitcoin literally as I watched it go from $20K, $15K,$10K, and down to the months long slog at $3,000. I even tried trading and buying Altcoins and lost even more money. When BTC was stuck down there, thats when I was buying the most. Even when nobody was making youtube videos anymore and nothing but FUD left and right, I was still buying. Mostly because I heard a bunch of youtubers say ""buy when there is blood in the streets"" so that's exactly what I did. Keep in mind I had never invested in a stock my entire life at this point. 

# The Key method of how I got 1 BTC

Dollar cost Averaging

That is the key. Every single week I got paid it was only about $500 a week. Since I lived with my mom and only paid half rent, every two weeks I got paid I would buy exactly 0.01 BTC (put another way, I bought 1% of a bitcoin every 2 weeks). Regardless of the price I would invest. 

Since 2018 was a bear market, It was getting cheaper and cheaper every single week. When it was $3000, It was so cheap that 0.01 BTC was like $30 or $40 a piece so I bought like 3 or 4%(0.03 BTC) every 2 weeks. Since there is 52 weeks in a year, by the time 2019 rolled around, I already had roughly 65% of a Bitcoin. 2019 was half bear and half bull market but still I stuck to my guns and no matter what every paycheck I bought 0.01 BTC regardless of price. 

Now by the time 2020 rolled around I had exactly 97% of a BTC. It was only this year That I had finally gotten to 1 BTC! I heard Charlie lee say a long time ago to stay away from Altcoins until you have 1 BTC and that is exactly what I did. After the pandemic started, I then started buying Ethereum 0.2 ETH a paycheck and I now have multiple ETH. 

I just wanted to tell my story of how I got 1 BTC and hopefully inspire others to get invested. I don't know if what I did was luck or skill, ***but the key thing is to stay consistent***. If you water a plant every single day eventually you will get the fruit.",1604944249,400,1

ju03w9,brianddk,Bitcoin Archaeology (building old code); Part II,"As I mentioned in my [other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/js9sxn/bitcoin_archaeology_building_old_code/), As a learning endeavor, I've been working on building the first 3 versions of bitcoin.exe.  Namely version 0.1.0, 0.1.3 and 0.1.5.  To try to be true to the original, I'm working on building up an environment as close to the original one used in October 2009.  Harder than it might seem.

Although it isn't known (by me), The two major versions of Windows that were available at this time Windows Vista (Longhorn) and Windows 7.  Not really wanting to buy a license for either of these, my choices are to use either archived beta's or jump a bit ahead or behind.  I decided to jump ahead to Windows 8 (2012) and use that as by build base.  Since I'm using the ""Server Core"" edition, it may be a bit foreign to most, but I find it works quite well.

Since I'm using an old OS, its best to run it in a virtual machine just to reduce the heartache of trying to find HW that will run the old SW.  I'm use VirtualBox which is available in many different host formats.

Once I get the OS up and running I install Perl (strawberry), GCC (MinGW) and Bash (MSYS).  From there it's pretty much just paint by numbers, though I'm still having trouble in the very last step.  Here's, hopefully, a very brief rundown of how to get it working

### Download the files

At the end of this article I have the links to all the files and their MD5 checksum.  They are all archives of one kind or another that have their own checksums baked in.  This is just so you can sanity check your downloads.  Files not OS or VM related will be pushed to the VM once we get it up and running.

### Building the VM

I used the default Windows 2012 settings for VirtualBox.  Though I did enable port forwarding for RDP (3389) and remote shell (5985).  I'd suggest also enabling shared folders to push over the downloads.  You will need to take care.  I'm running Hyper-V (yes inside a VM) since it's free.  To pull this off you have to disable the Hyper-V feature halfway through the install.

### Building OpenSSL

OpenSSL was the build that originally tripped me up.  Turns out it was a bad version of Perl I was using.  I switched to Strawberry Perl and everything cleared up.  I did have to give up on the optimizations Satoshi outlined in his original code, and just did a plain vanilla build of OpenSSL (disabling the assembler since I don't own one)

    set home=C:\msys\1.0\src\bitcoin-0.1.5
    set path=C:\MinGW\mingw32\bin;C:\MinGW\bin;C:\Perl58\bin;%path%
    cd /d %home%\OpenSSL
    call ms\mingw32.bat no-asm 2&gt;&amp;1 | C:\msys\1.0\bin\tee.exe '%home%\OpenSSL.log'

### Building Berkley

This looks a bit more tortured than it needs to be.  Basically I just need to launch a BASH shell to run the configure script.  That bit of extra Kung-Fu is just restoring the PWD.

    set home=C:\msys\1.0\src\bitcoin-0.1.5
    set path=C:\MinGW\mingw32\bin;C:\MinGW\bin;C:\msys\1.0\bin;%path%
    cd /d %home%\DB\build_unix
    sh.exe --login -c ""cd '%cd%';../dist/configure --enable-mingw --enable-cxx"" 2&gt;&amp;1 | $msys\bin\tee.exe '%home%\DB.log'
    make.exe 2&gt;&amp;1 | $msys\bin\tee.exe -a '%home%\DB.log'

### Building wxWidgets

It's about as simple as you can get... which is why I'm perplexed that this build seems to have been the root of my current issue.  Hopefully I'll find root cause soon.

    set home=C:\msys\1.0\src\bitcoin-0.1.5
    set path=C:\MinGW\mingw32\bin;C:\MinGW\bin;C:\Perl58\bin;%path%
    cd /d %home%\wxWidgets\build\msw
    mingw32-make.exe -f makefile.gcc 2&gt;&amp;1 | $msys\bin\tee.exe '%home%\wxWidgets.log'

### Building Boost

Buckle up.  Boost takes about two hours to build on my VM.  The build isn't perfect either.  Attempted about 4000 targets, skipped 56, and failed 96 of them.  Some of those targets were due to the fact that I didn't install a 64-bit cross-compiler, so I assumed they are expected.  The build requires bjam which is in my download list, but it is easy to miss.

    set home=C:\msys\1.0\src\bitcoin-0.1.5
    set path=C:\MinGW\mingw32\bin;C:\MinGW\bin;C:\Perl58\bin;%path%
    cd /d %home%\Boost
    bjam\bjam.exe toolset=gcc --build-type=complete stage 2&gt;&amp;1 | C:\msys\1.0\bin\tee.exe '%home%\Boost.log'

### Building Bitcoin

Again... looks a bit complicated, but the shuffling of the subst command is analogous to a chroot command in linux.  It simply changes where the root directory is.  The bitcoin make file looks for the dependencies in the root directory.  This is just a way for me to keep them in a subfolder until it is time to build.  I doubt this is the cause of my failures, but I can move things around later I suppose.

    set home=C:\msys\1.0\src\bitcoin-0.1.5
    set path=C:\MinGW\mingw32\bin;C:\MinGW\bin;C:\Perl58\bin;%path%
    if exist s:\ subst s: /d
    subst s: %home%
    cd /d s:\
    mingw32-make.exe bitcoin.exe -f makefile 2&gt;&amp;1 | $msys\bin\tee.exe '%home%\bitcoin.log'
    subst s: /d

### Final Failure

Although I'm able to get all the dependencies to build, bitcoin.exe is still failing.  It starts with some errors on /wxWidgets, and just cascades from there.

jttke2,ytb45b,How Not to Go Insane in 2021-2022,"As a PSA to those who have yet to experience the emotional and psychological extremes of a Bitcoin bull market, I thought I'd share my prescription for maintaining sanity during what is shaping up yet another parabolic market move both up and (inevitably) down. I'm sure many of these will seem obvious to the veterans among us, but this is for those who aren't:

1. **KNOW YOUR PRICE TARGETS**: Everyone needs to know ahead of time, what prices are important to them. Whether just for curiosity or your target buy/sell prices, you should know even approximately. You may need to update these weekly, monthly, annually, etc., but the point is, you need them, otherwise you necessarily will impulse buy/sell. If you are some kind of active trader, set your targets based on whatever indicators you use, but both traders and HODLers need targets. Once you've determined your targets, set your alerts, don't watch the price move. Only look when your phone notifies you. Simple. Watching the price is a waste of time. I have both short-, medium-, and long-term price alerts, and I don't waste much time looking at the price beyond occasionally updating my technical analysis charts to hone my price targets.
2. **SET PRICE ALERTS**: Download a mobile app onto your phone that allows you to set alerts when the price hits user defined prices. This will allow you to set both UPWARD and DOWNWARD alerts that will keep you from hitting refresh literally every 2 minutes for hours on end. Anyone who has been in one of these crazy market cycles will understand how compulsively the price checking gets. I've missed time with my family and friends during the last cycle over Thanksgiving and Christmas 2017. Set the alerts and don't look at the price until they are triggered, saving you hours of time and the psychological stress. I recommend [Blockfolio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockfolio.blockfolio&amp;hl=en_US) for this and use it to track all of my purchases and their individual rates of return, dates, spot price, etc.
3. **KEEP YOUR COINS OFF EXCHANGES**: This is not only important from a security standpoint, but will also dissuade you from impulse selling or actively trading (unless that's your thing). Some exchanges have limits and wait times for transfers, which will keep you from making stupid trades. Any extra steps you can put between you and impulse will be helpful.
4. **GET A HARDWARE KEY &amp; ROBUST SEED STORAGE**: As a corollary to the previous point, a high-quality and simple hardware key directly from a reputable vendor is critical to your peace of mind when holding a substantial sum of tokens. If even modest projections of future prices are accurate, you could be holding 5-7 figures-worth of coins in this wallet over time. Spend $200-300 now to ensure your key(s) are safe. I've been using Ledger Nano S for years and can confidently recommend as far as hardware keys are concerned, and just recently acquired a [Cryptotag](https://cryptotag.io/) Zeus to store my BIP-39 seed words, which I've liked so far. 
5. **SET UP A DUPLICATE HARDWARE KEY**: This is one I haven't seen said anywhere really but is a cornerstone of my basic security strategy. I've set up two Ledger Nano S devices with the same seed phrase and PIN both of which work perfectly normally with the software. In the event I lose my hardware key or my seed phrase is compromised, or both, I can QUICKLY use the backup to transfer funds to a new wallet with no latency that would be required if I had to order a new hardware key. It's crazy simple. Basic instructions can be found [here](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007646053-Use-multiple-Ledger-devices) if you have a Ledger.

I've learned each of these through experimentation and found that I'm most comfortable with it and it works best for me and encourage you all to find what works for you, but everyone has their own preferences. While this surely isn't an exhaustive list, I hope this is at least a little useful to a few of you during what I expect to be a crazy 2021-2022. Happy HODLing!",1605319188,43,1

I spend all day doing this kind of thing and though this might be the place to share it.

Unique wallets is obviously not meant to be a like for like comparison to population online. And the scales are very different, hundreds v tens of millions.  That said you can visible see the correlation coefficient between theses would be very height indeed. Correlation isn't necessarily causation but I find the rate of growth strikingly interesting and the very least its fun to code these kind of graphs.

jtc58a,AlfredoSaucess,Please help my students become literate.,"Hello everyone. I am a new teacher at a Title 1 school district. Over 86% of my students are from low-income households. My 9-10 year old students experience poverty, hardship, distress, and more at such a young age. Their motivation to learn is very tender because they are often discouraged due to their environment.

I see my students for who they are and what they are capable of. My number one goal with my current (and future) students is to ensure literacy. My teacher salary is not enough to afford a classroom library. I make just above the poverty line. The best solution to ensure they have access to thousands of books is with technology. Technology will allow students to receive diverse and relevant reading material that can also meet ALL students at their current reading ability.

Please, if you are capable of donating $1-5 dollars to this campaign it would mean the world to my students and their teacher (me). This is just the difference of getting a grande instead of a venti at Starbucks. Any help counts and I am not asking for much. I just need help reaching this goal and I will scour to the end of the Earth collecting dollars at a time.  **Donors Choose will also double any donations for the next day using code ""LIFTOFF"".** Your $5 donation could become $10 using this code.

Tomorrow is World Kindness Day. My students begin each day with social and emotional learning through our morning meeting. I would love to tell them the news that people believe in their education and we received the funds to get an iPad for our classroom. Thank you so much for your consideration. - Ms. Morgan

I have four deprecated / very used S9 running stock firmware (13\~13.5)  and now I'm upgrading and installing a new power system, new cables and 12 ""2 years old"" S9 in good quality.

The scenario here in Brazil is a little bit odd - every S9 costs around BRL 1200 or USD 220. There is no cheaper machine here. That's the cheapest one. So I'm investing in 12 new machines with a small discount bringing it to USD200 bucks each.  So my question is simple. I saw a lot of firmwares promising improvements over S9, expanding the hashrate from 13.5 stock to 16.5  or even lower, less energy delivering less TH/s.

**Do any of you have experience with those firmwares? (hiveos/slush/braiiins/etc)? Worth it?**

Have any kind of ""hint"" to give to a newbie throwing all his savings on this project?

&amp;#x200B;

I expect to receive 1000 USD per month with 16 machines. Doesn't look like it, but that's pretty decent money here in brazil, since BRL is so low. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Please keep in mind 3 things:** 

* \- T**he energy here is ""free"", but limited. (** oh,How I wish to install 100 S9 running 24/7.... but I can't.)
* **- It's a 5 square meters room (55 square feet) with one 18000 BTUs air conditioner plus a 12000 backup one.**
* **- The outside temperature (Rio de Janeiro) is something over 25 at night going to 43 degrees celsius by day (or 75f at night rising to 110 fahrenheit daytime)**

Any tips, hints and advice will be greatly aprecciated

juym7w,Pantamis,"Why running a Bitcoin node makes you ""your own bank"" and why you should run one","We have many newcomers and many seems to not understand what a bitcoin node is, what power it has, why it is important to run one, why node decentralization matter much more than anything else. I want to share my opinion on why by running a node, you are indeed your own bank.

I invite you to also read [this post](https://medium.com/hackernoon/bitcoin-miners-beware-invalid-blocks-need-not-apply-51c293ee278b). It shows how you can represent the Bitcoin network with visual image and it is nice to understand the technical role of nodes in the protocol. I want to focus on my opinion of the banking function of a node here.

&amp;#x200B;

# What is a Bitcoin node ? What the Bitcoin network does?

&amp;#x200B;

A bitcoin node is a peer of the Bitcoin P2P banking network. It is just that but it doesn't tell you much so a better question is : **What is a banking network actually ?**

A banking network is a mesh of banks which can emit, transfer and redeem their IOUs that we call a money. Emition is money creation and each banks may follow certain rules to enable such creation for a customer. A banking network allows the customers to transfer the freshly creates (or received) money (which is bank's IOU) to someone else more or less freely (sometime you can't, KYC, AML stuff...). Transfers are written in a ledger, which is a trusted record maintained someway by all the banks of the exchanges of the IOU and is what makes this kind of IOU so different from others: the mortgagor (custumers of the bank) can ask the borrower (the banks) to transfer the future repayment to someone else so that the mortgagor pay the latter. Cash is one way to make the transfert, wired payment is another.  And the banks can just destroy the money by removing it from the ledger, but better not doing it randomly if you want to keep the custumers using your banking nework (that may explain why burning cash is forbidden..)

&amp;#x200B;

Now the heart of banks policy is this: what truely makes several banks a banking network is the fact that they follow the same rules for money creation, transfer and destruction and they agree on the same ultimate ledger. They are several way to organize such network, lets look at fiat currencies first :

In fiat currencies the network is centralized and it may have a kind of fractal structure: the Central Bank manages the currency ultimate ledger but delegate a part of its power (money creation/destruction and transfer) to private banks through law and banking regulation, each of the banks have there own policy, responsibility in money creation and ledger that they delegate to regional banks desk which manage the policy of local banks.  Generally, each level has its own ledger and only net settlements are written to the ledger of the level above.  Fiat IOU are often represented by numbers written as amount of your bank account or cash (that only the central bank can print). Finally, when money is created in fiat currency, the banks always created an IOU against another debt IOU's (the state and private banks debt for Central Banks, customers for private ones), when redeemed, the banks get back his own IOU and can safely destroy it. We talk about ""money based on debt"". Fiat currency are today backed by debt. Being fiat rich mean they people have a kind of debt to you a lot (and you may see why inflation is needed in such system since without it, it is impossible to redeem the total of loans interest). During Gold Standard, the Central Bank only created money against gold (but private bank still created money based on debt, this is fractional reserve banking), it was a commodity based money (backed by gold).

So now, what about Bitcoin ? It is a P2P banking network. Nodes are the banks and all nodes follow the same rules. However the network is not at all like fiat currencies: it is peer-to-peer, fully decentralized. This means no nodes has more power than any other node and they all keep track of the same ledger (there is no intermediate ledger like fiat). The nodes check that the supply schedule (the money creation part) is correct, all transactions and blocks are valid and propagate them to other peers if it is the case (the transfer function of the banking network). The IOU of this banking network is the bitcoin token.

&amp;#x200B;

# What makes Bitcoin a banking network ? (and Bitcoin a money)

&amp;#x200B;

Now you may say that my story of ""bank's IOU is money of the banking network"" doesn't fit in Bitcoin since money is never really destroy and no one will give you something in return if you burn them ... but I have a way to look at it that makes it coherent.

Bitcoin's token are destroyed when you pay the transaction fees, they disappear from the ledger, transaction fees are indeed not a payment because you don't know who you are paying exactly: the protocol force you to give it to the miner who include your transaction somehow. Against this money destruction, you gain a priority score in the queue to write your transaction in the most secure, replicated, immuable database of the world: the Bitcoin's ledger. Why ? Because we have a rule which say that the miner of a block (which is also like a bank customer who borrows) can claim newly created money at most equal to the new supply schedule of token plus total of transaction fees in the block, so the just destroyed money is immediatly recreated... like any normal bank would wish to do in fact ! In the case of Bitcoin, the money is somehow ""hash based"" and hash is priced by the network difficulty and priority competition. The banking network exchanges against the hashing power they have to secure the ledger a priority right (incarnated by a bitcoin utxo) with miners to write stuff in the database stored by all nodes that they can transfer if thes wish to do so. The money creation against hashrate is a perfect alignement of incentives: the Bitcoin's banking network creates the money for the ones who make the ledger going forward. You can check in a block explorer that the miners indeed claim the full reward in the coinbase directly, and the raw data of a transaction have no field ""transaction fees"", they are always equal to the unclaimed (=destroyed) bitcoins in the output of the transaction.

&amp;#x200B;

So there you have it: a bitcoin node is a peer of the Bitcoin P2P banking network, a monetary network or settlement network (not a payment network like Visa, you can't have a loan with Visa, so it is not a bank). A node follows the protocol rules to ensure the network furfill its function: manage a currency that take the form of electronic cash. A bitcoin node is to Bitcoin what a bank is to fiat currencies network but decentralized and with full powers, that's why we also call bitcoin nodes ""full node"". That's why you are your own bank when you run a node. That's why you are just a ""bank's customer"" if you don't.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why if you don't run a node, you technically don't have a word to say on Bitcoin rules.

# What if I don't run a node and mine/own bitcoins ?

&amp;#x200B;

You can mine without having a node, you just have to join a mining pool. The pool uses a node to send you validated transactions you include in the block you are currently mining. In that case, you are trusting the node of the pool and have no way to be sure that the node send you the transactions with the highest transaction fees for example: you are a customer of the node mining pool (which is your bank, you don't own it if you don't run your node). This is generally not an issue because the pool is a custodian of mining reward anyway and distribute rewards fairly later, and miners are often running a node for themself too.

When you own bitcoin without running your node, you use a wallet software: ""something to store your money"" and nothing more. You can spend bitcoins using the wallet software. But the sofware must contact a bank (=a node) to receive and broadcast transactions in the monetary network. Owning bitcoin without running a node is like having a bank account protected by your keys at the big Bitcoin bank, you are not the bank itself so some node you are connected to may spy you (chainanalysis electrum servers), scam you (electrum 3.4.1 scam), censor you and you may not follow a valid chain by simply checking proof of work in case of 51% attack.

# How to run a node then ?

In Bitcoin, we try to make this task as simple as possible. You only have to install Bitcoin Core, the main node software  (home page of this subreddit, right panel for a link). But do your own reaseach on how you must set Bitcoin Core for your need because the Bitcoin blockchain is big and your PC will be working a lot for several week potentially to catch the current state of the ledger. This is a time investment, it is ok if you don't run a node for little amount or if you never transact but running a node will make you learn a lot about Bitcoin.

Learn how to use your node to broacast your transactions at least (`sendrawtransaction` may be your friend here) and notify you when you received money. This way, you are really trusting no one.

Some guide exist to install an always online node on a raspberry pi with many useful tools to use it well (RaspiBolt, RaspiBlitz, mynodes ...), if you have skin in the game,  those are really cool project  which allow you to run a lightning node trustless and many other things !

I've known about btc for quite a while, somewhere around 2012 my buddy used to mine it and I thought oh thats cool and moved on.  Flash forward years later I watched what happened in 2017 and started doing research.  When it crashed from 2017s peak I wanted to buy some so bad, but I have been poor literally my entire adult life.  I started working in social work in my early 20s, specifically in rehabs and addiction treatment centers.  I worked in ethical ones and never was able to really pull ahead financially.  Anyways, I landed a good job in 2019 after years of grinding and around the same time stumbled into a small sum of money (literally massive amount to me but small comparitively.)  I started researching btc again because the gains caught my eye but the tech and ideology made a believer out of me.  Anyways covid hit and btc dumped to around 4k and I committed as big as I could.  I had to cash some out recently (don't trip im still holding id never sell it all lol) to buy my girlfriend of five years a ring.  We've been together almost five years and has had my back on everything thick and thin.  She used to help me out when I didn't have enough to pay the bills, and thanks to bitcoin I was finally able to afford to give her a ring that she absolutely loves.

Not anymore for me, with Yubikey things are 100% secured, as long as I keep my physical key hidden somewhere in the house. $40 is a small price for big peace of mind.

Yes yes yes ..... I bet 1 bitcoin someone here will be asking ""Why don't you just put all coins into a cold wallet"". The answer is, in this up market I can leverage on my existing portfolio's equity to buy more coins, and those coins would need to be locked up in an exchange as collateral for me to do that.

Bottom line, Yubikey all the way!!!

\-Clean installation of Windows 10 x64.  
\-All drivers are up to date and the correct ones for my motherboard and components.  
\-USB ports work.  
\-All 4 USB cables, that i own, that work on the Nano S, work well.  
\-I can initiate and unlock my Nano S.  
\-Ledger Live is up to date and for windows.  
\-Nano S firmware is up to date.  
\-Nano S wasn't tempered i am 100% certain sure.  
\-Nano S always worked well.

Now I have tried my Nano S on the PC of a friend that as a Nano S, is version of ledger is the previous one.  
I was able to connect and add MY Nano S, with MY Cable.

jv90b0,Rhettre,How Bitcoin protects against MMT (Modern Monetary Theory),"I was introduced to Modern Monetary Theory through Stephanie Kelton’s book - The Deficit Myth

The central tenant of MMT is that as a Monetary Sovereign currency issuer, the US government can print as much money as it wants so we shouldn’t worry about running up large national debts/deficits. 

We’ve seen this play out recently with the multi-trillion dollar stimulus plans and the proposed multi-trillion dollar climate plans - there’s no plan for paying back any of that money or any conversations about lowering the national debt/deficit. 

This likely means low interest rates (nearly zero in the US and negative interest rates in Europe) for quite a while.

This means that to effectively retire people cannot rely on traditional safe financial instruments like bonds / savings accounts. Instead needing to become proficient asset allocators (or needing hire someone to manage asset allocation for them). Adding this complexity to the system will be a problem for low information investors. 

That’s where Bitcoin comes in. As a store of value Bitcoin can replace the traditional savings account that yielded between 5 and 20(!!) percent during most of the late 1900s (when interest rates were higher spending was more controlled). 

TL;DR - MMT is a reality and has destroyed USD as store of value, Bitcoin fixes this

Instead of just straight up buying everything now, it can be much better to buy 1k now, 1k next week, 1k in two weeks, and so on, until you buy everything you want.

The problem with buying everything upfront is that it can go up a lot after you buy it, or it can fall/dip and you'll lose money. The risk is quite high.

If you instead buy slowly, some of your buys will be on highs, while some of your buys will be on lows. The gains you'll get from the low buys will more or less cancel the losses from the high buys, and you'll end up with a smaller standard deviation. You'll probably gain less, but also risk losing less.

Many of you probably already know this, but some don't, thus it's still [good to emphasize it](https://xkcd.com/1053/).

MMT economists deal with the idea that **more inflation reduces unemployment**, this is what Phillips curve explain.

Nowadays Phillips curve version include the possibility of negative inflation (deflation) when high unemployment, but the purpose is the same.

As Powell said, FED is going to maintain inflation slightly above 2% seeking inflation that averages 2% over time to reduce unemployment. To achieve it, monetary policies like zero interest rates and no bank reserve requirement has been implemented. But as far as I know inflation is not reaching the streets yet, provably because to reach the main street the FED needs commercial banks or states intervention to ease direct cash. 

Conclusion: This leads to the CBDC (central bank digital currency) as medium of citizens direct control of broad money. 

In any case, credit expansion to corporations doesn't equals solid growth as bail outs aren't necessarily helping a prosperous business, but sustaining a project with no demand and perpetual debt. Looks like inflation just reached financial markets making them volatile, unpredictable and a signal to wrongly invest capital as the continuous bail outs distorts the fundamentals.

Conclusion: Inflation just looks like a fake demand that distorts reality, reducing unemployment does not mean a trust full economic growth as bail outs comes in the economy, instead looks like a downward spiral of debt that keeps non profitable companies alive. 

I have hope in the Bitcoin adoption to start building a free market decentralized alternative.

I really don't want to extent the content, as short reads are good for discussion and this is my resumed point of view.

jvs2yt,kozen23,Why Bitcoin will be here to stay --- and rise.,"Over a year ago when the Bitcoin price was rather down, I wrote a blog post (in German) about why Bitcoin will still be here in 10 years. 

**The gist of it: Bitcoin is ""the standard"" in the crypto world.** 

Even if newer / better / faster / cheaper cryptos pop up and become popular, Bitcoin will still survive. Why? Because it was the first crypto of its kind and has become the standard currency cryptos are being traded in. When ETH, XRP, LTC and so wer launched -- they first traded on any exchange in BTC. Any new crypto that comes up will also trade in BTC first, because that's the currency that everyone has and its the one everyone can trade with - on any platform.

While there are many other reasons why Bitcoin is here today and why it will be here tomorrow and in 10 years, I truly believe the above reason is the most valid one. It was simply there first, it works and everyone uses it. Kind of like craigslist - it's still the king of classifieds in the U.S. even though there are many other better options out there.

Soon they will have data on so many wallets and their connected wallets that every wallet they don't have data on could be interpreted as risky because ""if you have nothing to hide..."" 😒...

Shakepay charges about a 1.25% fee on selling Bitcoin. I can't seem to find the sending fee from Coinbase to a non Coinbase wallet in Canada. Is it $3 + 0.5% figure? If so, then I would overall lose a couple percent in fees with this method.

I can also withdraw from Coinbase straight to my PayPal. I do not earn enough for this to push me into a tax bracket since I am a student. However, PayPal's USD to CAD conversion fee is 3.5% + whatever Coinbase charges.

So overall, it looks like it might be best to send to Shakepay and then sell, if I want to.

For those in Canada, does my research look correct?

edit: upon furhter research, it seems like transferring first to coinbase pro, then withdrawing to my wallet address is probably the cheapest?

edit: i decided to just try a method out. I moved my coins from coinbase to coinbase pro for free, then withdrew to wallet for a fee of ~.75 CAD. Pretty solid.",1605677983,2,2

Looking to get some feedback on a new project we're working on -- [Remitbit.io](https://Remitbit.io).  The goal of the platform is to educate users on how to leverage BTC and other cryptocurrencies to complete international money transfers.  

Most people don't realize that BTC can be used to send money overseas.  Simply by buying BTC on one exchange / fiat currency and selling BTC on another exchange / fiat currency, you effectively can transfer money across borders without the challenges and costs typically associated with such transactions.

We have also created a tool to help identify geo-arbitrage opportunities.  Our [Charts](https://remitbit.io/charts) page compares BTC prices across different currencies &amp; exchanges to find price discrepancies in BTC.  It's very new and not yet mobile responsive.

We believe that by educating people on the real life use cases of BTC and cryptocurrency, we will encourage a different type of user to familiarize themselves with blockchain technology.  We do not handle money, we simply provide information and refer users to trusted &amp; established crypto/fiat exchanges to complete their transfer.

jwv01r,jojorabbit11,Bitcoin's Market Cap Hits All-Time High Despite Price Not Being ATH,"Not since December of 2017 has Bitcoin's total market capitalization been above $320 billion. Yesterday's high, when Bitcoin reached nearly $18,500 came with it a market cap that eclipsed $340 billion. 

A market cap is calculated by multiplying the number of units in supply by the price per unit. To date, there have been just over 18.5 million Bitcoin mined and released into circulation.

However, it is important to note that in the early days of Bitcoin (approx. 2009-2011) a lot of BTC was permanently lost (e.g., forgotten passwords, broken or discarded computers, etc.). [Some estimates](https://lebobtc.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=658c1b8776af27dd2a81dd8dc&amp;id=c8007d5e83&amp;e=e5298ad1f5) indicate that as much as 20% of the total supply of Bitcoin has been lost, which equates to about 3.7 million coins. If we are to operate under the assumption that those coins are indeed lost forever and cannot be retrieved, the implication is there are fewer Bitcoin to go around, making it even more of a scarce asset. 

**What's propelling Bitcoin to these new highs?**   
A look back at the macro developments in the Bitcoin investment space this year:

* *March 2020:* The economic shutdown that came as a result of the global pandemic spurred unprecedented amounts of money printing, raising into question significant inflation concerns in fiat currencies;
* *April 2020:* Gold hit all-time highs above $1,800/oz. as a flight to safety asset and inflation hedge;
* *May 2020:* Paul Tudor Jones, the legendary hedge fund manager, released a [research piece about his bull case for Bitcoin](https://lebobtc.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=658c1b8776af27dd2a81dd8dc&amp;id=5b9179a14e&amp;e=e5298ad1f5), subsequently announcing his own investment in the asset;
* *August 2020:* MicroStrategy ($MSTR: NASDAQ) becomes the [first publicly listed company to invest in Bitcoin](https://lebobtc.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=658c1b8776af27dd2a81dd8dc&amp;id=25fae3360d&amp;e=e5298ad1f5), allocating $425 million of its treasury reserves as a ""hedge against inflation"";
* *October 2020:* Square Inc. ($SQ: NYSE) becomes the second publicly listed company to invest in Bitcoin, [announcing an investment of 1% of its total assets](https://lebobtc.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=658c1b8776af27dd2a81dd8dc&amp;id=6a9e797edd&amp;e=e5298ad1f5) in what it believes will be ""a more ubiquitous currency in the future"";
* *October 2020:* Mode Global Holdings PLC (£MODE: LSE) becomes the first publicly traded company in the UK to invest in Bitcoin, [announcing a 10% allocation of its cash reserves](https://lebobtc.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=658c1b8776af27dd2a81dd8dc&amp;id=35341ce003&amp;e=e5298ad1f5) to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset;
* *October 2020:* PayPal Holdings Inc. ($PYPL: NADAQ) [announced the launch of cryptocurrency on its platform](https://lebobtc.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=658c1b8776af27dd2a81dd8dc&amp;id=75a65092b8&amp;e=e5298ad1f5), enabling its network of nearly 400 million global users (26 million of whom are merchants), to buy, sell and spend cryptocurrencies;
* *November 2020:* Citigroup Inc. ($C: NYSE) [released a report](https://lebobtc.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=658c1b8776af27dd2a81dd8dc&amp;id=8f845dd40c&amp;e=e5298ad1f5) titled, ""Bitcoin: 21st Century Gold"", that suggests Bitcoin's bull market is just beginning and technicals suggest it may reach $318,000 per coin by December 2021 (yes, you read that correctly).

This latest piece from Citigroup really caught our attention. When is the last time any global bank projected a &gt;20x return in a 12 month time frame? We have never seen it before in any asset class. 

Whether the returns and time frame Citigroup offers in their piece are realistic or not, the trajectory of Bitcoin is significantly higher. These are early days.

I get it. I get why someone might think that. But bitcoin isn't money.

Bitcoin is like land. Digital land. The most prime digital land in the entire digital domain. There's only so much of it to go around, it is never going anywhere, and they'll never make any more of it.

If you think of a landowner, like a farmer, they might have tens of millions of pounds worth of land but relatively little cash. To them, the price of land doesn't matter, what matters is that the land they have is worth an amount that is unpurchasable for the average person. Once you sell your land you'll never be able to buy it back and generations of landowners recognise this and forgo the acquisition of chattels in preference for acquiring more land.

That's how to think of bitcoin. If you have one bitcoin, that's not one acre of land, it's thousands of acres. And it's not land in the barren Siberian tundra, it's prime real estate in the glittering metropolis. Acquire bitcoin, hold onto it, and never sell. It's not ever going to go to zero, it's land.",1605741224,33,18

jwqbi1,IHAVESOMEDADDYISSUES,Should I seek legal advice before reaching out to a potential scammer?,"August 23, 2020, I sold my bitcoins to someone through a bitcoin buying/selling website. I messaged with the person who would be buying my bitcoins and waited to confirm that the money was in my PayPal account before I released my bitcoins to them. I received the money and then released the bitcoins, all was well.

September 25, 2020, I received an email from PayPal stating that a case has been opened because ""the buyer stated that they did not authorize this transaction"". I submitted the receipts through PayPal's website with an explanation of the situation.

November 5, 2020, I received an email from PayPal stating that the case was closed and that I would have to pay the buyer back. I quickly contacted PayPal and was told to reach out to them via email, and that they would work with the buyer's bank and advocate on my behalf. I sent the email, along with the explanation and receipts.

November 13, 2020, I received this email from PayPal:

&gt;""Dear IHAVESOMEDADDYISSUES,  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for contacting PayPal.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am deeply sorry for the frustration and inconvenience this matter has caused you. Sellers form the backbone of our customer base, and we deeply regret the need to perform any reversal. Chargebacks are initiated outside of PayPal and are controlled by the card issuer. Your customer's credit card company grants its member's specific consumer protections. Your customer chose to take advantage of those consumer protection rights. These rights are guaranteed by the Credit Card Company as well as applicable law, and as such we have no authority to replace or reduce any customer's rights.  
&gt;  
&gt;As we did not receive an official credit for the case, we encourage you to contact your buyer directly to reach a resolution.  
&gt;  
&gt;We appreciate your business and regret that you've experienced a chargeback.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sincerely,  
&gt;  
&gt;PayPal Chargeback Division""

I replied, stating the information I was told over the phone (that PayPal would work with the buyer's bank and advocate for me) and also stating that, regardless of the issues that are occurring with the buyer's bank account, I had every reason to believe that the transaction between the buyer and I was legitimate.

I'm not sure what to do - from PayPal's email, it sounds like they now want me to reach out to the buyer directly; however, I have many concerns about doing so.

**My question**, should I seek the advice of an attorney (specializing in digital/virtual/cryptocurrency, I believe) before reaching out to the buyer?

jwpgoc,superarius,How long (probably) until my low fee transaction stops getting rebroadcast to the network,"I made a highly nonstandard/not recommended transaction... playing around with a DIY P2PKH transaction which does two really wrong things: uses itself as change address (address reuse) and also has a way too low fee (1 sat/byte). 

So a number of UTXOs have been locked in the mempool for a few weeks and I looked into the classic solutions (RBF, CPFP) but I thought simplest thing to do was wait since I’m in no hurry to spend the coin anyway. I had heard that the tx would be dropped after 14 days but not if it keeps getting rebroadcast, which seems to be the case. Is this going to work or am I going to have to wait forever? When I attempted to double spend within a few days of the original low fee transaction my double spends were rejected by all the common push sites (since the tx was in the mempool). Will a simple double spending approach eventually work? Or will I have to go through more intricate hoops in order to “rescue” the coins.",1605736783,13,3

My company (Do Amore) has accepted Bitcoin since December 2013. At the time I thought that we'd be the leaders in this and hopefully more would follow. Unfortunately, even today we are still one of the only engagement/wedding ring companies in the world that accepts Bitcoin.

We had a decent amount of folks paying via Bitcoin in 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018. However, the last 2 years, the number of folks paying for their engagement rings via Bitcoin has really died down. Is there any advice you all may have to try and get some momentum back?

jx6llm,DaBeeJ,Be Safe New Bitcoiners! (Rant),"My brother in-law had FOMO and wanted to buy Bitcoin. I explained that he needed a cold storage and he should wait to do much of anything unless I was there to help set things up correctly. I was hoping to guide him through the process of getting on an exchange, setting up his wallet safely, and basically give him the low-down on how to be involved in crypto. He chose to go solo.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward, he screwed something up, called ""exchange he was using"" who remoted into his phone, and basically stole his money. He calls me after the fact asking if I knew what was going on. He knows now that it wasn't the exchange and that he was basically robbed by scammers.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Verify a URL is the actual URL you are trying to get a hold of. CompanySupport\_com is not the same as Company\_com. Contact support from their App, don't go looking for external numbers or emails.
2. Don't let someone remote into your computer or phone unless you personally know them (even that is a stretch).
3. When you set up a cold storage, and it tells you do follow the instructions exactly. Follow the instructions! That seed phrase is insanely important.
4. Don't take any pictures or save any digital copies of anything. You may be big and strong in the physical world, but a tiny hacker can destroy you online. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: New people, don't be stupid. Bitcoin isn't going to a million dollars in a day. Don't let FOMO make you do stupid things.

jx54ju,MadgeSpeaks,The Bitcoin HODL Moment: A Spiritual Experience.,"**I have had 3 deeply spiritual experiences in my life. The immediate moment after smoking DMT, meeting my fiancé, and the HODL epiphany. All in that order, across a 2 year period — almost exactly 12 months in between.**

**DMT:** I first learned of DMT in 2007, when I was 21. Everything I heard about it scared the living daylights out of me. Ocassionally I would read up, hear stories of those who had trekked deep into the Amazon to sample *ayahuasca*, and watch the odd Joe Rogan clip. But it was too much for me.

Then one day my life turned to chaos. In the space of a month, my girlfriend jumped ship, my company spectacularly crashed, debt spiked, before crippling sciatica and insomnia set in. I wanted to die. Not suicide, but die with dignity and bow out with some honour — cancer maybe.

In that darkest week, the strangest thing happened. 3 people out of nowhere started spouting off about DMT. My barber, a random dude at a bar, and an old friend I ran into at a crypto conference (I wasn’t a crypto believer at the time, just curious).

At the end of the week I tell my close friend of the weird coincidences around DMT I was experiencing, and that “maybe I should try it”. The following day he calls me up and says “you’re not going to believe this, I have DMT in my hand right now, a friend gave it to me… for free, thats the DMT code”.

Well if there ever was a sign to try, this was it. 

That weekend we ventured out of town with a glass bulb in hand. One drag in… a female voice said to me “welcome, you’re in good hands, it’s ok”, second drag in… the room starts to break apart, and third drag… well, who knows, I was in a different dimension.

The next day I woke up and saw the world with a fresh set of eyes. I’ve never looked back. 

**Fiancé:** Until I met my fiancé, I was anti-marriage, anti-engagement. I thought I knew what love is, but marriage wasn’t for me. A social construct I just couldn’t buy into. Then one day I walk through a door, talk to a girl on a brown couch who is reading the same rare book as me, and we hit it off.

6 months later *to the day*, I propose to her, without hesitation, without doubt, fully convinced she is my soulmate. 

**The HODL Moment:** I didn’t really know what this was until yesterday when I came across Michael Saylor, who was sharing a similar insight to the profound experience I had. 

Once you’ve had this epiphany, you don’t want to sell Bitcoin. In fact you’re like “how the F do I redeploy more wealth across to Bitcoin … FAST”. And then you ask the question … *“who in their right mind would trade this stuff, eventually others are going to have the same experience, and the price will sky rocket… with the chance to own wholly undiluted Bitcoins — GONE”*.

What led to the epiphany…? What caused the moment you may ask?

It didn’t happen overnight. I almost bought 5 BTC in 2014 as a small punt after some weird teenage blockchain developer was going on about it at a co-working space. He was crazy, but I love crazy, so I listened. The friction purchasing it at the time was too much of a distraction and I kept forgetting to buy as I pushed forward in my career as a tech startup bro.

Then comes 2020. What the heck…

Nothing in this system makes sense. The manual has been thrown out… It’s like well established economic models and political theories have been *uninvented*. This system is about to break, and break badly.

Then one day admidst the chaos as a joke I say outloud “well only Bitcoin can save us now”. At that moment, I had the epiphany. BITCOIN! It’s f\*\*\*\*\*g Bitcoin. The world has been trying to tell me for the last 6 years it’s Bitcoin and I finally get it.

**HODL,** I’ve come to learn, is a belief system equal to knowing you are one with the universe. Until you’ve had this experience, you probably don’t know what Bitcoin really is, or could/will do. It’s going to upend the world. It’s a virus where the only cure is becoming one with it. 

The Bitcoin and re-emergence of pyschedelics in the west, are part of the same agenda. 

HODL for life.

It’s been a great year for Bitcoin. The flagship digital currency has recorded a surge in price that has mirrored the 2017 bull run that culminated in the all-time high price above $20,000. Bitcoin is currently trading just shy of $18,000, its highest price in three years. Is this rally likely to continue or will a correction take place? We talked to a few experts who shared their thoughts on the market.

jx2nh3,zoli0506,Analyzing bitcoin from a macro perspective. Socio-economic factors and bitcoin in late 2020.,"As it stands today, bitcoin represents roughly few basis points of all assets, and roughly 10 basis points of total tradeable assets. Bitcoin is still a niche thing.

In the next decade  $230 trilion dollar worth investment will need to find new investment. Assuming a small percent of this will huge base will flow to bitcoin we can see double or even triple digit rate of return per year.

It's a hedge against bad governance like gold, but it is harder (Bitcoin is the hardest asset in the world and the stock-to-flow ratio will be infinite), with much bigger upside because it's in an early life stage. (You can go to zero, but the upside is indefinite, it has a huge asymmetry, a powerful investment concept).

&amp;#x200B;

Let's see what is happening these days in the world, seperate the signal from noise and see clearly.

Most important trends today, in the beginning of the new decade:

&amp;#x200B;

Monetary/Economic:

\- Central banks policy: Decreasing interest rates and rapidly increasing monetary base. (Throughout  the history we can positive correlation in the price of gold and monetary base, that will be true for bitcoin as well.)

\- Fiscal dominance in the Western world's policy. (Goverments will spend a lot of money, debt will increase)

\- Questionable future of dollar as a reserve currency as US share of world GDP declines. (This is a longer term (15-20 years+) trend, we are nowhere close to the end of dollars reserve currency status, but it's imortant to consider as well.)

\- Huge inflation of financial assets (Bond, equity prices are already record high, future yields are somewhat limited, which is great for bitcoin)

\- Disinflation in CPI terms and slowing velocity of money. (Bad for economic growth)

\- Deflation of wages (We can expect more aid and ""stimulus checks"" )

\- Debt-liquidity spiral, solvency issues of corporations. (There are a lot of indebted, zombie companies in the US and the rest of the world, policy makers won't let them go bankrupt, because the dominoes would start falling, so that's another factor with points to more expected liquidity)

&amp;#x200B;

Political/Social

\- US - China superpower competition and deglobalization. (It could be more difficult in the future to move financial assets in a bipolar or trippolar world, bitcoin helps, also US will print a lot to maintain it's military superiority in the Indo-Pacific)

\- Technology, monopolies and it's job/small business destroying effect (Again we wil see more paychecks straight to people's pockets and small buisnesses)

\- Wealth Unequality (For a lot of people it will be a peaceful revolution against the system)

\- Political populism, Social unrest is on the table - Bitcoin is great hedge against it: someone could hold a knife to your throat and they still couldn't take your net worth in minutes. Also governments can't confiscate bitcoin, it's totally decentralized, they would have to kill the internet to stop it)

\- Ageing society in the western world and the incoming pension fund crisis. (The average public pension plan is assuming a 7.22% annualized return going forward. I seriously doubt this target will be met. Older people will increasingly look for store of value options.)

&amp;#x200B;

All in all i think in the year of 2020 every trend helpful for bitcoin. Lots of politicians/CEO/coproration and institutions buying it up, and they have a huge sway on policy makers, The smart money/macro investors are buying it up right now which is also a good indicator that buying bitcoin is a great opportunity and it also has a huge network effect so other cryptos will have an impossible task go dethrone it.

This is a rare event in history, we are in crossroads and in the middle of it, there is only one thing: bitcoin.  I've never seen an investment opportunity like this, i have to agree with Raoul Pal, he said ""bitcoin is the world's most pristine asset"", don't miss this once in a lifetime opportunity.",1605792434,0,1

jxmuo3,NoUserLeftException,"Confusion about technical background of transactions, hardware Wallets and Recovery process","Hi,

at first I was not sure if I should ask each question in its own post, but I think it's better to ask them in one post.  
I think about getting a hardware wallet and want to transfer the BTC from the exchange into the wallet, but before I do that, I want to fully understand the technical background. I already had some Bitcoins in 2012 (but I was too stupid to sell them all, nevertheless, I've been back for a few months). In the past, I downloaded a software wallet on my machine which downloaded the whole blockchain in the background and the wallet was just another access point to the blockchain. 

Question 1: How does this technique works with a hardware wallet, since I guess it does not download the whole blockchain? But how does it work to access the transactions of the blockchain without downloading it?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the transaction in the blockchain (which is something like ""Sender X encrypted 1.23456BTC with the public key of my wallet"") is stored in a block of the blockchain. 

In the past, I was able to extract the private key from the software wallet and were able to import it into another new wallet (e.g. if I get a new computer) and I guess the private key created the corresponding public key (never tried that out). When I would have created a new wallet, I guess it worked like this that the wallet (who has the whole blockchain stored locally) queried over the whole blockchain to find the latest transaction with the given public key. 

Question 2: Did it work like this? If not please explain how it worked.

Now, the BIP39 concept is used which allows me to restore the private key from the given 24 words to decrypt the transaction from the blockchain. 

Question 3: If I create/restore a private key from the BIP39 words, how is it possible, that all private keys in the world are ""unique enough""? Maybe I didn't understand the BIP39 completely,  but since these 24 words are predefined, isn't there a pretty high chance that somehow has the same words which would generate the same private key and therefore he can get all the BTC from the latest transaction which were created the the same public key?",1605868842,6,1

jxmi85,ThrowawayBTCer123,I don't like being my own bank.,"I expect this to be controversial, and I expect to get downvoted, but that's okay. This is a throwaway because I don't want to talk about my BTC holdings on a traceable account.

I hold a few BTC. Less than 50, more than 10. I bought most of them in 2014. I've spent a few here and there, but have been DCAing pretty much constantly over the last few years, although because the price has gone up so much, I've probably added less than 1 BTC to my total in the last 3 years.

All my coins are on a hardware wallet. I used to use paper, but got paranoid about losing it. I like hardware wallets, they're the best of a bad situation.

And by ""bad situation"" I mean that *I don't want* to be my own bank. About 80% of my total net worth is tied up in BTC, and I can tell you, it's quite stressful to be responsible for that much value in one place. My remaining net worth is mostly tied up in my house, and in various stocks and shares, and I'm much more relaxed about that.

Owning BTC is constantly in the back of my mind, and I don't mean the worry of the value going down. I'm sure the value will continue to rise, and even if it doesn’t, I'm totally at peace with that. The thing which is always in the back of my mind is knowing that, if somehow I lose my balance, I'll have no comeback. I want it to be in a bank where I get cover. I don't stress about losing my stocks and shares because the brokers I use are covered, and because, well, it's their \*job\* to look after my money. I'm just a regular Joe, I don't want to be my own bank.  Oh, and I know the stats about how secure hardware wallets are etc. so I'm not looking for reassurance about that, it's simply that looking after it is stressful, regardless of how secure it is.  Not to mention the additional worry about what happens if I die.  If it was in a bank my next of kin would just take over ownership.  As it is, I have to do something to make sure that if I die unexpectedly my next of kin are able to access my crypos.

I like that I can my own bank (for smaller, say &lt; $10k value amounts), but if BoA came out with an account tomorrow which I could transfer my BTC to, I would. And you know what, I'd sleep better too.

jxm75e,MadgeSpeaks,Bitcoin Conviction: A story about liquidity.,"2 months ago I had the opportunity to purchase shares in our startup for $1 with the share price being over $3 (that has a very real 10 x potential over next 3 years). Good deal right? Maybe, maybe not.

I turned down the offer to use bonus for Bitcoin instead. Here is why.

Investing or owning shares in a private company comes with many golden handcuffs. 

1) You need to liquidate for an emergency or invest in another asset? Good luck! Shareholder agreements make this hard and slow. You'll also get a terrible price.

2) Liquidation preferences: Not all money is equal. You may have bought in at $1, and the share price is now $3 - or higher - but if a later stage investor comes in with liqudation preferences that means in any sale, the first $3 goes to them, and you get a return on every $1 after that. So your belief in a ""3 x"" return, is actually worth ZERO. 

3) The $30 ""exit"" could happen in 10 years. The exit might also never happen.

On paper, some of my startup investments have very good returns, but I can't liquidate, so to me right now they're worth zero.

What's better? Your Bitcoin investment that has halved, or your startup investment that has 5 X? Depends, if you need emergency capital, Bitcoin. 

As a technology investor, Bitcoin is the absolute utopia. We are still in the VERY early days of the adoption curve (simple math of % of world population X % of global wealth), so there is extreme upside potential with absolute liquidity. I have never seen a scenario like it. None of us will again in our lifetime. Count yourselves lucky you worked out the secret &lt;$1T market cap. 

For the record, I don't see Bitcoin in the same light as my other tech investments. This is a vote to a better future. I will HODL. I will only liquidate Bitcoin in the event of an emergency situation. 

HODL for life.

jxm223,my5cworth,How do you cash out and declare your Bitcoin?,"Short answer I'm expecting: ""We don't""

That said, if we need to, what then? 

I've read through a few countries' tax laws and most of them still consider BTC an asset class rather than a currency. So you treat it as capital gains when selling for more than what you bought it at. 

One country as an example: 

You pay something like 25% on CGT AND you have to have (and supply if asked) records of your purchases, trades and BTC addresses. It even states that I have to declare my HODLings on my tax returns. 

So this makes me feel like we're prety much forced into HODLing until such time as direct BTC payments for products become the norm...

The internet is a massive multiplier in our lifetimes. So much of our life now functions on this network. Can you imagine living without it? I sure cannot.

In 2009 an anonymous person(s) by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto bootstrapped a value network called Bitcoin to set up a decentralized p2p currency that was protected against manipulation and inflation. It needed no central actor to manage &amp; control the supply and enabled humans anywhere on the planet to instantly move value between each other for minimal fees. Until then the only way to do so was physically and over a distance you always needed a third party.

The story is repeating. Where will it lead us? Will we be able to live without it?

Hey everyone! I'm new to Bitcoin, and so apologies in advance for this n00b question. It's probably been asked a million times.

I'm located in Canada, with a Canadian bank account (with USD funds). I'm interested in day-trading/swing-trading Bitcoin with $100,000+ USD.

With the research I've done, I'm apparently looking for an OTC. Some that I know of are Shakepay, Newton, and NDAX (but I believe all only accept CAD funds, though I have USD funds).

My question is: am I limited to Canadian OTCs, given that my wire transfers will be from a Canadian bank, despite having USD funds? If not, what are the most popular/best OTC's that you guys would recommend?

TL;DR

Bitcoin supply is shrinking not constant

Roughly 4% of available bitcoins are lost each year. These are irretrievable. People lose keys, damage or lose their hardware wallets, die without making arrangements to move them or send them to wrong addresses where keys are lost too (intentionally done at times , called ""burning""). If we continue to assume the 4% lost rate, it sets the maximum circulation down to 14 million

This sets the maximum number of bitcoins that will ever be in circulation at 14 million.

What does this mean to you:

1. Securing and HODLing is harder than you think
2. If you do the right things the value of Bitcoin you HODL will be much larger than existing predictions",1605854844,9,1

jxyv5u,DangerActiveRobots,A small example for the long-term-thinking challenged like myself.,"I'll admit to anyone that I'm not the best at math. I got through calculus, but only barely. So when I started getting into Bitcoin, I was kind of throwing money at it without thinking of the potential long term results.

My first goal was to get to exactly .1 bitcoin, which I did. I then decided to switch it up, and just start putting in $100 every paycheck regardless of the price.

So, here's the thing: at .1 bitcoin, that's worth $10,000 if bitcoin hits $100,000. Easy enough. 

The $100 I spent brought me up to  ~.105... btc. That's $10,500 at $100,000 per btc. Over a 5x return on my investment. 

Obviously this is all hypothetical, and of course there are many other factors to consider like inflation, the possibility of btc losing value, etc. I just didn't realize how much adding $100 in now could potentially pay off down the road if/when btc soars.

I don't think I've been around long enough to say ""stack sats"" or whatever, but yeah. Small investments now, huge returns later- hopefully. Even at this current relatively high price, that small $100 investment could really pay off down the road.",1605910860,2,1

So the question is, would you sell BTC right now to start a business if you could? Mind you I have always been interested in btc and have used it for a few years just for online purchases really. I only started holding when I sold my house in March and it was taking forever to buy large amounts of coins, so I didn't get to buy at the bottom, but I did buy most around the 6k-7500 range.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not looking to theorize on Bitcoin the network and whether or not it succeeds - I am totally sold on the potential behind Bitcoin.

Just curious from those who have more experience in the realm on real normal issues that people may have with Bitcoin and even other crypto.

Obviously, it's become absurdly easy to buy bitcoin - the market is saturated with solutions for that. What are some other challenges that haven't yet been solved for the masses?

Some examples:

**Storage**

*""Not Your Keys, Not Your Bitcoin"", Single points of failure, etc.*

This seems to be a big one. Hardware wallets should be simple in theory, but they are still pretty complicated. Also obviously relies on the user not screwing it up, which is pretty easy to do.

[MultiSignature](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature) security seems like a great solution, and I've noticed companies like Casa and others are building some pretty user-friendly apps to solve the single-point-of-failure problem.

**Taxes**

Taxes seem like a nightmare for end users and business owners. I have yet to file my first crypto tax return, albeit it seems Coinbase and other sites tackle this for those who trade in and out of bitcoin.

Are there tax-advantaged ways to save crypto? Some have mentioned Grayscale Bitcoin Trust in an self-directed IRA. Are there any other examples of direct ownership that can be taxed up-front?",1606000960,4,1

Printing more of their currency is a way to overcome these hard times short term and all governments use it (some overuse it), but if bitcoin or another crypto becomes the main currency in the world, they won't be able to do that anymore.

With the large influx of new Bitcoiners I thought I would share some basic security measures. Please feel free to add your input and suggest others!

*  **Never Share your recovery phrase with anyone!!!!**
* Place your recovery phrase in a secure place
* Use a hardware wallet (not your keys not your coin)
*  Don't expose how much Bitcoin you have... to anyone
* Never invest more than you can afford to lose
* Always review the address you are sending bitcoin to (your clipboard could be compromised)
* Continuously educate yourself on why you are buying/have bought Bitcoin.

This is a brief overview of how you can be more secure. If you have any questions on the above bullet points, please feel free to ask for clarification!

jyigzg,therealhodlonaut,Bitcoin And The American West,"""What does it look like when a new frontier develops? With Bitcoin, we often refer to the Internet as the analogous frontier by which to envision Bitcoin’s future trajectory.  This is certainly the most appropriate comparison, as these two pieces are the yin and yang of the Digital Revolution: The Internet is the digitization of information, while Bitcoin is the complementary digitization of value.

However, this comparison has its limitations, specifically because the Internet is still developing, though our contemporaneous bias is to think of it as complete.  When we limit our Bitcoin comparisons to the early days of the Internet, we miss out on the insights we might draw about the future trajectory of Bitcoin beyond the stage of development that the Internet has now reached.   

Looking back further in time, we can identify previous frontiers whose development has now reached completion.  With one of those examples as a guide, it’s possible to take a deeper look at the evolutionary stages of that former frontier’s development.  By comparison, we can take stock of where Bitcoin lies in that journey, and what that could mean for Bitcoin’s arc into the future.

This will be an extended analogy, and while the nature and specifics of the comparison may vary drastically in some respects, the broad brush strokes of history have much to teach us.

**As a starting point, this is my core assertion: the Internet in 2008 was like America in 1802.""**

jz10q8,SpicyNuts42,Bitcoin: a monetary metaphor for the one true religion.,"Think of money as a religion for a moment. 

A small religion is called a cult. This would be something akin to altcoins. 

The most successful religion is called the one true religion. (Mostly by its followers)

 
Cults come and go. Most of them die without ever ascending to religion status. Some force themselves there like a sci fi religion did that time. 

It's just that for money, these smaller projects die. 

What makes Bitcoin the one true money religion? The fact that no matter how hard any person or group tries, they can't inflate the Bitcoin supply. 

Every other form of money, including and especially altcoins, cannot guarantee that. 

Why does it matter so much? If a money supply can be inflated for personal gain, then it's only a matter of time before it'll happen. The easier it is, the worse it happens. 

Only Bitcoin solves this. And the solution cannot duplicated or surpassed. There will never be a flippening. Bitcoin is king. 

Bitcoin is the hardest money ever created. Over a long enough time line all other monies will come and go and Bitcoin will out compete them all. 

There can be only one of what Bitcoin is. 

Bitcoin is the one true money.

jz0go7,fruitsetlegs,Every dip of late is getting bought up aggressively ! How different is this bull cycle going to be ?,"We have been seeing a crazy run since October, uninterrupted and with very few and short term bullish consolidations.  
For the past 3 weeks it seems there is a pattern of run ups during the week and pauses during weekends with weak and short lived pullback that are aggressively getting bought up.  
From my experience this is not a common pattern I have observed in the past, on the contrary we used to have weekend breakouts and run ups that were often rendered useless because of these dumb futures gaps.  


My guess is that this time the game is being played a differently. Google trends are still showing little to no interest from retail, most bitcoiners have been expecting a correction that is yet to come, while institutions keep scooping up BTC at 18000+usd at a rate that does not seem to slow down and are buying every dip.

After dipping only 7% this weekend, BTC is already back to 18500 with a V-shape recovery start (yet to be confirmed). This looks insane!

I believe the upcoming bull market is going to change the world this time. For the better. Not too sure what I'll do at the 2021-2022 top... take profit in a dying USD or EUR ? buy properties that the governments will heavily tax ? Buy farmlands ? stack some more useless and inflationary gold or silver ? Or just keep holding the only unconfiscatable asset ever created and start buying stuff in sats in 2025.

If this did happen, there will be lots of users with potentially over £100k plus in bitcoin... I don't think Coinbase will allow you to sell such an amount and even if they did withdrawing it to your bank would be another hurdle with the most likely outcome being account closure, something that happens far to often in the UK.

Just to remind that this is the end of a long-term debt cycle, interest rates should rise up guiding a  healthy deflationary process where the free market leave behind indebted corporate's that couldn't find their place in a democratic demand. 

Instead QE insanity is recapitalizing bank reserves, leading to a new artificial period of credit expansion. This does not represent free market capitalist society where citizens choose which products are needed by purchasing them incentivizing it's production, thriving the business by demand. 

Centralized bail outs seem to be the new reality and looks like the new standard before, during and provably after this COVID crises.

My task - find the ways to help ""partisans"" that deanonymize policemans and some people, which stole our voices.

All of us, now living in the country, are under suspicion. All of us can be arrested for our opinion, that's why we ask help through the messengers and anonymous wallets.

Your everyday banks, the bank on the corner, the place you have your checking account, the people who gave you a mortgage, the guys who provided financing for your car. Those banks are creating new money.

When you get a loan, that money is created out of thin air. There is no vault holding cash. The banks don't decide between lending to you or Joe from down the street. They ""lend"" money to everyone because they aren't actually lending you anything. The money is created from nothing. There is no reserve limit. The bank doesn't have to hold 10%. That's why you can get a mortgage for 3%. That's why you see promotions to buy a new car at 0% interest. The interest is almost irrelevant. If you take out a loan for $250k, that is entirely new money to the bank. They never had it before, but now they are collecting payments from you. It's money that never existed.

This might be obvious to some of you, but it took me a while to grasp. Even now when I try to explain this to someone, they'll fight me on it. We have a long way to go.",1606061885,54,1

jyx2xb,ActionShackamaxon,The intense emphasis on personal security and cold storage hurts mass adoption of BTC,"Listen, I use cold storage.  There is no question that in a world of digital hacking and regulatory uncertainty, cold storage is the safest option. I would never dispute that. HOWEVER...

Most people are interested in Bitcoin as a store of value similar to gold. The gold analogy is one that will resonate with boomers as a hedge against inflation. Now, when your ordinary 50 or 60-something Main Street neighborhood baby boomer wants to buy gold, guess what? They’re not (at least not most of them) buying physical gold bullion and storing it in a safe in their basement. Would the basement safe be the safest and most secure option? Quite possibly — for many of the same reasons cold storage is safer for BTC. But the reality is that most investors who own gold in their portfolio have purchased shares in an ETF through a brokerage — meaning: they do not physically possess any gold at all. In fact, all they own is a paper certificate indicating that they have the right to the market value of the underlying gold. They cannot pull the physical gold out of the ETF. And ya know what? For most ordinary investors, that’s perfectly OK for them.

What I’m getting at here is that the BTC (and crypto community, generally) consists of people who a.) were mostly ahead of the curve; and b.) have some level of technical savvy. We’ll call this crowd “the Originalists.”  For the Originalists, cold storage makes total sense. The technical barrier to entry to top level security is not too high and makes sense for us. But for the ordinary Main Street investor? (Particularly the older crowd who may not be in the market as long?) The Robinhood and PayPals of the world are a perfectly fine solution. For these people, it’s an understandable and accessible point of entry. And for that reason, maybe we (as a community) should rethink the level of intensity with which we criticize these platforms. Maybe, for some people, they’re perfectly sufficient and their use should be encouraged.

Does that mean we stop educating about the benefits and security of cold storage? Absolutely not. But it may mean we should ratchet down the all-or-nothing approach to personal security. The intentions are good, but the overall tone could be scaring off enough would-be investors to be counterproductive to the overall cause. Just something to consider. At the end of the day, not every gold investor wants or needs physical bullion in their basement, and the same is true of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.",1606057695,161,1

I bought in at $6000, so of course as of now $300 seems super early. But 20-30 years down the line when there's a much bigger picture to look at, and the price is likely in the millions, most everyone would consider me an ""early bird"".

Bitcoin’s durable technology could make it take gold’s place in the digitizing world, believes the CIO of the world’s largest asset manager – BlackRock.

The Chief Investment Officer of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, believes that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are here to stay. Although he hasn’t invested in BTC, Rick Rieder asserted that Bitcoin could “take the place of gold to a large extent.”

BlackRock’s CIO Believes In Bitcoin

Founded in 1988 in New York, BlackRock is an American global investment management corporation. In fact, it’s the world’s largest asset manager with over $7 trillion in AUM as of the end of 2019.

Its CIO, the person making the investment decisions, recently appeared on CNBC’s Squawk Box and discussed Bitcoin. Perhaps due to the recent price increases that led BTC to new highs, the primary cryptocurrency has become a hot topic of discussion among many traditional investors.",1606051291,6,1

jyv9u5,Rosey93_,Should I mine BTC ? (Full story below),"Howdy Reddit,

I own some BTC. I've been invested since early-2017, so I know how very exciting these current times are! I have my hardware wallet with all my security checks in place. But I want more...  


MOAR I SAY!!!  


I've recently had a sizable windfall come my way; it's not ""in my pocket"" yet, but very soon it will be. I was quickly eager to simply buy more BTC and ETH (which are my main investments), but I thought to myself that my current work/life situation could benefit me greatly in regards to mining. 

Let me explain:

I work away from home. I fly to work for 2 weeks, then I'm home for 1 week, classic FIFO setup. While I'm away at work, I have my accomodation/meals/entertainment completely provided to me, this (currently) includes electricity up to no limit. (Keep in mind that this could change)  
My rental situation at home also provides me with ""free"" electricity within my rental agreement.   


So no matter where I am, I'm not paying electricity costs. Just $350 in rent each week and $400 for my mortgage (another investment FYI), which is easily covered by my salary alone, not to mention my wife having two part-time jobs. Covid and such aside, we still save very well and tithe regularly with our church.

But if I were to invest in an Antminer for example, would it be worth my time/effort/money to run it for mining?  
If I set it up with proper ventilation for the expected heat exhaust, I would be able to run it for at least 12 hours a day at work, in a small but heavily air conditioned room.  
And I can do a similar situation at home. I have better ventilation there, but I just have a less effective air conditioning situation at home.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I don't pay for electricity. Should I mine for more BTC?",1606049998,26,1

It's really taken a toll on me emotionally, so I thought I'd highlight my stupidity here to help you all be safe with your incredible investment. I'm sure I'll get over it eventually and will most likely buy another 0.1 BTC or so ***IF*** the price dips significantly again.

A lot of these sportsbooks stopped allowing people from the UK to be customers and/or stopped us from depositing by the usual methods (debit card, skrill, neteller etc). I was left with a $2800 balance in one of these sportsbooks at the start of the year, and the only way they would pay me was by Bitcoin.

So, knowing next to nothing about Bitcoin, I opened an account at [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com). I've had no issue with them. When I log in, they send me an email link, then a SMS code to my phone, so it seems secure enough. But now my initial balance has more than doubled, I'm wondering if a large amount is safe there? Especially as I have no intentions of selling any time soon and hope it grows more. I know a lot more about Bitcoin now (I've been a fan of Cathie Wood for a while now), but I still know little about the methods of keeping my Bitcoin safe.

jzf1rz,anonymouscitizen2,Bitcoin Supply Shock Acceleration,"The thing about Grayscale is that Bitcoins go in and they never come out. Grayscale does not and explicitly says they will not ever have a redemption program. Meaning you can sell your GBTC shares, but you can never convert it to the amount of Bitcoin behind it. Essentially those 500K+ Bitcoin are locked away forever unless Grayscale allows redemptions but they are very adamant they will not due to legal and operational friction. 

The estimated trading float of Bitcoin 6+ months ago was 2-3M coins. Meaning only 2-3M Bitcoin are actively traded (moved within the past 2 months) the rest are being held. ~12M have been held for over a year, and around 3-4M are considered lost forever. The supply shock is accelerating, the day trader idiots, weak hand noobs, and nocoiners are going to be rapidly priced out if things continue the way they have been over the past 3 months. Grayscale is buying 5,000+ per day, Paypal is buying 700+ per day, Microstrategy bought 475M worth, Square bought 50M worth, other institutions are actively looking at Bitcoin or entering. These are investors with long term time horizons, they are not day traders in it for a quick buck. The available supply of Bitcoin is rapidly diminishing. 

Do not get overwhelmed by the moves we are seeing now and try to time short term tops or bottoms. Hold on to your Bitcoin as tightly as you can. It is the first finite resource in our known universe and people are realizing it. A price projection of 500K per Bitcoin is modest. At that price it has a market cap equal to gold. Bitcoin is better than gold for value storage, Bitcoin is better than off-shore bank accounts for value storage. Off-shore bank accounts hold an estimated 25T. Bitcoin at a price point of 1M per coin is less than that. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, don’t screw yourself out of it.",1606126270,172,1

jzejni,allinretard,How to retire early with Bitcoin,"A lot of online calculators for early retirement work as follows:

\- Input: Capital 

\- Input: Assumed return on capital (for example 6% for diversified stock portfolio)

\- Input: Desired withdrawal (rate)

What is missing in most of these calculations is the **volatility of the returns**. As Bitcoin holders we are very aware of the volatility. If we just use a ROI estimation, based on historical performance, **Bitcoin is an absolute nobrainer.** Outperforms everything. 

That is why it is nonsense to leave this out of your projections. For Bitcoin **as well as for stocks.**

Now, tell any of the financial planners or retirement gurus you are allin in Bitcoin and they will declare you batshit crazy. And yes it is high risk, just as holding stocks is.

The following simulator will simulate the development of your capital based on the following inputs:

timeframe, desired withdrawal per month, return, return volatility, dollar inflation, inflation volatility

If yes, how could I avoid this? I've read some articles about bitcoin mixing but isn't there any simpler method?

jzqw0x,DefenderOfMontrocity,replacing bitcoin's numeric nonce based hash function with human language(arabic and others) based blockchain," Intro

Blockchains use numeric hash functions to block together. That is what supposedly 'freeing' us from corrupt banks and federal reserve. However there is a great cost to this mechanism that we don't yet understand. Do you really believe ASIC chips are 'freeing' us from power structure and the CIA? Really? Well China makes more ASIC chips and they have even worse human rights condition than the federal reserve-CIA. China and Saudi Arabia both in UN human rights council and they both have lots of sands, to make microchips. Coincidence?

Federal reserve and central banking systems are corrupt pyramid scheme, I agree with satoshi nakamoto's libertarian statements. However we too are building a pyramid scheme. It is of course lot better than central banks but still has lots of problems. The biggest problem is, the dependence on ASIC chips that can hash fast. This implies you have to spend a lot of money and use a lot of sands to create new fine-tuned ASIC chips to hash at slightly faster rate than older chips. POW, and to certain extent POS, does not necessarily solve the ultimate problem of humanity.

The ultimate problem of humanity is the system based on greed, the system where winner takes all. In blockchain world, we are actually encouraging winner taking all. The longest chain wins and takes everything, by definition. This is going to make people even more desperate than people are right now. In theory, if I make ASIC chips just a bit faster than you, I can, eventually take most of the bitcoin in circulation as the longest chain always prevails. Currently we don't consider this to be an issue, but as technology stagnates in future this will become a grave problem for any proof of work consensus.

In 40 years (yes I can see the future) we will realize that bitcoin was a mistake, because we will be in a prison of numbers. We will be forced, economically and politically, to insert Elon's chip into our brain so we can hash numbers faster. We will not speak any language, other than what computers speak, Ones and Zeroes. Simple articulation will be incomprehensible for us, let alone nuanced poetry. We will be in a prison of our own making, mark my word. We will be enslaved by robots and cyborgs, as blockchain cannot differentiate between humans and robots.

However bitcoin is actually not the mistake, it's us. Blockchain is the final frontier. We need to spin innovation to the perfect distribution. Innovation is never the problem(not even nuclear energy), it's the distribution that really counts. To properly distribute an actual cryptocurrency, we need to innovate a crypto which replaces numeric hash function with human language. I have a plan, a plan to create a human language based crypto currency, specifically Arabic language.  
Be warned I am not a linguist, I don't even speak Arabic. But I notice how things work.

&amp;#x200B;

Technicality

Here is a short version how blockchain works. We take transactions from mempool and hash them together (technically we use merkle tree but I am skipping that info). Then we add previous block header. Then we insert a random nonce/salt in there. Then we hash these together to get result within a certain range. The random nonce helps the result hash output to be under certain value. Now, we are using numeric nonces, of course. This is computer science after all, we are using numeric nonce, usually 4Byte. This hash guessing is called mining. This mining process what keeps blockchain together, the consensus algorithm is called proof of work, as mining requires lots of energy.

What is a cryptographic hash? it's a deterministic random looking one way function. What you need to know now is this-&gt; hash functions depends on subtle changes on input. You change only one bit in the input, the output changes dramatically.

This is roughly how it goes-&gt; Merkle root(the transactions)+previous block header+ random nonce =&gt; hash it=&gt; new block header. Then check this new block header if it's under a specific number, if not, then try again with different nonce.

&amp;#x200B;

Language based coin

Creating human language based cryptocoin sounds impossible, but it's actually easier than it sounds. Right now, we are writing random nonce in blockchain and hashing it with block data, we call it mining. But what if don't use a nonce which is numeric. What if we use human language in the nonce instead?  
What if we write poetry inside the nonce then hash it together with block information?

I know what you are thinking. Poetry replacing numeric nonce? How is that even gonna work?

Firstly, even at this moment, without creating any new cryptocurrency, we can technically write 'poetry' instead of numeric nonce in the bitcoin blockchain, you know we have something called unicode. Unicode converts everything we can write into a number.

The issue is not writing poetry and converting it into numeric nonce, the issue is somewhere else. Remember, the random nonce has to be hashed together with all other block information. If the block header is not in a range we have to try it with another nonce. This is a very repetitive hashing/mining process. That's where human language is supposedly failing.

Can you really imagine writing a piece of poetry, then changing it dramatically just because the poetry doesn't hash under a certain value? This is not efficient, cannot possibly compete with numeric nonce and hashing algorithm.  
This is where Arabic language comes in.

&amp;#x200B;

Why Arabic language?

There are hundred thousands of other human languages out there. However Arabic language has a few special features which most other languages don't have. I don't really know what this feature called, but let's call it 'single letter case' or 'single letter causative' or something. You can switch between assertive, possessive, accusative with very minimal change in a sentence, just change one vowel or two you are done.

Moreover, Arabic depends on word roots. It's a consonant based language you don't even write vowels. So by design, one word can mean various things, you just have to change one vowel to change meanings dramatically.

**How that helps? Because cryptographic hash functions also depends on subtle changes on input. If you know how hash works, if you change only one bit in the input, the output changes dramatically. This means if you are writing a poetry in Arabic you can change the meaning of the sentence by subtly changing one vowel in a sentence, and consequently changing the hash of the sentence.** This makes Arabic language feasible for a blockchain-hashable human language.

Also, you can kinda express complex things with short sentences in Arabic language. This supposed to work well in a blockchain, where you are writing poetry and hashing it under certain difficulty threshold, but when you are writing the poetry you are trying your best to keep it short. 2 or 3 words in a sentence maybe. I am not sure but this should go well with blockchain. What is this poetry should be about? I..... guess... something that's happening around you, something on the news or on the streets, maybe? I honestly can't imagine the subjects of these mini poetry/sentence, my imagination power has a limit.

Slightly off topic, Arabic is a very old language and older generation languages had an unique feature which newer generation of languages don't have. That's frequency. A language can resonate. If you only speak English you wouldn't know that, because new English is nothing like old English. Old English is kinda like French or Latin, it had some unique characteristic which you can't expect nowadays.

&amp;#x200B;

Implication

Now the main question is, how it helps destroy the longest chain problem? Chain can still be replaced by somebody who has greater hash capability, or in this case, better poetry. Well, it doesn't officially solve longest chain replacement issue. I believe, and this is more of a 'belief' than fact, because of Arabic language being 'weird' in a way, it solves this issue unofficially. Something good will come out of this poetical battle a.k.a. thesaurus warfare. Hashing under a certain difficulty threshold with short poetry, this should solve the dependency on ASIC chips and fear of longest chain-discard.  
However poetical crypto currency will still be lot slower than a numeric nonce based bitcoin system, there is not really a way to fix that.

This also solves the oracle problem to certain extent. As we know Ethereum and other smart contract coins depends on real world human oracles. The problem is that oracles can lie about the state of the blockchains. However if you write poetry, it has less chance to be manipulated by oracles.  
My plan is to combine many things together. Say, a ring signature, where is the idea of ring signature coming from? The fundamental idea of ring sig is coming from friend circle. You are supposed to have a friend circle, this anonymous friend circle a.k.a. ring signature scheme will provide anonymity to it's members. So everybody in the same ring agrees with same poetry at the same time, or something...  
I really need to make a proper model out of this because when it comes to ring signature based on human language, things get rather convoluted.",1606166727,2,1

Imagine a mega-corporation such as for example PAYPAL decides to create a mega server where most of the transactions are held. The gov would not approve it because of the possible fraudulent nature of its purchasing power (guns, drugs, illegal content). So imagine that the fees that one has to pay with bitcoin are calculated based on the nature of the transaction, for instance, imagine a person has a score of 100, that is his transaction costs are minimal, he decides to buy some heroin, well at this point his score will lower to let's say 40 points, and therefore the cost of food, shelter, transportation will have higher transaction fees, that way free will and the market would still be there, but at a price, the same goes for, for example, other negative transactions. On the other hand, if your score is of let's say 50 and you decide to do something positive such as, idk, donate to BTC with a justifiable cause, then your score would raise to let's say 60! making you ""richer"" by having to pay fewer transaction fees.

At the time I had accumulated a little over 1 BTC (DCA’d over the years to cost about $9500) and about $6000 in other investments.Well my idea after losing my job was  that I would start day trading crypto to make money. The plan was to keep my 1 btc and cash out the rest as income as I made it. I got to around 1.5 btc trading quite recklessly (high leverage and almost no risk management because my first few trades went so well.) Weeeeell shortly after that I started losing, and with my bad habits, I lost a lot quickly. This all happened within about a month. I ended up losing about 85% of my bitcoin. So then I pull all my other investments to live off of. Between managing my trades better and sports betting, which I actually have done well with long term, I am back to about 25% of where I started with bitcoin, but because of the price increase, I have about 50% of the value I started with in USD. Need some encouragement that these things happen and pass. I can’t go a day without thinking about how I fucked up, and without doing any trading, my btc would be almost doubled in value by now.

However, after I ""bought"" my bitcoin, I was informed the only way for me to actually spend it was to provide my ID...lol. I thought, ""They must be smokin BASE to think that shit is an option, I wouldn't have 'bought' my coin share beforehand if that were clearly explained.""

&amp;#x200B;

Like literally, the fundamental purpose of cryptocurrency is to be the online equivalent of cash, not just ""I spent 15 dollars and put it on a hard drive and forgot about it now I've bought my own HOME!!!""....Right?

I felt like an ass, did some digging around, then found out that even buying a wallet installed on a flash drive costs like $75+...JESUS!!

&amp;#x200B;

Then I found that service after service requires you to present some ID for them to scan into a system, which undermines the whole point of bitcoin to begin with.

&amp;#x200B;

I was only looking at bitcoin because that is the cryptocurrency I read about back when it was basically ""worthless,"" but could actually be used as an anonymous source of online payment.

&amp;#x200B;

So, just asking, if I, an Americanish citizen who possibly might have finally gotten out of under the thumb of unconstitution laws like the Patriot Act, can actually use bitcoin as it was originally intended, not as some unstable investment vehicle where WE CAN ALL GET RICH but as online cash to buy services from a small European company that doesn't accept the kind of American credit card I hate using to begin with?

&amp;#x200B;

Or is it just buy now while the price is a lowly 20 grand or whatever it is a coin and sell later for much more because it isn't actually a real cryptocurrency with respect to privacy it is just an investment vehicle?

&amp;#x200B;

And if there is someway to actually USE bitcoin as an anonymous online cash source for Americanishes like me, who can buy giftcards, how do I make this an actual practical useful currency? Like the 50 cent that I would have put into gumball machines before they were all torched for good reason?

I had my money on the exchange for less than a week as I waited for banking information to send my cash out to. 

After having lost an amount that would be worth over 130k today, I want to make sure I take a safe route with the most trusted exchanges... Or maybe an ATM? I also have an account with Binance but for personal reasons, I'd much rather avoid China all together. 

So what advice do you have for a Canuck crypto old timer that wants to get back in but needs a quick update?

Of course, there are other factors but they all play into this framework, like clockwork. Tick tock! 

&amp;#x200B;

Every pullback here, money is moving from weak hands to strong hands. Because you don't buy Bitcoin for $17000 in 2020-21 unless you're a strong hand. Just like you wouldn't buy Bitcoin for $13 in 2012, or $800 in 2016 unless you were a strong hand. What makes six figures plausible in 2021 is big WS money sitting on the sidelines to snatch your bitcoins. Now when they start playing for real, a $1.8 trillion Bitcoin market cap doesn't seem so far-fetched - well shy of the March stimulus bill alone, and little more than a tithe of gold's market cap of c. $9 trillion.",1606384186,14,1

k1bupu,iamnobodysfriend,"Let me tell you something about crashes, and corrections","Been in BTC since 2013, when I bought my first coins for $40-$80 each.

Bitcoin has a 4-year halving cycle consisting of about 1 year of a bull run (after the halving) and 3 years of a bear market.

During the bull run (1st year), prices rise quickly but often have corrections of 30-40%. Which means absolutely nothing. These are the weak hands, and other people desperate for cash. 

The first real big crash comes at the end of the bull run, meaning after the All-Time-High: a sudden drop of up to 60-80%, which then quickly bounces back. But from there, the bear market begins, and price will slump for 3 years. By the end of the second year, price will hit lows of-60% to -80% from the ATH.

During the bear markets, prices sometimes rise again, but always keep falling back down. 

Best thing to do is invest right at the start of a bull run, cash out near the ATH. Then just don't invest for 3 years. Wait it out for the next bull run. There's no point in keeping money in BTC during a bear market.

FYI You're still at the start of a massive bull-run today. Best thing to do now is to ""buy the dip"". This advice only makes sense during bull runs. After the nextATH has been achieved, there's no ""buying the dip"". During the bear market (2022-2023), here's only throwing your money into a gaping void.",1606380940,48,1

* KYC and government regulation may lead to a situation where only whitelisted BTC can be accepted by anyone not willing to risk prosecution. 

* Self custody might become illegal.

* Governments can easily create a tax nightmare so severe that it will be impossible to use for anything but speculation.

* Diehard maxis sitting on big piles of AR15s and rib eye steaks might be so successful at turning newcomers off with their constant arrogant shitting on anything and everyone  that the majority of people who run full nodes in the future might not be all that interested in the important core principles if Bitcoin anymore. At that point the system becomes susceptible to corporate or government takeover.

* High fees might lead to a situation where self custody isn't really an option anymore for anyone but the bitcoin super rich. This will lead to the worst kind of centralization: centralization of private key holders which in turn are an easy target for government regulation. This is the only argument of the big blockers that actually had some merit.

To avoid the first 3, we need better privacy. To avoid the forth, maxis should consider being more welcoming and call out arrogant assholes for being arrogant assholes while still upholding the important core principles of Bitcoin. When the masses come, we need a significant minority and especially those who run their own full nodes to be onboard with privacy, scarcity and responsible scaling.

To avoid the last, we need to scale on-chain, not just off-chain. This will be very difficult to pull off.",1606379115,5,1

Be mindful when you see this type of activity and try not to sell the panic floor. In today’s case, very little has actually changed about our market.

Price recovery to $17,200+ is to be expected both Friday and at the beginning of the week. Our recent rally has been driven by incremental purchasing from institutions and new retail fronts and our recent price drop was largely driven by their absence for the holiday. With diminished but pressure, several media players have made an effort to get scary news onto our feeds, including the latest round of government surveillance and suppression updates. When you have an expected period of diminished but pressure, coupled with an intentional propagation of bad news, throw in OKEK resuming withdrawals after 5 weeks (!), the only result it a price correction. This is the same Bitcoin you know and love, so no surprise that a bunch of new money has reacted with the expectation that this dip will mirror the crash of 2017. Unfortunately for them and fortunately for you, our momentum is stacked and this pull back is healthy, albeit excessively emotional and volatile.

If you're not an experienced trader, losses aren't realized until you sell, so the only question is, do you think Bitcoin will EVER go beyond 19k or whatever you bought in at? 

In a week from now or even a few months from now?

Do you think that Paypal or all these major institutions who bought hundreds of millions worth of bitcoin in the past few months are done with Bitcoin forever after today? 

Do you think that the new Bitcoin banks being set up in the US or Bitcoin debit card issuers are calling it quits after today?

Do you think that crypto is just a fad or that China's experiment of digital currency is going to be scrapped today?

Do you think that the market is now stable and people aren't going to look at this has a store of value anymore?

Do you think that Bitcoin's nearly $200 Billion market cap is done for, forever?

If not, and you think that Bitcoin will probably go back up eventually, then relax. As long as you haven't sold, you haven't lost any money. 

You should only ""cut your losses"" if you've genuinely given up hope on Bitcoin entirely and believe that digital currency, as a store of value, is finished.

Otherwise, you have an opportunity to buy in at a lower cost and actually IMPROVE your previous investment with averaging.

k2eb03,DrRobertBottle,PayPal next moves will show it's brilliance,"tl;dr PayPal's closed ecosystem for Bitcoin will finally make using Bitcoin for purchases a reality by allowing Bitcoin to be used on millions of merchants' sites and simplify tax reporting by PayPal issuing 1099-B forms for those purchases.

I used to buy stuff with Bitcoin but it was such a pain in the ass to report every purchase on my taxes. There are a bunch of people that are anti-IRS in the Bitcoin community and don't feel like people are obligated to report to the IRS their purchases using Bitcoin. I don't want to debate that. Let's assume every purchase that a person makes with Bitcoin needs to be reported on form 8949. When a person buys on exchanges like coinbase, binance, etc, those exchanges are an open eco-system. Once a bitcoin leaves those exchanges, those exchanges don't know what happens to those bitcoins(for the most part). So, those exchanges can't automate your tax filings.

PayPal has setup a closed eco-system where they know a person's purchase history of bitcoin, their sales history of bitcoin and the history of when they bought something using bitcoin(via PayPal). So, PayPal has all the necessary information to generate a 1099-B for that person. A 1099-B completely simplifies tax filing for purchases made with Bitcoin.

To give you a concrete example. Let make the following assumptions:

I bought 1 bitcoin on August 1st 2020 for $10,000

On Sept 1st, 2020, I bought a TV for $2000 using Bitcoin and the price of one Bitcoin was $20,000.

So, let's work through what happens if I used Coinbase to originally buy that 1 bitcoin. So I bought that Bitcoin and then I moved it to my hardware wallet. I had to pay some amount of bitcoin in transaction fees to move that bitcoin. To make things ""simple"", let's assume the network transaction fee was .01 btc. So that improves my cost basis but overall it cost me money but my new cost basis is .99 bitcoin for a $10,000(this makes the effective cost basis of 1 btc to be $10,101.01). Then I purchase the tv from my hardware wallet. There would be another network transaction cost but let's assume it was free. Coinbase has no idea what I did with that bitcoin that I bought from them. So, it's now my obligation to report my capital gain to the IRS since the price had gone up since I bought that bitcoin. So, my capital gain would be: I used .1 bitcoin to buy a $2000 TV. My cost basis of that .1 btc was $1010.01. So I had a capital gain fo $989.99 that I need to pay short term capital gain taxes on that.

Now I imagine that I buy a $4 cup of coffee every day. I have to do this calculation for every cup of coffee that I had. Complete and utter insanity to manually calculate the capital gain of every purchase a person makes. I decided it wasn't worth it so I stopped buying things with bitcoin.

Let's work through the example of the closed eco-system of PayPal. Since PayPal doesn't allow me to move bitcoin in or out, they know exactly my cost basis of all of the btc that I have in my PayPal bitcoin wallet. Now I used a merchant that accepts PayPal(which is a lot of them) and I used the bitcoin that I bought via PayPal. PayPal knows exactly what my capital gain/loss is on that purchase. At the end of the year, they generate a 1099-B. All tax software can easily import a 1099-B. There is no manual calculation that I need to do. I don't need to keep track of any cost basis. PayPal has literally solved what I believe is the number one issue of using bitcoin for day to day purchases. There are only three companies in the U.S. that could pull this off. They are PayPal, Visa and MasterCard. A company needs to be already integrated into merchants.

Also, when I make a purchase using my PayPal bitcoin wallet to a PayPal merchant, PayPal doesn't need to register that transaction on bitcoin's blockchain. So, there will be no network fee for that. Yes, this is centralization. Yes, this goes against a root philosophy of decentralization.

I understand a lot of Bitcoin purists dislike these choices of PayPal. I think it's brilliant as a business strategy for PayPal. I personally will take the tradeoffs if PayPal makes it simply for me to make purchases with bitcoin. I think it's great for bitcoin if this improves adoption rate, increases the number of merchants accepting bitcoin and brings bitcoin mainstream.

I am trying to secure my current assets with cold wallets etc and well there are several strategies, good or bad, that can be adopted to do so.

Question is: how to properly manage this kind of assets together with the risk that one can suddenly pass away or become disable in a way that your close ones cannot have access to your assets? Shouldn't there be a procedure or strategy to deal with this issue?

I am worried with the possibility that my net worth continues to grow after I die without having anyone with access to it... 

Who has some plans on how to deal with this issue?",1606525534,20,1

k2adkc,properspecimen,Curious geek with a couple questions.,"Hello all, I hope the holidays for my US friends went well and we're all enjoying riding this wave as we HODL to our heart's content. Today I'd like to present a few questions and talking points in general just to open up discussion, but also to get new insight into other perspectives. Just to prefix this, I've worked in IT and Network engineering for years. I love computers, programming, and problem solving. This is no brag just a simple credential explanation so you know who you're talking to. 

1) How do my fellow HODLers feel about potential future bottlenecks in the network? I.E, when BTC first started as a project, I could in theory use my school laptop to mine BTC, as it wasn't that taxing. Now, with all the competition, we see scalpers grabbing graphics cards and selling them at extraordinary prices, in theory to make a profit off of gamers, but a lot of BTC miners that I know have personally spent thousands on top of the line cards (often times 2-3 of them), just to mine BTC. Is this competition hurting us? Hurting our approachability? Do you think it's better than a select few are involved in the mining process, compared to any old joe with a laptop being able to attempt, (and in 2020, almost indefinitely fail), to mine any coin. Is this hurting our network and our eventual overtaking of Fiat? Please share opinions below. 

2) How do you all feel about the adoption of the general public of BTC? I.e the JPM coin that has been introduced, which in my opinion is a joke, but if you look at the code. It's completely different than BTC, it's only meant to be for a subset of certain P2P transactions, and it's only used in their own personal environment. Is the adoption of BTC by general public seen as counter productive by my friends here? Or do any of us believe that major banks &amp; governments 'hopping on board' and 'playing by our rules' will be beneficial, albeit, in my eyes, almost seemingly impossible? Please discuss, let's keep it friendly, insightful, thoughtful, and accurate. Happy days to all of my fellow HODLers and I hope the best for all of us here.",1606513531,19,1

k29wmc,Adamsimecka,I did it. I emptied my Coinbase account.,"Yeah, the title was a little bait and switch, but I did empty my coinbase account. I finally pulled the trigger and took control of my own keys.

I have always been hesitant to maintain full custody of my bitcoin since I wasn't 100% sure I could reliably and responsibly control it.

However, with everything going on with Coinbase, and rumors that they will be introducing new policies with the US government regarding self-custody, I am pretty worried they will sanction BTC for all US citizens. Yes, I know it's an extreme case, but as soon as things get real and the current elite realize they have holes in their moneybags (inflation, quantitative easing, stimulus, money printing, bailouts, etc...), they will probably take extreme measures to make sure they retain power.

You start to get panicked even when you have done nothing wrong.  


Some who has entered crypto gains since 2014 ( trying to pay taxes ) even before anyone was sure how to handle crypto I am afraid are going to get hurt badly.  I am not sure but there is a possibility that people who never filed crypto might actually get it easier ( which is wrong, but it is what it is ).  


The IRS innocently sends you requests... do you get a lawyer?  Your claimed taxes equal about what you have in assets or taken out to your bank over the years....  


Did you properly report exactly?  Probably not..... too late you have an audit, no amnesty to go back and amend now....  Hire a lawyer?  It is so damn stressful you can't sleep and you don't even know how to comply without possibly putting yourself in jeopardy.   So Again, you have done nothing wrong, tried to pay your taxes, are probably going to get penalties.  


The question becomes hire a lawyer/cpa service to rebuild your history?  Maybe.... 10k -20k, more stress you know you didn't do much wrong but are at a complete loss on how to move forward without hurting your financial future, your family is stressed....   


So I guess I hire a lawyer that can rebuild a complex history filled with gaming transactions, trading... going to cost an arm and a leg fun times.  Such a travesty of justice, no other choice...  


If anyone has a similar experience and would like to share what to expect and what you did and what you learned, please share here or in a private message.

k28v2a,Rachel_Pham,Please help me with Bitcoin or Ethereum!,"  

My family has been facing difficult financial hardship because my father unexpectedly left my family. He stopped supporting my family’s living expenses and left us a big amount of debt. In my culture, a father’s responsibility provides the main financial resource for the whole family while a mother and children are dismissive of him. Therefore, our family is facing a big financial burden for our survival due to his left. I also had to stop my studies as my family is unable to afford my academic expenses. My family and I have been trying so hard to find a job but the situation is more challenging due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I tried to reach out to many local financial aids and money donation organizations but there is likely not much help. My family and I are very stressed and depressed and we only hope if magic will happen to us. Luckily, I know by chance that there are many donators who want to donate Bitcoin or Ethereum for free in the world so I am trying my luck to ask for Bitcoin or Ethereum. Please financially help us overcome this tough time. I promise that if my family and I will be able to survive after this time, I will give back to the community to help others. Thank you for your time reading my words and I hope I will hear positive news from you.

k36mah,vukthewolfy,My idea for the Satoshi symbol,"* It's a number 8 with a small part erased to represent the opposite of infinity symbol, which is ""Finity"" and sats are finite, ie. absolutely scarce.
* It's very similar or the same to the small delta symbol which represents the change and difference, and I think that Bitcoin and Satoshi are the embodiment of that.
* It is also similar to the small letter b in some languages and the symbolism is clear between the uppercase letter of B in bitcoin as a larger unit and the small ""b"" in satoshi as a smaller unit.
* I think it's really memorable and easy to write on paper.
* The symbol also has a letter S in itself to symbolize Satoshi.
* I have checked globally accepted symbols as well as symbols of world currencies and couldn't find any similarities. I d like to be checked on this. We want something unique, aren't we? ;)  


There are the connections and symbolism I could find between satoshi as a unit and this symbol I ""Created"". Tell me what you think. :)

I've been earning a minimum of $3K+ bi-weekly and sometimes monthly although, that depends on how hard I work in a particular month. Today I'll share the insight with everyone here to help more people and make an extra income.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2017, I attended the 10X growth conference by Grant Cardone and I met an interesting gentleman by the name of Brian. He's a financial consultant and a portfolio strategist. He wanted me as a client but I told him I was going to schedule a meeting with him later on.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to July 2018, I watched an interview on CNBC and the person on-screen was none other than Brian David Odell. The same guy I met at the 10x growth conference. I reached out to him personally and he told me about his hedge fund and asked me to join him. I did my research on him and decided to give him a try.

&amp;#x200B;

My first portfolio with him was worth $10K and in less than 48 days I was already up by 64%. After my first dividend was paid I had to increase my portfolio size and for over 2 years now, it's been a profitable journey. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you're interested in building a working business relationship with Brian, send him a mail at [brianodellofficial@gmail.com](mailto:brianodellofficial@gmail.com). I would love to drop his WhatsApp phone number but that'll be too much but you can reach out to him via email and request it if you need it.

&amp;#x200B;

Another good thing about Brian is that if you refer someone to him and the person purchases a portfolio from him you instantly get a 10% commission and that's how I make an extra $3K+.",1606636684,0,1

I’ve been thinking about getting into Bitcoin as another investment besides the stock market.

Security is my #1 issue, and it seems a hard wallet is impossible to get hacked and I want to go that route.

I’m just curious about what happens to your hard wallet (I.e. Ledger Nano) when the battery dies? Their website says u can charge it but it is designed to last 5 years. I’m curious what happens to your coins if the battery eventually dies out after the 5 years. 

I was originally thinking Coinbase, but With a hard wallet, Is it simpler and easier to just use cash app to transfer the BTC? Or is it as easy with coinbase?

Other that since, I’m excited about getting into BTC but want to make sure I understand eveything about storing my coins.

I recognize the ""privacy"" hand-waving fear-based reasoning, and I don't agree, particularly with regard for mainstream introduction and accessibility. Folks are reassured by stability. My wallet is a personal item, and this person believes in radical honesty—yes, I would like my ""illegal"" purchases to be traceable to me, for those bothering to investigate.

For example, Oregon in the recent election de-criminalized many drugs. I now have no way to verify that I was right all along (saying ""I told you so"") by associating with my wallet. Perhaps counter-intuitively, the way things change is by being happy to explain to others why one's path is different. Part of that is having an actual path, rather than hypothetical past situations with which to reference.

Regardless of your position, the original protocol, I believe, supports this, and the changing of addresses with every send complicates the legitimate business use-case and personal bookkeeping of Bitcoin-based economy.

You have the fear-based ""what-if"" problem solved with xPub addressing, which was a ""feature"" no one actually requested. With me, you now have a real-life counter-example and reason \*not\* to implement.

Could you please point me to a an iOS wallet app generally-available which allows me to centralize my ledger by looking up a specific address and sticking to a specific address, instead of the tedium forced on me now, looking up each address, comparing sends+receives and all that malarky.

k31upa,InfinityLife,Enable 2FA and other security methods! Learn from my mistake.,"Yesterday I was a target of a data breach. Never tought this can happen, but they could successfully login to one of my exchanges I use. Good for me as I only had a few dollars on this excahnge. They even moved some coins on the exchange, but then stopped at the withdraw as it was not worth or fees too high. I do not know.

How this could happen? I had 2FA everywhere. But my old phone got broken and I could not access some 2FA. I had to reset some 2FA with a lot of effort like passport and much more. At one exchange I forgot to re-enable the 2FA. I am very very lucky this happened at an exchange I do not trade.

Now I spend the whole day about data breaches, safer passwords, 2FA and how to avoid this. There are more and more data breaches happening around the world . They get your login and password in an encrpyted SHA1 or bcrypt form. If your password is weak, they can decrypt it very easy with brute force method.

So as I could find, two important things to avoid such my mistake:

1. Enable 2FA with an authenticator app. (No SMS! They are calling your provider for a loss of the sim card, get a second sim card and get the 2FA sms)
2. Make your password 16+ digits long with a really random alphanumeric and special charakters. Use sentences or other mnemo technique to remember. This makes sure they cannot brute force your SHA1 or bcrypt password.

And safest method: Use an offline wallet. And diversify these offline wallets to different locations. Your room can also get damaged (fire, robbery, ...). Reduce the risk as most as possible. The more your savings are, the more spend time, effort and even money in reducing the risk and diversify your savings. Some people say spend up to 0,1-0.5% yearly to safe your savings.

I hope some of you learn from my mistake and take the opportunity to safe even better your savings.

Looking through history (graphs of blockchain size, hashrate, network difficulty, estimated number of wallets, and price), I think it is possible. Very soon (within a year).

For example, first 'mayor' bull run, from 100€ to 950€:

https://preview.redd.it/alq8mfyf6z161.jpg?width=1184&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10ef3d006861a2ecc97da9fbb74f2b0c598a941c

And then, second bull run, after reaching new ATH to 16500€:

https://preview.redd.it/3t3kanqm6z161.jpg?width=1184&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=048cfb02e3a63559f9fd956ba27281a0128874b0

So, if all observed data (blockchain size, hashrate, network difficulty, estimated number of wallets) have same growth tendecies, then price should follow same pattern? Like this:

k2ludh,Platinum_Joe,"Trading Brokers - main RISKS hidden in T&amp;C, you have no full control","To all online Trading Brokers, platforms,

prove that you don\`t have characteristics of a SCAM company, explain and defend yourself answering 6 questions. Just share with the CySEC, FCA, FSCA and WORLD:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Out of 13 mln users how many accounts have you terminated?
2. Was there at least one that broke the Terms and Conditions, how many?
3. What was the average profit/loss of each account when terminated? I assume it was major loss
4. What was the total LOSS of all accounts you TERMINATED, turning all users\` loss into your PROFIT? How much have you cashed in on all Terminations?
5. How do you compare that to competitors? I have not heard one person complaining about being kicked out of Plus500, XBT, Aviva or CityIndex?
6. Do you think it\`s fair to not let investments mature, but terminate positions and accounts pre-maturely?

This is an OPEN LETTER to All brokers, in last 10 years how much have you PROFIT-ered from Terminating Users Accounts?

The clause in T&amp;C allowing platforms to terminate users accounts, effectively means you are not in control of your investments, thet have right to CLOSE your positions and Terminate you account at any time. So, when you are in Red and want to wait for next market cycle or for change of trend, you don\`t have years to wait (as one would think with owned x1 un-leveraged position as is case with Stocks and Cryptos on Etoro - ""You own the underlying asset""), no you have been MISLED, or even Misrepresented, the broker can close your position the next day!

In case of Etoro, who have been notoriously known for silencing inconvenient users and kicking out arbitrarily, as found evidence on www.truetoro.org, ,

Total money made on account terminations could be over a million, since only one user lost $150,000! See [www.etoroisnotsafe.com](https://www.etoroisnotsafe.com/). I think Etoro is a quasi legal SCAM machine, grooming users like Platinum Joe and TERMINATING their account, taking their profits, just for stating obvious problems! Is that not the definition of SCAM - grooming, taking more money, building sense of safety and running away with users money when he wants to complain to authorities, without appeal or hearing.

Also, who gives companies like Etoro right to decide if a trader can or cannot afford the money he is investing? Do they know that he drives a Ferrari, lives in LA mansion, has multiple sources of revenue, real estate, inheritance, and perhaps just pretends to be worse of, to complaint about something to make even more money? Ethos should be I\`m responsible for my money, my trades, my investment strategy. Trading platforms cannot just assume that $100,000 is too much for someone. The secret millionaire will always say he\`s poor and that something was too expensive for him and will bargain for every dollar. Point is, only trader should be in charge of his money and decisions, unless  he\`s medically diagnosed not fit. But a healthy person can pretend to be poor or sad to exaggerate his situation and claim more money. Companies should be objective and let traders manage their accounts, don\`t terminate them if losses appear big (but are actually smaller every week during a bull run). 

Etoro had no right to Platinum Joes \`Termination Money\` by saying he could not loose anymore. All it took was limit deposits and trading and in fact let him ride the bull run and take out the profits growing every week. His positions were not leveraged by x1, no fees, so should be allowed to be open indefinitely. Etoro\`s only interest was to remove the whistle blower and take \`termination money\`, not least concerned or bothered to check actual financial situation.

That\`s what SCAM companies do. Take profits and run if  users ask too many questions or say they will contact authorities. There is evidence of Etoro using that SCAM tactic on Platinum\_Joes, account!

**This is an open letter exercising freedom of speech.** Etoro has right to comment, but only if above questions are answered. If this post is removed or edited by Reddit, there might be suspicion of siding with the Giant.

k2koua,ChTender,New Bitcoin Regulations: What it means for you,"This is a response to a question cropping up since Brian Armstrong from Coinbase amplified Steve Mnuchin’s self hosted wallet FUD.

The proposed regulation is to compel exchanges to KYC both inbound and outbound wallets. Within this measure, there is no attempt to blacklist your cold storage wallet. The process of sending coins into an exchange would change. One day you would go to your receive address on your exchange and there would be a warning, that all new deposits must be from pre-approved sources. You would validate that the cold wallet is in your possession and then send your deposit as per usual. If you send a deposit from a non validated cold wallet, your funds will probably be frozen until you validate the wallet. The same goes for sending BTC out, except that it will probably be impossible to approve a send to non validated address.

I agree with Brian Armstrong that this is damaging the United States crypto industry, in that it requires more diligence and expense from exchanges, more diligence and reporting from self hosted wallets, and that it proceeds down a slippery slope of regulation that will inevitably stifle innovation. It’s important to remember that this proposal is both only a proposal and primarily coming from Steve Mnuchin who is out of a job come January.",1606554693,16,1

I didn't even realize what i had done until it was too late. **I had sent tens of thousands of dollars to a CUSTODIAL WALLET!!!!**

They gladly accepted my donation, but I immediately tried to send the funds out, after realizing, and was flagged for ""SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY"" So let me get this straight taking my funds BACK into my control is SUSPICIOUS??? (What a bunch of SCAMMERS)

Ive provided them:

**Photo ID**

**Screenshots of wallet the transactions came from**

**Ring signatures,**

**Proof of residence,**

**Pictures of me in front of computer with sending wallet open and a ridiculous pic they sent.**

**After sending them this, they then asked where the funds came from, and it was another wallet I had which I also sent them DETAILED info from!!** (They keep asking questions until they find something that you cannot comply with then this somehow gives them justification to STEAL YOUR FUNDS)

**At each step they assured me that this is the ""LAST THING OUR SECURITY DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO COMPLETE VERIFICATION""**

I have provided them everything short of a **STOOL SAMPLE,** which I'm gladly able and willing to send if they provide a valid address... you know just so they can verify that the funds are mine...

I have asked them for their ADDRESS Their NAMES and of course they will not comply!

I noticed that They tend to PLAY A GAME WITH YOU BY ASKING FOR THE SAME INFORMATION 3-5 TIMES (Most likely to delay the process and have more time with your funds)

&gt;**As far as I can tell I am the ONLY person they have held funds for over 2 months!**  
**So those asking if FREEWALLET IS A SCAM?**

**ABSOLUTELY!! FREEWALLET IS A SCAM!!**

I have never in my almost 10 years of crypto witnessed anything like this, or had funds held without any justification, for such a long time!

Most recently they are asking me:

&gt;**"" please provide us with a photo of the certified purchase agreement containing the buyer's and seller's IDs. The document should also contain transaction hashes, addresses and amount.""**

This Monero came from MANY transactions, mostly cash, done over the course of years with people I meet in Meetups and Crypto Conferences (I'm very involved with Crypto, and yes I should have known better)

Impossible to provide this information even if I wanted to!!

How dare they ask for ID of a person that I purchased coins from?

Like anyone would be willing to provide their personal information to a SCAM WEBSITE, or me?

And what does any of this have to do with verification? I sent them Ring signatures that CONFIRM that the funds came from me. NO ONE else in the whole world would have access to this information!!

I hope that others can learn from my mistake, and avoid #FREEWALLET like the plague!!  
If you read this Please tell others you may encounter about this SCAM so that they are not effected!

I believe that if the community STANDS up against these SCAMMERS, together we can take them down, or at least limit the number of people that they effect!!

**I am working on a website that will detail all of my ordeals with them and a place where others can go to post details of their negative encounters with freewallet, since they buy positive reviews to offset the negative ones, I mean they made enough $$ from me alone to buy several thousand positive reviews! (its easy to tell the fake reviews they usualy one line and talk about the ""great User Interface"" also the accounts have 3 names like"" Jose Louis Gonzales"" whereas the negative reviews are detailed and only have first and last names!**

**If you have been scammed by FREEWALLET SCAM please CONTACT ME!**  
**(Hope I used ""SCAM"" enough times also ""SELECTIVE SCAMMING"")**

Hello All,

I’m a previous Bitcoin buyer who never could quite add up WHY I should invest in Bitcoin, so I cashed in (2 years ago) 

In the last few months I’ve reinvested and now have a better understanding of all the benefits and the value of holding long term.

Now that’s all and good, but when I try to express my excitement about the potential of Bitcoin to people m I know, and to the audience of my podcast, I do t think I’m doing it any justice.

So I’m looking for somebody that’s experienced (expert in blockchain and Bitcoin) to come on my podcast and educate me and my audience all about this amazing technology and why we shouldn’t let the train depart without us.

If you’re interested and would like to talk, please shoot me a DM...

Anyone have any reasons to believe the repeating cycle is just a coincidence?

Let's assume the cycle would continue similarly. Will the pandemic (money printer go brr) and institutional intervention (regulation and investment) make it unrecognisable, hence breaking the cycle? 

Also, since most of the coins have been mined, would that mean that btc is trying to become less volatile which would probably attract adoption?

Or all of the above?

I'm sure hedge fund managers are getting calls right now saying they need to accumulate this asset, and still need to profit. I'm sure they're freaking out. This happened in China. They pulled the exact same stunt. I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist, but I believe that we have to be pretty naive to think that government and wall street are going to stand on the sidelines as this new asset completely disrupts the entire global monetary system. I expect a bumpy road. I expect the US to scare people out of bitcoin by threats of banning it, or regulating it to a point where there's no longer incentive to own it. After they gain enough control over it, then they will advertise it as something positive to the public. The very reason as to why Bitcoin was created was because Satoshi saw what happened during the housing collapse of 2008. Greed and corruption rules capitalisms, and everyone operates within self interest. Right now, they are incentivized to act in the way I'm suggesting. Thoughts?",1606689256,10,1

I obviously don't want to lock the funds up in any long-term commitments that would prevent me from moving fast or fulfilling the limit order during a dip, and ideally this could all be done seamlessly through an exchange that also lets you earn interest.

NEM: Ok yeah, I mean it’s not really about that.

OBF: Pounds are backed up by (fist to the sky, bicep flexing, Rocky Balboa style stance assumed) THE BANK OF ENGLAND

NEM: Oh yeah I suppose.

The fact that he said “the Bank of England” and not “something tangible like silver” was quite revealing. It suggests he knows about GBP not being redeemable for silver anymore and that he doesn’t care. Like somehow he feels so British and is incredibly proud that his currency is worth more compared to other countries. I could have slapped him with the decrease in purchasing power or indeed held up that it got divorced from shiny metals, but I just felt like he might be a lost cause. He was probably 70. I didn’t want to turn a friendly exchange into something where he leaves feeling like his very identity was under attack. Idk.

At that point, there should only be upside potential, as we move towards global adoption. That’s the point when it becomes a store of value rather than a “speculative investment”

k3euqj,Strikaos,Kraken is closing my account with no reason after I asked them my sepa transfers are missing.," Hello guys,

(Ticket 3523248)

I'll explain the situation real quick :

I, an european, did a sepa transfer in my kraken account 10 days ago.

Not seeing anything on account, after the 5th day, I send a request to kraken support to help me.

They don't find anything, we discuss during 5 days. They told me they are not finding anything under my name the 9th day.

The 10th day -today- I told them I might have found the problem : I didn't put the reference in my transfer because there wasn't any location where I could put this info.

And then, I received a complete mayhem of answers, within 2 hours :

&amp;#x200B;

[Emails.](https://preview.redd.it/oycvasje68261.png?width=1342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a130008db5619ee06e0517641f31be99eeb6bf5f)

The first one tell me that my issue was sent to the Payments team for further review = they don't know yet what's going on.

&amp;#x200B;

[First email](https://preview.redd.it/oy2t069h68261.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26c4b825eb357ef882da4fc77d11e60d194dc890)

Second one, the weird one, the support tell me, out of nowhere, that my account is going to be closed and I need to take back my crypto. I don't even know why :

&amp;#x200B;

[2nd email](https://preview.redd.it/yhpm36li68261.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe82d6214742f4e388f81a46d589e70d89f86796)

Third email, the exact same person told me that they may have find it but the transfer is not exactly the amount I talked about -even though I said I sent a first transfer 19th november and another one 24th of November :

&amp;#x200B;

[Third email, 3 minutes after the 2nd one.](https://preview.redd.it/tw8ecbrk68261.png?width=1214&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=851310465abe29e05a497f4f82d7f6c6202ab204)

What is going on ? How am I suppose to send a picture of a deposit I don't even see in my kraken account. And I already send them a picture of the deposit on my bank account.

Can someone tell me if it has already happened to you or someone you know pls ? For what reason Kraken can close my account without my consent as I didn't do anything wrong -My account is not even big, I'm a poor student. What happened if I don't send my crypto within the 78 hours, do I loose them ?

I even contacted the online live support, they told me they weren't ""allowed to talk about it"".

It's very concerning for any Kraken user.

TL:DR = Kraken is closing my account without telling me why and are sending contradictory answers to my missing sepa transfer.",1606675886,71,1

I got an offer, accpeted the trade. The method in which I paid the seller was interact e transfer. 

After I sent the email I confirmed the payment and waited for the seller to confirm they have recieved it also.

&amp;#x200B;

I waited for about a day, which was the duration of the trade. I messaged the seller through Bisq no response. 

&amp;#x200B;

After it was declared incomplete, I opened up dispute and waited for the mediator. 

I wrote I had sent the payment and the seller did not confirm they had received it.

It is nearing 48 hours of no repsone from the mediator or seller. 

Im not sure whats going on. Will I lose my btc deposit and 250$ as well?

Finally, I then stretched it vertically so it would not look out of place next to other currency symbols.

So  I transferred bitcoin from Coinbase Pro to Electrum and paid the fee within coinbase pro for both buying BTC (.5%), as well as the withdrawal fee (approx 0.0001 BTC). I got nervous because when I viewed my transaction on the block explorer it said the transaction fee was 0.0054 BTC (297.3 sat/vB), or about $85 USD! However, when the transaction from Coinbase to Electrum was completed (over 6  confirmations in Electrum), I had my full amount of BTC after the coinbase fees.

My question is why does it show a transaction fee (.005 BTC or 297.3 sat/vB) on the block explorer and I didn't get charged beyond the Coinbase pro withdrawal fees? Did Coinbase absorb the transaction fees? Or are those getting pulled from somewhere else?

Any help or reading would be much appreciated.",1604691584,10,1

## Let us now have a look into some of the best Bitcoin Transaction Accelerators:

&amp;#x200B;

**TunisiaBTC**

[**https://tunisiabtc.com/txid/**](https://tunisiabtc.com/txid/)

TunisiaBTC is the world’s most powerful **bitcoin accelerator** and allows you to accelerate BTC transactions by reducing the time taken waiting for confirmations.

## Fast

By rebroadcasting your btc transaction through up to 15 Blockchain nodes, we can greatly reduce the time where they can get ‘stuck’ in the queue (known as the mempool) during busy periods or where you used a low mining fee. 

## Private

In the same way that Bitcoin transactions themselves are (in general) private, we also value privacy and don’t ask for registration or personal details from you.

## Free

Actually, this site is donation supported, so technically someone is paying for it. That’s why we ask that you don’t use an ad-blocker, otherwise we won’t be able to offer our bitcoin transaction accelerator service.

## Accelerate your BTC transaction in a few clicks.Free of charge.

[**Accelerate BTC Transaction**](https://tunisiabtc.com/txid/#)

## How Does it Work?

Every time you make a Bitcoin transaction i.e send or receive BTC from or to a wallet, your transaction is ‘broadcast’ on the blockchain. This tells miners that your transaction is ready and waiting for processing and; once processed, it is then marked as ‘confirmed’. It is usually these confirmations that you are waiting for when you spend your BTC because they act as proof that your Bitcoin was actually sent and received.

Unfortunately, this process can take longer than is ideal and you end up waiting longer than you’d like for transactions to confirm. This is especially true when the blockchain is busy when, in some cases, you can end up waiting days for confirmations! However, what TunisiaBTC does, it rebroadcast your transaction across a number of global Bitcoin ‘nodes’ which reduces the time you wait for miners to become aware of your transaction and start processing it. This is how our BTC accelerator works.

&amp;#x200B;

### ViaBTC 

📷

ViaBTC started its service back in 2017 challenging the 1MB limit of Bitcoin blocks. The service is free but charges an extra amount for low transaction fees or transactions that are urgent. The free service is available at 100 accelerations per hour.

To use the service users, need to provide their transaction ID. To avail the paid services, you have to pay a minimum charge of 0.0001BTC/KB. Also, there is no need for users to sign up for the services. They just need to submit their TXID in a specific format available at Bitcoin Blockchain explorers. [Link to ViaBTC](https://coinfunda.com/go/viabtc/)

### BTC.com 

The BTC.com doesn’t have a Bitcoin acceleration service of their own, but they do so in cooperation with other mining services to prevent congestion in the Bitcoin transaction services. The fees depend on the congestion in the network. BTC.com can increase your transaction confirmation to 75% in one hour to 98% in 4 hours respectively. For availing of the free service, you can just sign up for the acceleration service. However, paid services depend on the congestion in the network and are nonrefundable. [Link to BTC.com](https://pushtx.btc.com/)

### ConfirmTX 

ConfirmTX is another Bitcoin accelerator service and charges a minimum fee of 5 USD for more than 250-byte transactions and free for all other transactions. They pull your transactions to multiple pools they have partnered with and so there is always a chance that your transaction will be confirmed even if you have paid a minimum fee of $0.01. Once paid, there is no chance for a refund and all your transactions are confirmed within 12 hours and maximum up to 72 hours. If they fail to confirm within 72 hours your account will be credited with a free future transaction acceleration service.

The confirmation also depends on the amount of fees you pay. For example, if your fees are 0.50$ chances are there that your transaction will be confirmed within 48 hours rather than 72 hours in case of a 0.01$ fee. [~~Link to ConfirmTX~~](https://confirmtx.com/)

### 360 BTC Accelerator 

The 360 BTC Accelerator provides free acceleration services and there is always a chance that your transactions will be confirmed even if you have paid a very low fee. The service does not mine by itself or is not connected to miners but all your transactions will be confirmed by rebroadcasting the unconfirmed transactions to the network itself. In this process, the transactions get picked up by other mining pools like that of ViaBTC, and your transaction gets confirmed. The service is very easy to use and no sign-up is required. Link to Website

### BTC TX Accelerator

BTC TX Accelerator is a free Bitcoin accelerator and has partnered with several mining pools to accelerate the confirmation of Bitcoin transactions faster. If your transaction has been jammed up or is unconfirmed due to the low fee, BTC TX will add an extra fee and clear the confirmation process by sending it to partner pools. Link to BTC TX Accelerator

### BitAccelerate

BitAccelerate is a free Bitcoin transaction accelerator and helps you clear your unconfirmed transactions easily within the network. BitAccelerate asks you to submit your transaction ID or TXID and click on the “Accelerate” button and your transaction will be rebroadcasted by using 10 Bitcoin nodes. To get a faster result, you can resubmit your ‘stuck’ transaction every 6 hours and the BitAccelerate will keep on broadcasting until it is confirmed. No sign-up is required for using the service. [Link to BitAccelerate](https://bitaccelerate.com/)

### Bitcoin Afterburner APP

Bitcoin Afterburner is developed by a software team called Samourai Wallet Team and is slightly different from the other Bitcoin Accelerator services. It uses a system called CPFP or “Child pays for parent” transaction which acts as a wallet and helps you accelerate your unconfirmed transaction.

To use the services, you need to download the Android App into your android phone and restore your Bitcoin wallet. After you have synced the app with your transaction need, Afterburner will charge you with a fee of $5.99 along with miner fees for using CPFP services.

* Relative cost of production is the main determinant for prices

* Electricity consumption is the main cost of production

* Altcoin production is only an intermediary means to Bitcoin production

* Bitcoin price can be described by its cost of production

Please give me your insight on this, super stuck!

As I haven't got many resources I am unable to test this method however before I spend the time investing in servers and such, I would like to show my idea as to how I will be handling a payments system with my site and whether or not this is a good idea or not.

I will be using Bitcoin-client / core / bitcoind (I don't know the difference).  
I will first create a new wallet: `createwallet ""transactions""`  
Then I will import addresses I already own: `importaddress ""address"" ""label"" false` (rescan: false) and this do for around 30 addresses?  
Once I have imported the addresses, I will then do `rescanblockchain`  
And now, I should be able to do: `listreceivedbyaddress &lt;address&gt;` and get a list of all of the transactions for an address (which I can then track and use as a transaction)

Question is, will this work? I don't know a great deal about Bitcoin but from my research, this is the only work around I can think of as I have no clue whether this is the correct approach at all.

Ideally, I would like to set and forget the addresses and then whenever a new address has been picked to serve as the address a user will have to send bitcoin too, it will then look for that address, find the latest transaction when there is one and then monitor that transaction.

I've been searching for months to find a solution where I don't use some rubbish third party API so please, would love some input!",1604795099,4,1

I am considering taking 100k out of my 401k and sticking it in btc.

I know.....

Here are my details:  My wife and have about 400 total in our 401's.  I am 57, and for the most part retired (I have ""flipped"" properties the last couple of years, but at this point I am pretty much income neutral.

My wife's situation is a bit odd:  she was let go from Deloitte due to the covid situation, but she is still planning on working about 15 more years as she has a solid marketable career skillset as a financial risk expert (and is 7 yrs younger that me).  She was making 230k last year as a senior manager, and should be able to get a position making at least 200k when she returns to the job market (which theoretically should add another 100k or so to our retirement fund)

So, the 100k would essentially be about 15ish% of our ""liquid"" cash  (we have about 300+k in property equity, plus 25k in btc and maybe 20k in other investments).

We would of course be paying a 10% penalty, plus the 30% income tax on the 100k 401k withdrawal, so right off the bat that 100k has already dropped in value to 60k....

This is also my issue.  I sold last cycle.  The price went down so much, but I was waiting for even cheaper prices.  Before I realized, the price went higher past my selling price.

It’s almost impossible for me to regain my previous numbers of bitcoins.

[After going live last week](https://pdf.maitube.com/pdf/?e=agin1HZwcF6.Qa), the deposit contract for Ethereum’s 2.0 upgrade now holds over 50k ETH – 10% of the threshold needed to activate the watershed update.

**Cyberattackers Demand $11M in Bitcoin From Japanese Gaming Giant Capcom**

Japanese Gaming Giant [Capcom](https://pdf.maitube.com/pdf/?e=agin1HZwcF6.Qa), creator of popular games like Resident Evil and Street Fighter, fell victim to a ransomware in early November, with attackers allegedly demanding $11 million in bitcoin in exchange for not leaking illegally obtained confidential information to the public.

**Bitcoin whale clusters signal $14.9K is the crucial level for BTC to hold**

Bitcoin whale clusters show that $14,914 is critical for the ongoing rally to see continuation. New data from Whalemap suggests that in order to maintain bullish momentum Bitcoin price needs to hold above the $14,914 level.

**Bitcoin at $15K is now bigger than PayPal, Coca-Cola, Netflix, Disney**

Bitcoin surged from $190 billion to around $280 billion in recent months, surpassing some big-name companies, including banks, by market capitalization.

In early September of this year, the market capitalization of Bitcoin ([BTC](https://pdf.maitube.com/pdf/?e=agin1HZwcF6.Qa)) was hovering at around $190 billion when the BTC price was hovering around $10,000.

In the past two months, however, the price of Bitcoin[rose from to over $15,000](https://pdf.maitube.com/pdf/?e=agin1HZwcF6.Qa). With it, the market cap of Bitcoin surged from $190 billion to around $280 billion. This now makes Bitcoin more valuable than most major U.S. companies.

**Sam Bankman-Fried believes even ETH 2 can't handle DeFi's potential growth**

FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried doesn’t believe Ethereum will be able to provide the scaling capabilities required by the DeFi sector in future.

FTX exchange co-founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried believes Ethereum ([ETH](https://pdf.maitube.com/pdf/?e=agin1HZwcF6.Qa)) is incapable of handling decentralized finance’s (DeFi) growth.

Talking to Camila Russo from the Defiant Podcast, Bankman-Fried says that the Ethereum blockchain is limiting DeFi’s development and the only way around it is to build on other networks.",1605076907,2,1

She's spent a lot of time explaining to me that I need to buy bitcoin using ""coinmama"" and then use that to buy DFC, using a website called ""[dfc.live](https://dfc.live).""

Earlier this year I signed a retainer client and we started figuring out the best way for me to get the regular payments I'm owed.

Initially, we used Xoom, a payment service similar to Western Union where client makes transfer and I have to go to a local physical location (a bank in my case) to recieve the cash.

This meant I had to set aside 2-3 hours of driving back and forth and waiting patiently for the bank to ping another branch, verify my ID, verify the transfer, etc. and it cost me 3% of my payment. 

Next we tried Payoneer. 3% overall fee as well but took a week for me to get the money in my bank account.

Finally, client and I discussed using Bitcoin. Both of us were already familiar with it so it was worth a shot.

Process goes as follows:
- Client buys Bitcoin on Coinbase and sends it to my wallet
- Bitcoin shows up immediately and takes maybe 10-20 minutes to get 3+ confirmations. 
- I HODL some and transfer the rest to Localbitcoins where I have a regular ""dealer"" who has a local bank transfer waiting for me.
- Transfer arrives immediately because it's between accounts within the same bank.

The best thing is, the overall fee is around 3%... extra, to me! 

Bitcoin is a little more expensive here on Localbitcoins than on Coinbase (very recently not the case anymore).

This process is far from perfect and I'm open to any suggestions on how to improve it. 

I chose to share it here because it has really been a great and empowering experience for me. I feel in control on my business's money in a way I never have before. 

I'm not at the mercy of some bank and their paralyzing bureaucracy. 

I think this new age of financial globalization Bitcoin is sheepherding in is something that a lot of people in the ""west"" forget. The US and Europe are well connected by traditional financial networks which, I believe, makes it a little harder to appreciate the true democratic decentralization and empowerment Bitcoin provides.

jrulh3,ting_jun48,Multiple banks refuse to send wire transfer to Bitcoin exchange,"Trying to link my bank account to an online exchange (screw exchanges, but it's good to have them setup in case other avenues are unavailable), and both of my banks refused to send the wire transfer that is needed to get the account verified. 

One of the banks is a major US bank, the other is a local credit union. The major bank refused to tell me why they wouldn't process the wire transfer. The credit union rep straight up said it was because of the crypto exchange. This just shows you how the billionaires are trying to keep working class people out of BTC until it is too late.

In a last ditch attempt, I decided to skip the wire transfer and succumb to Plaid. Blocked as well. First they cut off credit and debit cards. Now they are cutting off the accounts themselves.

However, as I started accumulating a sizable position and with BTC’s price starting to look like it’s gonna retest it’s ATH, I knew that I wanted to actually own my own BTC. So over the past few days I sold my entire BTC position on Robinhood, transferred the money back to my bank, wire transferred that money to Kraken and just now bought actual BTC and boy does it feel amazing. Was honestly super scared to click the sell button on Robinhood as I knew that I would be without any BTC exposure for a couple of days while my funds were being transferred but it definitely was the right move.

jt0kq3,Foufou190,How Bitcoin is not the first “virtual” money and is bringing back the original concept of it invented 5000 years ago.,"The usual narrative about the emergence of money is that people were trading goods (food, materials) and then needed some common way to represent the value of everything. Some pieces of metal were found convenient for their properties (tough, quite rare, easily transportable) and so emerged the first coins, then later on people started lending money to each other, and that’s how slowly emerged the banks.

However, like Felix Martin explains (I strongly recommend reading his work) this is not actually what happened. The first coins we have discovered are from 500-700 BC, yet civilizations in Egypt, Mesopotamia and China were already using systems to assess the value of everything and trade efficiently. 

In fact, when people were looking for a common system of valuation, their first solution was to keep track of the trades on clay tables. The first signs of writing are indeed these tables, were we can read how person Y gave 2 sheep to person X, and then person X is now giving back 4 fishes to person Y to close the trade. 

These are the first example of literacy, numeracy and of the concept of credit, invented for accounting purposes. It is also the first valuation system for goods (a.k.a. money). These clay tables are from about 3000 years BC, so well before the first metal coins were ever used.

Now if we look at Bitcoin, it is essentially keeping track of trades and the balances of everyone by writing it on a ledger... that is exactly the same as our ancestor’s clay tables. The concept of money being a physical thing is a myth, money and even credit is much older than physical coins and its first forms were decentralized, just like Bitcoin.

Tl;dr Bitcoin is in fact bringing back the very first form of money that humanity had forgotten long ago, which is keeping track of every trade in order to se balances for everyone, only the tools have changed.",1605207214,5,1

jsz97u,ShldVBoughtBitcoin,Bitcoin just hit the “Daddy actually came home after 2 years of searching for cigarettes at a liquor store” price pattern,"This is a pattern I like to call the “Daddy actually came home after over 2 years of searching for cigarettes to at a liquor store” Price Pattern.

It’s when Bitcoin recovers back to a price it hasn’t seen in on average over 2 years since dropping from a previous all time high. Not the all time high price itself, but a price on the way down during the drop from an all time high. It’s a price many lose hope in ever returning after the drop, and believe will never happen again because of how long it’s been gone. The price itself feels like a father who left for “cigarettes” long ago, who you never expect to return. 

And just like in that situation, the kids tell themselves that if their dad ever did return, they’d they’d be so happy and excited to see him that they would do everything so he never leaves again. 
And that’s exactly what happens to Bitcoin’s market when this pattern emerges. The market gets so excited to see it return, that it sends itself into a supply shock, and demand explosion frenzy that makes Bitcoin run up in price at record levels and rates for as long as a year+. 
An endless loop that always repeats itself thanks to the halving and Bitcoin’s finite 21 million total Bitcoin supply network causing an endless feedback loop of price and stability increase attracting new buyers, traders, and hodlers growing demand for this infinitely finite asset. A perfect balance.


Back in November 2016, that price was $700, and it had not been seen in over 2 years since last appeared way back in February 2014, dropping from a $1,300 all time high price reached 2 months prior in December 2013. 

Every time this happens, the market gets excited and it triggers up to over a year long bull run to discover a new all time high price. This will happen again, and I suspect it will happen throughout 2021, possibly spilling into the start of 2022 before correcting, and restarting the cycle.

Too see this price chart pattern throughout all of Bitcoin’s history, check out this video:

https://youtu.be/C0Woc1JjsLI

It reminded me of this pattern I had completely forgotten about since it last happened in 2016, and the $700 price return in November 2016 after a 2 year hiatus lead into the year long 2017 run up to $20k",1605203337,6,1

Remember that you won't have complete privacy if your coins come from an exchange with KYC, that they can still be tracked to your identity. In order to break that link you would have to perform a Coinjoin using wallets like Samourai or Wasabi.

However, leaking your IP is also a way in which your operations can be tracked down to your identity, so it is great that Trezor has incorporated the option to run the traffic through Tor, helps increase privacy a bit, I think it should be a default option but unfortunately it isn't, so make sure you have it enabled (at the top right).

I have a notebook full of seed phrases (15 or so) that had been used for various wallets over the years, possibly using different BIP protocols. I don't actively use most of the wallets anymore, but can't help but wonder if some may have orphaned unspent txs. For example, perhaps at some point I sent to the wrong address, or someone donated to an address I had published somewhere months ago and forgotten about. It'd be great if there was a tool that I could enter all my old seed phrases in, and it'd check all relevant/possible BIP standards, address/wallet types (segwit and legacy), and show/alert me if anything was left unspent (or gets btc sent to it in the future). Even better if it could look across major blockchains. I know BIP standards are evolving and often not fully followed, so ideally it'd aggressively try all major standards for each seed phrase archived (almost like a master collection of all major protocols/implementations). For maintaining link privacy of previous transactions, it would ideally run on bitcoin core or a full node (obviously not possible to check all blockchains and maintain privacy of address association).

That would allow me to have some closure with my growing list of seed phrases that I now no longer have original wallets (nor do I need them).

I think this is close to what I'm looking for, but ideally a tool that would auto check all protocol implementations that this site lists, for all my seed phrases. [https://walletsrecovery.org/](https://walletsrecovery.org/)",1605312571,0,1

jtq8mg,prayank_23,Censorship by mining pools,"Question is not an attempt to spread misinformation or FUD instead I want to understand the things involved.

Recently one mining pool announced that they will censor some transactions. I don't agree with everything mentioned in the below link:

&gt; Miners have invested a lot of money in the mining hardware, data centers, they are paying electricity and taxes – especially large mining operations. They are mostly not cypherpunks.

http://web.archive.org/web/20201113141511/https://juraj.bednar.io/en/blog-en/2020/11/12/how-could-regulators-successfully-introduce-bitcoin-censorship-and-other-dystopias/

**How can we avoid a situation in which most of the mining pools follow some compliance which censors few bitcoin transactions?**

Also curious to know why do miners have so much control in a decentralized network to exclude few transactions? Is game theory the only possible solution for this problem?

This tweet by Murch also shows that miners will never allow low fee transactions even if many nodes and users want to use fee rate below 1 sat/vbyte? https://twitter.com/murchandamus/status/1326741966852386816

One user is waiting for miners to include a non-standard transaction: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20178

Recently someone was discussing about a premium in bitcoin price traded on non-kyc exchanges. Will privacy in bitcoin transactions be also at a premium and users will have to pay more fees for coinjoin transactions?

How does stratum v2 help in censorship resistance?

jup1zg,PatriotCrypto905,Threats to Bitcoin's Scarcity *Discussion*,"First off, I would say that moving to anything resembling the following practices will result in the decline of scarcity in bitcoin and ruin the market value after this impending bull run:

&amp;#x200B;

1. USDT:

USD Tether (a stable coin in crypto world) is supposed to be pegged to $1 at all times. In theory, it's a great way to avoid huge swings in volatility. The issue is a time ago, they changed their statement from all USDT was back by $1 of real world currency at any time. To its new statement which basically reads that it is now backed by less than a dollar. This sparking a huge controversy about over printing the supply or straight up printing more than you have to control markets for short/long periods of time. Basically anything involving manipulating the markets to better themselves and their ""cartel."" 

UPDATE:  We are waiting for the law to pass a decision on USDT. If they are deemed unlawful or a scam. We could see the markets plummet indefinitely due to the fact that tether props up A VERY HUGE PERCENTAGE of the markets in the first place. Also on a coin flip, letting them continue printing whenever they feel like it is just as bad in the long as well.

&amp;#x200B;

2.  Fractional Reserve and Bitcoin:

If bitcoin was to be fractional reserved and lent accordingly, we could end up with a total supply so bogus that it will actually put an end to scarcity entirely. This could allow the government(s) full control over the whole crypto ecosystem. All the alt coins would be at Bitcoins demise if they could choose to add more or take away at any time. This would cause alts to crash and lose massive value that they gain while bitcoin is ""forever"" growing (Satoshi's plan to help stop financial tyranny.)

Add that in with future markets (looking at you oil) and you could see bitcoin being tamed but only let loose with volatility when the government felt like it.  Then they can claim its just crypto and it's volatile. Not a fun road to go down because. . . THIS IS HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ALL ARE TODAY! Look up fractional reserve lending online and once you understand how it works you will realize why we are trillions upon trillions in debt.  Basically the FED made USA take out a proverbial ""credit card,"" that we can't pay the interest off. The reason why is because our government (this is a HIGHLY debated topic,) has 3 big issues.

&amp;#x200B;

FRAC. SUB Statement 

1.  It doesn't have a balanced budget.

&amp;#x200B;

FRAC. SUB Statement 

2. Military spending, ""black budget"" or not, is ridiculous. 

&amp;#x200B;

FRAC. SUB Statement 

3. DUMPING TRILLIONS into failed companies and businesses to keep them afloat.  While led by bad practices and poor financial choices that should cause them to fail and go bankrupt like everyone else. ESPECIALLY LARGE CORPORATION AND BANKS!!! Meaning they know when they give them the bail out they will just go bankrupt again indefinitely. 

I also have to add in that this is the exact REASON WHY BITCOIN WAS INVENTED! To fight this exact issue. Over printing the monetary supply / hence the term is called ""fractional reserve lending."" Which brings us to our last point. . .

&amp;#x200B;

3. PAYPAL has began printing paper bitcoin which is basically the same as number two. They are artificially increasing the supply which if left unchallenged will become the norm of many fortune 500 companies who will set up shop in this fashion. Please I urge everyone to see that the ELITE (whoever you call them...) has started its attack on bitcoin and I believe this will be the plan: 

&amp;#x200B;

(THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE)

&amp;#x200B;

1. The Elite and Wall street are frantically buying up as much bitcoin as they can. The next part would be suppress people from entering or learning about the space because they probably can't prevent this bull run because of one reason. .  . They have to much skin in the game at the moment, however once we peak at our new all time high ($100,000 - $300,000 only guessing.) Youtube is a great example of the suppression going on by shadow banning people or straight up banning someone in the first place with little to no reason. This is so people don't have main stream access to this life changing asset class.

 They already removed some of the biggest exchanges so they don't have to worry about them selling or manipulating the price and messing with their affairs. During the time, after all time high, i feel they will sell or will have sold after the alt run. I can't say if the alt run will have happen or not, because soon after all time high and it looks questionable I predict they will announce USD tether is unlawful or a scam and send bitcoin and alts in a very big death spiral indefinitely. 

&amp;#x200B;

HOW I FEEL:  The reason why I am so passionate about bitcoin and the space is because I have been in it for almost 10 years. It has changed my life for the better. I bought my first house with most of the proceeds and live a comfortable life (not rich, but good.) I just want everyone to have the same experience I had and realized this was made for us, by a man whom wanted us to decouple from a flawed monetary system that just drains people money, and their soul.

The dollar can barely buy anything and the lower class all but struggles to live, while the 1% (now smaller percentage) owns 99% of all the money supply. How did we let this happen??? That's another story for another time. The real question is. . .

&amp;#x200B;

Will you let this continue to happen with Bitcoin???

&amp;#x200B;

But it seems there are 2 things that would make each successive halving have less of an impact on Bitcoin:


1: As time passes more Bitcoin are mined, and so the amount of Bitcoin that comes from the “block reward” has less of an inpact on the overall supply.

2: Because each halving is a halving of the last halving, the reduction in block reward is smaller in absolute terms.

jv5y0v,ux041,Do not use Bitgo AT ALL!," Some cryptocurrency custody services like Bitgo allow users to make wallets. Introducing this feature to regular users, not institutional ones, questions the self-control nature of the cryptocurrency world, so my story begins here.

I am using Bitgo to store my bitcoins since 2017 until I noticed my account is closed by Bitgo (actually frozen for 40 years) without any prior explanation. When I tried to contact their support, they closed every single ticket with no reply. So I decided to get back into the file they gave me when I registered first and opened wallet. I had ensured company reputation and wallet explanation during register that backup given file could recover my savings but I was Wrong.

After trying to use Bitgo [recovery tools](https://github.com/BitGo/wallet-recovery-wizard/releases/download/v2.6.5/BitGoWalletRecoveryWizard.Setup.2.6.5.exe) with the given backup file, It did not work out so I decided to read more about their protocols and figure out how this service works. So I found that they are using MultiSig with 2 of 3 threshold need to open the wallet. Keys were split between me, Bitgo and a KRS (Key recovery service) called Keyternal. This was not what I registered for and they were not mentioned any KRS back then so I thought I own bitcoins just by carrying the file. Anyway, I have my own key and need to get it signed by Bitgo or Keyternal. Bitgo is not even answering emails or tickets and Keyternal has not done anything in past 3 weeks. So I'm stuck between these two companies trying to get out my assets, though Keyternal does not look like a proper company (you can tell it from viewing their [website](https://keytern.al/)).

My final advice to you is to not use Bitgo AT ALL. They make you feel you have full access to your wallet and one day you become aware of the BIG MISTAKE you made.",1605529694,21,16

jv5ms3,AnthonyDawnwalker,My wife and I are full time converts after paying for our unexpected car repairs with Bitcoin funds. Now I’m looking to upgrade from my Ledger Nano S but need some advice.,"I’ve had the nano a for around 3 years now and I’ve been happy with it.
I’d like to upgrade as I see the Nano X is now available and I like that I can track my portfolio and use the X with the Ledger Live app straight from my phone.

Having done some research it looks like the Ledger isn’t the only option and I’ve read a lot about the Coldcard which looks pretty cool.
I see a lot of people saying that ledger isn’t actually all that secure and that coldcard is the best option but it depends on your needs.

My needs are that I will be buying Bitcoin every week in small increments and just want to store it. I currently buy on Coinbase and wait until I have enough that makes the fees worth sending it my nano S.
I really like the usability of the live app as I like to see what’s going on.

I’ve seen people say you can use the coldcard with a wallet app but how well does that work? I’d like to see my exact holdings without having to start up my PC.

Or are there any better options? The Opendime looks really cool but I understand it’s limitations as far as having to puncture it to transfer off of it.

In an ideal world I’d like a solution that is secure, easy to use on iOS without needing a pc, low fees transferring to it and not hugely expensive to buy the device.

Any ideas?",1605528147,118,23

jv48ij,financeoptimum,The Bank for International Settlements,"The Bank for International Settlements (the BIS).

***Possibly the most powerful bank that most people haven't heard of.***

Known as the central bank for central banks.

&amp;#x200B;

The BIS was set up in Basel, Switzerland, in 1930 to facilitate World War I reparations payments from Germany.

It was partly the brainchild of Montagu Norman, the Depression-era Governor of the Bank of England.

Norman, or rather those he was representing, wanted a new bank that would serve as the world’s first *international* financial institution.

A meeting place for central bankers. 

Away from the demands of politicians and the prying eyes of nosy journalists, the bankers would bring some much needed order and coordination to the world financial system.

Norman’s proposal gained an eager advocate in Hjalmar Schacht, the Reichsbank president.

The Reichsbank was the Central Bank of the German Reich at the time.

Schacht saw the BIS as a way of easing Germany’s reparations burden, but it became far more than that:

***The BIS helped to sell gold seized by the Nazis from occupied nations and acted as a conduit of hard currency that allowed the Third Reich to buy raw materials throughout the war - to the point where Emil Puhl, the Reichsbank Vice President, described the BIS as the ""only real foreign branch"" of the Reichsbank.***

&amp;#x200B;

The BIS's morally tainted wartime experience almost sank it at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference, when Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau and lead American delegate to the conference Harry Dexter White sought to liquidate it while setting up the postwar international system dominated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

However, the BIS's powerful friends intervened to save it.

Since then the BIS has continually reinvented itself, using the Bank as a place to host a lot of the new architecture of the financial system, specifically the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).

&amp;#x200B;

[The Petrodollar Era](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjK0nRSUNgU) has had a massive impact on foreign policy.

It was the CIA who imported a new leader for the so called ""people's rebellion"" in Libya. 

Indeed, Khalifa Hafter had spent the past 20 years living with no known source of income just five miles away from the CIA's headquarters in Langley.

Cheney expressed great concern in a speech in 1999 that foreign governments were controlling oil.

***""While many regions of the world offer great oil opportunities, the Middle East, with two thirds of the world's oil and the lowest cost, is still where the prize ultimately lies.""***

Former Supreme Allied Commander Europe of Nato, from 1997 to 2000, Wesley Clark claims that in 2001, a general in the Pentagon showed him a piece of paper and said:

***""I just got this memo today or yesterday from the office of the secretary of defence upstairs. It's a, it's a five-year plan. We're going to take down seven countries in five years. We're going to start with Iraq, then Syria, Lebanon, then Libya, Somalia, Sudan, we're going to come back and get Iran in five years.""***

&amp;#x200B;

This agenda fitted perfectly with the famous think-tank called the Project for the New American Century.

So how is this all relevant to the BIS?

Well, the Libyan government controlled more of its oil than any other nation on earth and it is the type of oil that Europe finds easiest to refine - OK that seems like incentive enough to impose democracy - but there's more:

Libya also controlled its own finances.

***For the seven countries named by Clark, what did they have in common? None of them were listed among the member banks of the BIS, putting them outside the long regulatory arm of the central banker's central bank in Switzerland.***

&amp;#x200B;

What about today?

Well, naturally, the BIS is preaching about the importance of Central bank Independence.

As well as this, they have a new innovation hub, incorporating research into Central Bank Digital Currencies.

The BIS continues to operate with less disclosure than the central banks that make up its executive committee. 

Its assets are protected against seizure. 

Its process of establishing capital requirements for banks remains...opaque.

As heading says, which is the best hardware wallet? I want to get a hardware wallet for me which suits the best, so I need your help. Please! I've been knowing about Ledger Nano S so is it the only Best hardware wallet? 

Here are something about the different hardware wallets I know, please correct me if I am wrong -

1. Ledger Nano X - a bit costly for me, and have been hearing that it is being hacked most of the times.

2. Ledger Nano S - budget friendly, however have been hearing that it is not much secure. Also it isn't mobile friendly 

3. Safepal S1 - fits all my needs, is budget friendly (40$), has connection with Mobile, supports all crypto, but it is from **China and I don't think Chinese marketplace is good. Also, I don't know how secure is this? Please I need help with this one**

4. Coldcard - hmm, I didn't like it Structure. Also is a bit costly for me.

5. Trezor - have been hearing that it can be hacked

6. Secux - is good but don't know how secure it is.


**Please this is my opinion on various hardware wallets. I need your help, and I have never ordered anything from outside so I also don't know how it will arrive. I am from Nepal so also don't know if they will be able to reach to my country. I don't have credit card so I can use only crypto to pay them. Please help me. And if it is under 60$ I can happily buy it, if it's not I'll still try to buy it. I also don't know about VAT and taxes. If there are other hardware wallets, please tell me that** or if there is a website or a doc which compares all the wallets, it will be good for me.

I know I asked you lots and lots of question. But answer to atleast one of them will make me happy.

Thanks you very much for the replies in advance! r/bitcoin and r/BitcoinBeginners are the only two place where I can seek help and I highly appreciate it.",1605509077,96,12

Now that they have said that all gains are taxed, I'm starting to think its almost easier to just purchase GBTC in one of my brokerage accounts (Roth Ira) where I will never have to pay tax on those gains.  I certainly know its not the ideal way to purchase, but the thought of not paying tax on the gains if it goes from 17k to 200k somewhat balances that back out.

jvqo9o,Envrin,Open Source Sponsorship Opportunity,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of an unconventional message, but let's see what happens.  I'm creator of Apex at [https://apexpl.io/](https://apexpl.io/), a powerful open source software platform that is designed to rival Wordpress, which I promise you it will in the near future.  If you're technically savvy, feel free to check out how smooth, effortless and professional dployment is by doing a quick Docker install by following the instructions within the top section at:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've already managed to get Apex sponsored by none other than [https://digitalocean.com/](https://digitalocean.com/), and am currently looking for one or two more sponsors.  Do you have a legit business or web site that you would like additional advertising and exposure for?  Would love to list you on the Sponsors page at:

[https://apexpl.io/sponsors](https://apexpl.io/sponsors)

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, would also be more than happy to give you a shoutout on all future Youtube videos that will start coming out very shortly (100+ over the next \~4 months) which will be professionally edited (have a video editor lined up), and be happy to pitch your products / services to any of our clients where appropriate and there is synergy.

&amp;#x200B;

You can get a better idea of who I am by viewing my resume at:

[https://apexpl.io/Resume\_Matt\_Dizak.pdf](https://apexpl.io/Resume_Matt_Dizak.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also proud owner and creator of Envrin Group at [https://envrin.com/](https://envrin.com/), my bitcoin software operation.  There's online demos on there such as at:  [https://demo.envrin.com/admin/](https://demo.envrin.com/admin/) so you can see the software.  I've been developing Bitcoin related software for about 9 years now, and will be happy to stand behind this software as it is quality, secure, and clean.

&amp;#x200B;

Sponsor me, and I'd be happy to either, provide you with an unlimited distributor account so you can sell unlimited licenses yourself, or if you'd prefer, I'd be open to the fact of open sourcing all those commercial bitcoin packages (menus PayMail integration, as that one is somewhat exclusive).  You'd be an excellent sponsor and proponent of both, open source software and crypto-currency combined.

&amp;#x200B;

Last quick note of a personal nature, unsure if this matters any, but I went 100% blind four years ago (Sept 15th, 2016 to be exact).  Nothing disease related, just fell one day in my backyard and hit my head in the wrong spot.  Without question this has been the longest and hardest journey of my life, but I managed to get it done.  I retained myself, and got Apex done without even being able to see the screen.  The whole point of Apex is to help others, whether they're entrepreneurs or developers / designers, which is especially cruicial during this time of KoVid.

&amp;#x200B;

After about 3 years of training, development, and perfecting, Apex is 99.5% done.  I feel as though I'm at the last mile of a 20,000 mile marathon race, and I promise you Apex will work and work well.  This will turn into a thriving open source software initiative, as I won't give up until it does.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have a business / site you want to advertise on the Apex sponsors page and get shourt outs for via Youtube / social media, it would be greatly appreciated.  Please reach out to me at [matt.dizak@gmail.com](mailto:matt.dizak@gmail.com).  Thank you.

I'm currently attempting to replicate GetWork in PHP, mainly to gain an understanding of how it all works. So far I've managed to replicate:

* Generation of Data in the payload
* Calculation of Target to and from PDiff and BDiff
* Block Mining
* Block Validation
* Retargetting

The bit I'm working on now, and struggling with, is MidState. Now I know MidState is no longer used, however as I mention this is all about me gaining understanding of how it all works/worked.

Rather than using the built in PHP functions, which don't support midstate, I've instead attempted to modify a class I found on GitHub: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duoshuo/duoshuo-wordpress/master/duoshuo/nanoSha2.php](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duoshuo/duoshuo-wordpress/master/duoshuo/nanoSha2.php)

My code so far is located here: [https://gist.github.com/cr0bar/54d90b9b19f0b01f5a5b4f39b79a4467](https://gist.github.com/cr0bar/54d90b9b19f0b01f5a5b4f39b79a4467)

Basically I've created a new function named ""midstate"" and attempted to replicate some C# code I found here: [https://github.com/MithrilMan/bitcoin-sha256/blob/master/Sha256.cs](https://github.com/MithrilMan/bitcoin-sha256/blob/master/Sha256.cs)

I've tried playing with the endianness of the block data and the output hash but I don't anything that even loosely looks like the expected output.

I would really appreciated any pointers, and I'm really sorry if this is the wrong sub-reddit.

Thanks in advance. :)",1605605492,5,4
jvq5k7,w_ayne_,BTC should not be currency,"BTC is often criticised for small size blocks, slow tps, fees too high etc.

I have been thinking about its positioning of late and I would like to argue BTC does not need to change any of that. BTCs natural position is an investment asset class period, similar to gold, but sometimes we hear of discussion of BTC as a trading currency and I think that is a mistake. I don't believe BTC should try to be a trading currency, it should just solidify its position as a modern day investment asset. It is perfectly positioned for that and nothing else. 

My only concern with BTC is mining pools being concentrated in certain regions. I don't know how that can be improved so it is more decentralised.

UPDATE: while I don't dispute that BTC can be used as currency, I don't believe it will be a major currency for everyday transactions, other cryptos will most likely surpass it.",1605605461,20,0

Think about it, the average person right now does HODL something - cash. They HODL cash until they want / need to spend it on goods or services. 

In the near future, Bitcoin has the potential to play that role - people will HODL until they need to “cash out” some to spend it on an economic good or service. 

So the ultimate point of HODL is not to sell later on for cash profit, but it’s teaching us to save and spend when we actually want to consume, knowing that we will not only keep the value we have stored, but be rewarded for it with higher purchasing power in the future.

I full well understand that a lot of people get into Bitcoin to make profit (profit denoted in fiat), but I believe many more will stay with Bitcoin because it will be the primary way they are able to save.

To a generation of burrowers and spenders, Bitcoin teaches us to save.",1605589377,22,39

jw1h9q,j0-hn-dea-ux,Question about coinbase pro and hot wallets which arent an exchange,"Ive recently moved my relatively small bitcoin holdings from coinbase over to coinbase pro and begun DCA, but now that bitcoin is taking off again and causing more frequent coinbase pro crashes im considering moving to another wallet. But i don't want to pay a fortune in transactions etc and plan to move again to a cold wallet eg electrum once its worthwhile to pay the 80 bucks or so to get one.

So should i stick it out until i get a cold wallet or is there a hot wallet i can switch to for the meantime?
Also from my understanding you hold the keys for a cold wallet but do you hold the keys for a hot wallet? 

Any advice appreciated, for info i currently use the app on my android phone, but could use a laptop for the cold/hot wallet if its needed.",1605647143,16,3

The gains after similar stacking was surprisingly similar (identical). This was nice to notice, and it kinda makes me feel like we're all late-2016 guys with varying stack sizes about to experience 2017 all over again. Next year is gonna be amazing! =D

jvz4bt,heptagon_h,Waiting for Dip?,"There wont be one. Please debate. My core arguments:

1. A bunch of institutions buying into bitcoin are not 'weak hands'. Making a decision to turn trash-cash in the hundreds of millions into cold storage bitcoin is not done to 'trade' and get more trash-cash
2. Guys like Fidelity &amp; Grayscale are scooping up bitcoin by the hour. The former is using it as another asset in a wide portfolio. The latter is using it as a primary investment vehicle. I'm not sure why they would ever sell
3. Guys like Paypal, Robinhood are held by law to purchase bitcoin for their clients rather than offer an equity paper. So all consumer buys are backed with real bitcoin. Sure consumers will sell and have 'weak hands' but would paypal and robinhood liquidate the bitcoin is yet to be determined - they can instead hold a long position and pay the weak hands retail investor with trash-cash
4. Scarcity of bitcoin is still not understood. It appears to me that 'there will always be a buyer' once institutions have arrived. Anyone who's selling bitcoin for cash doesnt yet understand wealth. Bitcoin as collateral offers both the ability to continue HODLINg, get trash-cash for any expenses, not pay capital gains tax and the collateral value simply grows continuously.

Please tell me why I am wrong. I'm trying to beat my own rationale

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: There are some great responses about why taking profit makes sense. But I have to say I disagree with any pattern matching of the 2017 bull run. Its very clear that this time its different with the number of institutions &amp; banks getting involved. Clearly these folks are buying in after much approval and process internally and drive their thesis using some other ideas.

The scammers managed to get me to convert my money into BTC, which unfortunately I did before realising it was a scam. My question now is, seeing as I was the one who actually did the transaction, am I in posession of this bitcoin? I have no experience with this at all so I don't really know how it works. I have emailed the company that it was purchased through and explained the situation, she explained that the money can't be converted back to dollar value, but she was unable to provide me any more information about whether I have access to this Bitcoin or not or how to use it because of privacy issues. The only info I have is the code for the wallet (?) It was put into and the order number for my purchase. I didn't make an account with this website or anything like that so I don't have a place to login and look at my data or anything (not sure if that's even something that is usually done or not).  Apologies if this doesn't make sense or if my terminology is incorrect, as I said I have no experience with this and very minimal knowledge on how it all works. Thanks.

Reason is, i could not locate such level of details in some reading I have done in the past few years, since the 12 / 24 words got implemented ....

jwonht,PBislev,"Patience, selfcontrol, education and riskmanagement is the key to succes","I started my crypto journey in january 2018 with buying bitcoin, xrp and eth at high levels. I remember the first XRP i bought at 1.6$ thinking it would make me a millionaire buying the dip in a parabolic rise. At the time the community was so driven, greedy and there were so many moonboys shilling every single coin they could find. I went full retard when the fomo was at it's absolutte peak in january 2018. 

The first two years I continued to accumulate bitcoin and other crypto projects I believed in. The despair peaked when i was down somewhere between 80-90%. At times I was anxious bitcoin would blow up and never be appreciated again. I was afraid of a death spiral if miners would capitulate and drag the entire network down with it. I was afraid of tether imploding. I feared the energy consumption of the network would cause legal actions from politicians. 

Despite being in doubt, I continued to educate myself about bitcoin's potential. I had plenty of time to sell with a loss and transfer my money back to my account - at times I wonder if i should just do it and get over with it. Yet, I didn't only stay - i kept investing despite loosing more money. By the time i got more patience and aware of price movements. Market is tough to time, but I bought at a bigger retracement rather than at fomo times. Last time I bought some bitcoin was when it hit 5k in spring. Being in the red for two straight years is tough for everybody, yet i never lost hope that bitcoin someday would rise again. 

What's the catch? I know that many people are fomoing in to buy crypto and there are many moonboys predicting bitcoin to go to 100k, 200k or more. We don't know when bitcoin will top. This parabolic rise can continue for much longer. You are not a millionaire tomorrow, because you just found the holy grail. 

Tip: If you are new and decide to buy, because you fear of missing out: please be aware that nobody knows what would happen and your investment could easily plummet 40% within the next couple of months. Please be aware that crypto is volatile and you don't want to be at the wrong side of the market when it tanks if you cannot tolerate a loss - if it tanks: don't be in a high risk alt coin if you fear volatility. 

Tip 2: You need to have patience, confidence and have good nerves, otherwise you would likely sell when bitcoin retraces and makes a dip - most people loss money investing. Many people panic sell to avoid more losses. Think of how many people sold bitcoin at 4,5 and 6k in the spring, thinking bitcoin would die because of pandemic fear (look at the massive trading volume at tradingview). This is when I accumulated more bitcoin. 

Tip 3: You have to believe in bitcoin. Why is a great investment? It is hard money that cannot be printed. It cannot be sanctioned in the entire world unless you shut down the internet. It is the first global peer to peer system, and the network has never been more secure than it is. If you truely believe bitcoin can change the world then stop being affraid of loosing money in the short term - keep hodling your investment. 

After two years. I am finally at 50+% profit despite being 80-90% down. 

Lastly: I wanna thank the community for keeping me in the space.",1605734225,14,21

Long story short: I bought btc on that massive pump in 2017. End of 2018 I had 2 choices become homeless or sell the only thing I owned and keep a roof over my head.   


I had always said I'd never sell my btc. ""I'd go homeless first!"" Ha! When homelessness became an actual possibility ... you find out where your priorities actually are. It was just as btc was capitulating down to 3-4 k region (timing ... I know). 

&amp;#x200B;

I held out as long as I could. I maxed out credit cards. I liquidated the small 401k I had. I submitted hundreds of resumes. I ate flour &amp; water pancakes for months. It was inevitable, I had to sell my btc; right around 4k if memory serves.  


My job is not steady and dependent upon tips. Couldn't come up with $$$ to get back into btc especially during these lockdowns. I was trying but btc decided to run up without me.

jwm77m,heptagon_h,"The parallels of fine art, Bitcoin &amp; Shitcoins","If you investigate into the behaviors of the super rich you come across some startling counterintuitive mechanics. 

When the super rich buy fine art, they do so to capture wealth in a rare asset. So why aren't they buying bitcoin as quickly as fine art gets scooped up? To understand why, here is the super-rich's fine-art purchase playbook.

The TL;DR is : the super rich prefer items that are expensive and visible. So they are unlikely to buy bitcoin when its ""cheap"" and they are unlikely to buy shitcoins.

Fine art playbook:

1. If you have a choice between something cheap and something expensive, buy the expensive art. Art appreciates much faster at the high end. Find the expensive art and then negotiate a discount if you can. But if it is something really great, expect to pay a premium—not to get a discount.
2. Buy art that is highly visible—by artists who are being written about *in print*, not just online. In the major art magazines. Read those magazines. Stay away from the stuff they did when they were 12 years old that's for sale on ebay. Buy a Picasso that is immediately identifiable as a Picasso. From all the way across the room.
3. Buy from a reputable art dealer. Be loyal to that dealer once you find one. Get your dealer to investigate auction paintings and bid on your behalf for a fee if you decide to bid. Ask your dealer's opinion of paintings being offered by other dealers. Be loyal. If you decide to sell something, give it to your dealer to sell. 
4. Buy art that has been exhibited. In fact, it is great to buy art that has been used to promote the exhibition the piece was in.
5. Do not buy art in the towns where you go to ski or surf. Tourists always overpay for art in places like Aspen or Waikiki. All that fun makes them too free with their money. Buy your art in cities that have major art fairs and world-famous museums. In LA or New York for instance. Where buyers are more knowledgeable and more careful. Or perhaps in your home town, if there's a well-travelled dealer there who you trust.
6. Keep all the paperwork on the art you buy. The magazine ad for the show you saw it at. The invoice from when it was sold 20 years ago. Letters. Postcards showing the piece. The gallery's brochure or business card. Auction catalogs. Keep it all. Art appreciates in value faster when it is well-documented. Attach some or all of this stuff to the back of the painting, maybe in a plastic pouch attached to the frame. 
7. Most of all—buy for the long haul. Do not expect that your painting will go up in value in a year or two. 

Now apply that playbook to Bitcoin, because its very likely that the super rich will treat bitcoin as a collectible and fine art, before they realize that it is a programmable money",1605726851,2,0
jwm41s,Raverrevolution,You don't need to own a full coin,"I keep seeing lots of posts about people worried that the price is going up so much that they'll never get a chance to own a full coin.

We need to take a step back and look at the psychology of this and why people are coming up with this thought.

First of all the word ""Bitcoin"" contains the word ""coin"" in it.  What we typically refer to as coins these days makes us think that they should be cheap and you should be able to obtain them very easily.  The reason this is even like this is because the USD (I'm in the US so using our money as example) has constantly been inflating forever making 1 dollar the standard choice of use.  40 years ago coins could still buy you something so they didn't always come with a cheap connotation to them.

Secondly once you get past the name you need to come to the realization that 1 Bitcoin = 100,000,000 sats.  At the point of mass adoption the general public will be lucky to even have 1,000 sats given that people can't even come up with $400 emergency money.  Right now $1 USD buys you 5,591 sats.  20 years from now when you tell someone that you had the chance to get that many sats for a dollar they will be SOOOOOOOO jealous.  Meanwhile now you're stressing you don't have 100,000,000.

Stressing at that is the same as someone getting upset that they don't have 1 billion dollars now.  Wouldn't you be more than fine with 20 million now?  Hell, you could live a great life with 2 million alone.  If the answer is yes then 20,000,000 sats (0.2 bitcoin = $3,569) should make you filthy rich in the future.

Last, but not least you have to understand that 1 Bitcoin is literally just a label (an amount, a unit of measure) and not what's transacting through the network.  For example in comparison we have pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, etc..  I can give you 5 pennies or give you 1 nickel.  On the bitcoin network the only thing that's transacting are sats.  Sending a bitcoin is sending many sats.  It's ONLY sats.  1 Bitcoin is merely just a label, not an actual ""coin"" per se.",1605726598,350,85

Much of the reasonable and very large moves are patiently waiting on the sidelines. They have strategies like: if the weekly average holds 20K buy 10 BTC.

For many of the super rich, 50K is a comfortable floor price to get in and secure 10 bitcoin. $500K is chump change lol. Technology workers in Silicon valley make that much in a year. Their manager gets a 200K bonus. Despite that they struggle to buy a home with a backyard because that costs &gt; 3 million in Palo Alto

They are in no rush with wealth spread across plenty of real estate around the world, stocks and lots of money lying wastefully in the bank. For them picking up 10 BTC is a simple move, at the right time.

You're diversifying across shitcoins, or planning to save up for your big purchase. They are diversifying across the million dollar asset holdings so they can casually claim that they have a ""small"" position (10 BTC) in bitcoin when they serve up the 4000$ vintage wine to their rich friends while dining at their million dollar home in Thailand where they are currently spending the winter in lockdown.",1605723032,58,19

jx1sc0,smoms_mckensie,A concern about seizure of bitcoin by law enforcement,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to raise this concern, since it is a somewhat technical question about the law as it stands in several different countries. Still, I think it highlights an issue that some people here might be concerned about.

Here's the scenario. Someone, Alice say, owns a bitcoin that she got through some activity that is illegal in the USA (or some other country that has enough power to enforce its laws globally). For simplicity let's imagine that she stole it from David. Alice sells this bitcoin to Bob on an anonymous exchange, but Bob has no idea that the bitcoin was stolen.

Bob lives in the UK (or some other country that requires cryptocurrency brokers to hold copies of the IDs of people trading) and holds the bitcoin for several years. Eventually he signs up to a nice legally compliant UK cryptocurrency brokerage because he wants to sell his bitcoin. To sell via the brokerage he has to provide lots of ID (the UK has ""know your customer"" laws to prevent money laundering). Now Bob sells the bitcoin via his broker to Carol who has also supplied ID to the brokerage.

Now the FBI catches up with Alice and she supplies them with information on her bitcoin wallets. The FBI can see on the public ledger that the stolen bitcoin was sold by Bob's wallet to Carol's wallet, although they don't yet know who Bob and Carol are. Perhaps already, or in the near future, the UK-USA will share a database of wallets whose owners are known (every time you give your ID to a brokerage you are effectively adding to this database). The FBI consults this database and sees that Carol owns this stolen bitcoin. They have Carol's ID, and conceivably her address.

Since Carol purchased stolen goods, under UK law it seems (see a random article I found here: [https://www.fsp-law.com/buying-stolen-property-some-cautionary-tales/](https://www.fsp-law.com/buying-stolen-property-some-cautionary-tales/)) that Carol does not legally own the bitcoin, and must return it. She could sue the brokerage, but because Bob had no idea the bitcoin was stolen presumably the brokerage would be found to have acted in good faith and there would be no liability. She could sue Bob perhaps. Ultimately either Carol or Bob is going to lose out.

So, it seems to me that Bitcoins could be ""tainted"" with historical illegal activity that the current holder has no knowledge about, and that as law enforcement gets increasingly sophisticated in the way that they trace transactions, the current holder could have that bitcoin seized at some point in the future.

1. Have I missed something in my analysis? Different countries will have different laws about ownership of stolen goods that have been resold, but there are at least some countries (the UK for example) where ownership remains with the original owner, and the global nature of bitcoin trading means this is a potential problem for everyone who holds bitcoin. We don't know the providence of the bitcoin we hold.
2. Have I misunderstood something about tracing transactions on the blockchain?
3. Assuming I've not misunderstood something, and this is a legitimate concern, is there a way out of this? I can't see one if you want to follow laws on ID, tax reporting etc while hold bitcoin longterm, except mining your own coins. If you sell your bitcoin, buy an anonymised coin like Monero, then use the Monero to buy a bitcoin again, you'll still have the same problem that your new bitcoins could be tainted.",1605788776,14,2

jx1ohy,zoli0506,"Bitcoin is the world's most pristine asset and it's still early in its life stage. If you buy today, you are an early adopter.","As it stands today, bitcoin represents roughly few basis points of all assets, and roughly 10 basis points of total tradeable assets. Bitcoin is still a niche thing. 

In the next decade  $230 trilion dollar worth investment will need to find new investment. Assuming a small percent of this will huge base will flow to bitcoin we can see double or even triple digit rate of return per year.

It's a hedge against bad governance like gold, but it is harder (Bitcoin is the hardest asset in the world and the stock-to-flow ratio will be infinite), with much bigger upside because it's in an early life stage. (You can go to zero, but the upside is indefinite, it has a huge asymmetry, a powerful investment concept).

&amp;#x200B;

Let's see what is happening these days in the world, seperate the signal from noise and see clearly.

Most important trends today, in the beginning of the new decade:

&amp;#x200B;

Monetary/Economic:

\- Central banks policy: Decreasing interest rates and rapidly increasing monetary base. (Throughout  the history we can positive correlation in the price of gold and monetary base, that will be true for bitcoin as well.)

\- Fiscal dominance in the Western world's policy. (Goverments will spend a lot of money, debt will increase)

\- Questionable future of dollar as a reserve currency as US share of world GDP declines. (This is a longer term (15-20 years+) trend, we are nowhere close to the end of dollars reserve currency status, but it's imortant to consider as well.)

\- Huge inflation of financial assets (Bond, equity prices are already record high, future yields are somewhat limited, which is great for bitcoin)

\- Disinflation in CPI terms and slowing velocity of money. (Bad for economic growth)

\- Deflation of wages (We can expect more aid and ""stimulus checks"" )

\- Debt-liquidity spiral, solvency issues of corporations. (There are a lot of indebted, zombie companies in the US and the rest of the world, policy makers won't let them go bankrupt, because the dominoes would start falling, so that's another factor with points to more expected liquidity)

&amp;#x200B;

Political/Social

\- US - China superpower competition and deglobalization. (It could be more difficult in the future to move financial assets in a bipolar or trippolar world, bitcoin helps, also US will print a lot to maintain it's military superiority in the Indo-Pacific)

\- Technology, monopolies and it's job/small business destroying effect (Again we wil see more paychecks straight to people's pockets and small buisnesses)

\- Wealth Unequality (For a lot of people it will be a peaceful revolution against the system)

\- Political populism, Social unrest is on the table - Bitcoin is great hedge against it: someone could hold a knife to your throat and they still couldn't take your net worth in minutes. Also governments can't confiscate bitcoin, it's totally decentralized, they would have to kill the internet to stop it)

\- Ageing society in the western world and the incoming pension fund crisis. (The average public pension plan is assuming a 7.22% annualized return going forward. I seriously doubt this target will be met. Older people will increasingly look for store of value options.)

&amp;#x200B;

All in all i think in the year of 2020 every trend helpful for bitcoin. Lots of politicians/CEO/coproration and institutions buying it up, and they have a huge sway on policy makers, The smart money/macro investors are buying it up right now which is also a good indicator that buying bitcoin is a great opportunity and it also has a huge network effect so other cryptos will have an impossible task go dethrone it.

To receive market escrow refund, a site's guide said to use multisig, I should fill in the field labelled ""bitcoin public key for multisig"" in its account settings. And it said I should go to https://coinb.in/#newAddress to create that key. 

Does this make sense? Or have I misread the instructions somehow? 

And how to I use the BTC that gets returned as a refund? Does the above just create a sort of wallet? What's the difference between https://coinb.in/#newAddress and a wallet to mean I couldn't just use my wallet for the multisig public key? I'm guessing all the multisig aspects are done on their server so the field ""bitcoin public key for multisig"" could perhaps have been rephrased as ""regular bitcoin public key for multisig""?

* SI has doubled its stock price in last 30 days. ($15 to $31)

* A key investor of IS is Digital Currency Group (DCG). DCG has invested in famous industry leaders such as Coinbase, Circle, Ledger, and Ripple. DCG also owns Coindesk, Genesis, and Grayscale.

* SI runs the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) -- which allows ""institutional investors to move U.S. dollars to digital currency exchanges and trading partners 24/7 in real time at no extra cost."" The SEN 928 digital currency clients (with 200 waiting to be onboarded), including Gemini, Genesis, Bitamp, Coinbase, LedgerX, and Kraken.

* In Q3 the SEN saw a 70% increase in transactions. That's a 455% increase from same time last year.

jxhxhr,MrBitcoinMann,Bank Account Closed for Paxful Trading,"Well, this is an omen to this post 2 weeks possibly. [https://www.reddit.com/r/paxful/comments/jn77qm/paxful\_life\_changing\_experience/](https://www.reddit.com/r/paxful/comments/jn77qm/paxful_life_changing_experience/)

Don't get me wrong Paxful is great but now I'm facing a major friggen problem. I went to get lunch today and tried using my Bank of America debit card and it was declined, so I tried to log in to online banking and it said my account was locked and to call. So I called and they told me my account was pending review and would be permanently closed and I could never again bank with Bank of America, but they would be sending me a check and the specific information on why my account was being closed in 1-2 weeks. Luckily I also bank with USAA and Ally and my life savings wasn't on hold or anything, just about $4,500 in my Bank of America account.

Recently I had been getting paranoid after reading some stuff on Reddit and withdrew a lot of money from the bank so I could have liquid cash just in case something was to go wrong like a few horror posts I have read here on Reddit, and luckily I did that just in time and don't have $10,000+ on hold. That might of been what triggered something in their system but I'm not sure, because I should be able to do whatever the hell I want with my money but I hear banks don't usually like that type of activity.

If I had to guess my KYC policy must have failed me somewhere and Bank of America's systems might have gotten flagged for fraud or money laundering, which is obviously completely not the case. But my KYC was great except for a few screw-ups that happened months ago so I kind of doubt that too, I think Bank of America just doesn't support P2P cryptocurrency trading in general as it is too high-risk and I was sent to the Risk Department on the phone call. I never traded more than $1,000 with a person in a day trying to follow the MSB laws, so I don't believe that is a problem and since they'll be sending me a check of my remaining balance I don't think they suspect I did anything illegal. Also, the account activity was pretty insane, there would be tens of thousands going in and out of my account monthly for about three months on a personal checking account, which of course probably looks very suspicious if the bank doesn't know exactly what you're doing, so maybe it's just that, but regardless the bank said I would be unable to appeal their decision. It's kind of damning that the bank never contacted me in the first place to talk about the activity or what I had done wrong, just goes and makes a decision that will affect my entire future financial life which is only getting started and can't immediately explain it. If it was a chargeback or something I wouldn't at all mind paying it to keep my account and stopping cryptocurrency trading altogether.

I should add I'm only 19 years old so even though I'm still getting my money back this is still pretty damning and highly inconvenient because for the rest of my life I will no longer be allowed to use Bank of America's services, and I don't even know the EXACT cause of this account closure yet, I can only hope my credit/other bank accounts will be fine.

I have temporarily halted my operations on Paxful whilst I deal with this big headache of a situation. I've made about $40,000 in three months so I can't really complain if this is the end of it all, it's definitely better for my future if I don't go screwing up my entire future financial life and I wish I would have known better of this risk before I even started. If I can find supportive payment processors I will be continuing though, or off-shooting the trading to happen in Italy with my soon-to-be dual citizenship and possibly the UK where my friend has dual citizenship if that's legally possible.",1605844057,11,1

Since being on Reddit, a very short time I must admit, I have noticed that the same posters continually make comments, a dozen or so on any subreddit. That got me thinking as to why that was so, especially since on many of these forums there are a hundred thousand members or more.

My conclusion after pondering that question for quite some time is that individuals are afraid of being put down if their comments differ from others. No one should feel intimated to join a discussion.

Ok, so as per my understanding... if you hold crypto for longer than a year, then sell it, profits are taxed as capital gains. If you hold for less than a year and sell, profits are taxed as income, correct? 

Scenario: let’s say I bought 0.5 BTC in September of 2019 (greater than 1 year) and then another 0.5 BTC in March of 2020( less than 1 year). If I sell 0.5 BTC tomorrow, will that be counted as the BTC I bought in September or in March? If I sell all BTC tomorrow, will half get taxed as income and the other half as capital gains? How do we track which BTC fractions were bought and sold when? Or do you just choose the situation that is most advantageous to you? 

Also, if I bought some BTC, then sold a few weeks later at nearly the same price (did not profit), do I still need to report those transactions?

Here are the most popular objections I hear these days. I generally answer them individually however if I really want someone to get involved, I have a 100% sure fire way of getting them on-board which I’ll add at the very bottom of this post.  

Q: I don’t understand it?

A: Do you understand “Hyper Text Transfer Protocol”. NO! But it doesn’t stop you from using the internet everyday. [**http**://wwwbitcoin.com](http://wwwbitcoin.com/)  Don’t let your lack of knowledge scare you from learning more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Isn’t it only used for criminal activity

A: Less than 1% of BTC circulating supply is used for nefarious proposes. It’s technically an inferior method of using it as every transaction is registered on a permanent digital “immutable” record which can be checked and sometimes traced unlike cash.   

&amp;#x200B;

Q: If I can’t touch it and it’s not tangible, how it is valuable? 

A: This is one of my favourites.…“What is the most valuable thing to you as a human being? You get many answer here ranging from “my children”, to “my morning coffee” however the most valuable thing to every human being is “air”. You cannot see it. You cannot touch it but without it you would most certainly die. Just because you cannot see or touch it doesn’t mean it doesn’t hold immense value.     

&amp;#x200B;

Q: I’ve missed the boat?

A: To be honest, I fell for this one myself in 2016. I even have a few scam and alt coins skeletons in my closet to prove it. I was always on-board with BTC but didn’t “get it’ until I read “[The Bitcoin standard](https://www.amazon.com.au/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861)” which helped me understand that what BTC started out as will most likely not be what it eventually becomes and it’s still got so far to go. It’s certainly not too late to jump on board.  

&amp;#x200B;

Q:Another altcoin will create a better product and overtake BTC. 

A: This could be debated for millennia however my view (not everyone’s) is that BTC was the first and therefore affords the luxury of the most powerful network effect (Look up [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law)). Being open course, it can be updated and upgraded with any new technology that may be the “next big thing”.  

It’s also the only truly decentralised market unlike all other coins/tokens where the founders still hold large portions of coin/tokens and are able to manipulate the future markets.  

&amp;#x200B;

Q: It’s too hard to buy/store.

A: If it was easy, everyone would already be on board and you would have most certainly missed the boat. That’s the thing with new technology, it’s doesn’t start out as a perfectly executed product. It needs to grow and evolve. The real gains are made where there is a need for real work. Most aren’t prepared to put in the work.  

&amp;#x200B;

Q:I don’t know where to buy it?

A: True story, I just had a good friend tell me yesterday that he went to buy BTC but couldn’t see it in his share trading platform so he purchased some pharmaceutical shares instead as they were going up in value? Facepalm… But this is on me to explain and ensure he doesn’t get scammed like so many other new investors.

&amp;#x200B;

So as good as all these explanations are, the best way I’ve found to get people involved is to do one simple thing.  Buy them some Bitcoin! Buy it and store if for them and send them screen shots of the value each day. Nothing motivates a person more than seeing something they own go up in value and now is a perfect time to do just that.  Sure they won’t understand the fundamentals right away but neither do most people who start their journey down the BTC rabbit hole.. 

You have to start somewhere..

jxdub4,heptagon_h,The technology of bitcoin is not the reason for its success,"Too many people think bitcoin wins because of its technical design.

Surely its an amazing invention. One of its kind. But it's not the reason it wins.

The proof of this is in the forks and the shit coins that aim to be more technically superior, and maybe, in some cases are. 

The reason Bitcoin wins is because of the network effects running the core game-theoretic effects. Bootstrapping this is hard. Impossible right now for any other coin.

Consider the effort needed to get miners to run your version of Bitcoin instead of Satoshis. Why would they do it ? 

Consider the effort needed to have people stake currency for your POS shitcoin. Why would they do it?

Consider that not only do you need to convince them to join you but they need to stay. For their own incentive. This means you need to convince the rest of the world that you will win. Even Bitcoin hasn't reached this point yet. The majority of the masses still dont get Bitcoin.

In bitcoin if miners start turning off their nodes, the incentives are clear and globally available. Any country or person with cheap energy can join in to make actual profit. How the hell do you replicate this effect in a new coin? 

On the order books you can see how bitcoin is swallowed by orders waiting at lower levels.

Look at the amount of developer activity organically growing and many of them working full time simply on donations that are actually making them one of the first 100% bitcoin paid engineers. Why would smart folks put their brains at work for your new coin?

I am continually amazed how many actually smart people miss this very important fact that if you have no way to bootstrap your fancy new tech-coin you will lose. Your efforts are better spent in joining the Bitcoin revolution that is only beginning",1605828437,6,1

jxuh61,MadgeSpeaks,Response to The Bitcoin Cult accusation.,"So a redditor commented on a prior post that my HODL moment being akin to a spiritual epiphany is evidence I am in a cult.

Here is my formal response: You can use this to educate your fellow trolls IRL or here. 

1) Don't get confused between conviction and cult. An epiphany is a rare, higher form, of conviction. Although I had a spiritual experience understanding Bitcoin, it was largely my knowledge in economics, math, politics, software and history that gave me the conviction to HODL.

2) Did people say Issac Newton followers of Calculus were in a cult? Unlikely, but once they learned it, they didn't.

3) A cult typically needs a cult leader who reaps 50-90% of the rewards of its followers assets, work or soul. There is no Bitcoin holder with anywhere near that sort of influence. 

4) What comes close to a cult? A system where 2000 people own 50%+ of global wealth through an inside game that they are fiercly protecting. Oh guess what, that's the current system.

5) A cult by definition has a negative influence on its followers, asking them to break character, and turn on their value systems. Also, all cults eventually fail.

6) What is the opposite of a cult? A community. What is Bitcoin? Clearly a positive community that enhances one character and brings energy and spirit to humanity.

HODL for life.

jxucq4,anunimo,"Any alternatives to Wirex, They scam. ?","Greetings everyone!  
Just wanted to let everyone know that wirex recently has been doing some pretty shady stuff.  


First of all, they locked multiple transactions yesterday after their website got ""Updated"".  
(People that transferred funds to them never received it to their wallets, yet after the app was updated everything ""Seemed"" fine for other users, and they told other users that everything is fine.)  
Secondly they banned me from visiting their website, I can't access [wirexapp.com](https://wirexapp.com) from my pc's ip address anymore after addressing the issues on their forums (I can from my phone luckily).

Third: they don't resolved any issues whatsoever for any of the people on the forums recently.  
Many many people got their coins locked in atm with wirex.  
Wirex does not want to respond in this matter, and they have even banned me from their site. (Bravo).  


I cant do anything on the app even.  
And i have balance on their accounts. Not much but still balance, so be careful out there.  


I will be leaving Wirex   


Could anyone suggest any good alternatives for EU citizen?

jxs0mx,thhroaway,Lost almost all my BTC trading,"I got in pretty late into BTC - 2018 - although I'd heard about it from the start, I'd never bothered to buy 
    
Over the past 2 years I accumulated almost  2 BTC at an average of about 7K USD

Then I thought I'd do some trading to grow it (stupid idea)
In the start of 2020, I bought and sold ETC,XRP and various coins against BTC.
    
I made a few 100$ and it seemed like I could make anywhere from 20 to 100$ on a good day with just a couple of trades.
I got carried away and used margin trades borrowing about 1 BTC

Then Corona hit and I was stuck with a bunch of ETC at a cost price of 0.00085 or so - it kept going down, I thought it would recover, but it hit 0.00033 and my holdings were liquidated to pay back the debt in a margin call

I did another stupid thing, selling my remaining BTC at 12800 levels to buy lower, but it kept going up and up and up - now I just have a little USDT barely worth about 0.25 BTC 

I'm a bit despaired - I broke my own advice of HODL that I used to tell others.

Advice please - 

1) Do I just convert the USDT back to BTC and HODL even if its a fraction of what I had? And start buying again slowly?

2)Or is it worth waiting with the USDT for the ATH and the drop? Will it ever go below 12K now?

So the most obvious situation where you'd have to pay is if you have coinbase, robinhood, any of those etc and you sell on their platform, that's a taxable event and they mail your 1099 to the IRS. Have to pay those.

I'm planning on hodling for the rest of my life I mean at minimum most of it for 5 years for sure. I know bitcoin is traceable, but I moved everything I have to an offline wallet. I know there are ways to basically move your crypto around to get your identity off of it.

What if I gave my bitcoin to a friend as a gift, under the annual exclusion amount of $15k, (you can gift 15k a year with no taxation, over that you do pay, this applies to any asset not a crypto thing). 

So I gave my crypto to a friend, I don't hold any anymore, and I've got an offline wallet I don't need to convert my btc to cash which would obviously trigger a taxable event, I could use that btc in the future to purchase goods and services and your purchase doesn't get reported to the IRS.  So is btc taxation pretty much the honor system? we all know how technologically inept government is and they don't have the resources to track down every single person with btc and trace, it would only happen if you get selected for a full audit and you would be able to say you gifted it away x years ago and gifts don't have to be recorded you wouldn't have to identify who it went to.",1605989290,13,1

November 20, 2020 04:58 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Cryptocurrency     

Ark Investment CEO Cathie Wood appeared at the virtual investing in tech        seminar put on by [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-could-hit-500-000-according-to-ark-invests-catherine-wood-51605906264?mod=hp_LATEST) where        she discussed the rise of [Bitcoin](https://www.benzinga.com/money/is-bitcoin-a-good-investment/).     

**What Happened:** Wood told viewers the 160% year-to-date        increase for the price of Bitcoin could be just the beginning.     

Wood said the decision by the Fed to keep interest rates low, Bitcoin        being a digital alternative to gold and an insurance policy against        inflation as reasons why Bitcoin has increased in price.     

The increase in institutional investors getting involved in Bitcoin is        where Wood sees the price increasing further.     

Wood said it reminds her of the early days of institutions beginning to        make small allocations to real estate and emerging markets. She said the        allocations started at 0.5% and then rose to 5%.     

If institutions allocated mid-single-digit amounts to Bitcoin, it would        take the price to a range of $400,000 to $500,000.     

There will only be a supply of 21 million Bitcoin, with 18.5 million        currently in existence.

**Why It’s Important:** The rise in the price of        Bitcoin would make it the 16th most valuable company by market        capitalization. Bitcoin passed **Mastercard Incorporated**        (NYSE:[MA](http://www.benzinga.com/stock/MA#NYSE))        Friday with a market cap of $335 billion.     

Bitcoin had already passed **Bank of America Corporation**        (NYSE:[BAC](http://www.benzinga.com/stock/BAC#NYSE))        and **Paypal Holdings** (NASDAQ:[PYPL](http://www.benzinga.com/stock/PYPL#NASDAQ))        on the list.     

The rise in Bitcoin price and demand has also helped the **Grayscale        Bitcoin Trust** (OTC:[GBTC](http://www.benzinga.com/stock/GBTC#OTC))        rise 145% year-to-date.     

Wood is the manager of four of the best performing ETFs in 2020 with the        Ark ETFs.     

**Price Action:** Bitcoin traded at $18,619.50 at time of        publication Friday.

jyfd8j,Danccccc1989,BTC CFD trading vs Buying BTC (UK),"I already feel like there’s a majority of people in here who are very much in the BUY BITCOIN group over trading as CFD. 

Obviously trading at 1:2 leverage doubles the risk and reward aspect but with the downside of never owning the BTC and currency remaining stuck in Fiat - but if the intention is to make gains through a CFD approach and then cash out in order to buy BTC outright, one could buy double what they were able to with this approach? Provided there isn’t a massive jump between transferring CFD value to a bank account and making the BTC purchase. I guess there’s also the risk to being subject to Capital Gains tax on that too if the amounts drawn down are high enough. 

Also I’m in the UK and CFD trading on cryptos looks to be banned in January 21 (but we may be able to hold existing open positions but will not be allowed to open new positions?).

I haven’t YOLOD all my money at this point, just thrown in a bit to see what happens and following BTC as a new ‘hobby’. 

Part of what bothers me about outright owning BTC is:

Too many wallets vs hardware
Fees to purchase
Fees to transfer
Fees to maintain. 

Can people advise if the fees seem to be percentage based on account value or fixed price?

Also I’m completely ok if someone here tells me outright that I’ve got the wrong idea about fee structures with BTC. 

Overall, I’d like to invest more in to this on a DCA approach over the next few years and irregardless, after January CFD isn’t a viable approach for me anymore so I’m trying to find out some information now ahead of that so I can prepare to transition things over to a wallet. 

Thanks see you at the moon 🚀",1605981993,6,1

For instance, if you are holding whatever you consider to be a meaningful sum (i.e. if you lost the entire amount it would a disaster) should you consider diversifying how you hold your bitcoin? Is there anything to be said for a system where you split your bitcoin between

- A hardware wallet, where you alone control the private keys

- A Semi-custodial service (like Casa)

- A savings account like BlockFi (I know BlockFi has significant drawbacks, e.g. your bitcoin is being used to short the market and the downwards pressure this puts on price could offset the 6% interest), where you have given up full control of your keys

- Any other system of storage

Or is there no compromise when it comes to Bitcoin? Does giving up any control defeat the entire purpose, or is it pragmatic and prudent risk management?

jyekqt,Imaginary-Friendship,Taxes on Bitcoin (long-term) aren’t that bad in the US,"I know for US citizens the joke is to say you lost your keys in a boating accident to avoid paying taxes. However, I ran some tax numbers and I don’t think it’s that bad. If you are a married couple you can cash out $100,000 per year (2020 rates) without paying any Federal taxes. You may have state taxes, but that’s maybe a reason to move.

If you are single, I think the amount is around $50k. I know $50k and $100k aren’t lambo incomes, but for a pretty good life those amounts aren’t bad (assuming you live in a mid-to-low cost of living location).

If one were to use a “safe withdrawal rate” of 3.33%, a married couple would need $3 million in crypto to be able to live on $100k per year for 30+ years. Of course, this assumes that bitcoin continues to increase in value.

If you pulled out more than $100k per year then you’re only paying 15% (up to almost $500k). I mean, that’s not too bad. It just means you’d need more than $3 million if you wanted to last for a long while.

Maybe my sights are too low, but I’d be pretty happy if I could live on $100k per year for the rest of my life without needing to work. Keep in mind, $100k from a W2 job is not the same since you have to pay taxes, social security, and Medicare. So, obviously, $100k of capital gains would be better than $100k from a W2. Also, I believe some states may not calculate capital gains for health insurance so you may get free health insurance.

I know inflation and new tax laws could change everything in the future, but if things stayed somewhat similar, I probably wouldn’t have to lose my keys in a boating accident when I become crypto-rich! :)

Of course, talk to a tax pro and a financial planner. These are just the ramblings of a crazy person.",1605979405,37,1

I post with the hope to learn and start a productive discussion. My background is business and finance. I trade options regularly and have for a few years. Not a brag. I just thought buying BTC for some sweet HODL action until I retire many years from now would not be difficult. After many a google search, article reading, youtubing, etc. I find myself at GDAX buying BTC with a Trezor on the way. I'm in now and will keep buying in. After this experience though, I'm really disappointed. I understand crypto is an elegant technology that is secure because of the redundancies and complexities built into it. However, I found the whole process unfriendly to potential new users. The neogenesis of jargon seems circlejerkish. I personally enjoy it, it's a fun new world, but I'd gladly have it done away with where possible to encourage more people to buy in. The way exchanges operate is dissimilar to others.

jycpl7,tropicalfartbreeze,Bitcoin Valuation - Is there a misunderstanding?,"I see a lot of posts concerned and rightfully interested in the valuation of BTC. 

""Monday $20k!""
""...stop limit raid incoming!""
""I'm buying the next dip!""
""$100k by 2022!!""

Everyone wants a monetary bail out from life, finally a chance at being rich!

Or...how about this: ""Isn't this just a bubble...the bubble WILL pop, it's just a matter of time.""

Everytime we discuss BTC price, we discuss a USD or cash relationship in it's valuation. My question is: should we be doing that?

Some say BTC is worthless, such as Warren Buffet, while a former executive from Goldman Sachs says &gt; $1m. 

Why would a price target range from $0 to $1m?

Clearly, we are not understanding the real valuation. I believe the true value of BTC is undefined. I think we are greatly misunderstanding what value is. 

Here is how we know it's valuable. Governments are afraid of it. How do we know this? China. China is threatened by ANT Group, Jack Ma, and their growing power over the state of China.

Why would China stop this IPO? After all, it's just a financial technology and payment processing company. What's so scary to the state of China? And why would the president feel Jack Ma may not be in-line with the interests of the state?

China knows how powerful bitcoin (and cryptocurrency is). If bitcoin threatens and intimidates China...that gives you an idea of what the true value is. 

People think BTC recent price action is related to the U.S. elections. This is not correct. It is 100% related to China stopping the ANT Group IPO. Look at the second week of October charts and compare $BABA to $BTC.X there is a strong correlation to the causation. 

So if a country is threatened by crypto, what does that really really tell us of future price action? Well, it makes a lot of sense why many suggest BTC will reach and break $100k, but it doesn't stop there...

There's more to this, and this information presents some clear answers where the U.S. stock market is heading. I'm going to stop here.",1605973079,16,1

jycf9x,lazarus_free,Bitcoin privacy/anonymity explained for newcomers with quick guide on best practice,"Whenever the Bitcoin privacy / anonymity topic comes up in other threads, I see a lot of confusion as well as a lot of interest, so I decided to write a long post, mainly for newcomers, that will cover:

1. How private is Bitcoin? (assuming you don’t take extra steps to increase privacy)
2. Ways to acquire Bitcoin without revealing your identity
3. Ways to delink Bitcoin from your identity
4. Why should you care about privacy and other considerations

I am by no means an expert, I would just consider myself an ‘advanced user’ so anybody feel free to jump and tell me if anything I’m saying is not correct and I will amend it. I just do this selflessly to help newcomers.

I know this content may be here spread in various threads already, but I just think sometimes people miss having it all explained from the basics.

*Disclaimer: I don’t have any association with any of the services I may list below, it’s just the ones I’ve used and I’m most familiar with.*

**How private is Bitcoin? (assuming you don't take extra steps to increase privacy)**

Bitcoin transactions are recorded in the blockchain, which is public, so everyone can see them. However, transactions are pseudonymous meaning they show addresses and not directly an identity. 

Addresses look like this: bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdq

While your identity is not directly showing in the blockchain, it is still possible that some addresses can be associated with it.

If a Bitcoin address has been linked to your identity, for example because it comes from an exchange where you have revealed it, all your future transactions can be traced. Not only that but chain analysis can be performed to deduce if this address belongs to a larger cluster of addresses owned by you, therefore exposing if you own more Bitcoin and also potentially revealing past transactions.

Example: you purchased 0.5 BTC in Coinbase, and you have given them your identity because it is mandatory. You also have 1 BTC in a hardware wallet which you acquired by other methods and it is not linked to your identity. You want to store your BTC in the hardware wallet but you don’t want to reveal that you already own 1 BTC and you may feel smart by using a new address. While not reusing addresses is good practice, the problem is if you then go and spend 0.75 BTC, this transaction will probably contain 0.5 BTC linked to your identity and then 0.25 from the 1 BTC that was already there and was still anonymous. Well now it isn’t anonymous anymore, an external observer knows you owned this 1 BTC and can track where it came from. And now they can obviously track all your future movements too.

Also chain analysis companies collect all sorts of information like IP addresses to have even more pieces of the puzzle.

Conclusion: if you don’t take steps to protect your privacy, you should assume all your BTC transactions can be potentially associated to your identity, do not assume you are anonymous!

**Ways to acquire Bitcoin without revealing your identity**

A possible way to go is to just acquire Bitcoin in ways where you are not asked to reveal your identity, so that the addresses shown in the blockchain will not be associated to you and you will remain anonymous. These include:

* Decentralised exchanges like Bisq ([https://bisq.network/](https://bisq.network/)) which basically connect peers that want to exchange Bitcoin for fiat and have some clever mechanisms to ensure none of the parties can cheat. The BTC you receive is not associated to your identity and on the fiat side the bank just sees an outgoing transaction to another bank account and can’t tell it is to buy Bitcoin, so that’s one of the best ways to acquire Bitcoin anonymously. Liquidity may be a problem though, for instance you may only find offers to sell a certain quantity of BTC or at a bit of a premium compared to a centralised exchange
* You can also meet in person with people that want to buy and sell Bitcoin for cash, there are some apps that allow people to connect for this purpose, but it carries the obvious risks
* Bitcoin ATMs: there are some Bitcoin ATMs that don’t require any identity, where you can simply insert cash and get BTC in exchange. Some others may ask for credit cards or ID so they wouldn’t work for this purpose. Careful, some ATMs may have cameras so would still be wise to wear a cap or anything to hide your face. The problem with this method is that ATMs tend to charge high commissions
* You can also earn Bitcoin in exchange for your work or services and if done properly or via Internet, for example, you don’t have to reveal your identity or even if you do only the person that has paid you knows it, which his much better privacy than an exchange (and so the Government) knowing

**Ways to delink Bitcoin from your identity**

Ok so even though there are certain ways to acquire Bitcoin without revealing your identity, centralised exchanges may be more convenient because they offer high liquidity, comfort and competitive prices, but all of them ask for some form of identity as far as I know. So what can we do if the BTC we own has already been linked to our identity?

The best way to anonymise your BTC is to use privacy focused software wallets like Wasabi ([https://wasabiwallet.io/](https://wasabiwallet.io/)) or Samourai ([https://samouraiwallet.com/](https://samouraiwallet.com/)). Those wallets offer you the possibility of mixing your coins in a Coinjoin. A Coinjoin is basically a transaction to yourself where your BTC gets mixed with BTC from other parties in the process, normally from 50 to 100 other parties. So an external observer cannot tell who is who after the transaction is done and thus cannot associate your identity to any of the output addresses because they don’t know which one is it. Also, you can then subsequently participate in multiple Coinjoins, increasing even more your anonimity.

Bear in mind that an external observer can tell that you sent your BTC to a Coinjoin and can distinguish this from a normal transaction. So they would see for example your transaction from Coinjoin to Wasabi wallet, but then they would see a Coinjoin transaction with 50 to 100 outputs and would lose trace here, they wouldn’t be able to tell which one of those is you so your subsequent transactions would be more private.

Example: how to perform a Coinjoin using Wasabi Wallet, step by step:

1. Download Wasabi Wallet from [https://wasabiwallet.io/](https://wasabiwallet.io/)
2. Create a wallet, write down the 12 seed words, just like with other wallets nothing special
3. Go to Receive (tab at the top), generate a receive address and then send your BTC to this address, wait for your coins to arrive to Wasabi Wallet and have enough confirmations
4. The third tab at the top is “Coinjoin” and if you go there you can select the BTC you want to mix and then you should click “Enqueue selected coins”. Then the wallet will automatically mix your coins in a Coinjoin transaction, this can take some time, normally takes from 10mins to 1h depending on liquidity and if you have a large quantity it will take more time
5. Once done, your coins will show up with a green tick and means they are anonymous. Any coins that are not mixed will not have the tick and should not be used together with anonymised coins, Wasabi is very useful in this regard, shows clearly which coins have been through a Conjoin and which have not (those will show with a red cross), so don’t mix them in the same transaction or otherwise you would reveal your identity and the whole exercise would be pointless

Currently a minimum of 0.01 BTC is required to enter a Coinjoin and every Coinjoin mixes only the same quantity, so if you have more it will get automatically queued for the next Coinjoin. There is a technology in development called wabisabi that hopefully will allow for any quantity to be mixed, but is not there yet.

You should also know that Wasabi and Samourai earn a fee for the Coinjoin, but tends to be very low, like 0.003% per anonymity set.

Wasabi and Samourai run through TOR which means you won’t reveal your IP address in the process. And I would advise to use wallets that hide your address by default. Or you can also use a VPN to hide your IP address.

There are other ways to delink your identity from BTC, and a simple but effective one is to exchange them for Monero and back, using a service such as Morphtoken ([https://www.morphtoken.com/](https://www.morphtoken.com/)). The problem with this method is that you have to trust a third party (while the Coinjoin with Wasabi or Samourai is trustless and you always own the BTC during the process) and also the site charges you a premium in the exchange rates so it tends to be more costly than a Coinjoin.

Also something to take into account is that the BTC you receive when exchanging to Monero and back may have a history associated, so they could be tainted or have been used in criminal activities. So it would be advisable to perform a Coinjoin after you have exchanged them for Monero anyway, so why not go for the Coinjoin directly?

If we talk privacy we should also mention the Lightning Network, which is a technology that can be already used but is still in development in order to be improved. It is a second layer on top of BTC’s basic blockchain that allows you to ‘lock’ some BTC you have in the base layer opening a payment channel and then exchange it or spend it using the Lightning network, performing multiple transactions instantly and with negligible fees, and at some point in the future just settle the final value of the payment channel in the main layer.

Not the purpose of this post to describe how the Lightning network works, but essentially routes the payments through various nodes using ‘onion encryption’ similar to TOR so that each node knows only enough “1 hop” information: that the payment comes from the previous node and which node to send it to next, but not the origin or final destination of the transaction.

When you initiate the payment in Lightning, a node can’t tell if you are the sender or just relying it from a third party and can’t tell if the next hop is the receiver of the payment or just another middle node. Transactions in Lightning are not recorded in the blockchain (just the remaining value of the channel once closed, but the party you open the channel with is not necessarily who you have transacted with) so it offers great privacy. You can try Lighting with Phoenix wallet for Android for example ([https://phoenix.acinq.co](https://phoenix.acinq.co))

**Why should you care about privacy and other considerations**

This part is more subjective, it is my personal opinion.

Some people will tell you that “you don’t need privacy if you don’t have anything to hide” but I disagree. Think about your email account, you probably don’t have anything incriminating in there, but I assume you wouldn’t want it to be public for everyone to know who you send emails to and what are your preferences, right? It is just your right to mind your own business and nobody should know anything about it if you don’t want to reveal it or if there isn’t any reasonable proof of illegal activities.

Well then think about that through for a second: monetary transactions are much more important than emails, reveal a lot more like of how much wealth you have and what you spend it on and who do you transact with. Are you sure you want this information to be public and linked to your identity?

We are very used to using a peer to peer transfer of money which is absolutely anonymous, which is cash. Don’t you think we should be able to transact in the same way but electronically? Do we really have to put up with a Big Brother system that is controlling every single transaction we do? (like it’s the case with the current banking system?)

Maybe you come from a country where there are less liberties, where you may be prosecuted if you give money to certain causes. Guess what happened to some bank accounts that were accepting donations to support protests in Hong Kong (were closed and owners identified). HK protesters were also accepting Bitcoin but what if you live in China or HK and donated in Bitcoin thinking you are anonymous but you did with an address linked to your identity? Well suddenly you made yourself a target. This is why I’m writing this post, so people stop assuming they are anonymous when using Bitcoin. You can have a decent degree of anonymity but it requires a bit of work and being careful and you should be aware of it. Assuming you are anonymous when you are not is dangerous!

There are some instances where it may not be worth for you to increase your privacy. If the purpose is to buy some Bitcoin in an exchange, have it maybe in a hardware wallet for cold storage and back to the exchange to sell at a future point, maybe it is not necessary for you to anonymise your BTC.

A common question is whether an exchange can consider any Bitcoin coming from a Coinjoin tainted. Personally, I have sent Bitcoin to Coinbase after a Coinjoin multiple times and there wasn’t any problem. However, it is a possibility in the future. But I still think it’s ok for a reason: exchanges can just go a number of hops behind when analysing where a transaction comes from. Meaning when accepting incoming transactions they may say “has this been in any tainted activity in the last 5 hops?” so if it is the case you can avoid this blacklisting by just sending to yourself between addresses multiple times, at least more than 5 or whatever is the criteria of the exchange.

An exchange cannot analyse say the previous 20 hops because then they would go out of business, virtually all BTC has been in a Coinjoin or questionable address if you go that far back. And it wouldn’t be an issue to add 50 or 100 hops if you wanted to. Therefore I think if it is the case in the future and exchanges are a bit tighter in this regard, it will just be a game of cat and mouse and will be completely pointless.

Also by transacting in your Bitcoin anonymously you are also helping strengthen it. Fungibility (the fact that each coin is the same regardless of its history) is a great quality of money and is a weak point of Bitcoin in particular. So every time you are performing a Coinjoin or transacting anonymously in other ways you are also making Bitcoin a better form of money and store of value.

Anyway, it is up to you to decide how much do you value your privacy, but at least I hope you have a better understanding of the tools and ways to improve it.",1605972040,15,1

We are very far from the 500 BTC weekly we were trading months ago.

The reason (I think) is the value traded in LocalBitcoin is fixed to USD, so as the BTC price goes up the volume gets down.

If  I were abroad and want to send money to my relatives in Venezuela for  example, 200 USD monthly it would be a fixed amount in USD but lower BTC  amount, I think that is the reason.

Not  everything is good, I'm sure a part of the traded BTC come from the  goverment itself (they use that as a way of circunvent sanctions) the  percentaje is impossible to determine.

3) There is excess of wealth now in most counties

4) People store this wealth in stocks and mainly real estate

5) Especially the real estate is a big problem because people buy homes just to store value

6) An alternative and better finite store or wealth is bitcoin, because is portable. As long as it is collectively valued as digital gold and cannot be stolen - it offers more benefit than real estate

7) if Bitcoin is successful money maybe diverted from real estate and house prices will drop. This will be a true win for humanity because houses will have a pure utility purpose and not be hyper inflated. This way, people will have affordable housing and security. They will not be paying mortgage for their entire lifetime.

jys6nn,RPMahoutsukai,"Several noob questions about trading BTC, futures and trailing stop loss orders (on Binance)","I want to preface this by saying that if you can just give a link to an article that explains one of my questions, please do so. I understand maybe i'm asking something trivial but I tried googling and found no answer. Thanks!

Now, I am new to trading BTC, and I don't actually even want to trade it. I want to just buy and hold. However, in times of volatility like this, I would love to use trailing stop loss orders to protect my position from devaluating that much.

For example, when there's a correction like there is right now, I'd like to sell my BTC, and then put at buy trailing stop loss order, that will buy BTC when correction stops and price reverses up at least, say, 3%.

I tried figuring out the way to do it on Binance, and I find it quite hard, even though I used these kinds of orders on real stock exchanges several times already. Here are my questions:

1) Why does not Binance support trailing stop loss for just trading? Why do I have to go to ""futures"" trading to use trailing stop loss order? Is there a reason for this?

2) When viewing futures, I see BTCUSDT futures, BTCUSDT perpetual, and BTCUSDT with a date next to it.  I understand that perpetual means no expiration date, and a date means when the futures expires - like, 1225 means on dec 25 this year. However, what does the blank BTCUSDT futures means? It's not perpetual, as that's a different futures, but it has no date? But when I select it, I see ""BTCUSDT, 1440"" next to the chart below, which isn't a date at all (14th month? 40th day!?)  
So question number two, what is ""BTCUSDT"" futures and how does it differ to quarterly or perpetual futures?

3) What does "", 1440"" mean next to futures name in the chart window?

4) How does perpetual futures even work? What forces the price to come to the market price, if you can never actually exercise the futures? I mean, futures is a contract to buy/sell at specific price, but if it's perpetual, then buy/sell never takes place, does it 

5) How do I convert my long BTC futures position into actual BTC? 

I mean, say I want to do what I outlined above. I want to protect my BTC from devaluation during a correction. I sell my BTC when correction starts, transfer my USDT to futures markets, and make a trailing stop loss order to buy when price raises by 3% from minimum. Right? But then, after the order triggers, I now own a futures for BTC, not actual BTC, correct? So how do I convert that into BTC then? Do  have to sell this futures, transfer USDT back, and buy BTC, is that correct?

Thank you in advance!",1606032664,4,1
jys68c,iamnobodysfriend,The case for a million dollar Bitcoin by 2021,"I've seen people make projects of Bitcoin, saying, ""Bitcoin will hit 1 million USD by the year 2035"". These people don't understand how hyper-exponential growth works. Others, like the stock-2-flow model supporters, say BTC will hit around $288,000 before the end of 2021. And I think they are right, but they are not looking at the all-time-high.

Generally it iso that Bitcoin will drop back 60-80% after each all-time-high. For example, after the December 2017/January 2018 high of almost $20,000, Bitcoin dropped back to around $6,000 by June 2018 (-60% from high) and then briefly to around $4,000 (-80% from high) before shooting back up.

And that's how it's always been. In order for Bitcoin to actually \*drop back to $288,000\*, it first has to reach at least an all-time-high of about $959,040 (if 60% drop) or $1,440,000 (if 80% drop). So we are looking at a million-dollar Bitcoin by the end of this bullrun.

We are presently about 7-12 months from the next ATH (based on previous pumps after the past two halvings).

I predict the BTC price may flow as follows:

\- Before the end of this year, we hit close to or around $100,000 per BTC

\- Price will slump back 30-40% by Jan/Feb 2021 before starting its final vertical rally.

\- Sometime between April/May 2021 and August/September 2021, we hit a million dollar Bitcoin

\- Price then slumps back to anywhere between 200k and 500k -- the lowest point for the next bullrun (2023-2024), which may see a 10 million dollar Bitcoin.

I think this is possible. If you look at the many altcoin/shitcoins that saw 100x increases, I think this is going to be Bitcoin's 100x increase, from $10k to $1 million in under a year.

jyqwa6,peeptraque,How to Unfreeze an iPhone 11 Pro stuck on white Apple logo. Hire a Hacker,"

One of the advantages of using an iPhone is the fact that it does not  hang that easily. However, there are certain times when an iPhone  freezes and it could be a pain in the neck. Unresponsiveness or stuck  display is a common symptom arising in early devices, especially those  with shrinking memory or low storage space. The same symptom could  manifest in new devices when afflicted by rogue apps, data corruption  and software glitches. In worst case scenarios, [display problems](https://peeptraque.com/)  including unresponsive or stuck display can be a direct indication of  hardware damage. In this case, physical repair would be necessary.  Software-related display [problems](https://peeptraque.com/)  on the other hand still have a good chance to get fixed by some simple  tweaks and workarounds. Highlighted below are recommended procedures to  deal with a similar issue on the new [iphone 11](https://peeptraque.com/) Pro that’s stuck on white Apple logo. Keep reading to learn what to do if your new iPhone suddenly [stopped working](https://peeptraque.com/) and got loading the white Apple logo screen. [Hire a Hacker in The United States of America. ](https://peeptraque.com/)

## Troubleshooting an iPhone 11 Pro that is frozen on white Apple logo

For as long as physical or liquid damage isn’t present,  troubleshooting your device will likely bring some positive results. To  give you some inputs, I’ve lined up these subsequent procedures. Feel  free to try any, if not, all of these to eliminate common  software-related triggers and aid your iPhone in getting past the [white Apple logo](https://peeptraque.com/) display.

**Force restart your iPhone 11 Pro.**

The simplest recommended solution to deal with unresponsive or stuck  display issues in iOS devices is a force restart. As the name implies,  it forces the device to shut down and then restart. It’s a  battery-removal procedure that is used to deal with random firmware  crashes that result in [stuck](https://peeptraque.com/) iPhones and iPads. To force restart your iPhone 11 Pro, simply follow these steps:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Quickly press then release the **Volume Up key.**
2. Quickly press then release the **Volume Down key.**
3. Press and hold the **Side button** for about 10 seconds then release when you see the Apple logo. [Hacker for Hire for your iPhone 11 pro](https://peeptraque.com/)

This process doesn’t affect any saved data on your iPhone storage, hence it doesn’t require backup creation.  
 If your iPhone managed to boot up to the Home screen after carrying out a  force restart, install all pending updates for apps and iOS. Doing so  can help eliminate software bugs and malwares that might have triggered  the device to crash and get [stuck](https://peeptraque.com/) on the Apple logo again.  
 You can update your iPhone software via OTA (wirelessly) or manually through iTunes on a computer. Hack an iPhone",1606025639,4,1

I think this is a real option especially for people who are less technologically inclined and the path to mass adoption. Here is why:

As much as I understand most people want to be “their own bank” it also comes with some risk! You can lose your keys I so many ways (loss, fire, theft, error or manipulation, browser plug-in hack, etc... Or if something happens to you no one will ever be able to regain access to them. This has happened so SO many times.

Some bank in Europe now allow you to buy directly BTC, ETH and more (not trackers!!). They even allow you to move your crypto from and to major wallets like Coinbase for example. The advantage (for me as a hodler) is that, by law, my assets are protected! The cash up to 100k eur and the assets have to be transferred to me if the bank goes bust.

Another advantage for me is the ease to return to fiat if an when I want. Transfer fiat from Coinbase is blocked by many European banks or will raise a lot of questions.

An asymmetric ownership of something that everyone wants. This manifests in various forms: Real Estate, Equity, Art, Partnerships or good ol' strong-arming with political co-operation. But when they talk about it with us, they translate their wealth into a language designed to keep the truth hidden: Fiat valuations.

So, for example, you will never hear: I have 10,000 stocks of Google purchased and HODLed since 2001. Instead you'll hear I have $10 million dollars net worth.

So sheeple have been designed to think that they need to find more fiat. Work, work, work. Slave, slave, slave. Wealth is just around the corner.

Hence you are always thinking about the salary you make, the fiat unit savings you have, and this is why you buy shitcoins or trade away actually valuable assets, or go to Vegas, because the goal is to increase the amount of fiat you have. 

But fiat is a shitty form of wealth. None of the wealthy store wealth in fiat.

If you think in terms of fiat you are stuck in the matrix, the illusion that you need more of it.

Escaping this illusion requires you to twist your world into seeing what people will want more of in the future and transforming your fiat into that asset. There lies the asymmetric advantage",1606157545,52,1

jzn7nd,Prog44,Long term investing Bitcoin - Beginner Question (exchanges)?,"Hi everyone. I just started getting interest in investing in bitcoin for the long term since yesterday :). I did some research yesterday. I'm buying bitcoin for a long term hedge against inflation (already have been buying gold). I don't plan to do any short term/day trading. Right now I'm only interested in BTC and no other types of crypto. I did a lot of research yesterday looking at different bitcoin exchanges. I almost made the decision on setting up an account on binance and I was going to set up an account on coinbase just to try it out. I don't have a hardware wallet and won't mess with it until I have a lot more bitcoin. Right now I don't have enough to worry about.

After doing some more research this morning I looked cash app. I assumed most of the issues with buying bitcoin on robinhood would be there but apparently not. So I decided to buy a small amount of bitcoin (actually decided to setup a reoccurring transaction to buy more). I already use cash app so I was good to go. The fees seem to be really low. Honestly the only thing I like so far is there is no cost basis tracking so all I have is the total $ amount of bitcoin I own. I guess if I do continue to use cash app that means i'll have to keep track of it with a spreadsheet (argghhhhhh!!).

&amp;#x200B;

Ok and that leads to my question. Do you think I should continue to use cash app or I should move to something else and if so for what reasons?  I'm used to trading platforms so I don't necessary need the ease of use of cash app. If just wish cash app had some type of cost basis tracking &amp; gain/loss (including transaction fees)",1606155835,4,1

jzmreu,duane774,Is this a legitimate bitcoin investing platform?,"Hello,

I am fairly new to cryptocurrency; have been doing some buying and selling via Coinbase for a few months.

Recently I received an offer to signup for the following website, with the promise of easy passive returns.

[https://crypt-bits.com/](https://crypt-bits.com/)

I was given some ""promo"" capital and waited a few days for some profit to accumulate. I was able to successfully withdraw the profits to my bitcoin wallet, but my ""account manager"" whom I chat with on whatsapp, has been pushing me hard to deposit a rather large amount.

I'm curious is anyone is familiar with this platform. It seems like one of those ""too good to be true"" scam attempts, but they did let me withdraw about $50 in profit earned from the promo capital.

Thank you for any insight.",1606154530,8,1

As there's little evidence of retail fomo ([Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=bitcoin)), I was satisfied that the current rally was due to these corporations buying in.

However, I have a friend, who's close to some big players in the mining community, who's convinced it's bs, and claims that Paypal's product is simply a paper contract, with no BTC involved. He says that, as [Paypal's T&amp;C](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/cryptocurrencies-tnc) make clear, users cannot move BTC on or off the platform, so why would the company need to buy it?

Morgan bank is a leading global financial institution; its views can influence the US's investment community and across the globe. In the past, the Bank and its CEO have taken a hard line against cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. In a recent article, JP Morgan analysts suggest that Bitcoin can increase in value and rival gold in some investment market sectors.**

&amp;#x200B;

Koinal.io offers a fast and secure method for purchasing Bitcoin and leading cryptocurrencies from major currency exchanges. Join provides the advantage of purchases through bank-issued credit cards and bank-issued credit cards.

## Bullish on Bitcoin

The analysts offer a pro-Bitcoin position based on assessments of the current market and emerging trends. Bitcoin has emerged in global markets as a potential hedge against monetary policies that drive inflation. Like gold, many investors see Bitcoin as an asset that does not depend on monetary policy for its value. In determining Bitcoin’s growth and investment potential, the bank’s analysts looked at current investments and long-term trend data.

## Expanding Markets for Bitcoin

The use of Bitcoin has grown in recent years to include companies that seek to hold the asset as a hedge against unwanted economic changes. They include Square’s decision to add $50 Million of cryptocurrency to its balance sheet. The use of Bitcoin as a corporate asset suggests the Canadian trend of converting cash reserves to Bitcoin continues in the US.

PayPal’s decision to offer Bitcoin to its customers will increase potential buyers by a significant number. PayPal can offer cryptocurrency to more than 350 million active accounts.

### The New Safe Harbor

Gold is a traditional safe harbor for investors seeking to balance a portfolio and hedge against volatility. The demographic trend suggests a divide between older and younger population groups. For many younger investors, Bitcoin has a certain appeal. A higher percentage of millennial investors prefer Bitcoin to gold as a hedge. This emerging trend can support a doubling or more in the cryptocurrency’s value.

J.P. Morgan analysts provide a helpful analysis of the growth potential for Bitcoin. Koinal provides a safe, convenient, and efficient method for adding Bitcoin to your portfolio. We are ready to help start to expand your cryptocurrency participation. Open an account today!",1606154299,0,1

Or, for the same price you can buy a real car, drive it home... later you can sell your car to whomever, not necessarily the dealer you bought it from.

Paypal, robinhood, and some others only offer their fake versions of bitcoin.

These fake versions have no advantages (except to the owners of paypal. etc.), but have several significant disadvantages compared to owning real Bitcoins.

I think people should be clearly warned ahead of time, and not have to be surprised later that there were things in the fine print to fuck them over.

I recently was trying to recover coins from an old BTC account from 2011. First, I pulled the BTC coins out on a separate account/app and stored those in cold storage (this was approx on 11/13). I then used Coinomi and swept it for other coins/forks on 11/20.

I individually swept for BTG coins and BSV coins. I was able to pull those out successfully, but since this app says it is ""Temporarily Suspended due to fork"" for BCH coins, I waiting on it. 

I later found another app to sweep for BCH coins and it said that none existed in that original account. Looking at the blockchain, it appears that those coins came out approximately at the same time I sent my BTG coins from coinomi into another wallet in a separate app.

I'm assuming they are gone forever, seeing as according to blockchain I can see them travel between 3 different BCH addresses before resting into an account.

I can accept that they are lost if that is truly the answer. However, I would like to understand why? Can anyone provide insight to if I can recover these coins and if not, what happened?",1606147012,3,1

k0djiy,lookuplookdown,Bitcoin and U.S. Taxes - Practical Considerations,"I am not a lawyer or a tax advisor and the following is based on what I've read.  Talk to your own tax advisor for guidance specific to your situation.

Ok, in the United States the sale of Bitcoin is a taxable event.  If you sell for a gain you are required to pay taxes on that gain.  If you sell for a loss you can apply that loss to offset other gains.  I'm not going to get into any other specifics here regarding rates, capital gains or how to do your taxes.  The main questions are (1) what is a sale and (2) what Bitcoin am I selling (for tax purposes) when I sell.

As to the first question, basically anytime you own Bitcoin and then, after some transaction, you don't own Bitcoin that is a sale.  This includes:

* Sale of Bitcoin for fiat currency on an exchange (e.g. Coinbase) or off an exchange (e.g. to your friend).  There is no difference from a tax perspective based on where you are selling or to whom you are selling.

* Exchanging Bitcoin for other crypto currency.  If you directly trade Bitcoin for Ethereum, for example, without holding any fiat in between that is still a taxable event.  This gets complicated since you are dealing with two crypto currencies yet your taxes are paid in USD.  It is important to keep track of the value of both cryptos (in USD) when making such a transaction in order to determine your gains/losses on Bitcoin and your cost basis for Ethereum.  Unless you have some specific reason to go directly between cryptos it may be easier to always go to USD first for record-keeping purposes.

* Exchanging Bitcoin for anything else, such as a car.  This is still taxable event though you never actually ""sold"" the Bitcoin for fiat first.  If you bought one Bitcoin for $10,000 and then exchanged that Bitcoin for a car selling for $19,000 the $9,000 difference is taxable.

* All other Bitcoin ""costs"" as a result of a ""sale"" to the extent paid in Bitcoin, including all transaction and network fees.  This can get very complicated as well.

When you sell Bitcoin, what Bitcoin are you selling?  It's basically ""first in, first out"" or ""FIFO"" for short.  If you bought one Bitcoin per month for six months starting in January (so January through June) and you sold a Bitcoin in July, you would be selling the January Bitcoin.  Your taxable amount, therefore, would be your sale price in July minus your purchase price for your January Bitcoin.  

Putting all of that together, imagine the following scenario of a Bitcoin buyer.  This buyer purchased the following:

* January 2020 - .05 BTC
* February 2020 - .039501 BTC

Let's say (for convenience) that Bitcoin was $10K in January and you bought .05 Bitcoin from an exchange.  You would expect this to cost $500, but there is a transaction fee as well (let's say $4.99) so your total cost was $504.99.  This is your cost basis for your January Bitcoin and implies a per Bitcoin cost of $10,099.80 ($504.99/.05).  

In February (still assuming $10K per Bitcoin plus $4.99 transaction fee) you only had $400 USD in your exchange account and wanted to buy the most Bitcoin you could at the market cost.  So you paid $4.99 to the exchange and bought $395.01 of Bitcoin, or .039501 Bitcoin.  However, your cost basis isn't $395.01, but rather $400, which is your total cost of acquisition.  The implied cost per Bitcoin would be $10,125.57 ($400/.039501).

In March you want to do two things - sell .052 Bitcoin and transfer your remaining Bitcoin to a hardware wallet.

For the sale you will be applying the FIFO method to determine taxes.  So of the .052 Bitcoin you are selling .05 will come from your January purchase and .002 will come from your February purchase.  Let's assume Bitcoin is $12K at this point and that it will cost $4.99 to sell.   Your total proceeds would be $12K * .052 - $4.99, or $619.01 and the actual Bitcoin price you are selling at would be $11,904.04 ($619.01/.052).  Now on to the FIFO determinations...

Your ""first in"" was January so it will be your ""first out""...

* January Bought: .05 BTC @ $10,099.80 = $504.99 (cost basis)
* January Sold: .05 BTC @ $11,904.04 = $595.20 (sale price)

And your next ""out"" will be a portion of February...

* February Bought: .039501 BTC @ $10,125.57 = $400 (cost basis)
* February Sold: .002 BTC @ $11,904.04 = $23.81 (sale price)

But you actually need to divide February up between the sold portion and the unsold portion...

* Portion of February Bought and UNSOLD: .037501 BTC @ $10,125.57 = $379.72 (cost basis)
* Portion of February Bought and SOLD: .002 @ $10,125.57 = $20.26 (cost basis)
* February Sold: .002 BTC @ $11,904.04 = $23.81 (sale price)

Now, to determine your taxable gains:

* January: $595.20 - $504.99 = $90.21
* February: $23.81 - $20.26 = $3.55

For a total of $93.76.  

And you still have .037501 BTC remaining which you want to transfer to your hardware wallet.  There are two costs associated with this (in this example) - exchange fee of $2.99 (which will be payable in your Bitcoin) and a network fee of .00005 BTC.  The current cost of Bitcoin is still $12K.  Here's what is happening:

* Your .037501 will be reduced by .00005 BTC (network fee) and .000249 (exchange fee...$2.99/$12K). 

* Your hardware wallet will receive .037501 - .00005 - .000249 = .037202 BTC (Note: if you had other Bitcoin still in your account these fees may be taken out of that amount rather than the sent amount)

* And you ""sold"" .00005 + .000249 = .000299 BTC

Thus you just had another sale event whereby you sold .000299 BTC (from your February purchase) at $12K.   Looking at the FIFO....

* Portion of February Bought and SENT TO HW WALLET: .037202 BTC @ $10,125.57 = $376.69 (cost basis)

* Portion of February Bought and USED TO PAY FEES: .000299 @ $10,125.57 = $3.03 (cost price)

* February Sold: .000299 BTC @ $12,000 = $3.59 (sale price)

So your taxable gain would be $3.59 - $3.03 = $0.56 (which will be rounded up to $1 on your taxes).

k0rnq8,beateasyjoe,PGP is replaceable with the Bitcoin Public Key Infrastructure...prove me wrong,"Encrypted communication can be accomplished using Bitcoin Public Keys. Verifying the authenticity and integrity of files can be accomplished by having a designated Bitcoin Public Address to serve as your public identity for signing messages. By including the file name and file hash within a signed message from a particular identity, the risk of a compromised website is largely mitigated as any potential tampering of a message (or file within it) would be apparent to all as it would break the digital signature/fingerprint.

To be clear, I am not advocating for the use of actual public addresses (or public keys) that have ever been used in bitcoin transactions as there are many problems (privacy and other) with this which have been pointed out over the years. What am I missing?",1606308834,41,1
k0rg9z,TheGreatMuffin,"Want to contribute to Bitcoin Core, follow the development process, or simply learn how it all works? Here are some resources to start.","One of the great things about bitcoin protocol development is that it is completely public and open source, meaning that anyone can follow the process and contribute whatever they can/want.  

Many people don't know how open source development works in general, or how it works in bitcoin in particular, so I collected some good resources for starting to dive into it. The order is roughly from ""easy"" to ""complicated"", meaning the first ones are more a general overview of how it all works.  

1) https://blog.lopp.net/who-controls-bitcoin-core-/  

This I consider a classic by now because it explains in great depth how bitcoin development works, who is in charge and why it is decentralized. Here the first paragraph:  

&gt; The question of who controls the ability to merge code changes into Bitcoin Core’s GitHub repository tends to come up on a recurring basis. This has been cited as a “central point of control” of the bitcoin protocol by various parties over the years, but I argue that the question itself is a red herring that stems from an authoritarian perspective — this model does not apply to Bitcoin. It’s certainly not obvious to a layman as to why that is the case, thus the goal of this article is to explain how Bitcoin Core operates and, at a higher level, how the Bitcoin protocol itself evolves.  

2) https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/core-developer-bryan-bishop-on-building-bitcoin. 

&gt; There are so many important questions that surround the development of bitcoin and protection of the protocol, some of it shrouded in mystery. In this interview, I talk with Core Developer, Bryan Bishop about how developers work on Bitcoin. We discuss how ideas go from concept to code, testing procedures and the future of Bitcoin.  

3) https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/becoming-a-bitcoin-core-developer-with-amiti-uttarwar   

&gt; In this interview, I talk to Bitcoin Core Developer Amiti Uttarwar. We discuss her residency at Chaincode Labs, contributing to Bitcoin Core, working on open source projects [...]  

4) If you are already familiar with open source development and want some actual insights into the code itself, this might be a good place to start: https://bitcoincore.reviews  

It's a weekly hosted online meetup on IRC for discussing current pull requests. It is hosted by various Bitcoin Core devs with the goal of helping newer contributors to learn about the review process and the Bitcoin code in general. Records of previous meetups are available for reading.  

5) https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/  

This is the bitcoin dev mailing list. All kinds of topics and proposals are discussed here, mostly on a very high technical level. This is where discussion happens before a proposal gets formalized and before it gets assigned a BIP number. But also all kinds of questions and ideas gets discussed here.  

6) https://bitcoinops.org  

This is a great weekly overview of what is going on in various bitcoin infrastructure projects on a technical level; fantastic place to stay up to date but also nice pointers where to find places to contribute to or to learn from.",1606307947,14,1
k0rf4l,Astalon,Requesting Help to Recover an 18 Word Mneumonic wallet.,"Happy Thanksgiving everyone!... I could use some help in trying to figure out an issue.... 

I have an old Bitcoin original wallet with a recovery key that is 18 words long that begins with toast... I was trying to recover the wallet in the Bitcoin app and it only asks for 12 words, not 18... I accidentally sent some funds to this old wallet and I am trying to figure out how to get access to it so I can send it to my new wallet. I have the wallet address linked to my coinbase account but not sure if that is enough. I have installed the Bitcoin Core but do not see anywhere where I can recover that wallet.

What I want to do is offer up the value of my experience to this crowd, I have plenty of free written content that I think could really be useful to people in the niche. Especially since things are heating up and spectre of hype is lurking, what I'm wondering is what the best way to reach out to these newer traders is now? 

I haven't touched a trade in about two years, and knowing how rapidly the space evolves I figured I'd ask the guys who have still been in the game. I want to see everyone make money off of this, especially with the way things in the world are now; so if I can reach people and help them avoid the pain I felt before I got my game down it would be wonderful.

If BTC (or some other finite amount of virtual currenxy) becomes the de facto standard and no single entity can control the inflationary rate by increasing amount of currency in circulation, will governments still target a small inflation rate via other fiscal policies?",1606306329,19,1

Founded by [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/) developer John Newbery and [Bitcoin Optech](https://bitcoinops.org/) contributor Mike Schmidt, Brink aims to address two issues: how to sustainably fund open-source developers working on Bitcoin and how to bring new developers into the project, which is today primarily supported by volunteers. 

Brink will offer grants to established open-source developers and onboard new talent through a year-long fellowship. Funds provided by Kraken will benefit the Brink mentorship program. 

Grants will be awarded by the Brink board, based on the individual’s contribution history and potential. Funds will be awarded at the discretion of Brink, free from influence of any corporate sponsors, including Kraken.

“I’m thrilled to partner with Kraken on our grants and fellowship programs. Kraken’s investment in established open-source developers and newer contributors highlights their commitment to strengthening Bitcoin and ensuring its long-term success,” John Newbery, Executive Director at Brink said. 

At Kraken, we recognize Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies would not exist without the hard work and dedication of open-source developers. In recognition of their valuable contributions, Kraken has started a grant program to support promising developers and projects. 

Over the past year, we have made two grants of $150,000 each, and supported a third project through a full-time hire. See our [grant page](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/features/grants) for an overview of our program and how to apply.

**About Kraken**

Are you a developer looking to further your open-source project or simply looking for your next great career opportunity? Kraken would be interested to hear from you. 

We want people who constantly push themselves to think differently and chart exciting new paths in a rapidly growing industry.

I know very little about any type of investing, but Crytpo certainly has my attention, especially after the recent surges and I don’t want to get even more fomo so I’d like to act sooner rather than later. 

Any advice for a complete newbie, where to start, the best place learn the tricks of the trade, and/or Crypto people to follow? YouTube is so overwhelming. 

Is PayPal a good platform to buy and what other apps would you recommend?

Lastly, and I know this question is personal, but what do a good amount to invest for the average person? Is it still smart to work on the notion of “don’t invest what you’re not willing to lose”?

**What happens with loans which have fixed interests when hyperinflation happens? For E.g. I got 100k loan for a flat with 1% interest ""fix"" could the bank change the interest because of the crisis although I sign just a fixed interest? Did the amount of loan rise automatically?**

I know that a lot of people get hit in 2008 and lost everything because of that, I am from Austria and didn't know how it was here then.... I was too young and not interested in.... Know I couldn't find any information if there is some insurance that something like that never happens again....

Why I am asking Currently Money is cheap af and if I take a loan for 300k-400k for a flat which I can rent for e.g. did I have any disadvantage which I have to worry about if in the next few years a crisis hit us hard and the value of money falls or/and hyperinflation and so on....

OR the opposite happens: Money gets more and more expensive because of some different kinds of bank regulations (just an example) and I will be happy that I got this old contract with 0,8% interest?

So should I sell some crypto to take a smaller amount of loan (which i really really dont want), or should I go for it, like ""f\*\*\* it"" :D",1606297214,11,1

Anyway my mom refused to lend me money to invest, I guess people just doubt my intelligence and opinions. She told me to ask my grandmother for money, all I wanted was like $100-200 bucks. I knew as the value rose over the course of the day that my potential revenue was dropping exponentially. My grandmother offered me 50 bucks, if I could turn it into 100 then she would consider more, and I'd get a 15 percent cut, total bull but I should've taken the offer but I was too caught up in the fact that in the time it'd take to double the 50 I'd be losing the chance to double a much larger sum. I didn't want to be a few hundred richer, I wanted to be ridiculously wealthy, even knew that cannabis would be legalized someday and thought it'd be a great way to earn revenue to invest in dispensaries. My grandma asked my cousins opinion, he said it was a risky and foolish idea, ironically he bought 30 bitcoins, only to keep it in mt gox and lose the modern equivalent of 300k. Karma. I was so angry over it all that I shut down emotionally, I was enraged, I contemplated suicide for days. The real kicker?

I have read all the articles - including in this forum, thank you - advising nay exhorting crypto owners to move assets to a hardware wallet. While I get the benefits completely, I am very uncomfortable at this point about disasters that may strike \*after\* I buy a wallet and move BTC into it from my broker.

Briefly, here are disaster scenarios with a hardware wallet. I was curious how forum members deal with these scenarios after buying say a Ledger X and moving BTC into it.

1. You lose the wallet.
2. Ledger X stops working (the device stops functioning, Bluetooth connection to PC doesn't work, hardware interface to laptop changes as technology marches on etc.)
3. You lose your 24 word passphrase.
4. Ledger - the company - goes out of business (don't wish it upon them obviously but would like to be able to think through this carefully)
5. You become tired of the entire crypto gig and want to go back to the world of fiat.

Thank you! I am sure forum members have great measures in place for one or all of the above scenarios, so would love to learn. Also if there are other bad things that could happen and I haven't listed those, please share.",1606290220,11,1

k1797y,rayjay40,Paying a ransom in bitcoin (Help with my book idea),"Hi Folks,
I'm writing a mystery novel and I'm trying to find a clever way to do a ransom drop for a kidnapping. Basically, I'll have the dad show up at a subway station and answer a payphone call, that'll guide them to a new location and another payphone, and then to a third location (all in an attempt to ensure they come alone/ditch any cops that would be following). It's very similar to Along Came a Spider. At that third location, they'd drop a cold storage usb with the bitcoin. My question is can this be traced? The one problem I see is if the cops/family copied down the bitcoin address so that the USB isn't the only version of that key. In that case, the kidnappers would need to quickly transfer the bitcoin from the USB address to their own. Can that be traced? 

PS: No, I'm not looking to do this in real life. It really is for a book. If someone has a clever way of doing a ransom drop, I'll open to ideas. I'd do diamonds but that completely rips off Along Came a Spider. The ransom/kidnapping is a very minor part of the book so it doesn't need to be super convoluted or ingenious.

TLDR;  Bought high. Didn't sell. Missing FOMO 🤣

They say you learn from experience.

I had bought and used BTC for ridiculous things back in 2014.  It was sub 400. I then fomo'd and got back in 2017. Even being a ""true"" bitcoiner by buying near ATH. I also sunk some money into shitcoins. The saviour was ensuring I had around 80% held in BTC/ETH and LTC (mostly BTC)

Then things began to tumble. The crushing feeling of defeat and stomach knotted. By early 2018, I had en empty bank account and sinking BTC. Bit my lip, didn't sell. Until now when when some old sell order for 0.002 BTC triggered because of the current highs. That's when I even remembered my ordeal and what was going on. 

Now it all feels worth it. Now I can thank my hard balls of steel and idiotic stubborn nature of not wanting to give up.

Mind you I got back into BTC after quitting my fulltime job.

Yes I had no job, sunk in about 6 months of my modest salary savings into it. I still don't have a regular job. I now work as a freelancer doing community work and get paid for little projects. Barely enough to make ends meet. But I took a massive lifestyle change... no unnecessary gadgets, clothing, accessories etc. I don't pay rent, just internet and small expenses. I live a but through the gift economy and I moved to Asia to work with grassroot NGOs. 

I'm not sure what will happen, obviously I understand things better now. It's making sense. Somehow the true value and how not to time the market and FOMO has settled in nicely. Getting used to the weight of these balls.

I’m stuck seeing BTC as a commodity/security, and asking for help seeing it as a currency.

One of the reasons to keep stacking and HODL is because you believe BTC will keep going up and up (hitting 100K+ at some point)

Can someone with a strong vision of how we go from here, with BTC as a fringe currency (in the US-only perhaps) &amp; storage of value, to being one of the world’s primary currencies and a 100K+ price per Bitcoin?

Is rampant inflation a part of the story? The primary driver?

Is geopolitical tension/conflict a primary driver?

Would we expect the price of milk to fluctuate wildly, hour by hour, as BTC goes up &amp; down throughout the day? Or would supermarkets make a killing some days, and lose money other days due to the BTC market place?
(I am aware that multinational companies have this same problem with forex, but I don’t think fiat pairs fluctuate as much as BTC does, but I could be wrong.)
Or in the BTC-100K world does the price relative to other fiat currencies fluctuate less like a S&amp;P500 stock and more like any other fiat currency?

Nobody knows. Nobody knows how far down, or up. That said, seriously? BTC held over $10,000 since August. That in itself is huge. If anything at all above $10,000 is true support we have entered a new era.

**Heading down?** It's been like 12 hours and a rejection of 19,500 and break of 18,000 support. A few weeks ago 11,000 was a reason to celebrate. Seriously, calm thine tits.

As for price predictions I won't Mcafee my right hand's boyfriend but I've been right with 80% of my guesses and here's what I've been saying since the 10k breakout. Temper these with the news that some people are saying Mnuchin is going to try to impose greater restrictions on non-verified wallets getting remittances from exchanges, which I haven't thought deeply enough about yet and which might be contributing to the 19.5 rejection:

1. Holding above 10k support was and remains huge. It shows a low more promise and interest and I hope it stays this way. It's mainly psychological but it also means that 1 bitcoin is now above the mandatory reporting minimums to the IRS in dollar amounts when deposited to a bank. In other words it ""seems"" that the community is more comfortable with being held tax accountable every day BTC is above 10k. Yes, everyone knows you can buy / sell / send as much or little BTC as you like. Not the point. To some, appearance is reality.
2. Big moves have big corrections. Back in the ancient days, the hairy days, the blood and glory days of twenny ought 17 when men were men and Hodlers were bodler (I swear to god, Oliver, if you steal this writing like you did my other memes I will pound you like you wish Adam Driver would) I knew this but didn't heed my own advice. I bought my second BTC on the famed bull run at 11k. This was a small mistake. I did not sell at $20k. This was a bigger mistake. If I had done so I could have bought 6 BTC when it hit $3,000 and had money left over. Intellectually I knew it would have to correct but I didn't listen to my brain. And I made the other stupid mistake: Trying to time the market. My incorrect prediction, to myself, was that it would bounce and rise and then continue to rise soon. But... soon didn't come until this August, did it? Do yourself a favor and don't listen to the gifs. Buy BTC because you believe in it or don't buy it, a weak hand won't help you and these gifs and the memes and nonsense are just one bit jackass yelling BITCONNEEEEEEEEEECT. Seriously: They try to sell the sizzle *but you need to buy the steak.*
3. What happened yesterday is called a rejection of a double bottom. It's basically a failed bounce and it shows weak support at a given price level. Everyone knew $20,000 is an historic ceiling. It's a big resistance level to approach, let alone break. Many speculators, traders and Hodlers were watching it and ready to sell at that price or to GTFO just before it to reduce their risk basis from when they bought in 2017. Probably tons of limit orders in the book SINCE then! The 18.5 temporary support was, largely, people betting on a breakout. A lot of those people lost faith in that breakout when 19.5 was rejected and, foop, the floor fell out. It's *not* a big deal. I, for one, am MORE than satisfied if BTC trades between $10,000 and $20,000 for now. A $10,000 floor is a big win. Now people are going to tell you technical analysis is bullshit and nonsense and reading tea leaves. OK, well, make up your own mind. You can see exactly how many trades happened at a given price at a given time and all the trades so if you can't read into that I guess it'll seem mysterious and magical malarkey to you. But if you can look at the chart and see that people were more than willing to buy and sell BTC at 17,000 today when they were only buying and selling it at this volume for 8,000 a couple months ago I think that fall from 19,000 might just not seem quite so intimidating.
4. Many people were waiting for the run to end. I wish I weren't asleep for it, I'd have sold and rebought this morning. Might should have and made a few thousand bucks. But simply put when everyone is watching the big red light and standing with one foot out the door there's a predictable result. But, hold up, it's Thanksgiving day and the price has fallen three thousand bucks and... it's bouncing a little already? Not a huge deal. Maybe it continues down week over week but I don't see a big problem.

So, my predictions and we'll see if I can improve my 80% success record!

1. I am watching the $15,000 zone as a support indicator. It seems to be a good retracement point and if BTC doesn't draw out a new floor above it ($16,000 seems likely) and $15,000 creates a good bounce I think there's a damn good chance this is a hickup on the way back up to $20,000. I really think $15,000 will set the mood if $16,000 doesn't. 
2. I'm strongly considering buying back in at $13,000. Typically I'll want to catch an uptrend so this is hard with so many predicting $13,000/$13.5 as a hard floor right now but with all the froth in BTC it's not hard to see it go to 12.5 before a bounce. If the price falls under $15,000 and bounces before $13,000 it'd have to be a pretty strong bounce to convince me to buy back at that time. You can say I'm dumb but if you're a super-bull then what's the difference if I have one less BTC? Moon is moon, babe. My reason for selling on this run up was this exact situation (oh shit, 85% now!).
3. My bull case is BTC holds above $13,000 and climbs (relatively) slowly past $20,000 and continues to climb, watching short term corrections at every thousand dollar level before 20 and $500 after 20. My bear case is BTC breaks $13,000 support and slowly falls under $10,000 and seeks a floor in the high $8,000's before correlating with the stock market or opposite of inflation. I'm watching $15,000 to see which is more likely. The strength of hands is what's important. If we consolidate above $15,000 for the long weekend I am more than a happy camper.
4. Looking at the order book on coinbase it's quite clear the big wall here is just $20k. It's a climb, but it's not at all unlikely to get there. My super-bull case is some upcoming news regarding institutional buyers and the dwindling supply causing a great surge in demand and strong hands refusing to sell. My extreme long-term price for BTC has no upper limit, I see it growing in price for my entire life or until something is able to replace it. I find a replacement very unlikely simply because, seeing how disruptive it is and how much gov'ts wanted to shut it down, I expect they'll put the kibosh on anything with similar qualities that begins to emerge.",1606412168,52,1

k1ilmu,primalfabric,"Price is down, simply HODL or buy more bitcoin...","The bitcoin price crashing is nothing out of the ordinary. This happens every time bitcoin sees a sudden price rally in the upward trend. This simply appears to be a price correction. 

At such time it is best to HODL your bitcoin or buy the crash as the price is low. 

In actuality, there is no way to *exactly* predict the market movement and all one can use are financial models and past price movements to predict how the price will behave in the future. 

This crash appears a lot like the multiple crashes bitcoin has had in the past due to a sudden price increase. It almost always corrects itself and continues trending upward. Do note there have been instances where the price continued to fall down. 

But again we as users can only make predictions and hope they stick. 

If you decide to buy or HODL here some resources to help you out:

Here’s my 4:

1) Only buy what you can afford to lose 
2) HODL (i.e. don’t day trade but buy and hold for long term; 3-5yrs minimum) 
3) Don’t buy shitcoins (i.e. any other coin other than bitcoin, they are pump &amp; dumps)
4) Not your keys not your coin (once you bought, move your coins off the exchange into your own wallet so you own your keys and don’t risk the exchanges losing your coins)",1606409324,4,1

k1hsjc,srfrog1970,Did you just get rekt?,"For all you that just got rekt, understand that this correction is ""Business as Usual"".  If you are swing trading, you should have a plan.  I was around in 2017 watching my investment go up and up and it was sooooo exciting!  I was also there in 2018 when it went down and I watched all my profits go out the door.  I will not do that again....  there are 2 ways to do this in my opinion:

1) HODL - Buy bitcoin (or your favorite crypto) and just hold it until you can cash out your initial investment and then gamble with house money.  

2) DCA in and out of the markets using a PLAN.  Most people need help formulating a plan.  Without a plan,  your emotions will take over and that is dangerous 

I use Ben Cowen's r/intothecryptoverse as a guide for my plan.  He has been following the markets since 2014 and focuses on technical analysis. He has developed a ""risk dashboard"" that identifies how risky the market is.  Low risk, DCA in.  High risk, DCA out.  In his YouTube videos he explains in great detail the momentum shifts and its FREE!  He does have a paid subscription where he provides the risk dashboard. However,, he does talks about the risk in the free content.  This way, you can watch the markets as he explains and judge for yourself.  I bought in on the premium channel and it's been the best money I have spent.  I don't worry about these large drops and I don't get too excitedabout the large pumps.  It has helped me take the emotion out of the equation (for the most part:).

He does not have any ads on his YouTube channel because he is afraid that the ads will be clickbait ads and he doesn't want anyone watching to think there is any affiliation (Solid).

If you are moving in and out of the market, please have a plan, don't put in more then you can lose, and be patient (he data suggests longer market cycles, explained in his videos).

Good luck all!!!!  May the force be with us:)",1606406820,1,1

k1fzsf,Haigfish,Best Buy order strategy for HODLING?,"Hi everyone, I use coinbase pro and just generally weekly will add some funds and make a couple buy orders, one will be to the nearest $100 down and the other will generally be a couple hundred dollars down from the current price. Example: if the price is 18650 when I am placing them I’ll place a buy order for $18600, and a buy order for $18500 or $18400. I always seem to miss the bigger dips though. The problem is the minimum amount for a buy order is 0.001 BTC which was getting near $20 so I didn’t really have the option to have a ton of buy orders set up unless I transferred a ton of funds all at once. Does anyone have a good strategy for setting up buy orders? Do you just have clumps of buy orders at each $1000 interval? Any tips would be appreciated. I’m just interested in holding long term but I still like buying on dips",1606400424,3,1

Also there was a pyramid scheme where you would be rewarded for bringing more people into the scheme. (yes I know, I was very stupid.)

In the end they did deliver, but SCoin/SpaceCoin altcoin turned into SCT Token / Token SpaceCoin.

Due to a forecasted BTC weath tax or 6102 forfeiture order some people are advising others to report selling/spending BTC on your tax return thereby essentially claiming you no longer control the coins you bought from an exchange. 

I'm failing to connect the dots here, even if you buy non-KYC coins the government can still tax you whenever you sell/spend them if they catch you. 

Even if you buy AND sell to a third party with no KYC whenever you sell your coin that money still goes back into your bank account which raises massive red flags if it's a substantial amount of money. Unless you transact in cash only which is very unlikely.

In regards to a 6102 BTC forfeiture order or a wealth tax, if your government finds out that you were lying to them and you still control the coins that you claim you don't, you're looking at jail time and massive fines due to lieing on your tax return which is a felony.

k399g5,WorkingLime,"274 BTC were traded in Venezuela using LocalBitcoin (last week, lowest since 2018), down from 286. That equals 3,585,000,000,000 Bs. (ATH in Bolivares again in Venezuelan currency ""VES""), traded volume is a constant USD amount. One BTC is around 18,300,000,000 Bs. Monthly minimum wage is 1.20 USD."," Hi, guys remember I'm Venezuelan living here updating this week numbers.

We are very far from the 500 BTC weekly we were trading months ago. We are around 300 BTC weekly.

The reason (I think) is the value traded in LocalBitcoin is fixed to USD, so as the BTC price goes up the volume gets down.

The  trade volume is constant at around 4,500,000 USD weekly. When we were  trading around 500 BTC, price was hovering around 10k. That is why.

Remember, this is only measured by LocalBitcoin (For sure the biggest exchange here).

I'm  Venezuelan ""living"" here, crypto entusiast. A lot of redditors have  helped me somehow! I got several moons but sadly had to cash them out.

You can ask me anything!

 The first is whether I should hold only 100% Bitcoin. I recently sold the few altcoins I had and reshuffled to 50% BTC, 30% ETH, 20% LTC. I like BTC for store of value, ETH for smart contracts with ETG 2.0 around the corner, and LTC seems to have heavy use in unbanked and underbanked countries due to speed and low fees. I am considering holding 100% BTC if someone convinced me.

My second is regarding travel with the ColdCard wallet by CoinKite. I would buy one of these if I were to hold only 100% BTC. Currently I have the Trezor One. I want to go back to school in Moscow next year and would want to bring my hw wallet with me. The Trezor is very discreet and could probably even bring it carry on. The ColdCard does look a bit sus though...it looks like some kind of remote detonator lol. Do you think this would be fine in my checked luggage? Perhaps in a bag with pencils and highlighters etc so it looks like a calculator? Or is this even more suspicious? These are the insane things that I think about as I fall asleep.

I apologize before hand if this is a longer post. 

I was really into bitcoin back in 2017-2018. I never really owned alot of it, right before the crash I owned maybe 600$ dollars of it. Which in context would be about the same value today if I had not sold it off, so no regrests there. I sold it to buy Calculus and Physics textbooks. I cashed in on my gains and called it a day. Then it crashed, life took over and for some reason I never really thought to much about bitcoin until the pandemic hit. I was using coinbase to purchase my bitcoin and I still have my ledger (physical wallet). 

I believe in bitcoin for many of the same reasons that all of you do. Decentralized, set number of supply, no printing like the fed, and well to some degree anonymity, and of course the block chain. But what gets me everytime are the bitcoin fees. I know that with a fixed supply, if enough people want some, it will drive the price. But making bitcoin a feesable method of everyday purchase is impossible with the bitcoin fees. 

For all of you that know alot more than I do, how do we solve the fees? what is the solution, and the way around that? Serious Question.",1605637153,4,1

And he says Localbitcoins. I asked ""Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash?"" (Because I faintly remember hearing that localbitcoins actually sells BCH not BTC, but I'm not sure, hence the post). Anyway, when I asked him that he stopped, studdered, and said Bitcoin. Like he sounded really insecure about his answer.

Yet he was talking about how BTC is going to the moon and everything and it got me thinking: could it be that this dude is buying BCH while actually thinking he's buying BTC thanks to these suspicious little Jedi Mind Tricks the BCH community plays on people?

If you have the skill, you can also do it without the bank.  The next 5 to 10 years is going to boom and **Bitcoin** is the fuse.  Welcome to the new financial system. 

**Bitcoin** will live right next to our bank accounts in a digital wallet. It looks like this is all going to happen in the next 12 to 18 months. Then in the coming years, new digital assets will begin to appear for sale at our banks. 

Right now big banks hedge funds and large corporations with cash are buying **Bitcoin**, so they can start selling it to our local banks who will then turn and sell it to retail investors like us, PayPal just implemented this. 

Gold is used as a reserve asset or an inflation hedge, that market is $9 trillion, If you add in gold jewelry it's \~11 trillion.  Right now the **Bitcoin** market is $300 billion. The **Bitcoin** market at 1 trillion dollars will mean that each **Bitcoin** is worth \~$50,000 per **Bitcoin**. 

Gold miners ramp up production if the price of gold goes up. **Bitcoin** does the opposite, the amount of supply reduces consistently and predictably. **Bitcoin** is digital version of gold with a fixed and know total supply.

You may want to save your money for that.  

[edit] Hey man all I'm saying is when it was skyrocketing in October/November 2017 y'all were saying ""BTC $100,000 by 2019!!!!"" because you were hyped. There was so much FOMO-driven buying around $10K and $15K and that value wasn't recovered for years. BTC hit 20K and then bottomed out at 3.5K. By now you should know not to expect that a STEEP upward slope won't be immediately followed by a steep downward slope.

jw2onj,heptagon_h,This reminds me of coronavirus in early Jan 2020,"In early January 2020 a handful of people in USA started sounding the alarms of coronavirus. Most of them were met with ridicule by mainstream media, healthcare experts, world leaders.

I wonder if we are in that phase of the bull run right now. I sense some growing skepticism and I have a feeling this time the skeptics may be wrong about corrections or pull backs. The timing feels appropriate since Microstrategy's first announcement. It takes months for institutions to get ready with funds, approvals, exchanges and start buying. A few have made announcements since, notably: Paypal, Fidelity, Square. Grayscale keeps scooping up bitcoin like nobody's business.

Do you believe that more institutions are just getting started right now or not?

Do you believe no more institutions are waiting in line to execute their orders (and make announcements) or not?

Do you believe some key high-net-worth individuals (&gt; 10MM USD) are getting in touch with some of the bitcoin luminaries and figuring out process or not?

Depending on how you arrive at these answers, we are either starting a major bull run or we are already running too hot and there will be a cool off soon.

Thought experiment: Lets say you are a HODLER for 2+ years and a high-net-worth individual comes to you and claims they'd like to put atleast 100K into bitcoin soonish so that they can secure their spot. Would you recommend they buy now or wait?",1605650732,100,76

The big boys have come to play. They don’t FOMO. They dominate. The positions they take will be colonial. They have long time horizons and they are not buying bitcoin with paychecks. This bull run will cause suicides.

When dumbass traders realize what they had in their hands that they sold for a measly 2-3x. Working class wholecoins will start to be few and far between. Because buying a whole coin will require you to sell your house. This next 4 years is not just “the next cycle” it’s the next phase. 

Where governments will have to respond. Where criminals are going to step up their game. Where publicly declaring that you have a whole bitcoin could be dangerous to you and you’re family. This bull run is not going to be a retail FOMO extravaganza. 

This bull run is the beginning of the fall of fiat. This bull run will cement Satoshi’s white paper as one of the most important documents in human history.

There will be no 80% correction. There will be no fall from $300,000 to 50k. Grayscale is not a weak hand. MicroStrategy is not a weak hand. Fidelity is not a weak hand. 

The institutions that are buying bitcoin couldn’t give a shit about “when Lambo”. They get lambos for free. They control governments. People expect that hyperbitcoinization will occur with government adoption. The companies that are and will buy in the next year, are the ones that have governments in their pockets. 

They will be no 80% correction.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeorshimron/2020/11/17/wondering-what-bitcoin-will-do-next-look-at-these-5-indicators/

Edit: Adding these good points by u/gunshotaftermath

&gt; 
&gt; 1.	Most of the new buyers are institutional, including major funds, as well as of course the big players we've been hearing about in the past three months (microstrategy, greyscale at $10 billion, etc), and many of the new funds are looking at 5+ year plays
&gt; 2.	Fiat is a lot more uncertain right now, with both US and Canada printing their way out of this recession. A trillion doars printed in a month is not normal. 
&gt; 2.	Google searches for Bitcoin is only at 10% of what it was in 2017, suggesting most retail buyers this time around are more experienced and less skittish. 
&gt; 2.	Major institutions have been emerging in the past few months. PayPal would be the largest international bank by user count, Coinbase has a Bitcoin debit/Visa card coming to the US, Square, and now two Crypto banks have emerged in Wyoming.",1605719004,267,56

&amp;#x200B;

  I've been following BTC news since it was worth nothing. I started believing since it was 500$ per coin, I'am (21Male) now in a foreign country tho (Ukraine). I was born in a poor family, I'am still poor. The majority of people in USA are surviving from paycheck to paycheck. My father repair laptops/computers/tv's, most of his customers are poor people too so you get how is my family surviving. Anyway that's not the problem, i mentioned that i'am in a foreign country now. Well yeah this is another story, i came to Ukraine so i can study ""cyber security"" the crazy thing is my father was saving for years so he can help me out to go study abroad (the amount he had saved for me was around 1400$ and it was all what he had as savings). One day i found a fail in the streaming platform ""Twitch"" i did exploit it and got 1100$ into my Paypal (you can trade BTC now using paypal btw).

I surviving by working 9 hours a day  with a basic salary 300$ can go up till 400$ for a good month (expenses : rent 230$ 1 room apartment + bills 50$ \[water, electricity, internet\]) Only if I could make more...

Hey guys!

I have finally made up my mind about it and I want to invest. I am going to make my first test transaction 24 hours later after I real all the responses to this post.

Is right now the right time? Is ever?

I have installed my phone wallet and set everything up. I want to know what would be your advise on how I should invest my first 1000$. Should it be all in one transaction or should I do it in monthly/weekly bits?

Should I go all in on Bitcoin, or should it be in others like Ethereum as well?

At what stage should I buy a hardware wallet? 

I am not going to be spending in crypto right now. This is going to be long term. I am also going to start accepting crypto at my business as payment. 

Thank you all in advance for taking the time! Wish me luck!",1605716465,28,3

jwiahi,primalfabric,18K and climbing! Bitcoin breaks a 3-year price high yet is under the radar from most mainstream news.,"Bitcoin just passed the $18K price barrier reaching a 3-year price high. As the world drowns in global economic uncertainties, crashing stocks, raging pandemic, bitcoin is one of the only assets that has stayed afloat, yet for some reason has managed to stay away from mainstream news. 

Bitcoin made headlines a while back when **PayPal** announced its support driving mainstream investors into the currency. Some argue that this may be one of the propellors for the current bull run.

There is another set of voices that mentions that the current price movement could simply be **FOMO**. As the bitcoin price climbs investors put in their money into bitcoin as they fear they might miss out on the bull run further driving the price up. 

**Citibank** analyst just a few days ago came up with a price prediction of $300K+ by Dec 2021 further driving interest into the coin. 

Unlike the last bull run of 2017, mainstream media has largely stayed away from this topic as they steer their focus on US elections and the pandemic.  

Whatever the reason for this recent bull run, it is always great to see bitcoin climb up and see more people get into it. 

As a bitcoin user, always buy/sell bitcoin from reliable exchanges, and remember you are only one responsible for its safety so do make sure to [keep it safe](https://blog.blockonomics.co/bitcoin-security-how-to-keep-your-btc-secure-9826a002043d).

With bitcoin, you either buy with KYC or you don't. Privacy isn't a gradient, it's an on off switch.

When/If you eventually convert all or some of your crispy bitcoin for dirty fiat or buy a product, will you face potential censorship because you completed KYC when you purchased your coins? Or will you face possible censorship because of lack of KYC paper trail? Or will KYC not be an influential factor in future bitcoin commerce?

jwwk71,mimblezimble,A possible reason why Coinbase does not support the trade in stablecoins ...,"If you look at the price page at Coinbase:

[https://www.coinbase.com/price](https://www.coinbase.com/price)

You can see that they do not support the trade in stablecoins (no ""trade"" button).

I think I know why.

Imagine that you could convert a fiat bank wire to a stablecoin (such as USDT). From there on, you could use this USDT at a non-KYC exchange to buy Bitcoin for hodling or trading. If you ever wanted to cash out, you would first convert your Bitcoins back to USDT, and only then convert it back to a fiat bank wire.

Since there are no capital gains in the conversion from fiat bank wire to USDT -- which is all that the KYC-regulated exchange can see -- you would automatically be exempt of capital-gains tax on these transactions. No need to even report them.

Concerning your exchange between USDT and Bitcoin on non-KYC exchanges, these exchanges do not even know who you are and can therefore not report on you. It would be entirely up to yourself to report any capital gains.

Therefore, I believe that the regulator forbids the trade in stablecoins in order to preserve their capital-gains taxation income.

Therefore, the regulator may also ban the trade in their future CBDC (Central-Bank Digital Currencies). If they do not prevent this trade, then their entire capital-gains taxation system will come crashing down.",1605762283,18,0

jxpxzl,ncollier10,Free Bitcoin Algorithmic Trading robot - get set up in 5 minutes with auto mode," Website: [http://algocentric.digital/](http://algocentric.digital/)  


I  am marketing a free Algorithmic trading robot which will allow you to  set up automated trading based on algorithms that have been backtested  against 200k prices/ timeframes, trading Bitcoin/ USD, or other  cryptocurrencies against the dollar. The robot can work with multiple  strategies, algo's, timeframes and with additional parameters such as  stoploss and take profit. It will perform the entire process including  execution of trades on the Bitfinex and KuCoin exchanges.  It is based  on the idea of backtesting all strength/ weakness entry and exit points  and reporting on the best performing backtest so that it can be used for  live trading. The robot has an auto mode (recommended mode) and  advanced mode. In the recommended mode, the highest performing algo in  the backtest for the timeframe designed is presented for use.   Algocentric also provides a secondary product called Trading Discovery  which allows advanced users to experiment with backtesting scenarios to  form their own high performing algorithms for use. Trading Discovery is a  client / server solution that allows central collation of backtests so  that they can be shared which effectively distributes the workload among  users’ machines in a ""grid computing"" type setup.   


I developed  this software myself and have been using the software personally for  several years, and I decided to put it into a distributable package to  see if I can market it, therefore am giving it away for free until  further notice. For clarity, the full functionality is free until  further notice.  The package has a license which is centrally controlled  and can be stopped at any point in time. The product will be free until  further notice.   


The website and product are both Beta versions  i.e. very much ""pop up"" versions which are due to be formalised later if  there is interest in the product. I would appreciate that anyone  interested takes a proper look at the product and comments (as opposed  to Ad Hominem negative comments).

jxo7v7,Technologov,Benchmarking ancient CPU hashing power : Intel Pentium III and Pentium 4 from 20 years ago,"Hi All !

Today I'we got a very ancient Intel Pentium III 933 MHz (from 20 years ago, year 2000) to my private PC collection, and also got a new AMD Ryzen 9 5950X (new arch, Zen 3) this week. Also got an old  Pentium 4 @ 2.80 GHz ""Northwood"" from year 2002.

(The P3 is running Windows XP, and got only 256 MB of RAM, and is a 32-bit CPU, so running modern OSes, Windows 10 or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS), won't fly on it.... maybe Debian in command-line, or keep Windows XP... another obstacle is that most modern benchmarks such as Geekbench 5 and Cinebench R23 require either Windows 7 or 10, and 64-bit CPU)

So, how do I benchmark that ancient machine ?

Fortunately, one way to do that is to run a Bitcoin CPU miner: [https://github.com/pooler/cpuminer](https://github.com/pooler/cpuminer)

I am surprised that Bitcoin CPU miner is able to run on Windows XP on such an ancient CPU, but it did !

\&gt; minerd -a sha256d --benchmark

pentium3-933mhz: 173.51 khash/s (32-bit)

pentium4-2800: 1278 khash/s (32-bit) (NOTE: not sure why is P4 so much faster than a P3 in this particular benchmark, but maybe due to SSE2 optimizations... usually P4 is 2x to 3x faster in most other benchmarks but here 7.3x faster !!)

...

core-2-duo-2.40GHz: 5804 khash/s (64-bit)

core-i9-9900: 142492 khash/s (64-bit)

ryzen-5950x: 274082 khash/s (64-bit)

So, the new CPU is well over 100x times faster (including 64-bit and other optimizations).

...

I actually own a bunch of very old and very new machines, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask !

I even sent them my passport and drivers licence and the name matches, since I have already been verified for two years! I opened up a support ticket and the only response I got was this: (with no explanation which info does not match), makes no sense since I have already used them for 2 years 100% verified.

Answer from them:

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------------------

Thank you for contacting Coinbase Support.  


Financial regulations require Coinbase to verify customer information and make sure the information matches across different documents and verification processes. The information on your identity verification document didn't match the information you originally entered during signup.  


As a result, we recommend you upload an identity verification document that matches the information you entered during the Coinbase sign-up process.  


If you made a mistake when originally entering your information and do not have an identity verification document to match it, you'll need to sign up using a different email address and try again.  


Regards,  
Coinbase Support

Perhaps this would involve splitting hash difficulty across two types of problems, (1) to keep the block solution interval at 10 minutes and (2) to also to direct computing power at other causes with positive externalities.

Alternatively, that second portion of computing power could be sold by the Bitcoin pritocol to paying customers (think the kinds of customers of Google Compute Engine or Amazon EC2), which could effectively subsidize block transaction fees and reduce the cost of sending Bitcoin.

This all comes down to whether the block solution hash difficulty rate could safely be reduced to create space for miners to solve other compute problems.  Since hash difficulty is somewhat arbitrary to keep blocks on a 10 minute pace today, maybe so?

I'm sure I'm misunderstanding something...but it would be amazing to use some of the computing power and electricity spent on Bitcoin mining for additional benefits.",1606143769,5,1

k0aovq,xzclusiv3,Bitcoin Rabbit Hole,"I personally have a hard time explaining my thoughts when it comes to bitcoin. I see so many people posting online about going down the ""bitcoin rabbit hole"" but I’ve never see anyone try to break it down and explain their journey. There are so many fragmented pieces to the entire bitcoin concept as a whole and it takes time for anyone to start to see the bigger picture. I think I finally found a way to break down the major concepts and how they all come together. Or maybe this will make no sense to others, I’m really not sure. I’m sure this journey is unique for everyone but this is my personal experience with bitcoin and why I think it is much bigger than anything we’ve ever known before. It’s both difficult to understand and especially difficult to explain. Hopefully this will help others understand why I see bitcoin as the biggest and best thing to ever be gifted to humanity.

The curiosity stage:

\-First you learn about what bitcoin is in general and brush it off.

\-Then you keep hearing about it here and there and eventually curiosity takes over.

\-Then you start to actually google and understand the concept of the bitcoin as a currency, payment network, protocol.

\-You get hooked and start reading about the mining and bitcoins issuance policy (halvings).

\-You start to realize that this asset is very likely to apreciate in the future and you begin to invest some of your portfolio.

\-You also start to wonder about how fiat works and you go down that rabbit hole.

\-Once you climb out of the fiat rabbit hole you further realize bitcoin will go up in price and invest even more.

\-You then start to learn about all the promises that bitcoin brings to the world like,

The humanitarian benefits stage:

\-Global access to banking and how much that can actually help humanity as a whole. You realize just how unfair it is to those living in third world countries that don’t have access to traditional banking. Bitcoin fixes this.

\-You start to realize the power of a true decentralized system. You realize this is a way to balanced the power between everyone in a fair way. Like the founding fathers of America tried to do, but this system does not require trust in politicians.  You start to realize people will trust code/math instead and that this new system will win in the long run.

\-You begin to realize the benefits of smart contracts and just how much they can bring to the world. You start to see that programmable money makes sense in a digital world. The legacy system required people and institutions to verify just about any transaction. This is no longer needed. Programmable money will be chosen over the legacy system because code and math is less expensive than paying people/institutions/governments. It is also easier to trust code and math over people/institutions/governments so you realize this system will be adopted.

\-You start to realize that bitcoin is hitting all time highs in other countries who’s local fiat currencies are failing from inflation. You realize just how sad it would be to live in a country where you have no access to savings at all. There are people out there that at no fault of their own lose their savings because they have no other options. You start to realize the humanitarian benefits bitcoin offers to these people. It gives them an opportunity to save and preserve their wealth. You realize that bitcoin is a life raft for millions of people due to it’s natural properties (hard cap on total supply, censorship proof, resistant to confiscation, etc)

This is much bigger that I thought stage:

\-You start to realize that the entire concept of bitcoin is much much bigger than you think. You feel like you just started scratching the surface of all the great things that can be built onto bitcoin.

\-After each time you learn about a new possibility like the ones mentioned above you invest more time learning about bitcoin. You typically start increasing your bitcoin portfolio exposure more and more.

\-You start to realize that bitcoin is bigger than just gaining wealth. You start to realize this could be an entire revolution. A humanitarian gift to the world.

\-You dream about all the benefits bitcoin can bring to you, your family, your friends, people who are well off today, people who are poor, literally everyone.

\-The entire concept of bitcoin ends up becoming hope for a better future. It becomes a bit of an addiction. Bitcoin becomes faith for some people. Bitcoin can be viewed as the light at the end of the tunnel. A new beginning.

\-You start to dig into this revolution concept deeper,

Nostalgic for the future stage:

\-You realize that this is indeed a revolution. You start to care less about the possible monetary gains and focus on all the humanitarian benefits for the world.

\-You dream of a great future, you see that this system can do so much more for people than the fiat standard can. You dream about freedom for all, equality and even a future without wars.

\-You realize this system would allow people to unite and innovate in ways not possible before.

\-You see how a bitcoin standard would foster an environment where people will unite. 

        \-You start to see why the fiat standard promotes hate and tension among different races/ethnicities/cultures.

\-You see a world where automation takes over all work and the concept of needing a job to support your family diminishes. It's not about being unemployed as a negative, it's about being freed from having to work at all. Everyone gets more time to spend doing what they love.

\-You beleive people will unite and drive technology forward for the better of humanity.

\-You see a world where people who do work do it just for the benefit of humanity. Simply out of chairty.

    \-You beleive the worlds smartest will lead the way towards better products that last, are made using automation and very affordable for everyone. With the goal of allowing everyone access to these products for basically free to improve humanity.

\-You realize patents will no longer be relevant because people will not need monetary gains from the ideas. This will help us get to the next level of innovation. Being able to create without permission. People will realize if there’s no incentive in holding back ideas from the market that it will be better to let people share and use these ideas freely since the goal is to help everyone/humanity go further.

That has been in general my journey through the bitcoin rabbit hole so far. There have been many distractions along the way as well. I believe just like the universe is ever expanding so will humanity, bitcoin and innovation in general. This might just be the begining of the next era that could change humanity as we know it. At least, that is the way I see it. What do you see?",1606242634,3,1

k07efn,zomgitsduke,I think we're in for the true shakeup: Digital Real Estate,"Hey all, been a sideline observer for years. Barely hold any BTC after making a down payment on a house after ""too good to be true"" earnings. Now... regret just a little bit.

But I've noticed something emerging and I wanted to share it.

Bitcoin is becoming the next wave of Digital Real Estate. Here's how that's happening:

* Companies like Paypal and Greyscale are gathering BTC with no intention to ever sell it back into the market (unless necessary)
* Consumption of the crypto is exceeding the minting process
* You can buy into crypto through these custodial services

These companies are seeing the writing on the wall. Eventually, I think we can expect ""custodial fees"" to be implemented for insurance and upkeep costs. Small amounts, plus a profit incentive.

People ""lite-hodling"" crypto in these companies won't mind paying 0.5% if the value goes up 10% every year. Or, you can hold it yourself and take on the risk. Whatevs, you do you.

But look where things are going. Companies are keeping the crypto and essentially ""renting"" it out to people to take risks on. This sounds a lot like businesses that own buildings and ""rent"" it out to risk-taking individuals. Doesn't really impact the holding company, and they still control the asset.

If I'm right, this is going to be a whole new level of digital real estate laid over the internet. Bitcoin may be the ""NYC"" of crypto, while others become the ""Boston"" and ""LA"", and so forth.

Now, imagine owning 1 acre of Manhattan and what it is worth today... and you can see exactly how this could play out.

Just some thoughts, hope y'all can provide some good discussion here :)",1606232829,30,1

k0mm0r,OkCheerio,HELP: Leaving fiat on an exchange?,"Late night question prompted by what I anticipate is the beginning of the 30% Bitcoin pullback haha. 

I'm a BTC swing trader and often just left considerable sums of fiat on the exchange (very bad idea, I know). But, due to the nature of swing trading (i.e., quickly ""buying the dip""), I couldn't afford the end-to-end processing times that it takes to withdraw fiat back to your bank account, and then when BTC temporarily dips, wire transfer from the bank account back to the exchange (especially since my wire transfers are larger, and international). By the time fiat is back on the exchange, BTC would have gone to the moon and back.

Thus, for online exchanges (and not P2P, or local ATMs) my options would seem to be:

1) Just shut up and leave your fiat on the exchange then?

2) Purchase Stablecoin when selling BTC (i.e., TUSD, PAX, DAI, etc.), and then store it in my cold wallet?

3) Sign up for Silvergate Exchange (they're a bank that wire unlimited fiat to your exchange instantly)?

Any other solutions? Any experience with this? Anybody? Thanks in advance.",1606284828,16,1

   It crossed my mind, I can’t wait for this rally to drive another 50% higher, only to pull back 30%. Seeing the institutional side panic as their leveraged futures plunge. They will learn the lessons many of us long term crypto investors learnt during the last few years! Crypto is volatile, HODL your keys and be happy with 20x from spot prices. 
   If your reading this now, your likely averaged in far below this point. Hold strong, trade, buy the dip but don’t sell with another 2 years of bull market cycle to go!
   Hold the spot crypto whatever that is, ride your favourite altcoins projects to highs never seen before and take profits into the main store of wealth - BITCOIN. 
   I couldn’t help smile, as this future scenario not to far away comes closer. I’ll be buying that dip...  those panic selling institutional whales create, eating up that panic selling bitcoin discount with my altcoin profits!!

   We will be above all time $ price highs in less that a week, we all ready are above in all but the major currencies. Remember that, those of you who are privileged enough like myself to buy in US dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, Pound sterling, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Chinese renminbi, Hong Kong dollar and New Zealand dollar.

It is NOT a good idea to put 100% of your wealth in bitcoin. Only put in what you are willing to lose as it's more than likely bitcoin will crash again before it reaches the price you want to sell at. I was at uni when I first got into bitcoin and it went up in 2017 and I never sold any, mainly due to this sub and everyone saying HODL like your life depends on it.

Matter of fact I thought it was ok to have 80% of my wealth in bitcoin at the time... But of course it all crashed by about 60-70% and stayed this low for a good 2.5 years. In that time I finished uni and got a new house so had to sell some of my coins to pay for this at deflated prices...

So I'm just saying although you might think oh I'll never sell I would rather lose it all than miss out on a big rise. Just think twice about doing this. If you are ever forced to sell, the markets won't necessarily suit you at that time. If you think you'll need the money at any time in the next say 5 years then now is a good time to sell. Your likely taking away a nice profit and won't be stuck in a years time if it all dips. Can always sell just a small amount to cover what might be ahead of you. 

TLDR:: dont be afraid to sell some BTC in these times if you think you'll need some money in the next few years. It's unlikely BTC will never go below 10k again.",1605629186,0,1

I have finally managed to convince my business partner to put some of our cash into Bitcoin. I was telling him at 8K!

I have already completed the request forum with coinbase to setup the business account, But I have a few questions.

Once the account is setup and the BTC brought, from a company perspective if we were to sell said bitcoin say at 50K do we as a company have to pay capital gains tax on this?

I assume we can also do a bank transfer like the retail version of CB Pro?

Anything else I should be considering. I will be moving the Bitcoin off of coinbase once purchased and stored on a Hardware Wallet.

Important information: 

We regret to inform you that we're initiating the closure of your PayPal account. This measure is necessary to protect us from potential financial losses.

Your right to appeal:

We always perform a thorough investigation before deciding to initiate the closure of an account. We appreciate that from time to time misunderstandings can happen. To appeal our decision log in to your PayPal account at [www.paypal.co.uk](http://www.paypal.co.uk) and click 'Contact' at the bottom of any PayPal page.

This decision means we need to oversee the appropriate movement of any money currently in your account. A gradual approach to account closure allows us to part ways, while considering any liabilities that may arise. Our aim is to review any valid buyer claims lodged against you. We need to allow enough time for claims to be filed as these can take several months to be reported and resolved.

How and when will my account balance be released?

1. We'll hold any money currently in your account in accordance with section 2 below. We do this because it provides sufficient time for most claims, such as chargebacks, to be filed by other parties. These claims can result in financial loss. If your account balance is below zero, you'll have to settle the amount owing on your account to avoid further action.
2. Our first review at 30 days from the date of this email will calculate our exposure and we'll release any excess funds to you at that time for withdrawal. We'll communicate this to you at the time. This review can result in 3 different outcomes as detailed in subsections 2(1)-(3) below.

    2.1. We'll release your entire remaining balance to you for withdrawal. Note: If you choose not to withdraw the money at that point we reserve the right to recoup any money at the next review; or 

    2.2. We'll release a part of your remaining balance to you. If so we'll inform you about how much money can be withdrawn. We'll then conduct another review 30 days later that will repeat the process detailed under section 2; or 

    2.3. We won't release any funds to you if we deem our exposure to be greater than or equal to your available balance. 

Your account may be reviewed up to 5 times; at 30 day intervals until day 180 from the date of this email. If any money remains in your account at day 180, it will be made available for withdrawal at that point.

When we part ways with merchants, where insolvency or administration is in place, or in some specific business models, we will usually hold funds up to 180 days.

Accounts with a balance owing to PayPal:

If your account shows an amount owing to us, you need to add funds to make sure that the balance returns to zero. Note: We reserve the right to recover the amount by legal means.

A copy of our User Agreement can be found by clicking 'Legal' at the bottom of any PayPal page and then click 'User Agreement for PayPal Service'. Our right to close your PayPal account, and the retention of funds, are covered in our User Agreement under sections 10.2 and 10.3.

Yours sincerely,

## Transaction ID = 0ea2a8759bf28adf20dc6a0c8c20d27a7ae047b69fb6c24782016a4d0aa51be8

I've been trying to broadcast a transaction with a higher network fee (currently at 65.6/bytes). Whenever I try to increase the fee on electrum, it reduces the amount I am sending to the payee as opposed to reducing my electrum balance. What's more is that the fee rate hasn't even increased?! It's stuck at 65.5/bytes even though I tried bumping. It just keeps getting further away from the tip of the mempool (from 3mb to 5mb). 

&amp;#x200B;

I want this transaction to go through asap, but I don't want to use the increase fee function if it keeps taking money from the amount I'm trying to send/not reflecting... Please can anyone help?",1606388870,2,1

But if we go from 17 to 16500 and suddenly back up at 17k. means 16500 is lowest we can go.  i've witnessed it a couple of times. but I did it this time my self and it worked. :)",1606388813,1,1

k1d8f1,switchitoffbros,Bitcoin Chat App - advice/feedback/join me,"Hello guys,

Looking for advice and maybe some co-founders.

Been thinking of this for a while now and I’m ready to build it. 

I was thinking about building a chat app that gives you sats for using it.

So it would be like a WhatsApp but with its own bitcoin wallet built in for sending between users or moving to another wallet.

Rewards:

1. While you use it you get sats - tiny amounts like 1 sat for every minute you use it 

2. If you recommend a friend via the app and they signup you get 1,000 sats and they get 1,000 sats 

3. Potential yield farming type returns using a DeFi type model by giving rewards in our own ERC20 tokens which can embellish their income for using the platform 

Revenue model:

On Facebook we are the product and they make money from us using it, so here, the monetisation would be two fold:

1. A peer to peer trading network like ebay/amazon with payments via btc, limited transaction sizes fo start with, user reviews etc, a 2% charge on the payment 

2. Optional ads, use can choose to enable ads either anonymised or personalised and if they want to embellish the platform with more detailed information like shirt size etc this would allow for laser targeted ads which the user would get paid for, instead of the network keeping all the ad revenue like Facebook does.

Funding 

I can probably raise $20k for the MVP build

I know there’s a lot to think about and the system being abused etc, but would love your thoughts on it!

It certainly needs refining but with the right minds, your comments good or bad are appreciated! ⬇️",1606388012,0,1
