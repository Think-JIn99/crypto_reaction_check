However my nano S is an older model and I used to use the outdated chrome app. The firmware is not compatible with ledger live and the app won't recognize my device.

Now on march 1st the ratio changed to 14976 sats/share, a decrease of 0.1866% if my math is correct. This happened only 2 weeks in.

the EFT has a 1% management fee. (per year?)

does this look legit?

im thinking fees at this point should be a pro rata of whatever 2 weeks in the year is, (2/52 x 1% = 0.038%).

lwy3r7,BitcoinWide,How to buy a Bugatti with Bitcoin,"Amid bitcoin’s raging price gains — and its volatility — holders who have struck it rich are putting the pedal to the metal on high-end transactions.

In an interview with PYMNTS, Blake Pride-Zorn, general manager of **Vegas Auto Gallery** in Las Vegas, Nevada, said that ultra-luxury autos are a natural fit for spending some of those heady gains as bitcoin trades at around $50,000.

The company made headlines late last year in *The Wall Street Journal* when the dealer sold two high-end sports cars to a customer who paid the bill — topping a whopping $6 million — in bitcoin.

Granted, it’s not like buying coffee. Still, the transaction (as well as the fact that Vegas Auto Gallery gets a reported 3 percent to 5 percent of its top line from bitcoin-related transactions) trains a spotlight on the increasing use of bitcoin as a means to retail, mainstream use cases.

lwwwau,snailmailz,Doing Some Research On Bitcoin Going from 10K to 50K to eventual 250K. Help.,"Hello,

How are you doing everyone? Hodling? Good? I want this to be one centralized (lol centralized) location where we can have a list of reasons why bitcoin went up from 10K to 50K and could likely go up to 250K over the course of the year.

I'll start the list.

\- Coordinated Money Printing - Coordinated Money printing is taking place by several (if not all) of the G7 or G20 countries. This has led asset inflation across the board, real estate, stocks, etc. Cryptocurrency assets, BTC, is responding by accruing value. At the same time, it is important to note here that there are several distractions in the market right now, unlike in 2017, where, the most exciting mover was genuinely BTC and the cryptospace.

\- MSTR BTC purchase - According to Forbes,  **MicroStrategy MSTR** \+2.6% CEO Michael Saylor announced earlier this morning his firm has purchased approximately 328 more **bitcoins** for $15 million in cash, bringing the **total** to $4.45 billion.

\- Tesla 1.5B BTC Purchase earlier in 2021. Their reasoning was they want to preserve value and that it is less risky to hold BTC over concentrating assets in the dollar.

\- *Twitter or Square - Twitter did a recent convertible note offering but that could be for various reasons. Square does hold btc. Source-*   According to Business wire -*Square also announced a $170 million purchase in bitcoin as part of its ongoing commitment to the cryptocurrency*

\- Institutional Investors? I need to do some more research around how many actually stepped in and how many whales we have in the market compared to the prior years. 

\-----  Virginia’s Police Officers’ Retirements System and Employees’ Retirement System came together to invest in blockchain industry organizations such as Bakkt and Coinbase 

\----  Morgan Creek Blockchain Opportunities Fund ($40 Million Funding)

\- Number of open futures contracts?

Looking to add to this list with more data points.

Protonmail and Tutanota are out of the question because they don't allow Tor registrations. Also im not paying for any cloud service.

lwvhig,whut_say_u,Is a 4.000 bytes transaction size normal?,"Hello fellow bitcoiners,

A friend of mine recently bought some bitcoin and noticed that the amount of fees spent were quite large in respect to the bitcoin amount. The tansaction size of the transactions where in the range of 4000 bytes (explaining the large fees) while my recent transactions are in the range of 400 bytes. From the data from https://www.blockchain.com/charts website it seems that a transaction in the hundreds range seems more reasonable.

Id like to be pointed in the direction of some easy to understand info about utxo's and tranactions sizes. I understand that the fees depend on mempool size and transaction size etc., but dont quite understand why this transaction is 4000 bytes. Isnt this abnormal? Secondly is there currently a way to deal with such large transactions besides reducing satoshis/byte?

[There's](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018498.html) [no](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018425.html) [agreement](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018427.html) [on](https://medium.com/@sdaftuar/on-taproot-activation-and-consensus-changes-in-bitcoin-5b3453e91c4e) [activation](https://gist.github.com/achow101/3e179501290abb7049de198d46894c7c), and if an agreement isn't reached then nothing happens. That would be really terrible because we'd miss out on the benefits of taproot and potentially other future soft forks.

A major problem with BIP8 is that it would result to a situation where different parts of the bitcoin ecosystem run different consensus rules. Some people will run LOT=true and others LOT=false. Worst of all, it becomes vulnerable to a twitter/reddit/social media blitz which could attempt to move the date of miner activation around.

Twitter and reddit drama provide a perfect cover for social attacks on bitcoin. 

Forced signalling leads to brinksmanship. Where two or more sides (backed up by social media drama) enter into a game of chicken with deployed nodes. If one of them doesn't concede then we get a damaging chain split. And the $1 trillion in value that the bitcoin network protects is put at risk. From the point of view of a miner or big exchange stuck in the middle, if they look at the ecosystem of twitter and reddit (especially if you think about all the problems with bots and sockpuppets) they have no idea which consensus rules they should actually follow and exactly what date they take effect. Miners, exchanges, merchants and the rest of the ecosystem exist to serve their customers and users, and trouble happens when they don't know what their customers really want. Social media attacks are not just a theoretical concern; back during the block size drama, the bitcoin reddits were [targetted by bots](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4biob5/research_into_instantaneous_vote_behavior_in/), [sockpuppets](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/41ykkt/members_trying_to_destroy_bitcoin_on_this_thread/cz6ccka/?context=3) and [brigading](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3v04pd/can_we_please_have_a_civil_discussion_about/cxjnz1d/?context=1).

Enter flag day activation. With a flag day there can be no brinksmanship. A social media blitz cant do anything except have its own followers fork away. Crucially, miner signalling cant be used to change the activation date for nodes that didn't choose to and just passively follow signalling. Changing the activation date requires all those users to actually run different node software.

Flag day activation works simply: we choose a block height and after that block height the new taproot rules become enforced.


Supporters of the permissionless, ""users rule"" approach of LOT=true should be happy because it completely takes miners out of activation.

Supporters of the safe, conservative approach of LOT=false can be made happy with a few ways of derisking:

* Getting mining pools, businesses and users to look at the code and ask if they (a) think its either neutral or good for their business or use case and (b) they believe others view it similarly and that the consensus changes proposed have a good social consensus around them.

* Setting the flag day far in the future (18 months or 2 years in the [original proposal](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018495.html)).


**What if flag day activation is used maliciously?**

What if one day the Core developer team is co-opted and uses the flag day method to do something bad? For example, a soft fork where sending to certain blacklisted addresses is not allowed. The bitcoin user community who wants to resist this can create their own counter-soft-fork full node, where the first block after the flag day MUST pay to one of those addresses on the blacklist. This forces a chain split between the censorship rules and the no-censorship rules, and its pretty obvious that the real bitcoin which most people follow will be the chain without censorship.

For example, if a group of users didn't agree with taproot then they could create their own counter-flag-day-activation which requires that a transaction is included that does an invalid-spend from a taproot output in the first block after the flag day height.

This is always possible with any user activated soft fork. In BIP8 LOT=true it could be done by rejecting block headers with certain version bits signalled.


**But it will take so long!**

We seem to be at a deadlock now. This will take less time than any other method, because other methods might never happen. BIP8 is dead and from what I see there's no other credible plan.

We've already waited years for taproot. I remember listening to talks about bitcoin from 2015 of people discussing Schnorr signatures. And given how slow segwit and p2sh adoption were its pretty likely that we'll waiting a while for taproot to be actually adopted.


**A social media blitz could still try to activate it early**

The brinksmanship only works because miner signalling can make many other nodes activate early, even if those other nodes didn't do anything. There can't be a game of chicken that puts the bitcoin network at risk.

If a group of people did adopt alternative node software which has a shorter flag day, they actually have a risk of slow blocks. Because they cant trick or force any other nodes to come along with them, they are likely to only have a small economy and therefore would lose a lot of hashrate. Imagine trading bitcoins for cash in person and instead of waiting 10 minutes for a confirmation you have to wait 3 hours because the blocks are slow.

Also, the argument for downloading and running a different software only to speed up activation is pretty weak. Taproot would activate in ~18 months, so why are you so impatient that you need it in 6 months? And risk slow blocks for you while doing so? The big difference with BIP148 the segwit UASF, is that people *had to* run some other software otherwise they would get *no soft fork at all*.


**Without miner signalling how do we know the new rules are even activated?**

When did you see miners signalling their support for the inflation schedule?

Bitcoin's rules are enforced by wallets backed by full nodes. You'll always know if your own full node is enforcing the new rules. The thing that matters isnt miner signalling but your own full node, and the nodes of those you trade with.

Flag day activation is quite similar to the way block reward halvenings work. At and after block height 630000 miners are only allowed to create 6.25 BTC rather than 12.5 BTC. Everyone knows that if miners continued to create 12.5 BTC or more they would be unable to sell or spend those coins anywhere.

In 2017 when segwit was being activated people created a huge list of various bitcoin companies, merchants and wallets: https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111943/https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/ Looking at that list, you would know that if someone stole coins from a segwit address they would be unable to deposit them in many exchanges and merchants: Bitrefill, Bitstamp, Kraken, Localbitcoins, Paxful, Vaultoro, HitBTC, etc.

Then what happened is only a month after S2X was beaten this guy moved 40000 BTC to a segwit address, confident about the power of the network to protect his coins.
https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7tcmi4/bitcointalks_famous_user_loaded_moved_his_40k_btc/

If there's ever any doubt about flag day activation we can always draw up a similar list, although if there's broad consensus about it then there's no reason why bitcoin businesses wouldn't upgrade to the latest Core, like they did with every other previous soft fork.


**This gives the impression that Core developers control the protocol**

This objection has a mirror image argument: BIP8 with LOT=false gives the impression that miners control the protocol(!)

Eventually some group has to make a decision. We will ask the bitcoin economy and users what they think of flag day activation. It's pretty clear that nobody seriously objects to taproot, and as described above if Core developers did something evil the community could resist it with a counter-flag-day-activation.



**TL;DR**

I believe flag day activation is the way forward. It should answer all the objections and risks which make other methods too controversial. Let's go ahead and bring taproot to bitcoin!",1614782539,273,61

Causes of the ban.

* investors invest to get some profit. there is no point in investing in digital rupees except it shows some improvement.

I got into crypto only about two month ago, invested probably a bit more than I can afford to lose, made couple of small mistakes, but overall I had a great experience so far mainly thanks to this community. I've never used Reddit or any other online community much before but being here definitely saved me from staying up all night checking my portfolio and panic selling whenever it 'dips'. Last Monday (22/2), I earned around $1200 for a freelance job so I immediately used it all to buy BTC and ETH and in a couple of hours I watched my portfolio slowly shrink as the market went down. I came here right away and got over my anxiety in no time ❤️

Most of the people I know don't care about crypto currency and would only think I'm a bit crazy and reckless doing such investment. On the other hand, I'm extremely enthusiastic about it but don't want to recommend doing the same thing to my friends as I know I will be the one to take the blame if they lose their money. How do you actually talk about it with your family or friends?

Anyway, I wish this space continues to grow and other newcomers can experience the same form of support as I did. You prepared me to HODL for years to come even if any real big correction will happen soon. I also try to check my portfolio less often but that will still need a lot effort since it's so addictive.

This really is an anti-thesis to the ideals of crypto for which anonymity is a major premise.

From talking nonchalantly to many newbies investing in crypto, it appears to me that many do not understand that coinbase (among others) can easily record who you are and where your bitcoins go for the rest of your life. Everything is on the blockchain and as AI improves, it will become easy to type in an address and get a google maps like navigational path of where you were and what you bought.

Do any of you see this as an issue to Bitcoin (and to other cryptos)?

m1fh3h,SirFuckingLoin,"Microsoft own GitHub, but Gates says that crypto is a technology that literally leads to death. How come?","*This week I came across* [*an old article about the 18* ](https://www.zdnet.com/article/riaa-blitz-takes-down-18-github-projects-used-for-downloading-youtube-videos/)*projects that were removed from GitHub at the request of the RIAA. The main target of the locks was the youtube-dl project, a Python library that was used in many tools and services for copying YouTube videos.*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v0dayfr5b2m61.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2017206e036c9a0c41e2e7fa715a3da4e9984cbe

Moreover, no specific claims were made. The blocking occurred on the basis of a simple appeal of this type: youtube-d was allegedly created with the sole purpose of stealing music and videos from services such as YouTube. Naturally, this is all not true. But now in the post-truth world, such stories surprise no one.

In June 2018, [when Microsoft bought GitHub for $ 7.5 billion](https://www.investopedia.com/news/microsoft-bought-github-75-billion-embracing-open-source/), the community actively discussed the topic of dependence of 90% of free software, which located its repositories on GitHub from the global software giant. GitHub is the largest repository of software code and the largest community of programmers on the planet. Many have spoken out in favor of creating an independent platform for open source software repositories. But over the past 2 years, almost nothing has been done.

Unless, of course, we do not count the Chinese analogue of Gitee, which now already contains more than 10 million repositories and is used by more than 5 million programmers. But you need to understand that China is not an ideal place to create a truly independent platform. By the way, GitHub itself in China is blocked by a Chinese firewall.

But the most interesting thing is that the only place where the bitcoin code lies and is regularly updated is precisely GitHub, which belongs to the same corporation of goodness and justice - Microsoft, which always cares about us.

*And where is the guarantee that one day some other private company that cares about the happy future of all mankind, will not write such a letter saying that bitcoin was created for drug trafficking and terrorist financing and therefore GitHub should delete the bitcoin repository?*

There are no guarantees. Moreover, it will be surprising and suspicious if this does not happen. For example after the launch of the digital dollar.

Naturally, the community can create a mirror of the bitcoin repository on the bitcoin.org website, as they actually did in the youtube-dl project, but it looks very crooked and there is no programmer cooperation functionality, version history and much more.

Probably, the bitcoin community should think about this in the near future. Otherwise, the kind uncle Billy, who claims to be no less than the savior of the world, can bring down the market with one call. (after opening a short position.))

Two years ago, Bill Gates made a splash  with his [claim that cryptocurrency is a rare technology that literally leads to death](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43239781).

Say USA, China, Euro get together and commit to forcing all miners and nodes to hard fork into running BTC USA, BTC China, BTC Euro at the same time. With bitcoin now weakened into multiple forks occurring simultaneously, and less countries allowing the bitcoin core client to run within their borders, BTC now becomes more vulnerable to attack.

m1e3iq,Wrong_Run6589,Cashing out your crypto is a really bad idea,"As I am sure many of you saw recently, the annual IRS “boogie men” are giving their annual warning that they are watching for you cashing out of cryptos for cash.  This year, it’s called Operation Hidden Treasure https://www.coindesk.com/irs-operation-hidden-treasure-unreported-crypto, and a reminder to everyone that unless you like paying massive fines, or going to jail for tax evasion, any conversion of crypto profit to cash is a taxable event and must be paid.

So, it’s far better to keep your earnings in crypto (preferably BTC or some stable coin if you must) than to sell it off to go buy that house, or car, or whatever.  With cash becoming so inflationary soon, I don’t know why anybody would do that anyway.   Think of crypto like that 401k that, in only a few more years, will allow you to retire very early and live the good life.

I would venture to say that the average person is in the workforce for 30-40 years. 

This is a special moment in time for Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) before it goes mainstream. As such, prices are up, but when it actually reaches mass adoption, the price will hockey stick up and to the right from here. 

Why not devote *this* year... just *one year* to acquiring Bitcoin? What does that hurt?

If you end up being wrong, you still have 29-39 more years to invest in 401k, blah blah blah. 

*But* if you happen to be right and Bitcoin does explode, the single year that you devoted to investing in it could be monumental, life changing money.

**Mining pools attack**: This would be difficult to pull off, but China could theoretically force several mining pool owners operating in China to do their bidding. Would be enough for a 51% attack, but miners would probably quickly abandon said mining pool and join another one. (if you are mining for a Chinese pool, might be worth considering switching to some smaller ones. SlushPool is the one I would choose, there was a thread saying how they kept payouts for the rightful owners for more than 7 years)  


**Big players trying to change the game**: SegWit2X [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/SegWit2x](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/SegWit2x) where BitPay managed to ruin its reputation. Still can happen in the future when there is no consensus.   


**Government ban:** Thanks to big players joining in, this is less and less likely and it could backfire. Another move might be to heavily tax crypto. (inflation pumps price &gt;&gt; here is your taxable profit)

I thought the halvening was supposed to limit it to 6.25 from 12.50 BTC. If 7 BTC is being claimed, doesn't it theoretically mean more than 21 million BTC can exist?   


What I thought is that, if less blocks were mined per hour, reward should be be spread out as well, but that doesn't make sense since BTC follows halvening based on blocks and not time.

m1cl78,SirFuckingLoin,Gates says that crypto is a rare technology that literally leads to death," *This week I came across* [*an old article about the 18* ](https://www.zdnet.com/article/riaa-blitz-takes-down-18-github-projects-used-for-downloading-youtube-videos/)*projects that were removed from GitHub at the request of the RIAA. The main target of the locks was the youtube-dl project, a Python library that was used in many tools and services for copying YouTube videos.*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3thkmtjtn1m61.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b457fb323cc347747322a5049b17dc0d9e9ced6

Moreover, no specific claims were made. The blocking occurred on the basis of a simple appeal of this type: youtube-d was allegedly created with the sole purpose of stealing music and videos from services such as YouTube. Naturally, this is all not true. But now in the post-truth world, such stories surprise no one.

In June 2018, [when Microsoft bought GitHub for $ 7.5 billion](https://www.investopedia.com/news/microsoft-bought-github-75-billion-embracing-open-source/), the community actively discussed the topic of dependence of 90% of free software, which located its repositories on GitHub from the global software giant. GitHub is the largest repository of software code and the largest community of programmers on the planet. Many have spoken out in favor of creating an independent platform for open source software repositories. But over the past 2 years, almost nothing has been done.

Unless, of course, we do not count the Chinese analogue of Gitee, which now already contains more than 10 million repositories and is used by more than 5 million programmers. But you need to understand that China is not an ideal place to create a truly independent platform. By the way, GitHub itself in China is blocked by a Chinese firewall.

But the most interesting thing is that the only place where the bitcoin code lies and is regularly updated is precisely GitHub, which belongs to the same corporation of goodness and justice - Microsoft, which always cares about us.

*And where is the guarantee that one day some other private company that cares about the happy future of all mankind, will not write such a letter saying that bitcoin was created for drug trafficking and terrorist financing and therefore GitHub should delete the bitcoin repository?*

There are no guarantees. Moreover, it will be surprising and suspicious if this does not happen. For example after the launch of the digital dollar.

Naturally, the community can create a mirror of the bitcoin repository on the bitcoin.org website, as they actually did in the youtube-dl project, but it looks very crooked and there is no programmer cooperation functionality, version history and much more.

Probably, the bitcoin community should think about this in the near future. Otherwise, the kind uncle Billy, who claims to be no less than the savior of the world, can bring down the market with one call. (after opening a short position.))

My issue is I've already connected my bank account with my debit card on CB and now I cant use it to purchase coins without getting the message ""This debit card has already been added to this account."" So it's basically forcing me to go through the waiting process.

   I'm just wondering if I remove my bank from my payment methods if I'll be able to add my debit card again and do instant transactions. The only reason I haven't already tried it is because I'm still waiting on the $120 BTC I bought to finish going through the bank transfers and I'm worried if I remove my bank before that happens it will cancel the transaction.

m3se49,NumberOneAltAccount,Is this non-profit being shady about their Bitcoin transactions?,"Hello!

I'm hoping people far wiser than I can help us untangle this. A non-profit in Nigeria, The Feminist Coalition, helped fund their End SARS movement (similar to BLM in America) that recently released an accounting report, with a full audit to follow.

The organization is being scrutinized like none that I've seen before. People are finding fault in many things that appear to be innocent and are easily explained. However, the debate about the BTC transactions stumps me. I don't know enough to know whether there is anything suspicious about what they released. There are many Twitter ""experts"" weighing in, but it's hard to sort the facts from the noise. 

Is anybody willing to dive in and help us understand whether or not we should be suspicious of what they're saying about Bitcoin? Regardless, the whole thing is a fascinating look into how Bitcoin is changing the world by funding revolutions and giving accountants massive headaches. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to share whatever comes out of this discussion with my Twitter following. For reasons too complicated to explain, I somehow became a minor influencer in Nigeria.

m3s9d9,s-ro_mojosa,What does it take to be a bitcoin wallet developer and where do I learn this stuff?,"Serious question: what does one have to know to develop a bitcoin wallet? I'm keenly aware that bitcoin and other Satoshi-style cryptocurrency isn't one technology, it's several:

* The cryptographic data store that we call a wallet.
* The blockchain datastructure itself.
* The distributed ledger.
* The consensus algorithm.
* Probably several other things that I'm forgetting about just now.

I know that some wallets depend upon the bitcoin-qt wallet and just make RPC calls to it. I think Armory does (did?) this. I think libbitcoin makes it possible to dispense with the qt-client and just make a C-style native call from whatever language you happen to be using, but I'm not 100% sure.

So, I sort of get it. But, I know I'm missing a lot and want to dig in deeper. It's one thing to have a high level understanding of some of the bits involved. It's quite another to be able to implement these things or leverage an existing library to build upon these technologies in innovative ways.

So.... where do I learn this stuff?",1615586376,8,1

Ever since the talks about the Bitlicense, I have been going after these corrupts politicians across the United States. They will fall but if we, as a community, don't get up, they will be replaced by the same people.

I posted this tweet:  **https://twitter.com/TheoBitcoin/status/1370484457073995776?s=20** but fighting the power to be requires more than just speak up, it requires speaking out and holding these elected official to the fire. 

**This is not a win but just an opening of the door. It's time for US Bitcoiners to use that opening to frame the Bitcoin debate.**

m5xeyr,SubstantialCarpet6,Why do I still believe Craig Wright Could Be Satoshi? (I’ve been reading up on this for years.),"So maybe I’m a complete idiot, but I’ve been reading a bunch about Craig Wright and listening to his videos and I don’t necessarily think him being Satoshi would be such a bad thing for bitcoin. But for some reason, the idea that Craig Wright could be Satoshi absolutely infuriates people to the point of not even wanting to talk to me about it. 

That’s fine, but just imagine for one second that Craig Wright really is on the spectrum like he claims, and does have Aspergers. 

And then, also imagine that he did create Bitcoin and no longer has access to any of his old private keys or any of his old bitcoin for reasons unknown to me. 

Is it possible, that because he has trouble expressing emotions which he admitted to in interviews, he would potentially be very upset at the direction that bitcoin has gone and also at the fact that he no longer has access to his coins, but also be totally unable to express it in any way other than logic i.e. him taking (seemingly) logical hits at Gavin Anderson and Hal and a bunch of the original folks who worked on bitcoin,,, because if my theory is true, he would have deep-seeded resentment for all of them for allowing bitcoin to evolve in the way it did.

I also liked this theory, because it still means bitcoin could potentially still become a world asset reserve and everything else is Bitcoiners think it could be. All this could happen with or without Craig Wright that’s why I don’t understand why people get so upset at the idea that Satoshi is him. 

Can someone briefly explain to me why Craig Wright being Satoshi is such a bad thing? 

Can someone also point me towards something that proves this otherwise? 

Thanks so much, and please don’t waste your time replying with the typical “shut up this is a dumb idea” response. The more I actually read about Craig Wright the more I think it’s him and I think that’s what sets me apart from most others is they haven’t actually taken a dive into this shit and read any of his patents or papers or publications. The guy has like 17 degrees and is probably too smart for his own good. He says a lot of dumb shit and Too and I think that’s why people dismiss the idea.",1615857222,3,1
m5xexg,jam-hay,"The third theft: Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) Vs Bitcoin ""Digital Assets""","**The three great thefts**

If you hadn't heard, central banks all over the world have plans to hijack Bitcoins technology and roll out their own digital Currencies.

They're moving fast on this, some may say almost as fast as they moved to class Bitcoin as a ""Digital Asset"" as tax investigators knocked on the doors of major exchanges.

This at a time crypto had a speck of global wealth invested in it.

**Theft one - Gold**

If you're well versed in the history of money you'll be aware that promissory notes were issued in exchange for gold at banks. These were essentially paper IOUs that became the fiat currency we use today.

These notes were backed by the gold in vaults and therefore were actual paper assets.

This all changed when governments started abolishing the ""gold standard"".

This meant that the bits of paper were no longer backed by gold.

If it hadn't been for this slight of hand/ theft people would still have had their original scarce gold..an asset.

This is identical to what bitcoin is today.. both a store of value/asset and a currency. 

**Theft two - Quantitative Easing**

It's no secret that bitcoin adoption is also hedge against government's and central banks attempts to avoid/ postpone economic catastrophe from their latest experiment.. quantitative easing.

This essentially involves debasing the fiat currency supply by essentially printing and pumping new money in to system.


**Theft Three - Bitcoin technology/ bitcoin taxation""


The digital yuan, Euro, Pound, Ruble.. if you DYOR you'll quickly see that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) are in development or even well underway.

All of initial planning suggests that these government issued digital Currencies will essential hijack a form of bitcoins blockchain technology.

O.k. this trickery requires a little concentration.

- we did have an asset and currency - Gold 

 - Then we did have currency backed by an asset - promissory notes. 

We would have still had assets / an asset linked currency had it not been the theft of gold and abolishment of the gold standard.

Today we have bitcoin which is fundamentally what we had back before the theft of our gold.. both a currency and asset.

However...

Around the world Government's have predominantly reclassified Bitcoin solely as an asset.

In fact many have gone to great lengths only to refer to them as digital or crypto assets instead of Currencies.

Interestingly, although looking to use the same Bitcoin blockchain tech they are solely refering to their own currencies as Currencies not assets?

Infact at a recent ECB CBDC seminar they drew bitcoin in a box by itself as an asset class at the complete opposite side from their proposed CBDC which would effectively been the exact same thing, had they not abolished the gold standard and debased fiat through printing.

Why have they decided to completely reclassify and associate Bitcoin as something completely different than their own proposed CBDC?

The third theft - cryptocurency taxation.

Now they've destroyed any reminisce of fiat even resembling an asset, it's been hard to really tax it as such. As a result, in most countries personal money is not taxed or it's very low. 

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on the other hand.. they are subject to tax by default.   not only that but far more significant taxes compared to fiat due to price disparity after frequent rounds of debasing fiat.

The more fiat is debased, the bitcoin appreciates and the more tax they can collect.

Fast forward 10 years when we're all used to paying our crypto taxes.

You will more than likely have:

CBDC's built like Bitcoin but incurr little to no taxation

Vs 

Bitcoin - the exact same (or would have been if it wasn't for abolishment of the gold standard) but taxed.

Now bitcoin had been reclassified by many Government's, whos to say it ain't also have it's own additional tax applied to it above capital gains.

Taxation on bitcoin compared with CBDC will be the third tax.

As Governments are still in the CBDC planning phase we still have time to campaign for fair taxation between Central Bank Digital Currencies and our own cryptocurrencies.

If they're going to steal our tech, the can at least have the decency to apply the same taxation classes?

My main concern with this post is that I don't feel as though I have a clear understanding of which applications allow you to purchase and hold the ACTUAL crypto itself. From what I have researched, it seems like most the applications facilitating trading allow you purchase derivatives rather than the actual coin itself. Is this true for the most part? Which ones offer the actual crypto in purchasing? 

I don't really transact in crypto ever, it is just more of a hedge on inflation and the US dollar as I see it. My main plan is to use it like any other investment and hodl for quite a long period of time (I'm young and willing to sink a growing % of my income into this sector without pulling out for say 20-30 years at least, as I won't ever invest more than I can afford to completely lose). Its one of those things where I don't really plan on using the crypto ever per say, but I want to actually own it in case I would like to someday (rather just hold a trading asset like the derivatives to which if shit hit the fan for the US dollar could end up unfulfilled and useless as well). 

I recently opened a coinbase account as it came as the top recommended place to use from some brief googling, but I was hoping to crowdsource some opinions about it. Is the crypto you purchase on there actually the crypto? Or is coinbase just another application selling derivatives?

As block rewards reduce exponentially (as early as 2040) how would bitcoin encourage people to continue mining in order to maintain the security of the network? Reduced difficulty and miners just means a 51% attack is just around the corner. That is not a lot of security to store value.

You can correct me if I'm wrong.

I do think coinswitch kuber is not a safe place to store crypto. No where on the website is mentioned where user's crypto is saved. Hot wallets? Cold wallets? Where do they actually store user's crypto?

I have attached email conversations with their customer care executives and the do not have a clue.

People should be aware of the risk they take when they store their crypto on their exchange. Hacks on crypto exchanges have been increasing day by day and it's not at all a safe place to store our crypto on exchanges especially if a crypto exchange is not mentioning anything about security on the website.

Do it with your own risk.

Crypto Fan.",1615999117,0,1
m74i9n,modpizza,Whats the best bear case for btc?,"Hey There!

I am relatively new to btc and only hold about .015btc that I purchased a few weeks ago. I have been doing a bit of research lately and am STRONGLY considering purchasing 1 btc and locking it away for a long time. To do so, I would be taking about 70% of my positions out of the stock market and rolling to btc... so its a significant cost. I feel very clear on the bear case for doing so...

That said, I am having trouble finding a strong (or well thought out) bear case. Lots of outlets seem to just rage some version of ""bitcoin is stupid, it isnt real, people who like bitcoin are stupid, its a bubble"". While I am still feeling very positive, I would like to read through some well thought out arguments as to why btc might fail before taking that big leap...

m73q06,SeanyBlaze,Is your bank not allowing you to buy bitcoin?,"I've seen a lot of questions in the daily lately about banks not allowing transactions to crypto exchanges. I'm one of the people who encountered this, so i decided to find a solution.

I started buying with my debit card because that is still working, but after a while the fees really start adding up. If you don't care about that then perfect, this isn't for you.

Here's what i did.

* Open a free account with revolut (if you know more services like this leave it in the comments).
* Send money from bank account in local currency.
* open a euro account and convert the money.
* open up coinbase pro and click link new account.
* enter the BIC and IBAN numbers from your revolut euro account, and the bank name should be ""Revolut"".
* from the revolut app enter the CB bank info you get, and make sure that the reference number is correct.
* Make a test transaction and if you did everything right it should show up in a few minutes.
* after that you'll have it saved so you can just send right away and know it's the right info.

This cost me $0 to make the transfers and once everything is set up it's super simple. 

That being said i dont trust revolut, i would never keep my money in their account and i definitely wouldn't buy crypto on their platform.

I'm posting this because i had to spend a lot of time searching old threads on forums to figure everything out when my bank stopped my crypto habit.. Hope this helps you!

My reading tells me it stores my private key to send bitcoin from my wallet, but that my wallet actually only exists in cyberspace and not on the device itself... is this true?

I am struggling with [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com). They are illegally keeping my money now. There is some error on their end which doesn't allow me to send BTC that I have on my wallet. I am always getting an error "" Your Bitcoin transaction failed to send. Please try again. ""  


I sent a ticket to the support team, and the first answer was that I should try clearing cache and cookies, changing my browser, trying incognito Chrome, updating their app. I did all of that even before they advised me and it didn't help me. The issue is still there.  
Then I answered that email and no answer so far. I then filled another ticket explaining that error and also explaining those steps that I did to be sure they won't give me the same answer. No answer and then I wrote another one and rated them negatively. On that ticket, I got also some braindead answer like I was some kind of moron that is using the internet for the first time. They asked me am I sure I am trying to send the money from the right wallet. I have only one active wallet and that is the only wallet I was ever using without problem. I also answered on that and of course no answer from them. Guess that if they answer again it will be another stupid c/p answer until they empty their bag full of stupid answers.  
I am running in the circles at this point, there is no support from them, just some random stupid answers. If they aren't scammers they have some serious bug on their end which makes people losing money, struggling and not being able to log into accounts, withdraw money or simply transfer their money to another wallet, yet all they are doing is delaying and stalling.

Any way to contact some higher instance or CEO? Or do you guys know some good lawyer that can help me sue them and get my money out of their wallet?",1616933864,6,1
mf08l6,SilverBackRetard,[Discussion] BTC as a battery – And why you should NOT necessarily look at BTC as a dirty carbon emitter,"Fellow Bitcoiners,

I came across this short idea that BTC is driving the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Sound controversial? It is, but let me try to explain...

This comes back to the concept of what a battery is: ""if you can translate electricity into something that can be used anywhere at any time, then you have a battery""

Crypto mining converts electricity into value in the form of coins, which can be moved, exchanged, or HODLd. If we think of Bitcoin as a battery, the possible applications are varied and exciting.

Now of course it does not change the fact that it would be best if BTC was only mined through either excess energy in the grid or fully renewable energy, but maybe we'll get there at some point.

Just found it interesting as food for thought!

meyr8s,ANAL-Inverter-2000,Yall noobs think your gov can ban crypto. Think again.,"This is a rant and I apologize beforehand for hurting feelings and not choosing the best words. I'm drunk and I need to have a word with you noobs. I've seen people discussing the possibility that governments could ban Bitcoin and *omg how bad the big gov controls everything! What if they outlaw it? Or tax it? Or regulate it? Or kill then exchanges???*

Let me say it clear: most of you cyber noobs have no effing idea what cryptography, decentralized networks like the torrent network, and ultimately crypto currency are capable of.

You're thinking in legacy system terms. You're thinking, ""Oh no the economic value of my coins can go down because they control the exchanges"". You don't get it. Maybe you don't even realize what your crypto actually is. For many of you, crypto is a vehicle to attain more power in legacy meat space. I get it, it's hard to think outside of the box and think beyond your own cognitive barriers. But it's way bigger thank what your frightened, conditioned, slave mentality brain can even start to grasp.

What crypto does, among other things:
* it doesn't care what your exchange rate is
* it doesn't care how good your on and off ramps are
* it doesn't care about your local law
* it doesn't care about censorship
* it even doesn't care about any of your meat space physical boundary conditions, other than the hash rate, connectivity, and the network topology of the network

It's a fucking cyber honey badger but most of you guys are stuck with their mind in the ""but but but what if the big guys take it away from us"" mindset. I'm so happy that the success of this project does not depend on whether people's feelings are aligned with the cryptographic reality of it. 

Let me add only this: if it were possible to turn this thing off, It would be turned off already. None of your govs would have let it become what it is now. If they could have. They have tried to kill the torrent network for ages. Guess what, I've just seeded another terabyte this month. And I'm going to keep doing it, even if it means that I need to get a freaking satellite internet connection for doing so.

meyjm6,NebuLa32,Why proof of stake will not work (in the short term) or why Bitcoin understands and caters to Human Nature," What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a protocol that aims to achieve consensus of strangers in a value exchange. It achieves this task by making sure everyone in the network is on the same page or “block”. While the Blockchain is just a long book with all transactions ever taken on the network, what makes Bitcoin the genius invention is the understanding of human nature. To make sure everyone plays by the rules, it makes cheating ether A. Not as profitable as playing by the rules or B. So expensive in form of raw force needed that it is just not worth it.

Having understood the fundamentals is key to see why proof of stake will (yet) not work in the short term, or at least on the same scale as PoW.

While most people argue that the energy consumption is the key factor of why proof of stake is necessary, it ignores the main driving force in human wealth accumulation: Greed.

It should be considered that Bitcoin digitalized our need for automatic consensus in an exchange, while at the same time triggering pretty much all primal impulses.

What the Chyperpunk movement understood is:

Humans are lazy (Automatic Consensus, everyone can mine)

Humans are greedy (Automatic difficulty scaling that is key to security)

Humans want everything now (Instant gratification in mining)

Humans try everything to cheat the system for own gain (Unprofitable to cheat)

Humans blame others (“Inventor” Vanished, Bitcoin is self-sustaining and cannot be stopped)

Human nature

While most of first world inhabitants take their surroundings for granted and mostly ignore the problems of others, nearly 22% of all living humans are in Poverty. 35-40% do not have a Bank account or access to the banking system. A lot of smarter people than me got into this problem on why we willingly destroy the planet and abusing and using others directly or indirectly with our actions but you can boil it down to one thing: Greed. As one of the seven vices in culture and literature, it perfectly fits into why we are what we are. Tracing the start of a commodity to the end of production, you will almost always find a human right violation until it is on your table. While this is a known fact, not many people really care about it: “That’s how the system works.”. How could they care in the tangle of life? This fact is woven into the protocol. While i highly doubt the inventors are too stupid to understand the consequence of mining, it is catered to our nature. In some terms – criticizing mining is criticizing human nature. This critic is of course necessary, but will only take roots in a long time span. One of the main drivers on why we don’t burn ourself on the stake anymore, at least here, is this critique over time but I would argue that most of it has to do with a. Making things easy AND friendly to humans / nature b. Education.

While things get better over time, the proof lies in itself because we are still here, ultimately it is foolish to believe that people will change in one or two or three generations. 

Greed

While greed is only one of the vices, it fits very good into why Bitcoin is so successful. Not only counters it our will to betray anyone for more, the protocol itself has a fail-save for our own broad term stupidity. While there is no Human that distributes coins, the main problem is solved. With making it unprofitable or less profitable to cheat the system, the second problem is solved. 

The simple genius solution to greed is: No Human distributor. 

Now proof of stake does the same, but:

PoW also caters to something more. Anyone can put muscle into it. Anyone can “physicly” participate. Its not a random number or lottery where you put money in and hope for better odds and more money. It is actual work that can be made and seen. Now you can build the smartest PoS system but I will bet anything it will not get the same participation in the short term as the Bitcoin network has.

It caters to more vices.

Future

While I genuinely believe that bitcoin is one of the greatest invention with the internet (and many more) to bring humans away from destroying themselves, I also have my problems with the energy consumption. In the long term I can see banking swallowed and all smaller jobs in Finance/Archiving/Proofing that are not programming the system will be gone. We will invent chips that use less energy and go away from anything that is not sustainable. At least in the first and second world countries. You cannot expect anything from anyone that has problems putting food on the table or has no clean water.

In the short term we will choose the system that caters best to our vices.

In the long term we will use those systems to save us all.

meyhzf,enivid,The power of RBF and how it saved my ass,"RBF (replace-by-fee) is Bitcoin's feature, which lets you send the same transaction (double-spend) with a higher fee. The great thing about RBF is that you can send the second transaction to a different address, effectively cancelling the original transaction.

Yesterday, I fucked up by sending 20x intended size transaction using a Bitcoin Core client. Luckily, the RBF was enabled for the transaction. Unluckily, Bitcoin Core can only bump up the fee and cannot double-spend to cancel the transaction. So I had to install Electrum, dump my wallet with Bitcoin Core, import the private keys to Electrum, and then double-spend to cancel the transaction from Electrum. Thanks to the low fee I set for the original transaction and the current size of the mempool, I had enough time to do all this and save my money.

So, the moral of the story: 

1. Double-check the transaction amount before sending.
2. Enable RBF for all your transactions.
3. Don't set too high fees on your transactions.
4. If you fuck up your transaction, it can still be saved if you act quickly enough.",1616925279,21,1

mew9xn,JustForThis1980,"How is the crypto you own ""actually stored"" when in coinbase, a wallet, or other location?","Hi all,

I'm looking for a kindergarten way of explaining how coins/tokens are owned (in reality) while in an exchange account or wallet.  From what I understand, while in an exchange the actual crytpo is in somewhat of an ocean of mass ownership (within the exchange) and it's only actually ""in your possession"" if you use your seed phrase/key to transfer it to cold storage (Ledger, SecuX, etc.) otherwise it's in a sort of general population/pool that the exchange owns.  Is this accurate?  Is this also the same while in the coinbase wallet (or other wallet)?

If that is true, then is having your seed phrase engraved on a ""Metal Storage Card"" just securing your portion of that overall pool of crypto?  If so, do you have to have an active account with that exchange to have access to your crypto or is all you need the seed phrase?

My Coinbase Wallet was just compromised (I have no idea how it happened) and it was drained.  So how do I best secure long term investment crypto without having to worry about hardware failure (cold storage drive) or someone somehow accessing my account?  Lot's going on in this new environment and most of this info is out there...but it's in 400 different places and after spending days and days researching everything, I still don't have a simple answer/explanation.

mevx93,iamnik77,Bitcoin Hang-ups and a Flawed Understanding of Assets,"Many are experiencing a mental block, unable to process the rise of Bitcoin. But the biggest block may be a flawed understanding of Bitcoin's place among all available assets. 

The spectrum of assets appears differently to everyone. The color red might look like blue if you saw it through my eyes. I'm not even sure there is a fixed number of asset categories. My categories look something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Business ownership (active or passive via stock ownership)

\-Real estate (active or passive via investment vehicles)

\-Commodities (gold, oil, cattle, etc.)

\-Currencies and fixed income (bonds, CDs, etc.)

\-Cryptocurrencies

\-Futures and financial contracts

\-Collectibles (automobiles, guns, art, antiques, comics, sports/gaming cards, digital objects, etc.) 

&amp;#x200B;

If stocks are your favorite asset, your Bitcoin objection might be: “It doesn't have earnings.” 

If gold is your favorite asset, your Bitcoin objection might be: “It isn't as certain to always be in demand like gold is.” 

If sports cards are your favorite asset, your Bitcoin objection might be: “It is just piece of code on the internet that I can't see, touch, or hold.”

If CDs are your favorite asset, your Bitcoin objection might be: “It is too volatile.”

Five years ago, Bitcoin seemed to me like a johnny-come-lately internet company from the late '90's that was doomed to crash. It was like the company that went public with no actual product or service – just a stated ambition to disintegrate objects into molecules and send them over the internet to then be reassembled at their destination. All hype, no substance.

Here are two important things I believe now that I didn't then:

\-Bitcoin is truly a new asset class, made possible by the internet. Its unique combination of strengths and risks require a completely new asset category. 

\-Bitcoin is solving real problems and addressing real pain points in a way no other asset class has been able to do. People don't understand how Bitcoin can go from less than $.01 at inception to $56000 today. But that increase in dollar value is the nuclear power achieved by a combination of deflationary engineering, decentralization, liquidity and pure ownership via private keys.

In 2009, when Bitcoin was launched, only computer geeks wanted it. A few years later, retail investors wanted it. Today rich people and corporations are buying it. More retail investors, rich people, and corporations are coming. A few governments want to acquire it too. 

We might be underestimating how important Bitcoin will be five or ten years from now. I'll leave you with a few of my favorite quotes: 

“It's not a rally. It's not a bubble. It's a chain reaction spreading like a wildfire in cyberspace.” “It's better than owning all of Manhattan. It's better than owning the center city blocks of the greatest cities in the world. This is like Manhattan in cyberspace. One day, a billion people will live there.” “Bitcoin is the apex property of the human race.” “...Bitcoin is a masterpiece of monetary engineering.""  -  Michael Saylor 

“You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin.” “Tesla is using only internal and open source software &amp; operates Bitcoin nodes directly.   Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency.” -  Elon Musk",1616912300,10,1

meuy1v,OutOfWine,I never ever believe in my retirement fund,"I have worked some 20 years as an engineer. Ever since I started working, I had this gut feeling that I would never get enough for retirement, that there would be depreciation, that the system might collapse.

I grew up in a third world country, and I remember my father being VERY upset because of an 80% devaluation -overnight. He had his debts in usd, so we were financially screw. I was very young, did not even knew math, but when he literally eli5 the situation for my, I had complete understanding of the situation.

He owe 10 american bananas and needed about 20 local bananas to pay. But now our bananas were cheaper and he needed 100 bananas to pay for the 10 american bananas. And we only had about 30, so we needed 70 extra bananas and that is how my sister, his wife and the girl she find in a forest ended up working in the streets at night, to get most needed bananas for us.

Joke aside, I never in my life see my family being so miserable overnight.

In 2014, there was ""a voice"" telling me to buy btc. I did not even understood what it was but I buy in and after the crash, I sold and lost (7 btc).

2015, when the price went up again, the voice kept telling me to buy and I did. I kept doing that and in 2018, after the crash, I did not sell. I understood it was a cycle.

And oh boy, are 3 years long? They are.

But I kept buying, every month a little bit.

If anything, I regret I did not put all my savings there. I kept accumulating satoshis.

During this bullrun, I got probably 3x what I have in my retirement fund already, and I am not planning to sell like I did in 2015.


Another thing I realize while growing up is that both my grandparents had big houses and a number of cars, and my father could only afford a tiny house and 1 car, and myself? I was never willing to get a credit to pay in 30 years for a house half the size of my parents and move on public transport. The system was obviously not working.

All the fears that I had when I was a kid came back to hunt me. Devaluation is not just a phenomenon of third world countries.

Today I do not give a fuck anymore about my retirement money. I am much more upset that the government takes taxes from the risk that I took since 2014. While they keep devaluating the money a little bit every year to a lot sometimes, they want us to pay for they stupid games. And all along, the people who make the rules, politicians backed by big money, keep doing more money.

Is this a rant?

TLDR, I never believe in my retirement fund.",1616907775,129,1

Luckily it will hurt mostly corporations that get hit hardest this time it burst rather than in the past when it was grassroots.

mh7cf0,TechHodler,Goldman Sachs is close to offering bitcoin and other digital assets to its wealth management clients (CNBC),"&gt;The bank aims to begin offering investments in the emerging asset class in the second quarter, according to Mary Rich, who was recently named global head of digital assets for Goldman’s private wealth management division.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients, and that is something we expect to offer in the near term,” Rich said in an interview this week.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Goldman is looking at ultimately offering a “full spectrum” of investments in bitcoin and digital assets, “whether that’s through the **physical bitcoin, derivatives or traditional investment vehicles**,” she said.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The move means that soon, clients of two of the world’s preeminent investment banks – Goldman and Morgan Stanley – will have access to a nascent asset class that has intrigued billionaires and digital currency believers alike. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley told its financial advisors that **they could place clients into bitcoin funds starting in April**, CNBC was first to report.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It is the latest sign of the staying power of blockchain-related assets including bitcoin, a new kind of money that emerged out of the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis and whose exact origins are still unknown. Until now, big U.S. banks have mostly shunned bitcoin, deeming it too speculative and volatile for clients.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“There’s a contingent of clients who are looking to this asset as a hedge against inflation, and the macro backdrop over the past year has certainly played into that,” Rich said. “There are also a large contingent of clients who feel like we’re sitting at the dawn of a new Internet in some ways and are looking for ways to participate in this space.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Goldman’s private wealth management business mostly targets individuals, families and endowments **with at least $25 million to invest**.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The bank may offer bitcoin investment funds, similar to those that Morgan Stanley will have, as well as other ways to invest that are “more akin to the underlying asset class which trades 24-7 globally,” Rich said. Some cryptofunds, such as the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, can only be sold or bought once per quarter, she said.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; no one knows exactly how it will evolve or what shape it will be,” Rich said. “But I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.”

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Bitcoin Institutional FOMO Hype train is still ongoing and so is the Bull Market!!

I have a question with regard to transfer fees and coin movement.

I recently decided to move my portfolio from eToro to Coinbase Pro and BlockFi. Unfortunately there was no way to move directly from eToro without using the eToro wallet. So I requested my BTC be transferred to my eToro wallet. After it arrived I attempted to make a deposit into my BlockFi account.

This is where I ran into an issue. The eToro wallet said I had an available balance and gave an estimated Blockchain fee. So I requested a transfer of my available balance minus the transfer fee to my BlockFi account. It was rejected shortly after saying that I requested more than my available balance due possibly due to the Blockchain fee. I kept trying to lower the amount in tiny increments until I finally was able to get a successful deposit. But just as I had feared when I went back to my eToro wallet there is a small amount  orphaned there. Now it looks like I can't move that tiny amount because the fee is higher than the value of that balance.

How can I get this last bit out of my wallet?

Also, how can I avoid this in the future moving coins between my cold wallet and Coinbase Pro/BlockFi? I searched all over for Blockchain calculator but was unsuccessful. My research did show it's calculated off inputs/outputs but even those didn't seem to provide the correct amount (I'm guessing I did them wrong).

She isn't very tech savvy a little bit like myself it took me a while to get used to self custody ect. So she asked me should she buy or should she give me the money what she wants to put in every month to me and I just buy at same time as I usually do and just withdraw to cold storage and keep all in one place?

Sorry if this is a stupid question but I said I actually wasn't sure. I thought maybe it would be best for her to buy herself and keep on an exchange. Whats mine is hers at end of the day we are very strong I have zero doubt of us falling falling apart in future tbh.

 ***A longtime Bitcoin bull and the founder of Galaxy Digital Michael Novogratz*** [***spoke about Bitcoin's future.***](https://news.bitcoin.com/boomers-adopt-cryptocurrency-trillion-dollars-bitcoin-novogratz/)

He explained that as cryptocurrencies become more widespread, rich baby boomers will be the next generation to come to the bitcoin market.

&gt;*“It could be as much as a trillion dollars comes over the next year from that giant group of wealth."" - declared Novogratz.*

Baby Boomers are those who were born around the end of World War II until the mid-1960s. They were the main beneficiaries of the massive stimulus packages that pumped asset values ​​in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Many of them see bitcoin as an asset that can significantly increase its value, as well as protect their savings from inflation caused by the massive printing of money.

&gt;*""If you’re worried that the U.S. is printing too many dollars … you’re going to shift some of your savings into bitcoin.""*  
*- Michael Novgorats.*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/klscd9fsgcq61.png?width=1650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c24b87de9ece72fb090e6f9b9d06328423bf880

If the CEOs of JMP Securities and Galaxy Digital are not wrong, then in the coming months, huge amounts of money will begin to flow into the bitcoin market, and by the end of the year, their inflow will amount to $2.5 trillion. Now the capitalization of the first cryptocurrency is $1.2 trillion. If you add these two sums, then the capitalization of BTC by the end will reach $3.7 trillion, hence the price of bitcoin will be $177,754.

But since in free circulation, according to Glassnode, at the beginning of the year there were only 4.2 million bitcoins, a reasonable question arises: *what exactly are the listed groups of investors going to buy?* Everything that is available to them on the market today, taking into account all the bitcoins available on exchange wallets and in OTC, is a maximum of 4.2 million BTC.

If we subtract from the total emission of bitcoin, which is 18.6 million today, belonging to the class of illiquid 14.5 million, then the estimated price of bitcoin will be **$711,000 by the end of the year**. And this is without taking into account the money of other buyers, who, of course, are present in the market and their number is growing all the time. It is worth adding an element of common panic buying that can arise against the backdrop of the rapid rise in the price of BTC.

Last year alone, Grayscale Capital and other funds bought about 1 million bitcoins on the market. Under the above-mentioned scenario, no more than 1 million BTC will remain in free circulation by the end of the year.

**Turns out, “To The Moon” is much closer than expected.**

Thanks to Michael Novogratz for the tip.",1617188035,57,1

A friend of mine recently bought some bitcoin and noticed that the amount of fees spent were quite large in respect to the bitcoin amount. The tansaction size of the transactions where in the range of 4000 bytes (explaining the large fees) while my recent transactions are in the range of 400 bytes. From the data from https://www.blockchain.com/charts website it seems that a transaction in the hundreds range seems more reasonable.

Id like to be pointed in the direction of some easy to understand info about utxo's and tranactions sizes. I understand that the fees depend on mempool size and transaction size etc., but dont quite understand why this transaction is 4000 bytes. Secondly is there currently a way to deal with such large transactions besides reducing satoshis/byte?

lwtqk4,vmalarcon,When did you leave your skepticism behind and bought your first bitcoin?,"I must admit I'm not an early adopter. I come from a country where these shiny new things came and went away with our wealth with no other explanation than a shrug. So it was difficult for me to break my resistance to bitcoin. 

My first use case was transfer between countries. Buy BTC in country A and then take it out on country B and convert it to the local currency. I remember I had to be quick because I was afraid of the monster of volatility. I didn't know what it was, but I heard that it can swallow you whole and spit your bones in an instant! But it was done with no big problems.

After that I was still skeptic but kept looking. Eventually I made a deal with myself that after a certain threshold I would buy a little and see what happens. This threshold for me was 10k. I didn't buy a whole coin but something to involve myself more in the process. If I lost it, oh well, wasn't the first time. Live and learn...

A few months later I was deep on the rabbit hole. Learning about fiat and all its bullshitery. Yes, the 10000 BTC pizza and all the rest. But there was no turning back for me at this point. Even if bitcoin disappears in a tragic boating accident tomorrow I will no longer be the same person and that's thanks to bitcoin.

I realize now that this is an impossible question to answer, but there you go. Sometimes we do things for which we don't have good explanations for.",1614777702,43,19

Coinbase plans to go public under a direct listing that values the largest U.S. digital-asset exchange at almost $100 billion. The service the company offers is the same basic principle as a stock brokerage, giving retail investors access to the cryptocurrency markets, but that’s where the similarities end. Coinbase has frequent service outages, nonexistent customer service and sky-high transaction costs. All of these are disadvantages are well known, and yet it remains the most viable option for individual investors.

Still, it’s an odd business with lots of risks. **One of the risks disclosed in the prospectus for the initial public offering is the likelihood that the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous person or persons who created Bitcoin, will be revealed. There is a “wallet” with 1.1 million Bitcoins, worth about $50 billion, that is assumed to be owned or controlled by Nakamoto.** If the coins are sold or transferred from that wallet, it would set off pandemonium—probably the biggest crisis of confidence to hit any asset class, ever. **A mystery man is a funny thing to disclose in your IPO filing, and it speaks to the cult-like nature of Bitcoin investing.**

Even if BTC prices went to 1 Million, it would be a return of 10k.
To be in the six digits of dollar returns, you would need at least 0.1 which would potentially buy you a small retirement but definitely not riches.

0.1 Bitcoin would be around 5k Dollars to invest right now. I doubt that the majority of people invested that much.

back in 2008-2013 I had a bitcoin wallet with a some bitcoin in it (don't know how much) and I still now the e-mail and password - even though I don't have access to the e-mail because I deleted it years ago sadly.  I don't remember the name of the platform and searched for it a lot, I know back then you could deposit the money to your bank account and that they had an additional master code to recovery your password.

I need help, I search the internet but haven't found it. If I see the name, I will surely remember and I know the email and password! Who every gives me the name of the platform gets 5% of the wallet value as a thank you ( if we manage to find it and if I can successfully log in ), it is going to be a lot!!! I am serious!

Some context, back then I was young and spent a lot time on script kiddy websites for Germans like zion-network and hba-crew - both are of course offline, there I offered services and got payed firstly with ukash/paysafe-cards and afterwards with bitcoin. Maybe someone is remembering.

Just for clarification this is not a joke. It is hard to find it, because there are so many crypt-wallets nowadays.

Thanks for your help!

Have there been Bitcoin improvement proposals that would make the proof of work based on useful computations? Or are there other initiatives for this?

lxfmer,thicc_ladies_dm_me69,"Why you should not be buying a Tesla( or anything) with your bitcoin, even if offered at a discount.","**TLDR :** Given the choice of two currencies, people will spend the depreciative currency first. Companies may do the opposite and incentivize payment in the appreciative currency with discounts and offers, do not fall for this trap with your bitcoin in future. Be frugal with bitcoin and lavish with cash.   


To understand why, you need to know [Gresham's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law) : ""bad money drives out good"", it basically means if people have two currencies in society and they think one might appreciate in value i.e. bitcoin and the other one might depreciate in value i.e. USD, then **they will get rid of USD first**.   


**This is why bitcoin in its current form is not a good currency, because hodlers don't want to spend it**.  Bitcoin can work as currency only when majority of the people start trusting it as currency and it starts to loose its potential of appreciation.   


It may seem counterintuitive logic for growth, but look at gold, it has survived death of countless fiat currencies yet it has $11 trillion market cap, that is the valuation our collective monkey brains have settled at, even for 21st centaury. **But first time in history we have a gold like asset that can also be spent like fiat; and that changes everything.**   


Roughly less than 1% of global population have access to bitcoin, similar to the stats of internet in 1995. **We are still very early**; internet penetration crossed 60% only last year or two. Look around you, after decades of internet adoption, **you now have people taking social media seriously to gain and exchange social capital**.   


Bitcoin is not just digital gold or reserve asset, these labels undersell its potential, it's gonna be the bedrock of interoperable utility altcoins and multilayered solutions simply because of the gigantic PoW advantage it has amassed. **Bitcoin is pure digital capital at its most liquid form.**   


In next coming years companies might start offering their products and services via bitcoin payment, might even give discount if paid with bitcoin. **Do not fall for this!**   


**Bitcoin is the scarcest asset known to mankind**. As time passes, bitcoin will be severely dried up in exchanges. Right now, far more bitcoin is being grabbed from exchanges than it is mined daily.   


Just like us, these companies will be dying to let go of their fiat and will try to accumulate more bitcoin on their balance sheets.   


**DO NOT GIVEAWAY YOUR BITCOIN FOR 5% - 10% DISCOUNT. GET RID OF CASH FIRST!**",1614844711,14,1

lxzfmz,vitaminBTC,"and then the guy said, just because something appreciates in value, doesn’t make it the base value holder for the entire future of world commerce....","so I said-

&amp;#x200B;

You are totally correct, I agree fully. It is not because Bitcoin is appreciating in value that is why it will become the base value holder for the entire future of world commerce. The price appreciation is just the market recognizing over time that Bitcoin is a standalone system outside of the world of central banking and finance capable of final settlement without concern for borders, apolitical and neutral, permissionless and nearly frictionless, open for transactions 24/7/365 and with open markets every second of the day with a bid and an ask in practically every currency pair, free from government manipulation and debasement. (PS did you know that the stock market is open 6.5 hours a day, 5 days a week, or 32.5 hours per week, ie - open only (7x24=168) 32.5/168, just under 20% of the time, not including holidays or circuit breaks. That means every year of Bitcoin trading is actually 5+ years of stock market trading)

The problem with comparing Bitcoin to the massive list of companies/commodities/currencies that have shot way up before coming crashing back down is, how many of those experienced massive drawdowns, were left for dead, and then they rose again to even higher levels than ever thought possible before? Its crashed, and I mean CRASHED, about a dozen times with 80% or more drawdowns -- curiously though, always at higher lows. And here we are somehow, scraping $50k a coin, 900 Billion dollars worth of value created out of uhhh - a bit of ingenious code and a transparent ledger.

The question you must ask yourself is, why? Why does it not die? It has every reason to! No other example comes to mind of anything coming back from the dead once, let alone multiple times.

Bitcoin is a protocol layer on top of which the application layer rests. The only comparable example is TCP/IP - otherwise known as, the internet. The internet digitized and democratized information- it is now in the same power as you and I as someone with access to the world's best minds to find out whatever we want at the absolute cost of ZERO. Bitcoin is the digitization of money, it is the democratization of money. Today only the privileged in first world countries can have access to bank accounts, credit cards, checkbooks... To send a wire internationally you can pay $35 and wait a couple of days, that is if the country you are sending to is a country your country is down with and the amount of money does not raise any eyebrows in compliance departments.

But we are now in the process of seeing the transformation that will allow any person anywhere the ability to send money unfettered, without questions, without unreasonable fees, nearly instantaneously, from Istanbul to Venezuela if that is where their family members live, on a Saturday, at 11PM, and the person receiving it is not charged extortion fees, or bullied, or marked, or followed, or known to have received any value whatever.

How much is something like that worth?

So in the end if price is all you see, there is a reason for it, it is the iceberg under the surface that you are not seeing, this irresistible, unstoppable force that has been released into the world without hope of curtailing it no matter how much those who control the money supply might try.

And that is because Bitcoin, without firing a single round and without spilling a drop of blood, has forever placed beyond the reach of man the ability to manipulate and control the money. It is a voluntary system with clearly defined unchangeable rules (21M BTC, Nodes, Proof of Work, Difficulty adjustment, permissionless, non-sovereign, neutral, Supply schedule set in stone for the next hundreds of years) that if you would like to participate in, you are more than welcome to. If you decide you don't like it, you may sell it and leave. And without a CEO, marketing team, or coercion to transact in it as in FIAT, it has made people believe in it to the point of it being today one of the top 15 companies/ commodities/currencies with the highest of market caps, and it is the only one that looks bent on rising the ranks faster than any of the others. And for the first time in its history the macro external outlook has made it look by comparison, FOR THE FIRST TIME, as a desirable place to park value by those with value to park, accumulating enough liquidity to interest public companies. Validation for the thesis subtly embedded in the first block, ambitious and ridiculous in its scope and imagination, PLAYING OUT IN REAL TIME, earning respect in the eyes of the most serious of capital allocators.

And isn't it interesting that as the price appreciates, it actually becomes more useful and valuable, a better network, more reachable to bigger and bigger entities? It is the world's most fine-tuned positive feedback loop ever witnessed. Created by someone (anonymous of course, how else!) who understood this needed to be a public utility (as in water or electricity) and never cashed in on their deca-Billions! IS YOUR MIND BLOWN YET

Bitcoin is in the envious position of having time on its side. Everything else feels like it is borrowing against the future at ever-steepening costs to attempt to keep the charade going for another day. Short term gain, long term pain. Every decision at a corporate and government level today is made with the short term in mind, without paying a lick of mind to the long term. Bitcoin just mines another block. And another one. Miners keep dedicating to it more hashpower. It gets stronger and more secure. Monetary policy automatically tightens every 210,000 blocks/ approx every 4 years. Price rises. And the loop goes on.

With this scenario as laid before you, in the long term, how does this all play out from here?

Bitcoin in the end, is an unalienable right. Like water. Like electricity. Like the internet, arguably.

because... We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. And that includes freedom of monetary opression. For every human being on the planet, INDISCRIMINATELY, let freedom ring.",1614903538,133,321

(Bolivares, local currency). One BTC is around 92,000,000,000 Bs.","Hi guys, as you know Venezuelan living here, crypto enthusiast like to post these weekly updates.

The traded amount in USD is constant weekly, around 4-5 million USD. Just as reference in February 2019 almost 2,500 BTC were traded in one week. I don't think the drop is to worry.

This is measure ONLY using LocalBitcoin (Trades there are mostly Bolivares to BTC and BTC to Bolivares). Months ago Binance started P2P trades with Venezuelan bolivares, I think some people migrated there (it lets you trade other cryptos). Also AirTM is used as exchange too.

Who trades BTC to Bolivares? People that needs to pay in some places where crypto is not accepted. Where do these BTC come from? Could be miners, could be people abroad that send money to their families in Venezuela, could be the goverment itself (sadly), people with crypto savings, etc.

Who trades Bolivares to BTC? People that gets insane amounts of Bolivares (like store owners), people that get paid in Bolivares, and want to convert them in something better and stable than Bolivares digitally and easy.

Two days ago goverment announced the newest bank note (bill) biggest bill in Venezuelan history 1,000,000 Bolivares that is 0.52 USD (as for now)

A big chunk of the population that works for the goverment have a monthly wage of around 1-10 monthly minium wages, monthly minimum wage is around 1.2 USD. So that would put that people from 1.2 to 12 USD monthly. Sadly this people cannot even think in crypto, they are thinking in something different that is survive.

According to a NGO (CENDAS) a 5 members family need around 350 USD monthly to ""live"", yes if you are from USA, Canada, Australia, Germany that amount is ridiculous low, but that is a standar in Latin America, problem more that what you need to spend are the WAGES, they are crazy low. A really good wage here is around 400 USD monthly (in my opion).

If you want to know something ask me anything. Here the economy is a mess, so many poor people and a lot of people surviving and of course people living ""good""! I have gotten even work from some redditors since I started posting here, what a great community.

And MOONS (cryptocurrency subreddit), wow, have helped me a lot (Sadly I have to cash out usually).

One monthly minimum wage is around 18 MOONS.

FIFO - first in first out

As it sounds. You are selling the oldest holding you have first. If not all of your purchases are over a year old, this may be the way to go as it will guarantee that you are selling as much of your long term capital gain Bitcoin as possible. 


LIFO - last in last out

I don’t know why you’d use this, but it means you are selling your newest purchase first. The next option seems better to me. 


HIFO - highest in highest out

This is magic. You are selling the crypto that was the most expensive (per coin) you bought first.  This could reduce the amount you pay in capital gains, it could even create a situation where you can claim a loss if the value of the crypto you are selling is higher now than when you bought it. This can help offset gains with other sales. 


**bold**SpecID 
this is a way of designating specific coins or purchases so they can be used in the above accounting methods. 

The beauty of this whole process is you can move between these accounting methods every year, and choose the best for your current tax situation. 

Forbes has an article that delves into this a bit more. Please read if you are thinking about selling and need to figure out your taxes.

m03j9w,mulebotte,(For newcomers) Why every investor should have a 1% #Bitcoin allocation,"[https://twitter.com/macromule/status/1368718458075025408?s=20](https://twitter.com/macromule/status/1368718458075025408?s=20)

TLDR: with an appropriate weighting, Bitcoin will increase a traditional portfolio’s returns without raising overall volatility.

Let’s compare a traditional 60-40 portfolio (stocks &amp; bonds) with one that adds a 1% BTC position in place of bonds—weightings are rebalanced every year:

https://preview.redd.it/tr2a1wik7pl61.png?width=1832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0c2b335427e86b9ea35f317aa5e5c78af34a05a

Since 2015, the portfolio with BTC outperforms by 31%, while only compromising annual volatility by 0.25%.

https://preview.redd.it/jv0ifqui7pl61.png?width=1192&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=728fba323e48a4942b640c3d564b52d3e3fe78a5

Now let’s look at how these two strategies would compare without rebalancing every year:

https://preview.redd.it/nc0ivryp7pl61.png?width=2046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1895ab6f4ed98f07ca3f56eabc1e90414472e3a6

Just a 1% BTC allocation would have doubled the returns of a traditional portfolio while increasing volatility by 4%.

I'm someone who didn't learn about finance before Bitcoin. I wasted a lot of money and never really thought about how to manage money properly.

&amp;#x200B;

A while back I tried to talk to a family member about Bitcoins and why I think it's a good thing.

I got super stupid answers and this person had no interest in listening to me even once.

I gave facts why Bitcoin is the future and they still don't want to listen to me, make me out to be an idiot who doesn't know anything about anything and is going to fall flat on his face anyway because I wasn't really good with money in the past.

Since one would like to help one and is then looked at so stupidly.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I started another topic. I'm currently looking at a lot of things about our financial system and have decided for myself to have as little cash as possible and rather put it into real estate, bitcoins or other useful investments. That's why I spoke to this family member again, to get another person's opinion on what I'm trying to do.

There I was once again left wondering if I have any idea about these things and they think it won't work anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I have made many mistakes in the past. Now I'm trying to work on it and use my money wisely, because I think that the system is slowly collapsing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting so fed up with it. I don't think I will share a single word about my finances with my family anymore as I don't feel like discussing it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still quite ""young"", have done many things wrong, disappointed many and yet learned from those mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest I hope she will stay so stubborn and will be really angry in the future for not listening to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Bitcoin is still going to be a very big thing and believe that we are still in the beginning with just $50,000.

lzsnpj,DishAggravating6058,GBTC trading at 20% discount to the BTC they hold!,I own BTC in a number of places - one of which is via  GBTC (1 share GBTC = .001 BTC).   It’s SEC compliant and they hold all of the BTC to back up the shares in cold storage.   On Friday morning GBTC was trading at a 20% discount to the BTC they hold!  I know they charge a 2% custody fee but that will go down dramatically once there is an ETF competing against them and even if it doesn’t a 20% discount isn’t warranted.    For the life of me I don’t know why someone who wants to buy BTC today wouldn’t just buy it at a major discount through GBTC.     I know it’s all “supply and demand” and GBTC will not always trade in tandem to Bitcoin price (99% of its history it traded at a premium) but this seems like an incredible opportunity.   I’ve been selling my Bitcoin on Coinbase and buying it back on GBTC to take advantage of this.    If I’m missing something I’d love to hear it.,1615130429,22,1

**Will get straight to the point:**

The consensus is that bitcoin is uncorrelated to the overinflated stock market (especially tech stocks on the NASDAQ). Moreover, it is a store-of-value and hedge against inflation (digital gold argument).

However...over these past weeks since the price came down from the $58k ATH, I've noticed that when stocks are shaky and NASDAQ is down &gt; we see the same price action trend on crypto. Likewise today we're looking very green on crypto and at the same time the NASDAQ bounced back 3.3% after a slump.

Connected to this are the 10 year treasury bond yields:

* IF UP &gt; crypto+equities DOWN, 
* IF DOWN &gt; crypto+equities UP.

m195tb,110010010011,Grayscale Bitcoin Trust premium is currently negative. Why?,"I know most of us are anti-GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) because ""not your keys, not your Bitcoin,"" but the other argument was that GBTC almost always costs *more than Bitcoin.* Just as recently as December, you would pay 40% more for GBTC than had you just purchased Bitcoin outright. Today, however, Bitcoin is 10% more expensive than GBTC.

*Before we continue, here is my disclaimer: I hodl mostly real Bitcoin. I'm no GBTC shill, and I don't condone a full ""bitcoin portfolio"" in GBTC only. But it is of course near impossible to keep actual Bitcoin in my Roth IRA, so I use GBTC for that purpose. I also like to swing trade GBTC in my taxable account. I will attempt to sell the top with GBTC during this bull run (I don't believe we are there yet), but I will hodl my actual Bitcoin.*

For those who are unaware, GBTC is the stock ticker for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. It is not a true Bitcoin ETF, as this is privately run and has to be traded over the counter in your stock account. But it is an easy way to get Bitcoin exposure if you have an existing brokerage account. The way GBTC works is Grayscale holds actual Bitcoin, and you purchase shares of their trust, effectively taking ownership in a share of their Bitcoin holdings. For each Bitcoin Grayscale owns, they have issued roughly 1000 shares of their trust. Now this isn't the actual number, but its close to it. It allows you to do the math in your head. If Bitcoin is worth $55,000, GBTC should be worth roughly $55 per share. On to the real numbers:

Currently, [on their website](https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-trust/), Grayscale quotes their ""Bitcoin per Share"" at 0.00094664. To get the ""fair value"" for a share of GBTC, you simply multiply this number by the spot price of Bitcoin. At this moment, Bitcoin is $54,420, which means a share of GBTC should be worth at least $51.52. It's not however. The current spot price of GBTC is $48.72, giving GBTC a negative 10% premium. That means it's literally 10% cheaper at this moment to purchase some of Grayscale's bitcoin than it is to purchase some on your own.

Now you might be thinking, ""maybe it's always like this,"" but I assure you it's not. If you look at a chart of [GBTC premium](https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav) you'll notice it's almost always positive. I remember back in 2017, that at one point, GBTC premium was over 100%! 

So what's happening? I have a few theories. Actual Bitcoin is becoming easier to buy, which is a long term attack on GBTC premium, but if you look at the chart, you'll see this is a recent anomaly. Premium went negative at the end of February. I believe this is because GBTC has gotten wrapped into the greater stock market tech sell off and has been way oversold.

So what do we do about it? Well, purchasing GBTC today is looking a lot like a leveraged buy into Bitcoin to me. If the rocket takes off past $60k, retail stock investors are going to pile back into GBTC driving the premium positive again, meaning you will see larger percentage gains in GBTC than you will in Bitcoin.  
TL;DR: Buy GBTC. Today.",1615304784,93,1

Let’s say you bought a house in 2015 worth 500k, and in 5 years, the appreciation rate was 4% yearly. You’d sell it today for approx. 630k. That’s pretty good gains in USD terms.

Now in terms of Bitcoin. In 2015, the price ranged from 200-500 USD. So you’d pay about 1400btc at an average price of around 350usd per btc. 

Today, that 1400 Bitcoin is worth 75m USD. If you were to sell your house for 630k USD but into Bitcoin, you would only get back... 11 Bitcoin. 

In 4 years, the next halvening will commence, and in 2025, Bitcoin is expected to skyrocket again. Even if it doesn’t skyrocket, it’s still making 100% annually. For me, I think I’d rather hodl my Bitcoin and pay rent in USD.

m18raa,mummifiedlobsterking,Universal decentralized coin converter idea,"Tried to post to r/cryptocurrency but not enough karma, hope this is welcomed here..

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was just think about the idea of a blockchain, that can convert your crypto without dealing with an exchange. 

For the sake of this post let's call the coin ""ConvertCoin"".
The blockchain for the coin could include a wallet for BTC, ETH, LTC, etc and the private keys owned by the blockchain in a secure way so in that the blockchain itself owns them. 

There would need to be the initial issue to work out, filling those wallets with coin to get started... but after that all you do is simply send your crypto of choice on the blockchain, it fills the appropriate wallet, and sends you whatever crypto you want from that wallet on it's blockchain.

Then of course ConvertCoin will be its own crypto as well which would be the equivalent to stock in a company, so as more people convert and the more the wallets fill on it's blockchain the more it will be worth. 

Of course security would have to be top notch to prevent hackers from getting to the wallets owned by the blockchain but I think this would be a great way to get away from scummy exchanges and fees and take one more centralized part out of the decentralized world of crypto.

Any thoughts or comments? Or maybe this is not a new idea? I'd love to hear what everyone else thinks.",1615303668,0,1

m18hze,HerukaOnline,How to become a Crypto Financial Advisor,"Hi guys, 

Been investing in Cryptos for some time and making some nice profits (thanks bull market!).  Naturally want to share the love and help others as much as I can and also help this new asset class really flourish as I think its a force for good in the world.  I have helped several friends invest in various coins.  I am full time Crypto evangelist, I gave up my job to do this.  So anyway my question . . . I live in the UK:

\- How can I legally give advice to friends and then later members of the public

\- Can I 'manage' other peoples finances for them.

So with one friend the technology scared her, she just wanted to me to handle everything.  She sent me her investment, I invested that (on well known Exchanges) and then sent the money to her hardware Wallet (which I taught her how to setup).  I send her a report of exactly what she bought, what the fees were etc.  I charged her nothing.  

Now though, people are coming to me asking me can I help!  I want to help BUT, I don't want to get into hot water when it comes to filing my taxes and the FCA regs in the UK.  If you can imagine, in the example above, it will show money coming into my bank, then into Crypto (Exchange) and out into cold storage then later that route but in reverse I expect when they want to cash out).  Messy to say the least.  Not to mention no insurance, no accreditations. 

Many people really want to get into Crypto, I have 20 years experience in the tech sector so for me its cake.  But for so many people trying not to get scammed, hacked and appreciating how to protect your private keys etc is just either more than they could cope with or just they don't have time to learn.  So they come to me.

Anyone have any suggestions of how I could work for myself, not contravene the FCA regs, and provide clients with security and peace of mind.

You cant get insured (indemnity / liability etc) if you are not accredited.  You cant get accredited in Crypto (so far as I know) as its so new!   I have asked the FCA if there is an route to become accredited, but I expect they will say I have to complete YEARS of training in the traditional finance sector first, then work for some bank and then finally work for myself.  No thanks!  Waiting to hear back from them.

Seems like companies that offer Crpyto investmest advise just charge an hourly rate.  But then that doesn't work if someone wants to just give you their investment for me to invest for them because how can they can assured you would not just walk away with their funds?!  I would not do this, I am honest, but this is not the point of course.

m2kk18,SilverHoard,What are the some of the current best in-store payment methods for crypto? In Europe,"Hi guys,

I've been in crypto's since 2017 and so far havn't taken any money out of the market. But I would be very interested in paying with my crypto's to help promote adoption rather than converting back into fiat currencies myself. And to do that, I was planning on trying to convince a few local vendors to try out some of the crypto payment methods. Those that instantly convert to euro's to start with. And once they have a foot in the door, perhaps later they'll also consider direct crypto's. One of the major hurdles I've encountered so far is that they don't want exposure to crypto's directly, but would be open to accepting payments converted automatically and easily to fiat.

This one is mainly aimed at Europe, but I was wonder what some of the current best and easiest payment methods are to do this. And what are some of the best services to buy things with crypto's, like vouchers and gift cards, for example. Without KYC would be even easier, but not necessary.

Thank you!",1615447467,5,1

Now that Bitcoin is traded at a rate of 55000$, you chose to opt out of it. Now Coinbase will have to transfer this amount to your bank account. But the question is, does it have that amount of money to payback? 

What if everyone started asking for their money (Venezuela crisis?), will Bitcoin collapse?

But the recent bear market presented an interesting opportunity. I used an exchange's in built currency conversion tool, to swap 0.01 Bits for some Etherium. Then the values of two swung, but Etherium's value in comparison to Bitcoin's rose for a bit. 

I had gotten 0.31 ETH for the conversion, and I traded 0.29 back for my original Bitcoin. Kept the 3 Etherium cents that were made in the process. 

This helps me scratch an itch I've had for a while, while still allowing me to HODL. The two coins keep fluctuating in comparison to each other, and sometimes BTC has and upswing and the next week, ETC swings up in comparison. The key thing is, they both keep climbing over time, and I ride the positive difference. Honestly, it feels like I just pulled some Etherium out of thin air. 

TLDR: Use exchanges to swap BTC for ETH when BTC is up by comparison. When it falls, or ETH catches up, convert back and keep the change.",1615430460,5,1
m2fwbw,Activ2k,Avoid buying from coinme (my experience),"Ive been using coinme for the last month or so and have  maybe bought 1200 worth of btc. I completed all the verification and had no problems up until 5 days ago. I purchased 300 dollars worth and never received a voucher. Instead I was prompted by the screen to call support with the information provided. 

I called immediately and then after not being able to speak to someone went through live support. After finally chatting with someone they required a bunch of documents and pictures to prove it was I who was making the purchase which I provided. I was told by support I'd receive a call within 72 hours...

Today, after no returned calls and minimal information from their terrible support system I contacted the BBB. Within an hour I received an email from coinme requiring more information and to fill out a form which I did. After doing so I expected the btc to be in my account. Come to find out after trying to log in now my accounts locked. Seems as if they locked me out because I contacted the BBB. So then I contacted them about that and now they are saying they want 3 months of bank statements and think I own a business which I don't. 

Long story short, this company is super shady. All I want is a refund ot my btc. They have asked me for a ton of stuff which I provided and every time I do they require something else or tell me it's under review. Should have been a simple process, I was unable to redeem my bitcoin because I never got a voucher. I provided all of the required information and the bitcoin should have been placed in my account.

m2ftg0,CaptainBillsWildRide,Is it wrong to think this way?,"Most of my life I have been a pretty small government type guy who borderlines on anarchism/agorism. Before Bitcoin I would have been a staunch non believer in government meddling in the economy. When the first rounds of QE was dropping I was losing my shit, preaching the dangers of hyperinflation to everyone. I was worried for my fellow people of this land. How we were heading for despotism. However,  now that there is a new paradigm that you can just simply opt into at any moments time, like putting on the holy armor, I find myself caring less and less what government's are doing. If people simply have the choice to be free that is all I ever wanted. For people to live the way they see fit. Voluntarilyism. A peaceful revolution.  A shift in consciousness.  I find myself being less and less cynical of what the state does and in some cases I have started to embrace and welcome it. Let me explain. I know that the more money government prints the faster it is to their demise. This definitely hurts people with no other way out. With Bitcoin though, the entire world has an out. I have started embracing stimulus and welcoming it. Encouraging keynsians and liberals and cheering them on because I know that their ideology is their own demise. Printing money just speeds up the enevitable death of their beliefs and system. All the while rewarding and enriching me and my fellow lovers of freedom. Growing our power and ultimately bringing about a peaceful revolution much sooner. I've almost started Encouraging the stimuluses,  Encouraging wreckless government, cheering on the liberals, whether they are D's or R's. It's kinda sad but kinda funny to me. I know in my heart I don't want anyone to suffer.  But you have a choice now and no one is stopping you but your own stubbornness. You just have to join us if your governments turn on you.

m3q5cv,CryptoArtbyJake,"'Bitcoin Mechanism', you asked for it","Hello everyone,

First of all, I would like to say that I am new to the NFT and Crypto scene so bear with me if I say/ask anything silly.

A backstory: I have been painting for fun for more than 10 years. It's mostly mediocre stuff and only my family and close friends know about it. One of my closest friends is really into Bitcoin and the crypto space. By really, I mean A LOT. So we were having a drink and he suggested I do a Bitcoin painting. I wasn't into it at the start but I eventually agreed. Now, I read a bit online, asked him some questions and came up with this: [Rarible Link](https://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:370188:0xf33865414cd88d95098b0b7754d28efa81e4b32a). He loved it and asked if he could post it on Reddit as I didn't use or have an account here. I agreed. [r/Bitcoin post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m2aj2t/btc_art/) Well... it went viral! I was honestly really surprised as it's my first time that my work actually pops off like that. That's why, with the help of my friend, I finally decided to take the initiative, make a reddit account and post my side of the story + make an NFT (it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be). I have no idea how to market or advertise it as my exposure is not as great as those artists selling paintings for hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. I would appreciate if you take a look at let me know. I have currently set it at 1 ETH, despite it being 'evaluated' by the NFT guys on reddit for thousands. Also, I am thinking of shipping the original painting to the buyer and creating a digital one.

Thank you to whoever took of your time to read my side of the story and to those who are working and don't have the time, here's a TL;DR:

m3oxbj,oliverwyatt24,How to take full advantage of your coins.,"If you want the price of Bitcoin to go up...

Don't store Bitcoins on other people's equipment, where they can be rehypothecated. The rehypothecation of gold via ""paper gold"" has stalled the price of gold - do you want criminals to be able to suppress the price of Bitcoin, too? I don't.

For example, move Bitcoins off exchanges, don't lend them. Buy actual Bitcoins instead of ETFs, Grayscale stock, etc.

Furthermore, ""Not your keys, not your Bitcoins.""

Governments are going to become desperate as their fiat currencies fail and go to zero. In their desperation, they will figure out that custodial Bitcoins are low hanging fruit and easy to confiscate. The custodians will gladly hand over your Bitcoins to keep their own butts out of jail.

Don't just hand over your wealth like that. Maintain actual ownership of actual Bitcoins in your own wallet. A little prevention goes a long way.

It's been over 8 years since the creation of the iconic [magic internet money bitcoin wizard](https://www.bitcoinwizard.com?lolmoney), and thanks to all of you guys, bitcoin is booming! Finally got around making a website (linked above) with some merch that accepts crypto as payment as well as monopoly money. I've also [minted the wizard as a NFT at foundation.app](https://foundation.app/mavensbot/magic-internet-money-bitcoin-wizard-5252).

I want to thank everyone for supporting, helping and teaching each other. Never have I thought bitcoin would be where it is today so quickly. I've seen so many generous charity donations over the years. Thank you for all the positive messages and love sent my way. 

I miss the good old days. bitcoin was a big part of my life for a decade. Not just about the money but I miss running 10 nodes to help bitcoin, paper wallets, all the websites, mining, vanitygen, so many memories flood back. I remember my avalon and KNC miners, Bitinstant, mtgox and I still have the friends I've made along the way. 

Each advancement makes Bitcoin more grounded and better at taking care of the issues of the current monetary and money related framework. It's made another age of crypto early adopters, utilizing cryptography to change the world; and now having capital to build our future.

In case you're at any point favored with crypto fortune, consider supporting these projects.

what do you guys want to see more of?

m3m3yo,SirFuckingLoin,Why can’t you buy bread and milk with Bitcoin?,"*One of the popular misconceptions about bitcoin is the alleged fact that nothing can be bought with bitcoin.*  
For example, bread or milk. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kj96pcmdnmm61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43e5e62c344ba5cd7bf253bbc5b7f012dc374fd5

 

Well, firstly, bitcoin is digital gold, and milk and bread are also not bought for gold coins. Secondly, in terms of status, bitcoin is more suitable for paying for large purchases. Tesla, for example, will soon start selling its EVs for Bitcoin.

But the coolest thing is that It is now possible to pay for purchases of real estate in the United States. America's largest insurance group, American Residential Warranty (ARW), and its property management subsidiary Boca Raton, following in Tesla's footsteps, said [they would accept cryptocurrency payments for their services](https://news.bitcoin.com/american-home-warranty-company-to-accept-crypto-payments-plans-to-add-btc-to-investment-portfolio/). In addition, the company also [plans to acquire and hold bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/61031/american-residential-warranty-jumps-on-the-bitcoin-bandwagon) as part of its strategy ""*to expand its investment portfolio and increase its cash return.*""

In a statement, Josh Browser, the company's chief revenue officer, said that by accepting crypto payments, ARW is demonstrating that it is ""*a technology company that is rapidly adapting to emerging technologies.*""

*“As businesses around the world enter this new era of global currency, American Residential Warranty is proud to continue to be an innovator in home warranties and plans to accept Bitcoin payments from its most tech-savvy customers,”* Browser added.

Regarding Boca Raton's plan to add Bitcoin (BTC) to its balance sheet, the statement said ARW, which offers services in all 50 US states, will work with the Gemini crypto exchange. The exchange will handle custodian services for the US residential guarantee.

In addition, the statement hints that BTC, which has risen more than 300% in the past 12 months, is **an asset that matches the profile of the securities ARW wants to invest in.**

It should be noted that AIG Warranty is a division of [American International Group](https://www.aig.com/business), Inc., a leading global insurance conglomerate serving commercial, institutional and retail customers in over 80 countries for over 30 years.",1615569055,12,1

m4td52,CntDstryr93,Why is it not meaningful to decrease BTC's mining difficulty in general and set a rather low upper bound?,"First of all, while I do understand BTC, I do not understand it comprehensively from a technical point of view, so I am probably overlooking something obvious. Feel free to elaborate where I went wrong. Also, I do not intend to discuss whether BTC's energy consumption is legitimate in general (there are other posts covering these discussions), so please refrain from turning this post into it.

Because of Bitcoin's proof of work, when more mining-pools try to mine blocks, mining difficulty must increase in order to ensure that a new block is mined each 10th minute on average, not faster. Increased difficulty results in lower chances of mining blocks unless you upgrade your mining equipment. This results in the following issues:

* Because more and more power is needed, energy consumption increases, which has been all over the media recently. Regardless whether this criticism is legitimate or not, BTC does consume an amount of energy equal to not-so-small countries.
* Those with access to cheap power are favored in this process. IIRC, the majority of blocks are mined by a relatively small number of mining-pools, many of them located in China. This centralization of miners may represent a threat in the future, especially when mining blocks becomes unprofitable in areas where power is not as cheap.

In order to solve these problems, I played with the thought of lowering BTC's mining difficulty and also set a  rather low upper bound. I am aware that this would simply result in blocks being mined at a much faster rate than each 10th minute on average. In order to avoid that, I propose the following process:

* There is a list with 100 entries at most.
* The first one to find a correct nonce assumes spot #1 on this list, the second one assumes spot #2, the third one assumes spot #3 and so forth.
* When the list is full, the winner is drawn. Spot #1 has a 50% chance of winning, spot #2 a 25% chance, spot #3 a 12.5% and so forth (percentages up to discussion).
* The winner's nonce/hash is assigned to the new block and receives the BTC reward.

This process would have the following implications:

* Not only 1 correct nonce, but 100 have to be found. This demands a lower mining difficulty in general, so that it does not take hours or even days to mine a new block.
* Mining becomes more democratized: Given the lower upper bound, mining BTC may become profitable for smaller mining-pools or even single persons, decentralizing BTC mining.
* Less energy consumption because it is not profitable anymore to have the most hashpower, given that you may not win the lottery after all.

What do you think? Where did I went so wrong that I should be ashamed of myself? Looking forward to some answers, feel free to improve, disprove etc.",1615720329,12,1

Second, because its at a all time high, its not best to invest in  it just yet since All Time Highs are a pattern before a great fall. So, its not wise to invest so much because to the potential of devaluation. That true too?

We've got people around here talking about bitcoin being risky without even a passing nod to how risky it is to hold fiat right now. Cashing out? Finding ""your moon"" is not enough. You know they printed $1,900,000,000,000 this week? Out of thin fucking air. How long would it take you to earn a fraction of that? How many hours? What do you think is going to happen as soon as that money hits your grocery store? The velocity of money is being held down by the pandemic, the money printer is at levels never before seen in all of human history, asset prices are already soaring - the storm is here folks! Get on the lifeboat while you still can because one day you're going wake up and realize nobody will accept your fiat as payment anymore, they only accept bitcoin, and the measly amount of sats you were able to procure back when it was simply an investment to you is now the entirety of your portfolio and you've got to support your entire extended friends and family with it or else they will live in abject poverty.

It's very simple, just buy and hold. Never sell, never cash out, never trade, just buy and hold forever. Fuck DCA too, this is a bull market, you're losing sats because you lack conviction.

Surely if anyone can create a wallet using bitcoinpaperwallet.com, and there's no additional security (passwods, 2FA, etc) - with advances in computing, eventually we will achieve a computing power which can go through trillions of wallet addresses and private keys emptying them? I've been explained this point before, but I think I'm too stupid to understand.

2) With ledger wallets - how do we know they're not being tampered with in the factory? I know this is overly paranoid and is not happening - but the whole point of Bitcoin is that it's supposed to be decentralised.

I hear a lot of YouTubers talking about how bitcoin can get ***x*** high, or something like the price will eventually be based on the stock market etc. 

I think this is complete BS. Bitcoin is its own separate market. The sky is the limit. There is no limit with bitcoin, it is its own thing, its own category. In twenty years, Bitcoin market cap could be 10x that of what gold is today. It could replace every asset. The Bitcoin rush, like the gold rush ... but more epic. 

Hell, Bitcoin could reach $1T per coin in 20 years. Who knows. We are still very early in the game. Remember, most people do not understand nor care about Bitcoin. It's a great thing that massive companies are buying it because that increases the price. This could keep happening for 20 years and we could all be millionaires with a small amount of Bitcoin. We could buy a house with a fraction of the Bitcoin we own.

Imagine walking in to a store. There are no workers, only robots. Robots that transact with everything in the store, including the customer. These transactions are made via blockchain technology. This is definitely a possibility. 

I also hear people talking about altcoins and how the price increases or decreases based on the price of Bitcoin. Eventually there will be a handful of altcoins (pick wisely), that break away from that cycle. 

I am extremely excited to watch this market grow. Grow exponentially. WE ARE EARLY. Think of how amazing it will be after 10-20 years when we have an extra large sum of money to retire on. Our children, our family, WE can be financially free for the rest of our lives. 

Happy Hodling!

If you want to make the argument about institutional buyers: you must take into consideration that it takes MORE MONEY to move the price when the market cap is larger. Yes there are institutional buyers, but that's exactly what we need for bitcoin to reach 6 figures in the first place. You guys seriously think that bitcoin is just going to peak at 200k for the market cycle and NOT correct 75%? It's done that every single time ever since the beginning of bitcoin's existence.

BA - recently traders sold off BA when it printed 278 and that's no accident as the 50 month moving average will act as resistance for the stock which is currently at 280.

Hoping that someone reads this before dealing with them

The company claims to be a KYC-free BTC purchasing platform on its website and affiliates as well as advertising.  
Beware that they will **charge you** before a KYC is asked to verify your identity,   
they will not send any coins to your address, charge you the full amount and hold your money in the air until you give them a KYC in order to process the refund of coins that weren't deposited to your wallets. They will also keep 4% and 10 euro on each refunds for ""administrative fee' even if they have not deposited any amount to your wallet.   
Which is completely pointless and leads me to believe that this website is fraudulous and should be avoided.

m5sjq3,icedlemoncake,8 tips when helping someone set up a bitcoin wallet!,"I was helping my friend from China setup her first bitcoin wallet today, and thought I'd share 8 tips that may be useful if you find yourself in a similar situation. 

1. Don't tell them to buy from an exchange immediately, where they may think using bitcoin requires providing ID on a KYC/AML regulated exchange. Help them setup a bitcoin wallet on their phone, where they can navigate the app and learn about basic wallet security. They can buy bitcoin from an exchange after.

2. Use easy vocabulary - using easy words will make learning new concepts all the more faster. Spend more time rethinking what you're trying to explain in an easy to understand language. 

3. Make an effort to explain basic security concepts, also in an easy to understand way. It's very common for people to want to take screen shots of their backup words without realising the risks. Explain the importance of offline backups, 2FA and other wallet features to better protect their funds and privacy. 

4. Don't overcomplicate things! You know the deal, the more moving parts the more likely something will break. Trying to convince the person they should add an additional passphrase to their seed phrase, recommending multisig or that they should buy a hardware wallet are not all necessarily good advice. In time some of these (may) be a good idea, but may overcomplicate things if they are just starting out. 

5. Make it easy for them by recommending a good, secure but easy to use wallet, they can always switch later. If English is not their first language, there is no point having a 24 word mnemonic, they are more likely to write down one of the words incorrectly than having a 12 word mnemonic which is perfectly sufficient. 

6. Don't be a gatekeeper. Telling them that they should only be interested in bitcoin or any other token because of your preconceived view is unlikely to be helpful to them. Instead, explain the properties that make bitcoin valuable, it's better if they think and ask questions for themselves in this shift to decentralisation. 

7. Spark their interest! Of course if they have a background in computer science or mathematics it's easy to get excited about bitcoin's game-theoretic consensus model, proof of work immutability and the public key cryptography which allows only the sender create valid signatures. But by answering questions with interesting answers (which they will be coz it's bitcoin) they're more likely to learn more about it, regardless of their specific area of interest. 

8. Don't be stingy! Bitcoin is best experienced rather than explained. Sending them a small amount of bitcoin so they can experience it better is far more memorable than you just explaining how a transaction works.

In short, making the learning curve less steep and being patient is really important for newcomers in their journey down the rabbit hole.

Survey: Stakeholder interests in public blockchains

Dear all,

I am an information systems student at the University of Zurich and currently writing my bachelor thesis on blockchain governance and interest alignment. Within this thesis, I work towards a framework about different stakeholder interests in public and permissionless blockchain projects and created a survey to evaluate this framework.

In this regard, if you are in any way involved in such public blockchain projects (e.g. investing, mining, developing service tools, ...), I would very much appreciate your participation in that survey.

Survey Link: [https://www.uzh.ch/zi/cl/umfragen/index.php/967815?lang=en](https://www.uzh.ch/zi/cl/umfragen/index.php/967815?lang=en)

The survey takes **no more than 10 minutes** and is conducted anonymously. Should there be any questions or remarks, please do not hesitate to contact me. Also, feel free to share this link with others!

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Kind regards

A day after (March 2nd) we fixed the issue ([https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/pull/5295](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/pull/5295))  
but we did not release it.

Yesterday (March 16th) multiple macOS users started reporting this Tor issue ([https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/3693#issuecomment-800093080](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/3693#issuecomment-800093080)).

Also yesterday (March 16th) Wasabi deployed v1.1.12.5 which includes a fix for this macOS Tor issue [https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/releases/tag/v1.1.12.5](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/releases/tag/v1.1.12.5).

m714sx,BITCOIN_FLIGHT_CLUB,"“Banks aren’t the enemy, they’re trying to protect you.”","Everyone tripping about banks stopping their ability to transact due to fraud protections really needs to stop and think about what’s happening. The only money you’re immediately entitled to when transacting are the funds you hold solely in your possession, aka cash in hand. Banks have a liability mandate to depositors. It involves protecting them from malicious actors masquerading as their customer as part of that mandate. If they fail to be somewhat partial to safety, in respect to inconvenience, they stand to lose depositor’s money or being liable to cover the amount from their own pocket or through insurances they maintain. 

If you want to buy Bitcoin, it helps to do so in small amounts regularly when using your card accounts, especially when making initial purchases from exchanges. This will be less likely to trigger fraud protections and the inconvenience this can bring. Criminals know this also. It’s why they usually charge a few dollars and go big shortly after. It’s an attempt to establish a pattern in a new location, and ensure the card numbers work. Banks are playing cat and mouse games to protect you. 

If you really want to buy Bitcoin, use a reputable and widely used exchange and use wire transfers to fund your account in large amounts. You may still trip protections here, especially if you’ve never wired money before, never wired that large an amount, or if the recipient is newly added. 

I’ve never had a bank deny my ability to buy Bitcoin since the early days. I have experienced several occasions of fraud protections delaying my purchases. If you experience an account closure however, it’s most likely due to money laundering rules at the bank, and you may be throwing red flags in other areas. It helps to be realistic, and consider both sides of the argument here. 

Banks don’t really care what they hold for you, but they’re highly concerned with losing it.",1615989853,33,1

my previous/proper email/log in was blocked as i was travelling in the US at the time i logged in so i had to withdraw funds. That address was never fully KYC verified. I had an email conversation with Bitmex about this. i was allowed to withdraw funds and the account was closed.

I have 2fa enabled on my throwaway email and am KYC verified.

I can still log in to Bitmex and trade. Is there any way around this since i have fully verified my identity with them? I am based in the UK. Is there a way of changing my email and withdrawing my funds? cant believe this :(

""The recent hike in bitcoin price and after Tesla announced it bought $1,5 billion worth of bitcoin made me think I can't be dismissive towards cryptocurrencies anymore""

""I was very dismissive toward bitcoin because it doesn't have intrinsic value. But there are a lot of things that people want and value highly which have no intrinsic value. How about a painting, a diamond, a bar of gold?""

""Bitcoin confidential. Nobody, including the government, knows about your holdings but you. Nobody can steal it from you.""

""The people who bought at 5000, so far it looks like they were right.""

""My initial response was a knee jerk reaction without information and that's not a good way to behave.""

""Now I've learned how much I don't know.""

However, it seems to me that if we are entering a new monetary era, some currencies will be competitive on the basis of their usefulness, security, privacy, transaction and storage ease, etc.  Some other currencies may be competitive based on their ties to real world assets and uses.  For instance, I think USD will have value as long as the government can through you in prison for tax evasion and crypto backed by precious metals will have value corresponding to those assets.  

I just don't see where Bitcoin fits in.  There are other cryptocurrencies and asset classes that seem to do everything that Bitcoin does, but much better.  

Bitcoin may be the first mover, but if eventually we are going to have an accessible and open market for currencies, where does Bitcoin compete? I guess network effects matter, but if the exchanges keep allowing people to exchange a variety of cryptocurrencies, aren't those undermined?

Even if Bitcoin is widely adopted and for example, businesses figure out how to use it in everyday transactions, aren't they also basically figuring how to use every other crypto as well?

Does anyone have experience with this?,"I’ve only thought about this for a few weeks now so haven’t fully made up my mind yet, but i’m thinking of maybe buying a Trezor for each child, do monthly DCA-buys for a certain Fiat equivalent (for consistency), and put the coins onto the Trezor like once a year or so... my biggest worry is that technology develops quickly and i’m gonna struggle to access the funds in 20 years time or so?

m6gc6q,accsuibleh,Need a little information to put my father at ease about his new Bitcoin investments,"First up, I've spent some years telling my father that investing in Bitcoin is a good idea. Recently he decided to put some money into it and has concerns that are hard to address:

1. He found this [article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/us-government-targeting-cryptocurrency-expand-reach-its-financial-surveillance) explaining how Crypto is making it easier to track people. I've told him about ""boating accidents"" and how easy it is to just move Crypto to multiple places the government can never know anything about, but he seems very stuck on this point. He thinks that if the IRS comes knocking then the burden of proof is on HIM to prove he DOESN'T have any crypto...
2. DEX's. The above article states that the Government could ""take actions against \[DEX's\]"" but that doesn't quite make sense to me since they are... decentralized... so if I am missing something here please let me know.
3. Moving crypto anonymously across international borders. I've told him about how easy this is to do, but if anyone could provide a more solid explanation of different ways to do this ( I know of some but I'm guessing there are many) I would be grateful.
4.   Capital gain taxes - This one is so stupid, but he doesn't want to pay taxes on Capital gains. I've tried explaining to him that if his investments do very well (for example- gaining 100,000 and paying 15,000 in taxes is still 85,000 dollars he didn't have before) it won't really matter, but he seems illogically stuck on this point. 
5. FUD - This is what I worry about most. It seems like he is actively finding all the reasons this won't work out, and I think that will make him very susceptible to FUD, does anyone have historical FUD examples so I can try to put things into perspective?

lwqhj9,jzollobirds,I've seen a lot of posts lately,"I've seen a lot of posts lately that complain about high transaction fees, and how bitcoin is not usable as money, this is not what Satoshi Invisioned, etc.

Well, bitcoin is not used ideally for money right now, and it is not supposed to be. Fees are high because you are not supposed to be buying and sending small amounts of bitcoin. It is for large transactions at the moment. 

We are in the early stages of adoption and the world moves much slower than we like.

Here is an excerpt from saylor.org free course on bitcoin  about the process that bitcoin needs to go through before it is adopted as something you can use to make everyday transactions.

Using modern terminology, money always evolves in the following four stages:

Collectible: In the very first stage of its evolution, money will be demanded solely based on its peculiar properties, usually becoming a whimsy of its possessor. Shells, beads, and gold were all collectibles before later transitioning to the more familiar roles of money.

Store of value: Once it is demanded by enough people for its peculiarities, money will be recognized as a means of keeping and storing value over time. As a good becomes more widely recognized as a suitable store of value, its purchasing power will rise as more people demand it for this purpose. The purchasing power of a store of value will eventually plateau when it is widely held and the influx of new people desiring it as a store of value dwindles.

Medium of exchange: When money is fully established as a store of value, its purchasing power will stabilize. Having stabilized in purchasing power, the opportunity cost of using money to complete trades will diminish to a level where it is suitable for use as a medium of exchange. In the earliest days of Bitcoin, many people did not appreciate the huge opportunity cost of using bitcoins as a medium of exchange, rather than as an incipient store of value. The famous story of a man trading 10,000 bitcoins (worth approximately $94 million at the time of this article's writing) for two pizzas illustrates this confusion.

Unit of account: When money is widely used as a medium of exchange, goods will be priced in terms of it. I.e., the exchange ratio against money will be available for most goods. It is a common misconception that bitcoin prices are available for many goods today. For example, while a cup of coffee might be available for purchase using bitcoins, the price listed is not a true bitcoin price; rather it is the dollar price desired by the merchant translated into bitcoin terms at the current USD/BTC market exchange rate. If the price of bitcoin were to drop in dollar terms, the number of bitcoins requested by the merchant would increase commensurately. Only when merchants are willing to accept bitcoins for payment without regard to the bitcoin exchange rate against fiat currencies can we truly think of Bitcoin as having become a unit of account.",1614766359,27,17

lwpwap,redditclm,What keeps Bitcoin alive in 20 years time?,"Over the years since crypto was introduced, I have had couple of questions in my head that I haven't been able to figure out or see anyone answering.

If I understand correctly, Bitcoin mining is method of verifying transactions made in the Bitcoin network, correct? For doing those verification, the user is given Bitcoin as a reward.

Bitcoins are in a fixed limited supply, which means each time this verification process is done, there is less coins left.

The reward for mining (doing the verification process) reached to a point some years ago where the cost of electricity for the mining process was higher than the reward.

With these important elements come the following questions. 

A. What happens when all Bitcoin is mined out over a course of longer time period?
B. What happens if the energy cost of mining stays higher than the reward value over longer time periods as well?

Based on A and B, what is the incentive to keep verifying the Bitcoin network transactions if there is no reward left?

If there is no verification process in action, what would keep this whole idea alive and functioning? Let's say 10,20,30 year time from now?",1614763993,18,2

For example, let's say I bought 1 bitcoin for $10,000.00 and now it is worth $20,000.00 and I want to take out my initial investment of $10,000 (1/2 of a bitcoin) and leave the other $10,000 in bitcoin, would I get taxed on on the $10,000.00 that I am withdrawing?

1) I am looking at BTC price and it's currently ~$49,950 but then click buy and then the rate is suddenly $50,220 according to the rate for the purchase, and then I back out and its back to $49,950. It's not the price moving, it's coinbase just charging me more than the price shown for BTC. Same has happened to me for ethereum.

2) converting to a stable coin resulting in a significant drop in equity. I converted $1,000 BTC a few weeks back into a stable coin worth 1 dollar, I think it was DAO. Upon converting, I had only ~$975, and then when I converted back it was ~$950. There were no fees and coinbase tried to explain it but that makes no sense. If I have $1000 of any coin and I buy $1000 of a stable currency, I should have $1000, not $950...

lwor1f,facepalm5000,I think I've figured it out,"ok, I haven't figured out anything, but here's a hypothesis anyway

seemingly intelligent people (the latest of which is michael burry) speak disparagingly of bitcoin with an astonishingly high level of confidence that they're right about bitcoin being bad/pointless/overpriced/etc. for the life of me, I can't figure out why can't see at least the partial usefulness of bitcoin and everything that it is.

But one thought: bitcoin is so novel, so groundbreaking, so innovative, that people can't even see it. they can't see it in the way an ant can't see a smartphone (ok, exaggerating, but still). they're so thoroughly entranced by the high-time-preference, high-entropy, central-authority-stockholm-syndrome default worldview, that they don't even see the things that bitcoin fixes as problems.

for them, the world where wealth slowly slips away through entropy, or is only preserved through the debt-fueled frenetic activity of a public tech company or by loaning it back to a central authority with a military, (or rather than preserved, simply received continually as a gift by virtue of one's proximity to a fiat money printer), is the only possible world that can exist.

I think about it this way: most people are so high time preference, so focused on the short term, so involved in high frequency, high risk, frenetic active hedging and trading strategies in business and in life, that that is the only world they can conceive of. Enter bitcoin, a deceptively simple, long term, stable, low frequency, low time preference savings technology, they can't even see it.

Their time preference is so high, and bitcoin is designed for people whose time preference is so low, that for them bitcoin just doesn't exist in any meaningful way. they see people interacting with it but can't understand their behavior.

so instead they just try to fit into framings they can understand....""bubble"", ""ponzi"", ""greedy waste of energy""

here's to you, the low time preference people who actually understand btc.",1614759195,99,99

I’m extremely passionate about the topic. I was wondering whether anyone would be able to give it a read for me and let me know if there’s anything they think I’m  missing or if anyone wanted to learn about decentralization. I don’t actually know anyone who’s interested in Bitcoin and crypto in real life except one person so I thought perhaps this would be the best place to share it. It would mean a lot to me and I hope perhaps those who are new to crypto and Bitcoin will be able to learn something. Thanks. I have a load more topics I’ll be covering in the coming weeks too.

lwnujp,Present_Turn7021,To think that one bitcoin is more than many people can afford now.,"I haven’t been in crypto for very long. Started working at a crypto mining farm in Jan 2018 and it changed my life. 

My employers asked if I was cool getting paid in bitcoin. At the time, my answer was “As long as I can sell it into Ringgit Malaysia (fiat)”. Got paid around $1k+ monthly - remembered receiving about 0.2 bitcoin monthly. One day, I didnt have to sell all of it because I already have more than enough fiat. So i figured meh Ill just save it for later. That’s when it happened. Bitcoin went up 20% from $3k+ to $4.2k and so did my salary. Kept going up and i kept hodling.

Employers turned out to be greedy dicks and changed their minds towards the end - “we are not paying you in precious BTC anymore”. But my love for crypto remains. 

I was let go shortly after without any compensation and notice after I helped them move their operation to the US where the electricity is a lot lower. Struggled to make ends meet for a little while but doing odd jobs and investing in bitcoin mining got me going. Managed to feed my wife and kid. 

I reinvested mining profits into more machines all around the world with hosting, cloud contracts, and the returns kept compounding. 

Ive never told anyone I have bitcoin except for my wife. I am happily retired at 30 in a country where $200 is a family’s monthly grocery. For most of the time, I just spend time with my kid and wife who works from home. And to think I owe this lifestyle all to those tiny tiny bitcoins I saved up 3 years ago. HODL friends.

lwmvz8,Hot_Championship_787,Cryptocurrencies purchased in U.S. dollars do not need to be reported to the IRS,"According to the Cryptocurrency FAQ (Q5) updated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on March 2, 2021, cryptocurrency purchases made in fiat currencies are not subject to any type of U.S. Internal Revenue Service tax report.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier news, on December 11, 2020, the US Internal Revenue Service issued a new 2020 tax year 1040 return, all US taxpayers are required to submit this return. The lack of clear guidance on the definition of ""virtual currency"" has made some cryptocurrency users confused.

&amp;#x200B;

Subsequently, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a revised draft of Directive 1040 on December 31, 2020, which clarified the content covered by the term virtual currency. The IRS uses the term virtualcurrency to describe various types of convertible virtual currencies used as a medium of exchange, such as digital currencies and encrypted currencies, and points out that no matter which version is used, if a particular asset has the characteristics of a virtual currency, it will be considered Virtual currency. The updated draft requires that if citizens purchase cryptocurrency during 2020, they must check ""Yes"" on the virtual currency issue on page 1, although this may not trigger any taxable events.

&amp;#x200B;

On January 4, 2021, DonFort, the former head of the Criminal Investigation Department of the US Internal Revenue Service, published an article that the US Internal Revenue Service may accelerate the pace of cryptocurrency taxation enforcement. The article said that although the agency has so far focused its resources on providing appropriate reporting guidelines to the public, it will now shift to stricter enforcement. According to the article, major trends such as the U.S. Internal Revenue Service moving the cryptocurrency tax issue to the top of the 1040 form indicate that it is working to eradicate the phenomenon of insufficient payment of cryptocurrency taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the new guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides clearer instructions for taxpayers to answer this question. In addition, privacy-conscious crypto users will realize that they do not need to unnecessarily disclose their involvement in cryptocurrencies to the IRS.

&amp;#x200B;

However, FAQ-Q5 only applies to cryptocurrencies purchased with fiat currency. If you purchase a cryptocurrency using another cryptocurrency, you must check ""Yes"" on the 1040 form question. This may also trigger taxable events.

&amp;#x200B;

It is worth noting that as Bitcoin gets more and more attention, it may also be subject to further scrutiny by regulators. The Internal Revenue Service is also accelerating the pace of cryptocurrency taxation enforcement. As early as January 4, 2020, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) stated in its Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) that donors who donate more than $5,000 in cryptocurrency to charities must conduct tax assessments on their donations. This may affect the vigorous development of cryptocurrency in philanthropy. Alex Wilson, co-founder of the cryptocurrency charity TheGivingBlock, said that this new assessment requirement will make people hesitate to donate more than $5,000.

&amp;#x200B;

In November last year, Erika Nijenhuis, senior adviser to the Tax Policy Office of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, also stated that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is evaluating different approaches to cryptocurrency taxation regulations. Nijenhuis also pays attention to the burden that each method places on cryptocurrency related parties (such as exchanges), as well as a series of benefits that each method brings, such as improved compliance.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, the trends of the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also affect investors' adoption of encryption. ARKCEOCatherineWood stated in December last year that Bitcoin's extremebullish did not invest a large amount of money because of compliance considerations (more than 10% of the return will be confiscated by the IRS).",1614751851,32,7

bitcoins are believed as the future money for every transaction. so nothing goes wrong by learning about that.

first, let's have a [basic knowledge](https://sites.google.com/view/bitcoin-trading-for-beginners/information?authuser=0) about what is bitcoin mining and bitcoin trading.

  
Bitcoin mining:

[Bitcoin Mining](https://preview.redd.it/bzcv6hvv2rk61.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f57ca42ff134dce1541fd7059ce984e362354adf)

these two points make you remember the concept - 

1.everyone must have heard of gold mining, which goes like a person digs until he gets gold in hand. 2. other is maintaining the ledger of every transaction.

thus bitcoin mining helps you get bitcoin as a token of credit for your work. concept of work is simple, which is finding the bitcoin transaction and recording it in the blockchain, which is a public record. But doing this is not very simple, for this, you need either GPU or ASIC in order to solve complex hashing puzzles.

&amp;#x200B;

[Trading Graph](https://preview.redd.it/s6xwoeoz2rk61.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11073b4c7507432f0c995114e81a7ccd3d9bc4cb)

Bitcoin trading is simple, either buy or sell bitcoin by considering the fluctuation of the market.  
on the other hand, money plays a role. the cost to mine Bitcoin for miners can range between $5,000 and $8,500. you can invest $1 in bitcoin but depending on the exchange the fee may vary from $0.01 to $0.99 for a minimum $1.99 purchase.

lwlbtx,Ou8amaus,Refinancing my mortgage to buy BTC? Yes? No? Your thoughts?,"Hey all,

I have DCA'd in and currently own a bit of  Bitcoin... BUT: I want more &amp; think the price is going to rise sharply over the next year

I'm Canadian &amp; want to refinance my mortgage to pull 100K out of the equity of my house to buy (2) Bitcoin. Yes, I've heard the cautions: don't invest more than you can afford to loose, it's volatile, etc...  I'm looking for feedback (not a criticism of the idea) of why or why not to do so (something I'm not considering). I'm looking to retire in 10-15 years so will likely just HODL (not trade) till then. I feel like I'll never be able to borrow this amount of money at this interest rate again and the gains upside is extremely appealing. Thanks for your thoughts, much appreciated.

Other info: it would pull out almost all the equity in our house, we would be getting a better 5-yr-term (25 year) fixed rate of 1.69% for 373K, yes we can afford the increased payments. No debt, no car payments (for about 2-3 years), household income 150k/yr, 60K in accessible TSFA savings if needed (RRSP's can't be pulled out).",1614746253,57,4

mh2k5b,Peccataclamantia,The Bitcoin Network does not transfer dollars.,"The bitcoin network does \*not\* transfer money.  


What is the ontological status of a bitcoin?  
Bitcoins are proofs that computers performed a series of pointless math calculations.  


These proofs are \*not\* monetary instruments, securities, bonds, obligations. They have nothing to do with finance. A bitcoin does \*not\* entitle its holder to anything whatsoever. A dollar while subjective in value allows me to pay objective tax obligations. The dollar itself has \*no\* value, what has \*value\* is that which labor power created. Dollars just allow us to organize labor power in more complex interactions. That is \*all\* money is.  


Comparing to Visa is completely meaningless considering that visa process payments of actual dollars. Visa \*shifts\* dollars between balance sheets. Bitcoin does \*not\*.   


The ownership of bitcoin may change based on who holds the private key but that is \*not\* the same thing as transferring money.  


Just because bitcoin has the nominal word COIN in it does \*not\* make it money. Names reflect \*essences\* that are \*knowable\* however inprecisely to us. They are real.  


So lets stop it with the claims that the bitcoin network transfers 'billions'. It transfers the ownership of a proof that computers performed pointless math problems.   


What is the \*economic value\* of these proofs? To determine that we ask, does bitcoin improve the efficiency of energy transfer? Do I get more output with less input? The answer is no.   


So the economic value of bitcoin is zero. If bitcoin mining \*does not\* locate a power source which is near free, the entire network will collapse.",1617183803,29,1

He immediately  introduced me into this crypto space (started with Bitcoin) but couldn’t understand much about investing in it; I was just following what he was saying without much  idea of what I was doing. Though excited when my first investment rose with the rise of Bitcoin value, I only got frustrated when it dipped from $67k to $54k within a month.

mh0w06,Material_Youth601,Bitcoin Stolem - Are CNCIntel / Intelligence legitimate asset recovery specialists? Can such a company actually exist?,"Hey there, still learning my way around crypto (as will become evident), sorry if this post somehow breaks the rules.

Tl;Dr: I had a large amount of crypto stolen from me and I'm seeking experienced opinion on CNC Intelligence who claim to have experience in asset recovery, among other things. I'm not looking for other security tips or to be reminded of how I could have better protected myself, I just need help with discerning the legitimacy of this company.

Please try to resist posting if you don't have relevant evidence or specific experience dealing with CNC Intelligence; It's been very difficult to come to peace with what happened to me because I've had a hard time discerning palpable evidence into the legitimacy of this company who claim to be capable of helping in crypto retrieval. My scam-alarm is ringing at high volume, so I'm looking for legitimate, experienced feedback to help me decide whether to proceed with their services.

I had BTC / ETH stolen from me last week, and in a bid to try and recoup some of the lost cost, after contacting police and the brokerage I held the coin on, I reached out to numerous 'crypto asset recovery' companies after long and panicked googling. 

CNC Intelligence / CNCIntel have been the only ones to respond; I've exchanged communications with a representative, they've ostensibly examined the TxIDs and determined that 'something' can be done to get the coin back. 

I'm aware that BTC and ETH transactions are irreversible. Thus, the only way I'd naively understand to get anything out of this would be to either convince the current holders to return funds (I guess a bribe would be involved) or to serve as expert witnesses to police. Both seem to have incredibly poor success rates on the face of them.

In researching CNCIntel / intelligence, it's very difficult to find much of what I would perceive as a legitimate footprint online. No one is talking about them, they have a very dubious trustpilot page and a handful of puff-piece articles written by the company themselves to promote what they claim to be able to do. They seem to have created a similarly dubious subreddit about two weeks ago.

Not a good sign amongst any of it.

They certainly seem to be an actually registered company, both in Washington and Israel, but I'm going to assume this is not too difficult to setup. They're either a scam, or are terrible at creating a reassuring image for themselves; I would be too, but I'm also not claiming to be a company that can help people in desperate hours of need.

So. Does anyone have any legitimate experience with the company, any of its known staff or at the least experience dealing with similar 'asset retrieval' firms? I'd made peace with the idea that my money was gone, but I'm in turmoil again because I can't get enough of a bearing to know that I'm in safe hands here or not.

mgzjub,infectuz,Clearing up a misconception about BlockFi,"I was looking into how the community feels about BlockFi and been reading your comments about it I’d just like to clear something up I believe a lot of people are not understanding about this.

I kept reading something along the lines of “why risk your BTC which appreciates on average 100% a year (in fiat) for an extra 6%” and that’s is just _incorrect_  on all fronts, let me make a case for it.

First of all let me mention about the “risk” which is completely overblown. BlockFi did not shutdown withdrawals even during the March dump of 2020, so short of a complete market collapse I don’t believe they would have any problems with liquidations. Furthermore, people lose cold storage BTC everyday and yet BlockFi has _never_ lost a single BTC so they’re way safer statistically speaking than cold storage.

Second let me mention the interest, the big point that a lot of you are missing is that interest is paid out IN KIND, you earn 6% not on your fiat you earn that on your BTC. So the argument about risking it all for 6% is just not valid.

Let’s say to make it easy that you deposit 1.6 BTC - at the end of the year you would have 0.1 BTC more than you had before so 1.7 BTC total. If BTC increases 100% thats 100% that you missed out, plus this interest compounds so it should be even higher than that once all is said and done. I’d say that returns like this are definitely worth the risk but that’s just me, I like small risk high rewards situation and this is one of those.

Lastly I’d urge you to stop thinking about fiat, that 100% price appreciation is meaningless, if you’re talking about stacking sats which is the only important thing you can do right now, BlockFi is the _best_ place to do that, you’re literally stacking sats passively without any action from you. Don’t miss out on this because of not your keys not your coins.",1617170903,48,1

I recently found the emails where I discussed the payment with my client back then saw I have a bitcoin address. I also saw that I received through blockchain. I tried using this address to log in my wallet but it says it's invalid. I know the password I used for everything back then, so I'm thinking that if I can fill out the login, I can access the wallet.

mfzsjm,1precious,Exotic Car Rental MPH Club Now Accepts Bitcoin,"PRESS RELEASE. MPH Club announced that they will allow their clients to pay in bitcoin to rent cars. MPH Club is a Miami-based exotic and luxury car rental that allows their customers to vacation in style. Their fleet includes the newest models from Lamborghini, Ferrari, McLaren, Rolls Royce, and others.

They offer a few services, which include:

Rentals
Membership
Chauffeurs
Corporate events
Vehicle delivery
Hotel and airport pickup
Partnership program
Their service is incredibly popular and has been used by the likes of Steve Aoki, Floyd Mayweather, and Shaquille O’Neal. Part of the reason for their popularity is that they are able to offer such a wide selection is due to their partnership program.

The MPH Club Partnership Program – This service allows local exotic car owners to “lend” their cars to MPH Club. MPH Club will then add it to their fleet and offer it to their customers to rent out, usually at an average price of $1,000 per day. If the car rents then MPH Club will split the profit with the car owner.

This program has allowed them to grow their business at an incredible rate and bring their service to almost every major city in Florida.

Benefits of the service

Part of the reason that MPH Club is so popular is because of the convenience that they offer to their clients. For one thing, their locations include Miami, Ft Lauderdale, Boca Raton, West Palm Beach, Naples, Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville, and Tallahassee. They also offer hotel and airport pickup to make the rental process as simple as possible for their clients.

Since many of these cities are major vacation hubs (particularly Miami), it allows them to capitalize on wealthy patrons who are looking to travel in style during their time off.

In addition to the number of locations, their partnership program acts as a win-win-win scenario.

 Clients – Their clients benefit from the program because they get access to a wider selection of cars. If MPH Club was 100% reliant on their own inventory then it would be much harder to offer all of the rental options that they do. Additionally, the large supply of rental options means a more competitive price for clients.
 Car owners – The car owners benefit because they are able to turn their exotic car into an income-producing asset. Since many of these cars will rent for about $1,000 per day (the most expensive option is the Bugatti Veyron at $25,000 per day) just a few days of renting can create quite a bit of profit.
 MPH Club – MPH Club benefits from this arrangement because they are able to increase their inventory of cars without having to pay for it. Even though they split the profit with the car owner, they are essentially boosting their income for free.
Now accepting bitcoin

As mentioned, the MPH Club will now allow their clients to pay for their rentals in bitcoin. While they are not the first company to do this, it is still a big breakthrough for the cryptocurrency. A few major corporations such as Microsoft, Home Depot, and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond allow their customers to pay in bitcoin. The difference here is that MPH Club is not a major corporation.

MPH Club operates on a much smaller scale than these companies and can be considered a mid-size corporation. They only operate in Florida and have a few locations throughout the state but they are far from a major corporation.",1617052577,0,1

I am ready to throw my hat in the ring and purchase some BTC in due time. My question is I am also considering investing in a ETF that has a significant amount invested in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. My question is, is it wiser to simply purchase BTC directly rather than pay a firm a premium to be exposed to their positions. What are the advantages/disadvantages of personal ownership versus the trust? Is the whole point of BTC to not have one neck to choke as investing through a firm would allow? What is to say they don’t close their positions with the trust suddenly due to other circumstances within their portfolio?

mfy2gq,usavu,Anonymous mobile wallets for new users and safe?,"Hello! I am completely new to Bitcoin and crypto in general, I have never really looked into it at all. Now, I am selling an item I have in a game for $5000, and I figured that making the sale via Bitcoin would be the safest option (compared to PayPal, etc.). I am trying to decide on which mobile wallet I should use to do this transaction. I was originally going to use CoinBase, but I'm having some trouble with their verification methods so I can't do it right now - in the semi-near future I plan on transferring the $5000 from the anonymous wallet to Coinbase so I can exchange it to PayPal, though. 

I need a wallet that is relatively easy for new crypto-people to use, and also pretty safe. The only major thing I think I be afraid of is a ""Double Spending"" scam; see [here](https://coinsutra.com/bitcoin-double-spending/), [here](https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002990823-How-do-I-prevent-double-spend-fraud-on-unconfirmed-payments-), [here](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/722/has-there-ever-been-a-successful-double-spend-attack-on-the-bitcoin-network-if) and [here](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/a-vulnerability-in-some-bitcoin-wallets-leads-to-double-spend-attacks-and-inflated-balance/).

Maybe they are playing the long game and realize that their growth as a company is dependent on BTC price action. If they let BTC go too parabolic, it reduces the amount of BTC they can mine at that price as well as  effects overall balance sheet stability and performance.

If they could put a leash on growth and make this bull run last way longer than previous cycles, it would tremendously increase their CAGR over a multi year period and stabilize their revenue growth.

I still think BTC going parabolic is inevitable at the end of cycle but part of me thinks they want to draw it out as long as possible which honestly may be the best for BTC value.

Some quotes:

&gt;I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fullypeer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The main properties:Double-spending is prevented with a peer-to-peer network.No mint or other trusted parties.Participants can be anonymous.New coins are made from Hashcash style proof-of-work.The proof-of-work for new coin generation also powers thenetwork to prevent double-spending.

Satoshi Nakamoto, October 31st, 2008

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.

Satoshi Nakamoto, Nov 3rd, 2008

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Bitcoin network might actually reduce spam by diverting zombie farms to generating bitcoins instead.

Satoshi Nakamoto, Nov 3rd, 2008

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt;You will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.

Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.

Satoshi Nakamoto, Nov 6th, 2008

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The fact that new coins are produced means the money supply increases by a planned amount, but this does not necessarily result in inflation. If the supply of money increases at the same rate that the number of people using it increases, prices remain stable. If it does not increase as fast as demand, there will be deflation and early holders of money will see its value increase.

Satoshi Nakamoto, Nov 6th, 2008

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There will be transaction fees, so nodes will have an incentive to receive and include all the transactions they can. Nodes will eventually be compensated by transaction fees alone when the total coins created hits the pre-determined ceiling.

lw8djx,Jussulent_Argonaut,Another Bitpanda withdrawal drama...,"I can’t believe I’m posting this here again but apparently I’m a stupid moron and continued to trade on bitpanda, 3 months after writing a similar post when my funds were frozen on bitpanda requiring me to show them “proof of funds” for coins that I had purchased in 2017.
Back then the issue got resolved within 4-5 days (and me luckily being able to deliver actual invoices etc.) so I idiotically assumed that bitpanda would now “know” that I rightfully own a certain amount of BTC. 

I recently cashed out a some money from a savings plan and deposited the fiat on my bitpanda account with the intention to purchase some more Satoshis. This triggered again a “proof of fund” request, which I complied with and submitted confirmations from the savings plans, screenshots of my bank account etc. 

Well, it turns out that this is now not enough for bitpanda who are now requiring proof of funds for the TOTAL value (coins, fiats, etc) of ALL my assets on bitpanda. So basically, with every single deposit over a certain amount to my account I will be required to resubmit proof of funds for everything, apparently even including coins I purchased on bitpanda... 

I understand that regulated exchanges need to comply with AML and KYC regulations but for fuck’s same this is just stupid. 

And of course it remains totally unclear what actually triggers these proof of fund checks - no answers were given by the but panda Helpdesk on which amount, frequency, trading volume etc.
Also, no warning at all was given BEFORE depositing the fiat that this could lead to PoF.

I have nobody else to blame them myself for still doing business with them. I was lured by the convenience of already having a validated account, but I just can’t see how one can reasonably trade or even just buy coins on a regular basis on this platform. 

I have received a response from their Helpdesk after approx 48 hours. I assume it will take another 3-5 days to get everything resolved, with plenty of time spent by me looking for invoices, screenshots of blockchain explorers etc...again. 

Since my last post I’ve been contacted by 5 people who are having similar issues so I will update this post as and when this issue gets resolved.

lw7zr9,dorodor_equavius,Diversity. Equity. Respect. Responsibility.,"
Hi everyone,

This is a post to explore the ethical responsibility of all those whose lives are changing for the better because of blockchain and cryptocurrency. 

It’s well known that the crypto space is overwhelmingly dominated by white men. It’s a privilege to have access to the money, time, and technology that allow us to capitalize on the rise of cryptocurrency. Much like the stock market, this form of wealth accumulation is inaccessible to most of the world. Therefore, I’d like this post to encourage all to reflect on how fortunate we are and what we can do to help marginalized or disadvantaged communities with the money we are accruing. What world will we live in next year? The cryptosphere represents a mass transfer of power from institutions to individuals, but to which individuals? Those of us whose lives are changing radically for the better must consider the type of world we will live in, the type of world we want to live in—envision a better society and work to make it inclusive.

Here are some things we can all do:

• Introduce BIPOC, women, and other disadvantaged or marginalized people to the space. Help them set up a wallet. Gift them some crypto. Get people involved. Educate. Diversify the community. Not only will this promote racial and gender equity, a more egalitarian world, it will also introduce a broader range of perspectives and minds, by which we will all benefit.

• Be mindful of language. Disrespectful or degrading language shouldn’t be tolerated in public spaces. If you see it, call it out. 

 • Given the historical exploitation of African people by western cultures, consider how it sounds when a company touts its “expansion” into Africa and “bringing 5 million people on board” as a “testing ground for new technology”. Consider the benefits reaped by one side and the sacrifices to be made by the other in this process.

• Be grateful. Be kind. Be cognizant. If you are bringing in life-changing gains during this time, consider donating some of your profits to charity, or setting up an entire foundation, or helping a struggling family in your neighborhood.

Progress moves by leaps and bounds interspersed with prolonged periods of idleness. The whole world is experiencing profound tumult and upheaval. Those of us with the resources, time, and bandwidth to capitalize on the impetus of the moment should realize that the vast majority of humanity is struggling now and sinking deeper into a pit of poverty. It is the ethical duty of all humans to uplift our neighbors and create a culture of inclusivity and acceptance.

What else can we do to promote a better world? How else can we create positive cultural movements both IRL and in these online communities? What ethical obligations come with newfound wealth? How can we diversify our community, encourage positivity, and hold each other accountable? How can we change the language we use to promote rational thinking and moral behavior in the years to come?

Im rather new to crypto in general and i apologize if this has been answered elsewhere... but i need answers! Its been tough to sift through the crap on google these days, especially being in Canada.

I live in Canada 🇨🇦 and have been frustrated with fees associated with transferring crypto from one place to another... so, whats the cheapest way to purchase BTC and send it directly to a hardware wallet while incurring the least amount of txn fees possible?

Ive used CEX's like coinbase, binance, crypto.com and all of them charge pretty sizable chunks of the BTC purchase. And I'd rather not leave the BTC on the CEX... I've found Newton to be the cheapest method so far, but wonder if there's a better way?

Governments have also adopted and recognized the importance of BTC and also recognize that governments are incompetent, twith these measures they lost power and today as well as one of the characteristics of BTC, there are no governments, only decentralization, works also for the exchanges of consumer goods for society, what they call peer to peer, I call mutual exchange of trust. Many families were saved on account BTC, many poor families who did not have many hopes of a glorious future, who found that by chance, their deceased relatives had a coldwallet with some satoshis (say that some became millionaire in satoshis). Here in the year 2070 everything is prosperous and we live a full life, where the ideas and ideals followers of Bitcoin built with the ideas of a Satoshi Nakamoto (my parents said he was very important, was a superhero for all of them) must be why we have a statue diamond of him in the center of the Capital Nakamoto Center. 

And by the way, I'm not going to say my name because my parents forbid me to talk to strangers, I just traveled on a time machine built by my grandfather to try to find Satoshi Nakamoto and take a look at him a very tight hug and thanks him for the world he left for me and my friends, but I couldn't. It seems to me he also has a time machine, or he guessed I'd come and escaped. Who knows?

Or what are you using if neither?","I've been using Ledger live for several years now, but it lacks a lot of functionality when it comes to Bitcoin since it tries to appeal to many other tokens. I wanted to get a better understanding of how Bitcoin transactions work and what all is possible.
This has led me to these two desktop wallets [Sparrow wallet](https://www.sparrowwallet.com/) and [Specter wallet](https://specter.solutions/). 


## Both these wallets support

- Creation and signing of Multi-Sig wallets
- Batch transactions
-  UTXO selection
- New wallet address without needing hardware wallet to generate
- Labeling transactions
- Able to connect to personal node
- Detailed overview of transactions
- Price feed
- export transaction history

## Specter features 

- Browser based
- Check bitcoin supply, and the percentage you own
- Bitcoin whitepaper
- Transaction history only

## Sparrow features

- Native application. 
- Fee estimator
- Graph of your sats balance history
- Transaction and balance history
- Electrum server support
- Detailed transaction information
- Notification of incoming transaction

Both wallets have nice UIs and are very user friendly. I've only started using sparrow recently, but it's really starting to grow on me. What I really like about the way it's implemented is that there's a lot of detailed information available **if** you want to see it. And the balance history is very nice to have for auditing purposes.

What do you guys think about these two? In case you haven't yet, I'd recommend trying out both wallets for yourself and decide which works for you.",1616884966,13,1

TL:dr The banking system evolved uncontrollably since WWII and it’s broken now with no easy answers. Also, there’s no inflation at all any time soon, so all of bitcoin’s growth is organic at this point. 

I was a finance major and I have been into stocks etc for two decades. Finding this material and going through it multiple times has completely changed my understanding of the entire world. Strongly suggest you find the time to do it. And spread the word. A lot of bitcoiners out there just screaming inflation and pointing to an outdated M2 chart as a reason that bitcoin will go up.

lxdczt,amsync,Single biggest thing any true btc whale could do for the future of bitcoin?,"We're all waiting and wondering what future application/adoption of Bitcoin will really cement it as a global store of value. Governments right now can still tax and regulate it to make it really hard if you still rely on the fiat system for your daily needs, so the single biggest thing that would propel BTC to really squash or at least dent those risks would be for the system to be adopted in a serious way in monetary policy somewhere. If a national bank of a real nation with real people were to adopt it and tie its currency at least partially to Bitcoin then other governments and institutions that are key trading partners with that nation would not really be able to avoid also thinking of partially adopting Bitcoin to avoid imbalance, and so on so forth. This of course is both the chicken and the egg.

There needs to be a spark. An incentive for a government to even want to think of such an (experiment/investment) with their monetary system. It could be that COVID and the crazy debasing of fiats all over the world ultimately force this question, but I wouldn't underestimate the system's ability to survive in creative ways. Is it really going to matter for e.g. the US FED to spend a relatively very small amount buying some BTC down the road (they seem to be buying everything anyway). It might be good for the value, but its not going to propel it into a reserve currency. So this got me thinking, with the crazy concentration of BTC ownership this actually could be a real opportunity. What if, Satoshi if he is alive, were to offer a small but stable nation (say Denmark) 99% of his BTC in exchange for their central bank agreement to peg their currency (at least partially) to Bitcoin. Essentially making BTC the national currency. It would instantly change Bitcoin forever. Any true Whale or group of Whales could do this, at least if the value keeps going up. The funny thing is if they all say commit 50% of their holdings to this they'd probably recover the value of that ""donation"" almost instantly because of the spike in value that will come along with such a move.

In the example of Denmark, its a small enough nation that 1.1 million bitcoins represents a significant portion of both their GPD and M2. There's probably not going to be a lot of incentive for said nation to even consider this now, but the way things are going, at some point maybe soon there might be. Just a thought...

lxc9ba,SpawnMagic,How is bitcoin going to be made fungible? I get that some coins can have their history obfuscated,"You can, in the future do coinswaps and coinjoins and whatever but this only obfuscates the history of those coins: other coins have still have a socially meaningful history that can be discriminated against, and of course coinjoin coins that where done so in a way that anonymizes them are treated differently: coinswap simply seems to trade histories of coins, which upon investigation the other party would likely reveal the other associated coins so they aren't bothered by investigations, LE, etc 


It seems like the default is always going to be easier, quicker, and cheaper as it doesn't involve interactive transactions, multiple transactions, etc 


So most coins will have an unobfuscated history while the other group of conjoined ones will and currently are treated differently. 


How will it be made so that bitcoin is fungible? Where I can't be treated differently because of the coins which have a unique history?

I am not understanding how coinjoin, LN, coinswap, or a mixture of those actions solve this to have all bitcoins fungible and equal one another? 

Hard to get answers to this. People seem to always miss the point about fungible and assume I am asking how to obfuscate the history of just my coins. I'm thinking for bitcoin to become a good money / currency it will need to be fungible but I can't ever get a straight answer on how *all* coins will have an equally meaningless history?

I decided I shouldn't be investing in something I don't know about, especially while I was paying for an education.

Less than a year later, I started my first job after graduation which had an open office format. I distinctly remember a coworker saying Bitcoin was a good investment and we would regret not buying in. The response was pretty brutal as everyone was laughing at him and saying it would die out. It finally sparked me to do my own research and I hopped on board this wild ride. That week I put in $1000 which isn't a lot for some of you, but as a recent college graduate it was a big deal. Ever since then I have been trying to reach the milestone of accumulating 1 BTC and I'm almost halfway there!

I lost about $12K trading options. I could've easily bought about 3 full bitcoins leaving me with about $150K at the time of this post.

I'm saying this to all you new guys that are starting to get into trading. Holding an investment long term has a way higher success rate than trading an asset. If you really feel ballsy then buy and hold a risky investment but don't trade it because time is on your side. Time is probably the most important thing you need when it comes to investing and you give that up when trading. 

**TLDR; The lesson I learned is that when you have a considerable amount of money you have to protect it. Its when you have nothing to lose that you should be taking a lot of risk. If you have a good amount of money saved, at least 5 figures, you should really start focusing on preserving it rather than maximizing your returns.**",1614827106,36,13

I made a payment this morning to a e-wallet so I get my account credited. The site I usually use to see sat/byte to pay is apparently not updating and I sent my transaction by paying 20 satoshi per byte. The transaction still unconfirmed.

If I use Replace by Fee with Electrum. Does it create a brand new transaction ID? I fear that if I use the feature the merchant system won't see my deposit even if it used the same input/output. I would have to contact them and send proof, I was the sender. Exhaustive thing to do...

One last question, say I decide to leave the fees this low and the transaction don't get confirmed in the next say 3 weeks. Does the transaction ever get cancelled from the mempool and the coin return to my wallet?

Thanks!",1614824405,6,2

lxn43r,Haath_,Quick question regarding fees,"Hello, I have a quick question regarding how fees work. The fee when I'm trying to send bitcoin, is determined by the ""size"" of the transaction, right? So if I understand correctly, if my wallet has received multiple smaller payments, then the fee will be higher than if I have received one big payment, correct?

&amp;#x200B;

So assuming that I've understood right, and please correct me if I haven't, would the following be possible?

* Need to pay for something in bitcoin, but payment link expires after let's say 2-3 hours.
* Fees are currently way too big to send a payment that will be confirmed in 2-3 hours for sure.
* My wallet balance came from hundreds of small transactions.
* I send my entire balance to myself with the minimum fee of 1-2 sat/b. It may take days to confirm but I don't mind.
* Now my balance comes from a simple block, so when I try to make the above payment, my fees should be significantly smaller.

Is my reasoning correct here?

lxn091,ramzataztaz,Exit strategy,"If you're planning on taking profits for other *investments* or to pay some bills you should really have an exit strategy in mind. I'll start with a few pointers to help and then get into some strategies from simple to complex to gut wrenching. 

**Use multiple exchanges**,  have atleast 4 or 5 different exchanges that you use, exchanges have a bad habit of being down at crucial times. 

**Make a plan** write it down and stick to it. Base this off your personal objectives and not the current price of Bitcoin. 

**Leave some behind** don't ever sell all of your Bitcoin unless you really, really have to.

**Scale out** you'll likely get crushed trying to time it perfectly, just sell in bits (pun intended). 

**Always buy back** until volatility subsides, which may take decades, compounding so that you end up with more Bitcoin, is the smartest thing to do. 


**Strategy 1** Take out a set amount of money at each doubling that's small enough to not reduce your Bitcoin too much but significant to your personal life, this way you are selling less Bitcoin each time it doubles and if it re enters another bear market, you can a) buy more b) HODL. 

**Strategy 2** Set price targets and sell a pre defined percentage of your Bitcoin. E.g. BTC @ 100k sell 10% - &gt; BTC @ 150K sell 20%. and so on. 

**Strategy 3** Set *one* high price target and sell in tranches, depending on how fast/slow the price moves into your target you can sell in 3 to 5 tranches. The slower the move the more tranches to use, this will increase your chances of selling higher and higher. 

**Strategy 4** Get a read on sentiment and sell into the maximum Euphoria phase, again you will need to use tranches here. There will be an uptick of exchanges going down due to increased traffic around this time, similar to what was seen a couple months ago but with more frequency and across more exchages. Their will also likely be a huge increase in positive news relative to negative news. 

**Strategy 5** Learn topping signals from on chain data and use technical analysis in conjunction with no. 6, again using tranches. Look for an increase in old wallets, large pools and whales selling. Also some good info at lookintobitcoin.com there are other sites as well. 

**Strategy 6** So you've made it this far, Bitcoin has topped and you still haven't sold any. Let. It. Dump. Let it dump so hard on you that you feel physically sick and then, wait for the bounce. The bounce might take a month or so to play out, sell on the bounce, *don't* find false hope in that bounce, it's *not* going to break up again for atleast another 3 or 4 years based on historical price movement and the halvening cycle.

**Strategy 7** you've fucked it, you missed your price targets, you haven't sold any tranches, the top has come and gone and you found false hope in the bounce. Move your shit to a cold wallet and HODL. Check back again in 3 or 4 years. NEVER EVER CAPITULATE. 

Feel free to share your strategies, or call me a fiat fondler or whatever. Good luck 🤞.

**Abstract.** Safe Proof of Work (SPOW) is a consensus algorithm blockchain that deals with the main drawbacks of the proof of work algorithm, This algorithm greatly solved the biggest security problem of the POW blockchain system, this is %51 attack. The standard POW is open to this attack. If someone wants to attack the POW blockchain, if it covers the cost, successfully hacks the blockchain. But SPOW blockchain offers a system that almost completely prevents attempting this attack. SPOW does this by sprinkling some unknowable and unity power into it.

Hello, I have been developing this algorithm for a while, I have prepared a pdf with detailed simulations, I want you from the forum residents to review this pdf and return. If this algorithm is used, there will no longer be any coins that will be subject to 51 attacks.

[https://github.com/onuratakan/SPOW](https://github.com/onuratakan/SPOW)

If an attacker wants to succeed: he needs to know the random rate below. Read the pdf for more information.

lxlb75,wintry_earth,Encrypting your recovery seed for safe storage.,"I mean SURE it's fun to come up with outlandish ways of storing recovery seeds...sealing them in a pepper in a hammer in a door is hilarious but it's dumb. Likewise hammering letters into a steel bock is a fun project but ultimately more of an art project than it is a viable way to secure your wallet. Why do you want to take something that's fundamentally digital and *easily* backed up and secured and turn it into something physical that can be lost or accidentally discovered? 

The simplest way I've found to store recovery seeds is to encrypt them with standard tools and store the encrypted files wherever you store your regular backups. 

Go download [GPG](https://gnupg.org/) and install it on your machine. In this case machine can be your windows/mac desktop or (a better choice) a raspberry pi dedicated for the purpose. 

Of course the major fear in doing this on a PC that's connected to the internet is that you might have malware that will steal your seeds. It's a valid concern, so this process keeps the seed words exposed as short as possible. Again if you're REALLY worried then you should get a raspbery pi and install linux on it and do this while offline. 

These example commands are being done on a PC. A linux machine will have slightly different commands. 

So to encrypt your seed words you'd do. 
    
    echo ""Put your seed phrases between these quotes"" &gt; out.txt &amp;&amp;  gpg --output encrypted.txt -a --symmetric out.txt &amp;&amp; erase out.txt

You'll be promoted to enter the decryption password twice. 


You'll end up with a file called encrypted.txt that will look like this:
 
    -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----

    jA0EBwMCt7aphKg6233H0mgBWujdCdwqHz7WW5MIATAoDBjxE9rCJnHWYrARSVIj
    tgXG4d9ZFj4FbNJ9EhEnpxILRmItEDARi39DcQxiHhF9fJIRs9hB9ZduWzvss9bU
    PErNAi1wT+gNgLhzJYMHPr2x6IcFlYrS6Q==
    =c95L
    -----END PGP MESSAGE-----

Back that thing up and you're good. Just to show how much I trust the process. Those are my ACTUAL recovery words for a wallet that holds 1 BTC. 

To get the words back you'd just do

    gpg --decrypt encrypted.txt

and give it the password. 

Store your decryption password in your password safe and you're done. 

You can definitely take a deep dive in encryption algorithms and certificates and stuff, but this is a thousand times more secure than tattooing your recovery words on your balls.",1614866913,72,0

Bitcoin has X amount of addresses available.
What % of that number one single seed of 24 words (generated by a hardware wallet) gives access to?

From my understanding, one seed gives access to Y private key+public key pairs (which = one address).
And when you restore your seed, all your funds are getting ""re found"".
So it means that somehow the algorithm cycle through all accessible addresses and queries their fund.

Can a seed accidentally give access to an already used address?

If 1 seed = a LOT of addresses, and a seed restoration cycle through all those addresses fast, I can see overlaps happening...

1. Never discuss your Bitcoin. Especially on Reddit, scammers are goning to text you really fast.

2. Not your keys, not your bitcoin. Don't let your keys stay on your exchangea ans be careful choosing your wallet.

3. Scam. Where's money, there are people and a lot of people play dirty to get your money. Nobody gives you Bitcoin for free(Seriously, no one), nobody gives you Bitcoin undervalued and no one trades 1 Bitcoin for two.

4. Keep that seed safe. Your 12 or 24 words are the door for your bitcoin. Don't lose the key(seed) for that door.

5. Check every transaction. You don't want to type the Bech 32 string wrong.

6. Never invest what you're not willing to lose.

7. Don't listen to anyones opinion. Get all the information,  different point of view and evaluate everything you've heard and conclude your own opinion.

8. Research, Research, Research. Invest in things you understand. Take your time for that and never stop learning something new.

9. ""Peer pressure"". Everybody says ""Hodl"" but that's completely up to you. Don't let different people make the decision for you.",1614812501,22,9

As the money is spent more, the price level rises, until the later recipients suffer a reduction in their real purchasing power.

lx4svz,jsamwg,Due Diligence on Bitcoin,"Hi everyone,

I've been trying to evaluate on my own whether bitcoin is worth buying and holding long term and wanted to present to you some basic findings. This is not financial advice but my own research analysis and I am open to being corrected as I am still new. I see a lot of DD for stocks but not as much here so I am hoping we can also get some more quality content here to share knowledge. I am someone who has bought and sold bitcoin at a loss back in 2017-2018, and then again 2020-2021. Yes, I saw all the ""HODL"" posts, but I was only in it for attempted financial gain. I've only recently spent the time to look into bitcoin and become a believer.

**Supply**: First, Bitcoin has a fixed supply. Right now there are 900 bitcoins mined per day. Every four years the number of Bitcoins produced per block (created every 10 minutes) are cut in half. Currently the mining reward is 6.25 Bitcoin per block. In 2024 it will drop to 3.125 BTC per block. So we are beginning to see something we learned in our high school Economics class called Scarcity.

[https:\/\/institutional.fidelity.com\/app\/literature\/item\/9901337.html?pos=T](https://preview.redd.it/xqveh5ei8vk61.png?width=359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eff083c195e1aa24ede9ce998708f1d2c0f53f83)

**Demand**: Next is demand. It doesn't matter if there's less of a resource no one wants. There is a lot to look at here (i.e. Bitcoin ATM installations increased by +85% in 2020 to 11,798 terminals, outpacing the previous year’s near +50% rise by a significant margin, according to data source Coin ATM Radar). But the big one we are all most excited about is the change in institutional money flowing in. For those that don't know Metcalfe’s Law, it holds that as the number of its users grows linearly, a network’s value (or, by inference, the bitcoin price) grows geometrically. In other words, there is a cascading effect where more and more institutions begin exponentially buying in *worldwide*. Right now 30% of all U.S. buyers are institutions. This is a big deal because institutions have more money than you, and that means if they keep buying, our clock window to buy at our current price is now ticking.

[https:\/\/ir.citi.com\/peFJTnzeEoMSIAEFlwH12VeM5d&amp;#37;2BCckWNrsO9lxpmyWezrz5V&amp;#37;2Bx&amp;#37;2FfRvm0gv6cWRpDHGWtIk7sTME&amp;#37;3D](https://preview.redd.it/wc54qsbk7vk61.png?width=456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b468d4499be43c05390432d4e0bd7a578b79d0b7)

**Indicators**: The first decade was marked by speculation and pushback. And Bitcoin prices reflected that. I know for a lot of us, me included, we want indicators to show that prices will go up. But something I'd like to propose for your consideration also: The maturation of an ecosystem tends to result in fresh consolidation. Because we are still in a stage of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD), this is good news for you - it means we are only now beginning to exit the early adaptor stage. It's not too late to buy. As more and more people have bitcoin, it will begin its slow inevitable march towards mainstream as a dependable store of value. This is why the next chart I want to show you is not just money, but people. More and more people are bitcoin owners. More and more people start talking and googling and investing. Metcalfe’s Law, remember?

**Inflation/Depreciation**: When I was a kid I remember reading a book called ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" where the premise was to put your money in assets that make more money, not less. Putting your money in things that depreciate (i.e. a car) loses you money over time, while things that appreciate (i.e. a house) make more money. A popular Bitcoin valuation chart is called the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) pricing model. Notice how as Bitcoin becomes more scarce due to halving's, it exponentially grows. Next, notice how your hard earned U.S. Dollar has depreciated by 99% the past hundred years to gold, which has been traditionally the ""gold standard"" of storage. Guys, this is seriously starting to look like a no brainer to me.

[https:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/4366155-u-s-dollar-devalues-99-vs-gold-in-100-years-gold-price-crosses-2067](https://preview.redd.it/ycii0zfhgvk61.png?width=1492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1747777ca3f275aa3b1fbb27a4ccbe3f54688fda)

**Regulation**: This something not completely known to any of us. Despite the price volatility, what if the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Securities or Exchange Commission (SEC) tried to in some way limit or outright ban Bitcoin? I take comfort that institutions are adopting and even big retail investors are adding Bitcoin as part of their overall asset portfolio. Regulation is not always bad and can provide us a layer security from a ""Mt. Gox"" happening to us again. There is a stable coin called Tether that is being investigated and other legitimate FUD concerns. But with Coinbase's soon IPO, and large positions on the news from the likes of Tesla, there is more safety and certainty. Do understand that your faith is currently paid to you at a premium. Once all FUD and volatility from Bitcoin is removed, it's skyrocketing price will reflect that.

[In December 2020, the SEC announced they would allow “crypto-focused broker-dealers to operate for five years without fear of an enforcement action provided that they can verify if they have possession and control of customers’ digital asset securities https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/rules\/policy\/2020\/34-90788.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/gfyk4m81mvk61.png?width=644&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a957eec2e5367ad36acf68cd26e6d320f9818477)

**Competition**: Cryptocurrency is not just limited to Bitcoin, there are many ""altcoins."" But analysts have been pointing to Bitcoin as the ""north star"" of all other cryptocurrencies and welcome mainstream adaption of cryptocurrencies as a portfolio diversifier. Bitcoin helps illuminate the financial industry’s path. There are new technologies and advancements being made too for the ""inefficiencies"" of Bitcoin. Efforts to improve Bitcoin’s processing speed are underway such as a new scaling technology called the Lightning Network.

**Conclusion**: Bitcoin has gone mainstream and is considered a legitimate asset class of digital gold by more and more investors. Bitcoin has a proven supply dynamic (S2F) and demand dynamic (Metcalfe’s Law). With banks printing money to infinity, the question for you is:

*With all this information, is bitcoin worth a portion of your portfolio?*

If your answer is ""*yes*"" then Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) of buying and holding bitcoin appears to be a viable investment. I do not think this is an asset class to sell anymore. Notice nowhere in this writeup did I talk about getting rich quick off bitcoin's prices. I'm a firm believer that ""time in the market beats timing the market,"" and so I will be buying and holding because I believe in the future of bitcoin.

lx3kte,feren6,"I found it challenging to communicate in Bitcoin denominations, so I created my own (the Hyperbit).","Hey all,

My friends and I have been talking lately about transferring our focus from talking about prices in fiat (USD) to talking about prices in Bitcoin. It's fascinating to approach day-to-day life from this perspective, and since we believe cryptocurrency to be more stable than USD for a variety of reasons, it's helping us anchor into this financial technology.

But...the challenge we were having was communicating in the traditional BTC denominations that we found online. There was satoshis, centi-bitcoin, milli-bitcoin, deci-bitcoin...but nothing that was easy enough to understand how the dollar was fluctuating in relation to BTC AND communicate about day-to-day things easily. At least I didn't find the denomination of .0001 that we were looking for.

So we're calling it the Hyperbit between us, and I decided to create a website that lists it's conversion so that it'd easy to keep track of on a daily basis (though it's quite easy to convert from the current BTC price). I thought I'd share this experiment with y'all and suggest trying it for a bit, it's fascinating to see how it's shifting the focus from fiat in everyday conversation to cryptocurrency.

Here's the website if you want to take a look, too.

I logged out to reestablish my other  old off-market wallets, which took a couple of days to ferret out. In  the process, I discovered the US split where Binance sent an email to US  users giving them 2 weeks to empty their accounts or have the accounts  locked. I never received this email, and my account has not been locked  (as of last week).

I want to move  my assets out of my non-US non-compliant Binance account and into my  personal wallet. I worry that when I make moves in the account, it may  be flagged and locked, perhaps indefinitely if support is as poor as  reported. I'm open to transferring funds to a BinanceUS account where I  will be compliant once again.

I figure I have 3 options:

1. Log in from my US IP address that matches the last login, fly casual and send with fingers crossed.
2. Log in from a (VPN) Japanese or German IP address that does not match the last login, and send with fingers crossed.
3. ~~Write an anonymous email to support asking how to do it properly.~~ (I cannot find an anonymous contact option...)Log  in from my US IP address, make no transactions, and open a support  ticket asking how to do it properly, with fingers crossed.

Am I overlooking other options?

Is  it an unreasonable fear that Binance will disable the account and funds  will be lost just because it's an old non-compliant American account?

Has anybody else dealt with this situation?

lxsmfw,sqaudwavy,Why BTC?,"I’ve been trying to get my friends and family members into adding some bitcoin to their traditional investments the last couple of months. They seem to have general interests especially given its recent performance and influx of institutions commenting on it but there they still have some questions. Any help answering them and getting some more information would be extremely helpful! 

1.	I don't see how buying a house or lambs without a 3 party is more beneficial? Wire cost $25 and funds are held by an insured escrow party like the title insurance company who verify funds are in place and deeds are proper in form and will take the liability to properly record that interest. For securing payment, okay, but why would a wire or bank check or letter of credit not suffice? Also, if it has evolved from p2p what has it or what will it evolve into? If it's not for p2p then what is the demand that will keep the value pushing higher (limited supply needs demand)? Or demand to keep computing power available? My ultimate question I'm asking is what is the endgame for btc? Year 2040 no more being mined. What does the world look like with btc?

2.	We have escrow services already for legal goods. I don't understand how btc solves this? Can I do chargeback or fraud protection or extended warranty like with credit cards?

3.	Lightning fee is less secure. So for small related transactions seems okay but any charges as cost of transaction buyer has to pay will be frowned upon. Like buyer paying a fee for coffee, not the coffee shop. Imagine if coffee shop asked you pay merchantile fee. That's why seller/stores eat the merchantile fees. Do you think cost of retail goods will be lowered if btc is used? Seems unlikely they will pass that savings on. Also for larger purposes one may want a secure block those fees would higher than current fees e.g. Wire or bank check.
4.	How is store of value achieved if demand is based on p2p? 
5.	https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html

https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_gas_price

6. So many altcoins and central banks from other countries have released or plan to release there own. How does btc stand alone with so many alternatives? How does it maintain an edge?

7. The case for btc for illegal good is easy to make. Used to be cash or works of art would be used but as cash goes down, more and more is needed or need an art appraisal to verify real deal. Billions of value could now fit in your pocket and can be sent from anywhere anonymously. Why would govts allow this type of structure to exist unless 1. they owned it or 2. They taxed it heavily. A hypothetical case to ban would be a 9/11 event funded by btc or cartels using btc for weapons drugs. 

I'm having trouble figuring the user need for btc p2p. Seems like strategy is to just hold it and then at some point swap it for cash other asset (real estate) if that's possible. Who is using it for transactions then? Is the only long term value derived from everyone just holding furthering shorting supply due to little demand?",1614885228,5,4

Don't be fooled by the media; while I agree that some coins are more innovative in how they mine, bitcoin is still the one that's going mainstream and that's what scares the hell out of them.

Why are they so scared? Bitcoin is step one in curbing wealth inequality since it will be a lot more difficult for any institution to manipulate. They won't be able to just turn on the money printer to pump their stocks, meaning that we will no longer see the stock market grow while the consumer price index stays relatively stable (basically what I'm saying is that they put more money in the stock market while the money supply of everyday people stays the same, increasing wealth inequality). 

Back to my main point; bitcoin mining isn't being run off of oil and coal like all of these other companies news agencies don't seem to have a problem with. They're scared for different reasons.

Seems to me like Binance is probably making a bunch of money on fees, Shakepay is breaking even, and Newton is losing money or breaking even. I'm curious why Newton would send withdrawals with so few outputs instead of lumping more transactions to save money.

m0s9f7,blastshielddown,Longtime HODLr's are biased by their past experience,"Michael Saylor raised this thought on a recent episode of [The Bitcoin Standard Podcast](https://the-bitcoin-standard-podcast.castos.com/episodes/34-michael-saylor-on-the-fiat-standard), where he essentially said that people in the Bitcoin industry (and presumably longtime HODLr's) tend to overemphasize the first decade of Bitcoin as an indicator of where it might go next.

He made this statement in response to Dr. Saife Ammous's comment that Saylor jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon well after many of its most difficult years, suggesting that Saylor's conviction to Bitcoin hasn't been tested by any crypto winters... yet.

But Saylor argues that Bitcoin's first decade is irrelevant (starts around 1:31:45):

&gt;I think March \[2020\] is the beginning of the new era. I think that people in the Bitcoin industry, to a certain degree, they're biased by their history and it's a liability for them. I think it's baggage that they should lose... Most people in life, they want to draw on their experience because there's a bias that 'I want to make decisions based on my experience and I want to feel that everything that I experienced was worthwhile, and if I felt pain, I would like for it to have meant something.'  
&gt;  
&gt;So what if I looked at you and I said, 'Saife, nothing that you experienced between 2010 and 2020 was relevant and you could basically flush it all down the toilet and take a clean sheet of paper and start again.' That doesn't feel good. Psychologically it's hard to let go of that.

I thought this was a poignant and challenging idea. Saylor's perspective is that the entire financial landscape has been flipped upside-down since March of 2020, and maybe expecting Bitcoin to repeat itself in this new environment is narrow-minded. Of course, he's only been in the space for a year now, so his experience is limited as well. But it's an interesting take -- that maybe it is a bit foolish to view the current bull-run as just another post-halvening cycle.

In other words: this time is different? ;)",1615243404,4,1

The fact is that speculating is scary and risk is scary. Managing and mitigating risk is necessary but impossible if you don’t feel informed.

I believe the most important factor is conviction.

Conviction means that you have weighed the possible outcomes to the best of your ability and continue to do so. It means that you understand the underlying asset to a degree that you feel comfortable with and continue to educate yourself.

It also means that you’ve listened to opposing arguments with an open mind and have gone with the stronger argument. Constantly challenging your theories and seeking rebuttals to your concerns, then trying to poke holes in those rebuttals.

If you can pass through these blockades, you receive conviction as a reward. Conviction allows you to whether economic downturns and acquire more of the asset during a bear market. Conviction can also protect you from blind speculation.

I think doubt is natural and should lead to productive conversation, let’s challenge our ideas and build conviction together.  

I personally haven’t been convinced that there is a strong bear-case for bitcoin the asset, but I’d hope that if there was, we’d be the first place to tackle those difficult ideas with an open mind and visionary solutions.

I agree with it, I hate that it end up like that.

So, how about we share actually good/informative content on Youtube that deserves more recognition? Here's three channel that I recommend:

* **Andreas M. Antonopoulos**, a legend that has been talking about Bitcoin for years that deserve a lot of recognition. There's also a lot of videos for begginers:  [https://www.youtube.com/user/aantonop](https://www.youtube.com/user/aantonop)
* **Trader University,** found this channel recently, very informative videos about Bitcoin and general finance: [https://www.youtube.com/c/TraderUniversity/](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraderUniversity/)
* **Crypto Daily**, a more meme/entertaining take on Bitcoin/Crypto news: [https://www.youtube.com/c/CryptoDaily/](https://www.youtube.com/c/CryptoDaily/)

I’ve been hearing this argument for years. 5 years ago, people said that eventually, people won’t even be able to own one bitcoin and I had a hard time relating to it. 

Recently, some friends and family wanted to buy bitcoin, and I asked them how much, and they said, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and some 0.01. People can’t afford more. Then it really dawned on me. People won’t be able to get even that amount soon.

If they can’t afford it now, how are they going to afford it in 2-3 years?

As soon as one or two rich people admit to buying it, we’re going to see the price sky rocket. As soon as people like jeff besos, warren buffet, and bill gates (I know he is opposed it now) start buying, the flood gates are going to open. And the middle class wont even be able to afford 0.1 bitcoin. Or even 0.01.

Coinbase sends a 2FA to my cell phone. I don't have that number anymore. I opened the account overseas with an overseas number but used US ID to verify the account. They have an option for if you don't have that number anymore. Great.

I have the old number, and the new number so OK. Moving forward.

Have to verify ID. Go through that whole process of getting the perfect picture of an accepted ID. 

They are verifying my ID. Cool. Then I get this:  
"" 

We couldn't verify your ID  
Be sure to use a valid, government-issued ID. Also, be sure the photos of your ID are unobscured and easy to read.

Your document was valid, but was from a country that didn't match your profile.""

Apparently the account says \[foreign country\] but my ID is US.  Customer support just directs me to the International Support page that basically says ""Sorry there is no support for international accounts""

Their Phone number is for ""account compromise only"" even then most of the automated phone tree says to go to their help page. I did that a couple times and it always just refers me back to the same unhelpful support page.

There appear to be some good advisor/custodians out there, but I am still trying to pick one.  I am particularly hung up on whether to start the LLC for my new SDIRA in my own State (NOT Wyoming) or in Wyoming (because of the Crypto-friendly laws Caitlin Long and others helped encourage, there).

Below is a dialog I sent to a Redditor privately.  I then thought I should post it here to invite general discussion.  I welcome your thoughts and suggestions in re:

""Hello, I found your thread asking about the Cloud Peak Attorneys Wyoming Law Firm ([https://wyomingllcattorney.com/Blog/Wyoming-LLC-for-Bitcoin](https://wyomingllcattorney.com/Blog/Wyoming-LLC-for-Bitcoin)).  I have exchanged emails with then, and their representative could not say...whether they know, or can explain...exactly why it *might* be advantageous to open an LLC for my Self-Directed IRA in Wyoming versus another State.

The Cloud Peak email respondent suggested I buy phone consultation with their senior tax attorney-partner.  I would be glad to, if I had any idea whether that attorney could shed light on this question (this was not explained).  Cloud Peak shows up when I search for ""Wyoming Crypto LLC"" or similar, but I could not tell if they know enough about Crypto laws to advocate for an SDIRA to establish a Wyoming LLC versus an LLC in any other State...

So, although I know that Caitlin Long has helped create a good Crypto legal/business/tax environment in Wyoming, I still cannot tell my accountant why or whether we should ""go to"" Wyoming to establish an LLC (I do not live there).

I have spoken to [iTrustCapital.Com](https://iTrustCapital.Com) about having a ""one-stop, Crypto-only"" (no-LLC, no-Checking account) ""Crypto IRA"" with them.  They seem fine, but I want the ""whole stack,"" including an SDIRA account with a Custodian, then an LLC owned by that SDIRA, then a checking account and (both stock and Crypto) trading accounts in the name of that LLC.

This arrangement custodies both Stock-trading accounts and Crypto-trading accounts beneath one LLC which is owned by you SDIRA.  It sounds complex, but once it is set up, you can pick your own trading exchanges and move or split your SDIRA funds between ""traditional"" stock trading and/or Crypto trading...which is still a bit of a challenge...

I have spoken to George Glower at [https://www.MySolo401k.Net](https://www.MySolo401k.Net), and he seems capable of putting this together, but he wouldn't suggest which U.S. State I should open my new SDIRA LLC ""in.""  He prefers you just tell him, so I am still ""hung up"" on this question.

I am now looking at Matt Sorensen and Mark Kohler at KKOS Law Firm, the ""Directed IRA"" authors, attorneys, and accountants, here:  [https://directedira.com/](https://directedira.com/).  They do a lot of publishing but I have not spoken to them yet (I have also not read their book, which I just bought, titled ""The Self-Directed IRA Handbook"").

I would be happy to exchange ideas with you or anyone about Crypto-IRAs, SDIRAs, Crypto-Tax software(s) and services, etc., if you would like.  May I ask please: did you finish your SDIRA or LLC?  Good luck and thanks for reading this...""",1615232772,5,1

 Even crazier, the growth in the number of users is not observed here, it is observed on the exchanges (most of the new users do not use the blockchain).",1615232637,3,1

m17u84,Adventurous-Station9,Swissborg community app," 

Hello every one ,

Swissborg Community is an Gaming app where you predict the value of bitcoin (for FREE), and earn CHSB tokens via badges by doing certain activities in the game. I've earned 200 Tokens, actually the value is: 300$

My code for the BTC prediction game is 6X3BGZI

We both get 3000 points to play with if you enter my code ;)

You earn CHSB tokens (actually value is 1,5$ for 1 CHSB) for each 'badge' you earn, for example successful bitcoin value predictions or logging in 'X' days.

\-You also earn real money from a prize pool depending on how successful you are.

Really good game, good luck everyone",1615301114,1,1

Now it's time for a recap &amp; update on development + adoption 👇

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade](https://preview.redd.it/oqq4kyhm30m61.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb28be028fff3a67534abd209e8d1e009a8315e1)

**For those not familiar** with the features of Stratum V2 or how it compares to Stratum V1 &amp; BetterHash, we have [an overview](https://braiins.com/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade) for you (check the Compare tab for more). It also includes a Q&amp;A with protocol authors [Matt Corallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jan Capek](https://twitter.com/janbraiins) and [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav).

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/upgrade\/compare-mining-protocols](https://preview.redd.it/lfabnz5z30m61.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0deab79ca092c68515e9c8af5f5492c88c4f1b6)

**DECENTRALIZATION:**

While all of the features are relevant to miners &amp; mining pools, the **aspect of Stratum V2 that most non-miner Bitcoiners care about is Job Negotiation**. This is a sub-protocol that enables miners to construct their own blocks, a task currently only being done by pools.

We recommend the following piece from [Karim Helmy](https://twitter.com/karimhelpme) (R&amp;D at [Coinmetrics](https://twitter.com/coinmetrics)) which includes an explanation of out-of-band payments, a potential economic incentive for miners to adopt Job Negotiation.

&gt;[Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/): ""Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization""

We also have a deeper explanation of how Stratum V2 can impact Bitcoin's decentralization and how the Job Negotiation process works. Approximately 94% of Bitcoin's hashrate currently goes through Chinese mining pools, while some \~65% is physically produced in China during the rainy season. Safe to say, **Bitcoin decentralization isn't perfect. TL;DR: Stratum V2 can help** ⬇️

&gt;""[Bitcoin’s Decentralization with Stratum V2](https://braiins.com/blog/stratum-v2-bitcoin-decentralization)""

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/blog\/stratum-v2-bitcoin-decentralization](https://preview.redd.it/vo0x4d1m50m61.png?width=862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12daa1f9f8dc2f10b861759d8f465a08eb0b442)

**ADOPTION:**

So, what is the state of Stratum V2 adoption today?  Well, it's still very early days. We have an implementation on r/slushpool and in our [Braiins OS+](https://braiins.com/os/plus) firmware, so there are already many miners using V2. However, this doesn't include Job Negotiation yet...

The reason is that **there are changes necessary in Bitcoin Core** in order to make Job Negotiation possible. So there can't be a full implementation of Stratum V2 until those changes are made. Good news: **the development is in progress with a help from Square Crypto!**

[Wohoo!](https://preview.redd.it/ondex2so70m61.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5747c121987bb40adfd5240af5ef4dabc7bdd2c3)

Until then, mining pools will remain the sole entities constructing blocks to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, **miners can still benefit from partial V2 implementations** which improve efficiency, privacy, and security (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack prevention). 

We believe **Stratum V2 will have a significant long-term impact** on the mining industry, particularly as transaction fees account for an increasing proportion of mining revenue. 

We'll be sure to update the community again as the development progresses.",1615298084,133,1

m16g42,FarmerInASuit,Personal gambling story...,"Prior to crypto I would go to a casino three or four times a year where I loved to shoot craps. I was a bad gambler because I walked up to the table each day with a set amount of money knowing that I wouldn’t walk away with a dime. I saw it as entertainment no different than buying a concert ticket. I could get several hours of play out of $200 and when it was done I’d walk away and a good time was had by all. 

Crypto has given me a paradigm shift that “scratches” my gambling “itch” AND I’m building wealth instead of throwing money at a casino and walking away with empty pockets. 

My crypto strategy has evolved to be similar to my craps strategy. Have to keep the bulk of my money in conservative bets (BTC) so I can play longer. Then I set a small chunk aside for high risk/high reward bets (the three altcoins I have). 

Thus far my craps to crypto journey has been one of the best things to happen to me as I approach 40 years on this earth. My life as a farmer is based upon a little physical labor and a lot of speculation. Crypto is no different...a little research and a lot of speculation. 

Every cent I have in crypto I see just like the money I wasted shooting craps...every cent I’ve put into crypto I’m just fine if I never get it back which makes the profits even sweeter! If crypto disappears toMorrow I won’t miss a meal but at the rate we are going I don’t see that happening!!! 

One last anecdotal comment...I’ve always thought Roulette was a stupid game. For some reason I have no remembrance of why but I started a “tradition” with roulette. When I walk into a casino I go straight to the roulette table and put down the table minimum bet , most of the time $5 or $10, on red 15. After losing my $5 or $10 I would start picking a craps table. Now, when I enter my new casino, Coinbase Pro or Crypto.com , I “bet” $5 on a low market cap coin I’ve done minimal research on or saw on Reddit. Then I get on with business setting my weekly order for BTC  and putting my smaller amounts into the three altcoins. BTC and my three altcoins are my portfolio and then the $5 I put into random “moonshot” coins I affectionately refer to as my shitfolio. Between my shitfolio and my portfolio maybe one day I’ll hit it big!",1615296740,13,1

- Executive Order 6102 is an executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States.""
- The stated reason for the order was that hard times had caused ""hoarding"" of gold, stalling economic growth and worsened the depression.
- The main rationale behind the order was actually to remove the constraint on the Federal Reserve preventing it from increasing the money supply during the depression. 
- The circumstances of the case were that a New York attorney named Frederick Barber Campbell had one deposit at Chase National Bank of over 5,000 troy ounces (160 kg) of gold. When Campbell attempted to withdraw the gold, Chase refused, and Campbell sued Chase. A federal prosecutor then indicted Campbell on the following day (September 27, 1933) for failing to surrender his gold.[12] Ultimately, the prosecution of Campbell failed, but the authority of the federal government to seize gold was upheld, and Campbell's gold was confiscated.",1615293714,5,1

Completely redo the plumbing in my 100 year old house, upgraded to PEX

Completely redone the HVAC

Paid off my motorcycle

Paid off my car

Paid off my credit cards

Helped family and friends when they were laid off from the rona

m14sir,SirFuckingLoin,Anyone who owns 21 bitcoins is a millionaire today.,"*An important event has happened in the history of bitcoin. Now the one-millionth part of the Bitcoin supply is worth $ 1 million.*

**Anyone who owns 21 bitcoins, or one millionth of the total supply, is a millionaire today.**

https://preview.redd.it/lwe5w4haqzl61.jpg?width=2300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8f6eb374315493f477bb1014cbaf59107116364

Back in 2017, financial publications announced the emergence of a group of crypto enthusiasts “hunting” for exclusive membership in the “[*21 Million Club*](https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-21-million-club-more-exclusive-by-the-day-2017-12)”. Also over the past years, there have been many forum posts about people who have finally ended up in the exclusive club of owners who own one bitcoin (BTC). The r / Bitcoin subreddit has [a whole topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1q8uv3/owning_1_btc_is_slowly_getting_out_of_reach_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) dedicated to those wishing to accumulate 1 bitcoin.

*Each member of the 21 million club who owns one BTC now owns exactly 0.0000047619% of the total BTC supply*.

Members of another club of crypto millionaires, who managed to collect 21 BTC or 0.0000999999% of the total limited supply of bitcoins, join [the 21-BTC CLUB](https://21-btc.club/). Membership in the club is informal and symbolic. Club members are recommended the best crypto wallets, among which Trezor is in the first place, the best exchanges, they teach how to pay taxes correctly and share the best information resources on the topic.

*Many people ask why Satoshi Nakamoto chose the 21 million Bitcoin emission limit?* There are many versions.

For example, Ph.D. Christian Seberino explained in 2018 that Satoshi most likely chose 21 million in order to “use floating point arithmetic.” You can read more about this [here](https://medium.com/@cseberino/why-21-million-bitcoins-was-a-great-idea-bd2533af0f63).

However, according to e-mail correspondence between Mike Hearn and Nakamoto, the inventor of bitcoin has chosen a limit of 21 million to match the M1 money supply of fiat currencies such as the euro and the US dollar. Back in 2008, when Nakamoto published the White Paper, the M1 money supply was roughly $ 21 trillion. By simple calculations, we get the predicted Bitcoin price of $ 1 million by Satoshi Nakamoto.

“*I wanted to choose something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but not knowing the future, it is very difficult. I ended up choosing something in between”,* Nakamoto said in an email to Hearn.

Summarizing all this information, we can assume that even **owning 0.1 BTC will make any person a dollar millionaire during his lifetime**. Not to mention the fact that having collected 21 bitcoins, a person will automatically enter the 1% of the richest people on the planet.",1615290478,284,1

To give you an example, there is somebody from US who is ready to buy a painting, and I'm trying to work out how to proceed with the transfer of money.

On one side, bitcoin is something I wanted to get in for the last 10 years but I wasn't in a position to do so unfortunately, on the other, I fear that it might be too complicated for people who have never dealt with bitcoin to arrange a payment and thus I will loose buyers.

m1vhk9,KnowingClub,My strategy 80% hold 20% for profit.,"Hi everyone,  
I have a strategy with BTC I would like to share:  
I hold 80% of it bought at  45,191.88$  
I try to get profit with with the 20% left.

I bought this 20% of BTC on Binance a little bit below the ATH on february. Now, I have recovered and sold with minimum profit with the expectations of getting BTC at lower cost.  


Do you think it's a good idea to set a few orders to purchase BTC at lower price. For example:  
My 20% of BTC equals 100$:  
I will set a order to purchase BTC if it dips 5% for 33$  
Another order if it dips 7% for 33$  
Another order if it dips 10% for 33$  
Then, sell all when it hits the next ATH. Getting a 5%, 7% and 10% profit of each.

I'm risking losing the next rally, but if it does healthy corrections like in the previous cycle I would benefit. WHAT DO YOU THINK?",1615375791,8,1

2) Miners will flock to these countries because of profits  
3) Wait for &gt;50% of hash power to establish within these grouped governments.  
4) Pass a law that dictates that only ""authorized"" transactions can be included in blocks, and blocks containing ""unauthorized"" transactions must be ignored.

This time, Norwegian oil billionaire [Kjell Inge Rokke spoke out in favor of bitcoin](https://news.bitcoin.com/norwegian-oil-billionaire-kjell-inge-rokke-btc-worth-millions-dollars-liquid-assets-bitcoin/). His Aker ASA, which controls oil and oilfield services companies, announced on Monday that it has set up a new business, Seetee AS, to harness the potential of cryptocurrency. In his address to shareholders, Rocque said:

“*We will use Bitcoin as our treasury asset and join the community. In Bitcoin, people like us are considered hodlers. "" He further added: “The direction is clear: finance will be destroyed as inevitably as fossil fuels. The question is not if, but when. Bitcoin could be the core of a new monetary architecture. If so, then one bitcoin could be worth millions of dollars*.""

But the funniest thing is not even that billionaires started talking about the inevitability of a financial collapse, now they are joined by a person who can manually arrange a financial collapse. He had already proven this phenomenal ability by causing the collapse of the British pound in September 1992. Meet the new bitcoin enthusiast and hodler - **George (drum roll) SOROS.**

Fund Soros, New York Life and [Morgan Stanley](https://thebitcoinnews.com/morgan-stanley-analyst-true-price-of-bitcoin-could-be-zero/) invested $ 200 million [in the BTC investment company NYDIG](https://news.bitcoin.com/soros-fund-new-york-life-morgan-stanley-investors-200-million-bitcoin-investment-firm/) (New York digital investment group).

NYDIG is part of Stone Ridge Asset Management, which recently filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for one of its open-ended mutual funds for investing in bitcoin. The founder of Stone Ridge, who also founded NYDIG, Ross Stevens, said Soon, you'll just see a wall of money entering Bitcoin.

**Summarize**:

**The financial system will collapse.**  
**Bitcoin will be worth millions of dollars.**  
**We will soon see the wall of money entering Bitcoin.**

m2ej90,gyakya,Don't be an ignuranus like me,"So I know that everyone and their grandfolks have a story about how they missed out on Bitcoin back in the day. Hindsight is 20-20 ,yadda yadda, I know the drill. My story is a little bit different, and mostly I hope to share a good lesson on how to not be an ignoranus.   


The year is right about 2014 give or take. I'm listening to two guys pitching the concept Bitcoin in a fancy auditorium  where startups and other companies present and share ideas. My brain is actively tuning them out, I'm not even  listening because I've already made up my mind that this is some scam. 

Fast forward another year or so, watching a streamer talk about it, as it's now at an all time high of $400. I'm thinking how crazy it is that it gained so much traction and value. Being a computer person got me intrigued but then quickly decide it's too convoluted even for me as an excuse to be lazy. 

Forward another couple of months and I'm looking to buy a graphics card to play Skyrim on release. The seller saying they used to mine Bitcoin with it. The actual concept felt like something I enjoy to do, so I think I joined a mining pool but then just decided it was too noisy and didn't bother doing any setup in the basement, that I'd much rather just use the GPU to play games with. 

The thing that upsets me the most is that I had plenty of opportunity. Yet because of my ignorace and  lazyness I never took the chance to educate myself. This isn't about me ""losing out"", realistically back then I would have probably sold a long time ago.  It is rather the feeling of doing nothing and gaining nothing, having no potential. Imagine I had no money back then and only learned about how it worked, that would still be very useful knowledge I could act on in the future.  
 

So these last few weeks I finally got my self a hardware wallet, learned how the techonology works on a decent level, read about the prospects in terms of investing in BTC as an asset, gained inforation and from different sources, spun up my own electrum personal server, and, yes I actually bought Bitcoin that I plan to HODL to diversify my portfolio (and also because I still believe it's undervalued).  


The moral of the story is to be more open minded. Don't be lazy. Invest (or not) after you've considered the circumstanes. Obviously the question then becomes 'what should be considered important to investigate' but as long as your're curious it shouldn't matter, as long as you come to your own conclusions.",1615425877,9,1
m2ej6f,slvbtc,The traditional banking and monetary system = anxiety. Bitcoin = self-possession and tranquility.,"Having dollars in a bank gives me nothing but anxiety. Will my bank block an ATM withdrawal for no reason? Will my bank block some transaction due to a stupid algorithm fault?  Will my bank card be blocked because its sensitive data was stolen online? Will my bank block a transfer simply because its heading overseas? Will I end up travelling overseas and have my accomodation payment blocked because i lost my phone with my sms 2fa code on it leaving me with no where to sleep? Will my bank pull a Cyprus and ""haircut"" my savings? Will my bank collapse due to another financial crisis? Will the dollars I hold in a bank be inflated to infinity?

There is no real trust in the current system, people just hope that everything keeps working day to day.

With bitcoin I have complete control of my money and the laws of mathematics prevent any form of inflation. I know with certainty that whenever I want to transact I can no matter how much I want to send, when I want to send it, where I want to send it, even its its the middle of the night and im sending it half way around the world.

Bitcoin gives me ultimate peace of mind, something the traditional system of money and banking can never do.",1615425870,4,1

DIY data recovery guide for HODLers,"After seeing a lot of dangerous advice on this sub about DIY ways of recovering Bitcoin, I wanted to write a guide to help other HODLers recover their wallets when their hard drives crash. This guide is mostly oriented towards conventional spinning disks but I have some tips for phones, SSDs, etc. I have been doing data recovery professionally for over 10 years at a firm that shall remain nameless, so I have a great amount of expertise in diagnosing and recovering from various media, operating systems, etc.


**BEFORE CONTINUING TO READ THIS GUIDE OR ATTEMPTING ANY DATA RECOVERY TURN OFF AND DISCONNECT THE DEVICE YOU WISH TO RECOVER DATA FROM. ANY FURTHER USE OF THE DEVICE GREATLY LESSENS THE CHANCE YOUR DATA WILL BE RECOVERABLE!**


**As a general disclaimer**: If you suspect or know your device is failing and you have Bitcoin or other valuable data on it, the safest route is to send your device to a data recovery lab that has the appropriate training and equipment to recover it. **Stop and think about how much your data is worth, or in the case of Bitcoin, how much you hope it will be worth one day. If it's worth paying a $300-$1500 to recover (or will be worth this in the future when you have more money), DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RECOVER IT YOURSELF.** I understand you are freaked out right now that your BTC may be lost forever, but you will make the best decision with a calm mind that takes its time to think through things. You may only get one chance at a successful recovery. Every time you do any attempts at DIY recovery, you lessen the chances that your data will be recoverable. This is especially true if you have a drive that failed directly after being dropped, is making clicking or grinding noises, or had liquid damage of any kind. Even spinning up a drive once for a few seconds that has a damaged head due to a drop can permanently destroy your data by literally scraping it off the platters. All that being said, if it's worth taking the risk, hopefully this guide can help you. I am providing this information without any warranty, if you lose all your data following my instructions, that's your own fault for not taking it to a professional. For many of the links referenced in here, I may have not tested the instructions fully. I have my own way of doing things in the shop which isn't written down and uses much more advanced tools, so for any step which uses external instructions, try to read a few other guides as well to make sure you know what you're doing before you try doing it.


If you do take your device to be recovered professionally, transfer your BTC to a new wallet. Many data recovery providers will be happy to sign NDAs, but it's better to protect yourself by simply emptying the wallet they had access to.

**Step 1: Diagnose your device**


The first step in recovering your data is determining the health of the device. 


* If you accidentally deleted your wallet or formatted your device but your device is in otherwise good health, you have a good chance of being able to recover your data. A professional recovery like this can run as low as $300.

* If your device stopped working (or got significantly less functional) directly after a fall and it is a conventional spinning disk drive, there is a good chance there is damage to the heads, platters, or both. A professional could recover data from this scenario for $600 to over $1,000 depending on the situation. Head swaps are complex enough that they're beyond the scope of this guide. I would suggest [this guide](http://hddsurgery.com/pdfs/samtshbfinal.pdf) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIPZtJyrVPw) which show how head swaps work in general and [this guide](https://www.donordrives.com/blog/matching-guide) for finding appropriate donor drives. Some drives you can find donors for by simply matching some information from the drive label on eBay, others require advanced equipment like a PC-3000. This is because some drives have specific information about them (microjogs etc) which you can't know unless you can access the drive's terminal and firmware. I implore you to send cases like this to a professional. I should add that while many places say you need a clean room if you open a drive, this is not the case. Clean rooms are great if your data is worth thousands of dollars and you can afford the clean room rate, but you can successfully run a drive after opening it without a clean room, some drives will even operate just fine, for hours, with the cover off. If a piece of dust or pollen gets in-between the drive heads and the drive platters (often this space is mere nanometers), it can rip the data off the platters. However, as drives spin they create an air pocket which can prevent such dust from landing on it. There is an element of risk in non-cleanroom recovery, and that risk is real, but it is not nearly as dire as some data recovery companies present it to be. If you don't believe me, take a hard drive you don't care about, open it, re-assemble it, and see if it works. It probably will, though some drives like WD may not because a screw in their case is needed to properly operate the actuator arm. And I wouldn't suggest continuing to use that drive for obvious reasons.

* If your device was damaged by water, you should dry out the device first as much as you can. Tricks like rice are dumb, all they do is prevent air from getting to your device and drying it out. Simply leaving your device out in the open air and time is all you need, though you can speed the process with some gentle heat. If you got your laptop, phone, or other enclosure wet, remove the data storage device from the enclosure itself. By gently cleaning the device with rubbing alcohol (99% or higher suggested) and a q-tip, you can arrest much of the corrosion and speed the drying process. The cost of having a device damaged by water recovered varies greatly depending on the device type, what was damaged, etc. But don't expect to get this recovered for less than $600.

* Do not put your device in the freezer. Doing so creates condensation on the platters which will destroy your data and it leaves you with less room to store leftovers. This technique can work in an extremely limited set of scenarios, but you'd be better off simply placing the drive in front of an air conditioner than subjecting it to a freezer if you happened to be in one of those scenarios. Which I would bet good money you are not.

* Conventional hard drives make all sorts of interesting noises when they fail. If you hear a noise that sounds like grinding or scraping, stop attempting the recovery immediately and inspect the platters and heads, it's likely that you have a crashed head. If you hear clicking, this can be caused by PCB/firmware issues or platter/head damage. Clicking can also be caused by damage to/corruption of the service area of the drive which can be bypassed or repaired with advanced equipment.

* Inspect the PCB board on the outside of the drive by removing it and using a magnifying glass if necessary. If you see any areas that are burned or smell smoky, the PCB likely needs to be replaced. PCB damage is more likely if your device failed directly after a power outage/brownout/power supply failure in your machine. You cannot simply swap a PCB board, you need to transfer the ROM and adaptive information using a tool like a PC-3000 or by de-soldering the ROM chip and re-soldering it to a new board. Many sellers on eBay can do this for you for around $60-$80, Outsource data recovery also [offers this for $60]( https://outsourcedatarecovery.com/repair-services/), I have used them in the past and they are great. If you have contacts that are corroded or dirty, gently clean them with an eraser. Data recovery for drives with damaged PCBs typically runs $400-$800.


**Step 2: Attempt to image the device**


If the device turns on and spins up (even if there is some clicking) but doesn't show up as a drive on your computer, there's a decent chance you can still recover the data using a Linux live CD/USB and ddrescue. Here's [a guide for that](https://www.data-medics.com/forum/how-to-clone-a-hard-drive-with-bad-sectors-using-ddrescue-t133.html). Ddrescue makes an image of the entire drive sector-by-sector and is agnostic to filesystems (meaning it will work on drives from any operating system, SD cards, DVDs, etc). The image will take up the same amount of space as the device you're imaging. So if you are imaging a 500GB drive, the ddrescue image will be 500GB. It's important to make an image FIRST before attempting recovery with any software. Once you make the image, you can work on copies of the image and throw as much software at is as you want as opposed to running the software on the drive and risking losing the data permanently. If you have more than a couple dozen bad sectors, ddrescue can shred your disk in the process of trying to image it. This would likely be due to platter damage or a bad head. If the drive doesn't register in a Linux live CD/ddrescue doesn't work on it (and you've ruled out a PCB swap), you won't be able to recover the data without investing in expensive data recovery hardware or sending it to a pro. Sorry.


If the device you're imaging is an android phone, a [guide like this](https://dfir.science/2017/04/Imaging-Android-with-root-netcat-and-dd.html) can help you make a dd image of the internal memory. 


Side note: There are some cases where imaging may not be the way to go. For example, if you know the file's location (and it wasn't deleted or is still in the MFT), some tools will be able to recover it by only touching the sectors they need to. A drive with platter damage or crashed heads (where the data isn't affected by the crashed head) or failing but sometimes working heads is an example of where such a technique might be valuable. By doing this, you lessen the chance that you'll accidentally destroy your wallet in attempts to image less important parts of the drive.


**Step 3: Run recovery tools on the image to recover your wallet**


Once you have an image of your device, you can now try various software tools to recover data from the image. The easiest thing to do is mount a read-only image in [Windows](https://www.osforensics.com/tools/mount-disk-images.html) or [Linux](https://major.io/2010/12/14/mounting-a-raw-partition-file-made-with-dd-or-dd_rescue-in-linux/) and see if you can use the drive as normal and see your files. If you deleted your wallet or formatted your drive, this will not work.


If you deleted your wallet, you will need to use a file undeletion tool or a file carving tool. When files are deleted, they are not actually deleted, merely the pointers to those files are deleted. It's akin to taking down all the highway signs to New York but leaving the city there. Depending on the filesystem, the pointer may still exist and simply have a ""deleted"" flag next to it. File carving is used when this isn't the case and your data is somewhere in the ""un-used"" portion of the drive. DMDE, R-Studio, and GetDataBack are all great tools to undelete files. 

If you formatted the device your wallet was stored on, you'll need to recover the original formatting or use a file carving tool. Testdisk is a great free tool for search for partitions and filesystems. R-studio, DMDE, and other tools can also do this.

For file carving, you need to know which type of wallet you want to recover as different tools support different wallet formats. Many recovery softwares simply call file carving RAW recovery/deep search. If file carving doesn't find your wallet, but you know some keys, addresses, or notes you kept in your wallet, you can manually search the entire drive with a hex editor that supports large files. [Photorec](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec)  is a free file carving tool which can recover wallets. There are also [specialized tools](https://Bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25091.0) for this purpose.


**Step 4: You recovered your wallet but don't know the password**

The guy behind [walletrecoveryservices.com](http://www.walletrecoveryservices.com) can crack your password in some instances. He has done some amazing work for people on this sub and is one of the few people who offers this service.


**Step 5: Importing your wallet and setting up a backup system**


Backup your existing wallet(s) and try importing the one you recovered. If it fails to import, you may need to extract the private keys from it and import those manually as the wallet could be corrupted. File carving is likely to produce corrupted wallets.


Once you have imported your wallet successfully, setup a backup system so this never happens to you again!

I'm not yet 18 years old in 2009, working my first job and making my first real money. 

I've always been a bit of a PC nerd, built my first computer with my dad when I was about 5 years old. But my big passion was music, my dream was to become a rock star. Oh, how young and naive I was back then. So I worked at my dead-end job and earned some money because my parents told me I had to work and not be a full-time musician. 

Back to the topic at hand, there I was in August 2009 after a jam session in a bar back in my 1 bedroom cabin, turned on my computer and went hunting for interesting stuff. I was on many message boards and formu. That early morning in August, I came across this article written by a moderator with the title: The Future of Money is Bitcoin. 

Immediately I was intrigued by this topic of a decentralized currency based on a network of users. At the time, I compared it to Torrent with the Seedings scheme network that can be used for payment purposes. Yeah, how stupid I was back then, but man, I could play guitar ;).

Fast forward 2 months to October 2009, I was visiting my parents and I started talking to my dad about this new technology Blockchain &amp; Bitcoin. In short, at that time my father was working as an IT professional in the field of server solutions and encryption. So for me a place to go for information about technology and its implications.

I talked to my father and showed him everything I could find and understand about blockchain and bitcoin. i told him we should invest some money or think about the minig.  After a long discussion my father told me that it is nothing serious and it is surely a scam in mining it is a trojan/worm/botnet scheme. 

Since my father was always right about IT and I was still young and naive, I believed him. The one time I shouldn't listen to my father, but many other times when I really should, I didn't.

Another side note: I am not angry, nor do I blame my father for advising me not to get into Bitcoin at the time. I am just reflectin the decision process.

So what could have happend if then my father would have not warned me not to get involved or even supported me ?

Quick calculation: I had bought a new electric guitar 2 months later for 3000,00 $. 

Bitcoin price in 2009/2010 = say 0.10$. 

3000$ invested in bitcoin= 3000: 0.10 = 30'000 bitcoin

Value of 30'000 bitcoin in 2021 = 1'500'000'000 $.  

FML....

But that's not all, my father who is an IT expert could have easy built a mining server with me in 2009 for $3000.

I mean at my parents the house eas always full of PC parts  incl. server grade stuff.

Let's say we would have been actively mining until it became too demanding. say for 2 years. 

Average 200 per day for 600 days = 200'000 bitcoins.

200'000 x 50'000$ = 6'000'000'000$ 

Just remember: It only takes one night of making the wrong decision and you're not a billionaire ;)

Since then, I never really got back into crypto. Because I always have to think back to that moment, why I only made that decision.

By the way i got never to be a rockstar, now stuck in an office job. Still got that guita, now its my billion dollar guitar ;)

How rich would you be if you then bought a Bitcoins instead of a TV, cars or other consumer goods in 2009/2010 ?

m335v6,PresidentAlmaCoin,Legal Bitcoin Capital Gain Strategy for HODLers? I think so,"Here's the case,

Say you expect Bitcoin to continue to go up throughout 2021 until 2022. A good strategy is selling your Bitcoin on Dec 31, 2021 by 11:59pm, then buying all the Bitcoin back (hopefully at the same price) at 12:00am on Jan 1, 2022.

This way, you successfully spilt your capital gain tax between 2 years, which should result you from paying less tax, then if you dispose everything all together in 2022 and pay the full capital gain tax in one year. Works even better if you anticipate that your income for 2022 will be higher than 2021.

Any flaws to this logic?

Of course, you may have to suffer a less than 1% trading fee for doing this, also the risk that you may have to buy it back at slightly higher price than which you sold for, but the downside should be mitigated. Also, perhaps the biggest risk is that after you trigger the capital gain tax in 2021 and purchased the Bitcoin back, Bitcoin starts to go down in 2022, and you paid capital gain taxes for nothing, but if you are a HODLer, that shouldn't be too much of a problem. What do you guys think?

FYI, in both US and Canada, to do exactly as I described to trigger a capital loss event is forbidden, under the name of ""wash trading"" in the US, and ""superficial loss"" in Canada. But I see no reason for disallowing the trigger of a capital gain event, which you have to pay more taxes for (at an earlier time).",1615503539,13,1
m334w3,bibi_bianchi,Serious question about the uniqueness of BTC,"I understand bitcoin has the largest market capital compared to the other cryptocurrencies and has proven itself to lack vulnerabilities and technical flaws. In addition there is momentum to its adoption and usage for decentralized finances and other new finacial services. 

Could the value of bitcoin and it's market capital  be reduced by a proliferation of other protocols? Governments can print more money inflating prices, so is this similar to more altcoins being created in the long term? Similarly, gold has a finite supply like bitcoin, but there are a finite number of naturally occurring elements. What prevents more protocols from diluting the value of one asset type?

m3lby3,picklejuice2391,How I possibly lost my crypto forever,"I’m typing this out for those who are in the crypto space or thinking about it. This is a true story and I would advise everyone to take note and don’t mess up like myself. 

In 2017 I learned so much about crypto from the homie so I did my due diligence and went ahead and bought some via coinbase shortly after. In total I’ve probably put in 1500-2500 into it with money that I didn’t miss in case it went bust. I bought in when btc was at its highest at the time. I think it was 6-7k per coin. So I tried my hand at trading but it was too much work as I wanted something more passive. So when the Bread wallet ICO dropped I took in some of those coins and eventually moved my crypto from binance and coinbase to my Bread wallet. They give you 12 words that you type in case you need to recover the wallet so I type those in my phone and let my crypto bubble. Now I will add that I had an iPhone 7 with thumbprint ID and that is how I opened my wallets.

To the people that decided to hodl in 2018 there was a blood bath. My wallet lost a ton a value so I decided to focus my crypto into 4-5 coins and bought a ton of Cardano and Stellar lumen. I copped over 1000 of each. Over the last 6 months I’ve noticed ADA is getting more popular and starting to rise so my portfolio is looking nice again. In December I decided to get the exodus wallet because it supported the ADA coin as Binance said they wouldn’t service the US anymore. They gave me a 12 phrase key as well and I put those in my phone. 

Now fast fwd to last week, I try to unlock my phone but my thumbprint won’t work because it had been too long since I checked it. (It was overnight) I go to type in my 6 digit iPhone password just to open my phone and it says it’s wrong. Confused I keep trying and I keep getting denied. I’m not too worried at that point but eventually I disable my iPhone by trying the password too many times. Fuck it this is an iPhone 7 I’ll go ahead and upgrade to a newer joint. I get the 11 and I setup my cloud and start getting my apps back from my previous phone. I download both the bread and exodus wallets and it’s time to put in the 12 phrase key. Now this is where I fucked up initially. So my iPhone users know about the Notes app and that is where I typed out my 2 12 key phrases to access my wallets. The fucked up part is I locked the note with my passwords with my thumbprint and the new iPhones no longer have the thumbprint. It’s asking me for my password to type out but I don’t ever remember typing in a password. I’ve tried all week to remember the password and it’s not coming to me at all. 

There is a silver lining tho so the BRD wallet I opened back in 2017 I wrote those keys on a piece of paper and found it. That wallet was worth more than the Exodus wallet. But the exodus has all of my cardano and if that ever goes to $100 a coin then I’d be sick but I got something back. If you’ve read this far I appreciate it. So to the rookies if you get a digital wallet then make sure you write your keys down and put them in your phone. Leave yourself multiple ways to recover if possible! Now I need to cop some ADA while it’s still low and start over.",1615566924,17,1

m3l3pg,Wazlit,How does Bitcoin go from being an speculative asset to an everyday currency?,"I should preface this by saying that I am not a ""muh tulip bubble"" person, but am instead concerned about Bitcoin's long term prospect as a real decentralized currency, which I think is the end goal.

**The Issue:**

At the moment, most people (especially those in real finance companies) trade bitcoin like a stock or commodity. They buy some if they think it is going to go up, they sell if they think it is going to go down, and they hold if they think the value is going to gradually increase. 

This means that Bitcoin is by nature very volatile, hell even this month, it had a high-low difference of 10,000 dollars. I realize this is somewhat due to the lack of a centralized financial authority (the reason it is good), but I think it poses a problem:

Who would keep all of their spending money in something that is super variable, even if you think it will increase over time? If the value of the dollar could decrease 20% overnight, people probably wouldn't have their entire bank account in dollars. Even though Bitcoin is a good investment, it still carries a certain amount of risk, and feels closer to a stock that can be traded to buy stuff instead of an true currency.

In fact, we still judge the value of Bitcoin in relation to dollars, making it secondary to another currency. Nobody maps the value of the US dollar in relation to Pesos.

**How does it get there:**

Currencies tend to relatively stable in value and widely used. This means they are unlikely to vastly spike up and down, and it is hard for any individual to effect the value of currency because it is so widely used.

My hope is that as Bitcoin becomes a more widely accepted method of payment, and the number of people using it increase, these problems will be resolved. The currency will hopefully find a true stable value because it is more reliant on use than speculative trading, and the whales that currently control like 40% of it will have less influence on the price since more people use it.

I'm curious if anyone else has thoughts on this problem.",1615566284,12,1

Following some of the strategies I know about:

- Buy a large amount whenever there is a major dip (for example everytime the price drops by 25% you buy 0.1 BTC or whatever)
- DCA monthly, weekly etc. so with every paycheck you buy BTC for a certain amount of money.
- Using bots for DCA. There are bots that can be used to buy dips for example you allocate 10000$ and they buy every so and so dip for 30 days.
- Simply one time buy in and hofl for years (That's not a strategy for me but still)
- Sell BTC at highs, wait for dip and buy in with the same money but getting more BTC

Recently I've been talking to family members about investing in Bitcoin and I realize they have no business ever holding their own keys.

Yet, also daily I see comments advising not to use Paypal/CashApp/RobinHood or Coinbase to hold Bitcoin.

m3jzz2,3mD3v,[GUIDE] How to decrease transaction fees on exchanges.,"# Context

I have used many applications/exchanges like Exodus, Atomic Wallet, Binance, NiceHash... All of them have the characteristic that you can have different wallets in the same account or with the same same seed. 

As soon as I exchanged some cryptos I noticed that my cryptos are gone on fees. Then I tried to find the best way to fix this issue without giving up the fact that I want to have all my different wallets in the same account, seed or device. This is what I found:

# Guide

This will sound tricky but to decrease the fees you need to buy a **Trezor** hardware wallet. Remember that buying a wallet is a 1 time expense and exchange fees are constant expenses when you want to exchange (besides all the other advantages of having a hardware wallet). 

Once you have the wallet and you're logged in the Suite ([https://suite.trezor.io/](https://suite.trezor.io/)), you can go to your crypto and Trade and then Exchange:

[ In the photo you can observe that I want to exchange 0.1 BTC to a crypto from the list \(there are +100 cryptos listed\) you can even define your exchange fees for the BTC when you send them. ](https://preview.redd.it/u5jak6ox5mm61.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e745926c80bd79280611b8e8f066cb4996568c3)

After selecting the coin (in this case BTC to BCH) you have the list of Providers that offer this exchange ordered by price:

# Example (Exchange BCH for StorJ)

Exodus wallet I changed 1BCH for 593.11804867 STORJ.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0x740fba96f64ac791440553c0ec712d45d5884a83567264cb6f7f65603807c16b](https://preview.redd.it/a9eqszb16mm61.png?width=1770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4c56bcd557f9cf6568572924c00aa021798dfc0)

Using the cheapest exchange listed in Trezor suite I have exchanged  **0.9999544** BCH for  649.2155106 STORJ.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0xc20371d434db4062083c4568597f183847915d570d3209cf0fcdea287829a2a8 ](https://preview.redd.it/2kgj6kx16mm61.png?width=1854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35fd986e28fc21ab1c6aa3108b375fc0f364d7db)

If we round the numbers we can find that in Trezor wallet I paid 1BCH for +56 StroJ then in Exodus.

Allow me to guess, no you don't and if you had the choice, you never would. You would use a clothes dryer and happily pay for the electricity. Why? Because using electricity (energy in general) allow you to live bigger and better versions of your life. If you didn't you would be spending all of your time drying clothes, it would be awful if you knew there was a better way. The same is true for bitcoin, using more and more electricity will allow humanity to do bigger and better things.

The real question is how to harness and use that electricity in a way that doesn't cause unnecessary harm to ourselves and others. Guess what, bitcoin can help with that too. If we can get mining to lower the cost of renewables that would be a huge win. Or we can put a clear profit motive to building nuclear (which we should anyways) which would help the movement in general. Imagine if we figure out sustainable nuclear fusion (like the sun) because some crazy bitcoiner wants to mine the last million bitcoin for himself. This to me sounds way more plausible than some bureaucrat trying to justify that taxpayer money try to do it.

Our standard of living only increases when we have more and more access to energy. If you don't want to consume any of this, then go live in the woods!

m3jmjx,le_stupid_french,"Tired of the stupidity behind the ""Bitcoin is inefficient"" argument","I am getting really tired of hearing the argument that Bitcoin uses lots of energy and is highly inefficient. Those who use it show a clear lack of understanding of how Bitcoin works, but maybe most importantly, they fail to propose a superior alternative that fixes that problem.

I am writing these 2 arguments for me and anyone else that would want to push back on this stupid inefficiency argument.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Bitcoin is a decentralized ledger with strictly enforced rules built upon battled-tested cryptographic algorithms like ECDSA and SHA256.   
Participating in this decentralized ledger requires finding a piece of information, nonce, so that the SHA256 of such information is below a certain threshold.  This is the job of the miners.  
It is up to the participants to decide how to find that piece of information. You can use a pen and paper, a pocket calculator, a fortune teller, or an ASIC powered by your own Uranium-235 plant.   
The Bitcoin network doesn't say anything on how to find these nonces; that is up to the miners. These miners found that ASICs powered by industrial electricity seem to work nicely. They purchase these ASICs, pay for the electricity they use, and run an open-source code in them. How can the government have a say in the kind of software and the scale at which I run it in my own private property as long as I am paying the bill?
2. If you are going to criticize Bitcoin, you have to propose an alternative, and ideally, a better alternative.  
Mrs. Janet Yellet called Bitcoin an ""extremely inefficient way of conducting monetary transactions"" just a few days ago. The immediate question that comes to mind is, what should I use instead then?  
I guess her answer would be the USD, coincidentally and of course exempt of any conflict of interest; that's the shitcoin she helps to govern.   
The problem is that I, nor millions of others, want to use the USD. Time and again, governments of the world have lied and manipulated their currencies.   
The US being no exception. In 1933 the US government forbade the ""hoarding"" of gold - Order 6102 mandated US citizens to sell their gold to the Fed at a price the Fed itself set or face a 10-year prison term. More recently, in 1971, our great government temporarily suspended the convertibility of gold. Temporarily, in this context, means that 50 years later, we still cannot convert our dollars to gold.  
She fails to recognize that Bitcoin is a far superior alternative to the USD because of the systematic institutional betrayal. Said shitcoin can be printed at will, and ad-infinitum, rendering your hard-earned savings useless. For these reasons, people are moving to Bitcoin, choosing to trust cryptographic algorithms, not the government.

m3jj63,Le0nZockt,Import BitGo / Bitwala Multisign 2 of 3 Wallet into any Wallet Applikation / Calculate zpub from 2 xpriv and one xpub - win 50 € when you find a solution.,"Hello, I have a problem that has been bothering me for a long time, and i didn't find a solution yet after days of googleling. So I hope anyone here can help me. 

Bitwala is an Crypto exchange who gives you a 2 of 3 Multisign Bitcoin Wallet provided by BitGo

&amp;#x200B;

When you create the wallet you get 2 x 12 words and an Extended Public Key in the form of an XPUB key that they call: wallet reference key. So you only get the xpub  but only uses Bech32 Native SegWit addresses that begins with  ""bc1"".

I use the Blue Wallet app on IOS to track all my Bitcoin wallets with the Extended Public Keys. So i also want to track my Bitwala/BitGo wallet to have all in one place but i only have this  xpub and no zpub. There are several tools on the internet that convert an xpub to a zpub but i didn't see any balance. I testet this tools with a normal xpub from my Trezor and i get another zpub (wich shows no balance too) than i get from my Trezor Bech32 wallet directly so i think this converters dosen't work.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many people who want to add the Bitwala wallet to Electrum to set completely custom fees and so on. But nobody managed to import the wallet and see the right addresses that you also see in the Bitwala app. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing you can do to get hands on your funds is to use the BitGo Recovery tool wich sends all the Bitcoin to another address that you choose. (Here is the Bitwala tutorial for this: [How to recover my Bitcoin wallet? – Bitwala Support Centre](https://support.bitwala.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000988999-How-to-recover-my-Bitcoin-wallet-))

The biggest thing is that BitGo is **OpenSource** so theoretically with Programming Skills (and i think here are some people who can manage this) someone can manage to get the zpub respectively the method that they use to get the balance from your Wallet with only the 2 x 12 words and the xpub. (Here their [GitHub - BitGo/wallet-recovery-wizard: Electron-based home for all BitGo recovery tools ⛓️🔮](https://github.com/BitGo/wallet-recovery-wizard)) I think with the right zpub the import into Electrum is no problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing i want to question is: isn't it it possible as calculate the zpub from the two private keys ? Or from the two private keys plus the xpub? Or that the key can be obtained from the transcationHex that you generate with the recovery tool ?

**There must be a way to get the right zpub key**. And me and many other people would be very happy about that. 

***I would even go as far as to send 50 € in bitcoin to those who manage to find the right zpub.***

I feel no one can intimidate me anymore and I feel I see through the ""invisible death traps"" of our society, where people would go to work, pay their taxes, spend their fiat money and save their fiat money waiting for it to depreciate to nothing. I am beyond that now.

When I talk about finance now, I speak in such a confident manner that people would actually listen. This is a total game changer. I am talking about that ""good feeling"" even money cant buy .

m3ih09,Jethroe1,LEDGER NANO X REVIEW,"Just received the Nano X, and wanted to share some thoughts as a community service to those on the fence about a wallet.

First off, it took two weeks to arrive due to heavy demand.  I have kept BTC on a exchange, but like many others, it had gotten to a price where I wanted to have the private key to myself, and possession of my Bitcoin.  The Nano X cost $119.

One of the best things about the NANO X happens all before you buy it.  It is very popular, so you can watch endless videos on Youtube about it, and the set up.  By the time you receive it, you already have numerous primers available, including one I found that applied to moving it from my particular exchange directly to the wallet... step by step.

But, quite frankly, you don't really need it.  Ledger on site has some great intro material and videos to get you up to speed.  And, Ledger Live is the application to download that interfaces with the wallet.  It is available for mobile or laptop.  I think Ledger Live is the company's greatest asset, and what makes the Nano X so easy to set up and work with.  The actual initialization of the wallet all takes place in conjunction with Ledger Live while the wallet is connected to your laptop or phone, and it is a snap.  I was up and running in minutes.  The only thing I took time with is recording the seed phrase, and then confirming it on the wallet.  The wallet comes with several blank cards set up to record the seed phrase.  I suggest getting a stainless steel vault.  The wallet should be locked up somewhere safe, and the vault kept elsewhere, i.e. a safety deposit box or a vault at the bank.

Making your first deposit to your wallet can be nerve wracking. Make the first transaction a small amount.  Don't even think about fees or any other shit, just concentrate on getting your addresses correct.  The Ledger Live part makes it a snap.  My BTC was on Coinbase Pro, and that was pretty intuitive, also. My first transfer was $1.67 in fees.  Remember, Bitcoin does not reside on the wallet.  The wallet is really your private key, and of course it allows you to generate an encrypted public key or address.  You can inadvertently flush the Nano X down the toilet, and it doesn't matter.  Get another one, use your seed recovery, and connect to Ledger Live, and you're back in business.  Also, when you transfer, remember, it could take up to 10 minutes for the first confirmation of your transaction, and then you wait for further nodes to confirm the transfer.  It is feasible it might take up to an hour.  Another nice Ledger Live feature is you can see on the screen the transaction status, and click on the details, which connects you to a block explorer, and then see your address in the block during the confirmation.  When the confirmation is complete, the Ledger Live updates, and shows success.

Another thing I like about the Ledger is that I know Ledger has proven itself successful, and is not going be here for the long run.  

Hope this helps someone.  There are a lot of great wallets out there, but just wanted to post something on the Nano X for those leaning in that direction.  Just a great wallet and great software.

m3igkz,Nat_Testes,Analysis on BTC balance on exchanges and active supply. What's your view on this?,"As we can see on this chart, the BTC balance on exchanges are dropping since March/2020: 

[BTC balance on exchanges \(2012-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/hefg62pnclm61.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43b713e81041c96a384b64551c189ce5791c900b)

But if you look at the whole period, you'll see that the balance is almost always growing in bull and bear markets. 

Maybe you'll say that financial institutions are taking bitcoin out of exchanges and this reduction of BTC in exchanges is good, but despite the current drop, it seems there's still enough bitcoin in exchanges today to dump the price as we saw in December/2017 (I am not saying there will be a drop now, I am just questioning the view of some who say that the supply of BTC in exchanges is too low).

We also need to consider that before going to an exchange, bitcoins were 'stored' in personal wallets. 

My first questions are:

1) Why has the bitcoin price gone up while the balance on exchanges has grown in the past? (*My guess is that new hodlers have gotten used to storing their bitcoins in exchanges over time instead of personal wallets, as the number and size of exchanges had grow*)

2) The historical peak of total bitcoin balance on exchanges is only 17% of the total supply. According to the TABB Group research report, the OTC market is about 3x bigger. Do you think it is relevant to analyze the BTC balance in exchanges given that it's volume is small?

\------//------

If you look to supply last active in 1y-2y, you'll see a big movement happening now, similar to what has occurred in other bullish cycles:

[Supply last active 1y-2y](https://preview.redd.it/aniuxs3ajlm61.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=744d1991c82d3c400e9bdbefedf93602876efa04)

But the supply last active 2y-3y moved less compared to other cycles:

&amp;#x200B;

[Supply last active 2y-3y](https://preview.redd.it/soe6x62ujlm61.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=101ab00d98bb833c8cd40989571cfa41d7c8e86d)

And the supply last active 3+y hasn't even started to fall yet:

&amp;#x200B;

[Supply last active 3+y](https://preview.redd.it/z88djpzkmlm61.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=522cf8f9e71a31b967ac7111149613d16b50964d)

So my third question is:

3) What do you think about each of the hypotheses below? (Probably True | Probably False | Impossible to know....)

A) As exchanges have grown in popularity, more investors have started to do their custodian at exchanges. This explains the increasing volume over the years. 

B) Short-term investors often store their bitcoins in exchanges. This explains why the balance in exchanges grows so fast when bitcoin is coming to the end of a bull market.

C) Short and medium-term investors (bitcoins moved less than 2 years ago) are selling their bitcoins to financial institutions. This means that the amount of long-term investors is still high and the short-term investors are mostly financial institutions, not retail.

\*Note that if B and C are true, maybe the bull market still has a loooong way to go.

I’ve been casually buying Bitcoin since 2017 and have always used Coinbase. 

But in the last few months I’ve really taken the plunge down the Bitcoin rabbit hole and have become convinced that I need to get away from the KYC exchanges and also get my holdings into cold storage. 

With SO MUCH information out there it’s hard to know what the right moves are, and I’m just searching for some guidance. I’m certain there are others who will benefit from having these questions answered as well. 

- what exchange do you use? why do you use it? how do you fund it? 
- what wallet do you use? why that one? 
- what are your thoughts on KYC? is it really that much of a privacy risk to use centralized exchanges? and does that outweigh the security risk of using anonymous exchanges?  

My hope is that this will set off a good discussion that’ll help myself and other relative noobs to level up our Bitcoin knowledge.

Yesterday he reported on the acquisition of 262 BTC at a price of $ 57146. On Friday, the company's total portfolio of 91K + BTC was worth $5.1 billion. By this morning, the price of bitcoin dipped to $56,200 and many traders rushed to write that Michael made an imprudent purchase. Well, who buys on growth, right?***

But in less than a day, bitcoin suddenly storms a new ATH of $ 60,000 and Michael Saylor's company becomes richer by half a billion dollars per day, which exceeds its usual annual profit of $ 472 million. And the most interesting thing is that having become richer by half a billion dollars, the company loses on that day 2.46% of the market value of their shares. Which corresponds to a loss in its billion-dollar capitalization of $ 25 million.

It is clear that the stock market is as detached from reality as possible. The company with a market capitalization of $ 1 billion has five times as much bitcoin equity in equity, showing a negative P/E ratio of -5.5. For example, Facebook, with its annual revenue ratio of 26, is worse in 143 times. But such outdated approaches to valuing companies on the American stock market no longer work.

If they worked, then MicroStrategy shares should have cost at least 55 times more.

A conspiracy hunch creeps in that Michael Sailor may know or sense BTC's move to the next ATH. I think it would be useful to subscribe to [his Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/michael_saylor), where he publishes all the purchases of BTC by the company, which by chance surprisingly happen before the price of BTC rises.",1615645057,9,1

m46f21,throw-away567891,How to split 24 word seed with a 3 out of 5 schema on a metal plate?,"Hey guys,

I would love to split my 24 word seed with a 3 out 5 schema,meaning there are 5 parts and 3 are enough to restore the orginal 24 word seed. However I don't want to weaken my 24 word seed, so plain text splitting it somehow is not really an option.

How can I realise it though? How did you do that?

&amp;#x200B;

* One Time Pad or XOR:  
For 2 out of 3 One Time Pad would be great I think as it can be decrypted by hand with a simple instruction. However it seems to be super complicated for 3 out of 5.

&amp;#x200B;

* Shamir Secret Sharing:  
Also a great method but it can't handle 24 word secret, right? Also the resulting parts (shards) are each one super long ""string"" that would be difficult to engrave on a metal plate

&amp;#x200B;

* SLIP-0039 : Shamir's Secret-Sharing for Mnemonic Codes:  
I think this does excatly what I want. However it is quiet new and there is not a lot of implementations. In fact all I know of is this [https://iancoleman.io/slip39/](https://iancoleman.io/slip39/). Where it says ""EXPERIMENTAL PROTOTYPE"".

He is also being investigated by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy of Canada for embezzlement, illegal appropriation of funds and fraud, file number 200-11-026989-205. 

At least one complaint has been lodged with local police. Samuel Wiss is a mythomaniac, who tells absolutely anything in order to appropriate funds. Basically, he presents himself as a cryptocurrency expert, accepts bank transfers for crypto. After 1 or 2 transactions that goes pretty well, he keeps your money and falls into a delirium of implausible excuses to justify why he can no longer send you your crypto.

His bankruptcy documents reveal that he deceived friends, family, employees and relatives for more than $ 400,000. Among his common excuses: 

-His 2FA password must be reset
- He changed cell therefore, he must wait in order to recover his accesses and his accounts
-He is drunk / with a girl so he will get back ASAP 
- The funds are on the way (wire transfer) which will never arrive 
- Forged screenshots of accounts that have been closed for several years 
- Transmission error: he sent your crypto but on a wrong address and it cannot be recovered (obviously)

And the ones saying: ""You should be taking profits""... get it even less.

Here's my projection:

&gt; As many smart people like Mr. Saylor and Mr. Musk have pointed out, it's very irresponsible for any individual or business not to own any Bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; People who don't own any Bitcoin will be laughed out and shamed as fools and ignorants.
&gt; 
&gt; People hate that, so they will come in slowly... then all of a sudden. That's when the next FOMO ""bubble"" will come and will take Bitcoin over 300K on this current cycle, to then maybe ""crash"" back down to around 90K (although with all the institutions lining up , and then later governments also buying, I doubt we see over 30% corrections any more).
&gt; 
&gt; The next halving/cycle will take ir over 1 million, following the S2F chart as it always has.
 
 So **I will NEVER sell my Bitcoin** for worthless, ever-depreciating, printed-to-infinity government coupons/IOU's... and pay enormous taxes that go to kill children on the other side of the world on top of that.
&gt; 
&gt; For the first time ever we have real independent money, that I alone can decide where to spend and how to use. If for whatever reason I need fiat to buy something from somebody who refuses to accept Bitcoin (I wouldn't buy from them in the first place), I would borrow against my BTC as last resort option. We have that option already with many lenders, the one I trust right now due to the people behind it is Blockfi.
&gt; 
&gt; Selling Bitcoin it´s like selling prime real estate you owe in Manhattan. You never sell that, neither your children and grand children. It's meant to be kept for ALL generations to come, forever, till the end of times. You can borrow against it, use it as collateral.
&gt;

I have very important lucrative info to pass to Warren Buffet. 

I suggest Warren Buffet look into the insanely undervalued BSV at $190 compared to $52000 tulip BTC...both coins are fixed at 21 million supply.

US patents office has awarded 1000 patents to BSV blockchain and is legally recognised as the legal bitcoin.  
BTC is the first experimental Bitcoin and BSV is the legally patented Bitcoin.  
I also forwarded similar info to Wall Street Journal and they are digesting the intrinsic value in the IP...1000 patents in BSV.  
I hope Warren Buffet will seize the opportunity to make a first move advantage to acquire 5 million coins in Bitcoin SV (BSV) before the media expose its intrinsic value.  
Bitcoin SV is internet 2.0 for data and money in 2022....its market cap could be worth trillions. This represents 300x on current ROI.

Anyone who’s held Bitcoin for a good while is likely now pretty well off, which is awesome, but I find myself now pondering how to make the most of it. I got in basically right at the start and have held ever since, a good 10 years now. I have sold some over the past year to pretty much buy a new house with a very minimal mortgage, which honestly was incredibly hard to do, I hate selling Bitcoin as it turns out, but while I completely believe in it and it’s future, my family now has a hard asset should the worst happen. But I really don’t want to sell any more. 

That said I’d like to be able to take advantage of this, likely once in a lifetime opportunity, to improve the life of my family by spending some of this new found wealth going forward (I’m not talking lambos and private jets, just the occasional nice holiday and having experiences that we couldn’t necessarily afford before). We now have the means to be able to do pretty much whatever we want, and we no longer have to avoid going on that trip as we need to pay for car maintenance, or miss that scenic helicopter flight as its not it’s just an expensive luxury. 

So the question arises, how do we spend our new money sensibly, when spending it is actually a bad idea as it keeps appreciating?

Lending out the Bitcoin for interest at places like blockfi etc is a hard no as this point, as I imagine most of us would need them to pry it from our cold dead fingers before we voluntarily handed over our Bitcoin to someone else. We’re going to need a really big player to come along with fully insured deposits etc before I feel even remotely comfortable doing that. 

People speak about how millionaires stay millionaires by taking loans against their assets and paying them off with more loans, rinse and repeat, but in practice I’ve no idea how that really works or if anyone would be willing to lend against Bitcoin when let’s face it, it’s a volatile asset at the moment   At least at reasonable rates anyway. 

So I just thought I’d open this up as the wife and I were just pondering it, and a lot of you on this forum now find yourselves in the same boat. 

Right now we have a lot of money, but only on paper as actually spending it kind of results in losing money in the long run. It’s a weird situation to be in, so what do we do?",1615691075,63,1

m5qa93,Xplosiv27,Why India’s Bitcoin Ban Doesn’t Matter,"Why India Banning Crypto Doesn’t Matter

India Bans Cryptocurrency

India will propose a law banning cryptocurrencies, fining anyone trading in the country or even holding such digital assets. Even China, which has banned mining and trading, does not penalise possession. Holders of cryptocurrencies have up to six months to liquidate.

The draconian bill is believed to give jail of up to 10 years on people who mine, generate, hold, sell, transfer, dispose of, issue or deal in cryptocurrencies (1). 


Why? 

Illicit activity with crypto is no longer a valid argument for censorship. It is currently believed to make up less than 1% of Bitcoin transaction activity, a stark contrast to the 2% to 5% of global GDP caught up in money laundering alone. As legitimate cryptocurrency use goes up, crypto crime as a percentage goes down. 2020 crypto crime was $1.9 billion in 2020, down 57% from 2019’s $4.5 billion (2). 

The Reserve Bank of India voiced its concern again last month, citing what it said were risks to financial stability from cryptocurrencies. At the same time, the central bank has been working on launching its own digital currency, a step the government’s bill will also encourage.

Quantitative easing (inflation) is seen by governments as imperative for maintaining financial integrity and mitigating financial crisis, despite the negative socio-economic effects associated with the loss of purchasing power (3). 

Bitcoin is immune from both fiscal and monetary policy and avoids the need for cross-border foreign exchange transactions. The Indian government is therefore likely banning cryptocurrency eliminate competition, centralising financial power and imposing inflation and monitoring on national digital currency users. 


Implications

Governments acting to improve the well-being of a community often make misjudgements, unintentionally creating “almost as much harm in ruining lives and destroying wealth as the most destructive wars”(4).  

The proposed ban on crypto will be particularly damaging to the already poor financial inclusion in India. A World Bank study that found there were over 1.7 billion unbanked adults in 2017 (5). 

It is unlikely that other governments will follow in India’s steps. However, for institutional investors to participate in a new asset class, it must be underpinned by a robust infrastructure able to support an efficient market, so more regulation is expected. Governments themselves are being pressured and many are re-considering their own currency offerings (6). 

Bitcoin's global reach and neutrality could spur it to become the currency of choice for international trade (7). It is almost impossible for a government to shut down access to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies or prevent its ownership or usage without what would effectively amount to a shutdown of the global Internet (8). Today, access to the Bitcoin network is enabled by satellites in areas with unreliable or no Internet connection, which further reinforces its censorship-resistant properties (9). India’s poor policy making simply slows national institutional adoption. 

September 2017 was the last time Bitcoin suffered a pull back from a government banning it (China). Spot price went from $5000 to $3000 before proceeding to run up to $20,000 in the following months. If anything this proves the resilience of decentralised currencies.",1615830184,20,1

m5q4gp,DontCallMeKevan,Covid and bitcoin (warning for new buyers),"Fellow bitcoin enthousiasts!  


The good news:

The past few months have been amazing for the bitcoin price. Less then a year ago, most economists described bitcoin as poison, or a bubble. One that would shortly die out.  
Since ... I think its been clear they've been proven wrong. Bitcoin is not a company that can make a loss and go bankrupt. If anything, its product is purely publicity, and .. in that regard, bitcoin deserves to rise in price!  


Its foundations have only strengthtened.   


Covid has killed both legal and illegal businesses alike that operated in the street, and .. much of it has moved to online purchases. Where bitcoin has found its use. Many people all over the world got into bitcoin without even intentions of investing in it, just to make transactions. 

And for the investors .. with all this currency printing happening for every major currency, it has only proven how safe bitcoin is in comparison.  


&amp;#x200B;

But now for some 'bad' news. If you're new to bitcoin, buying is .. almost always a good long-term strategy! Most people agree that bitcoin, if only due to its size and name recognition, will only grow and become more influencial. Either as the future world-currency, or at least linked to one. But .. be wary about the coming months.  


If you followed /r/bitcoin, or any newssite covering bitcoin, you're probably well aware a lot of big names, banks and other financial institutions have bought into bitcoin over the past few months. Absolutely breaking buy and sell barriers that traditionally would have stabilized the coin.   


These investors are of a different breed, and while not to quote the traditional ' pump and dump' strategy commonly employed by them in the traditional stock market, they do tend to have a bigger impact on the prize and can lead to more dramatic declines.  


If you decide to buy in in the nearby future, be wary of sudden price drops. Don't spend money you can't miss, and .. while it is a good long-term investment, recognize that bubble effects can sometimes proceed a natural bitcoin growth. The price IS capable of crashing! and It can take a long time before it recovers. Don't let that discourage your future bitcoin trading! Make an informed AND brave decision.  


(Personally, I predict many of these organizations to sell off bitcoin and other liquid assets whenever other opportunities present themselves. Much of this current bitcoin investment is due to the free availibility of cash by the central banks. But that's just my perspective. Many here will disagree. Time will tell)",1615829758,7,1

As far as i know, bitcoin has turned from a liquid currency to more of a ""hard"" asset like gold, to store value over time. Like gold, its not convenient to spend. While it might be feasible to make a large, one off payment, say, buying a house with a bunch of bullion, i cant scrape off a small piece to buy my morning coffee. But the only way to to keep this value, is to use up large amount of energy doing basically nothing (proof of work) and this, depending on the source of energy can be bad for the environment, and if not, just seems wasteful in general.

Due to this, Bitcoin seems like a very old, outdated technology. Going forward, what is going to happen to bitcoin, and its value, if something clearly superior comes along? This is kind of a major concern of mine, as i believe that crypto currencies will and should be a major part of the future, and I believe in holding long-term. Im concerned that bitcoin simply isn't going to fulfil this goal? Im not a short term profiteer looking to cash out into fiat, and bitcoin seems like thats all it is.

Etherium is similar, though i believe it is moving to the seemingly more efficent proof of stake model soon.

m5opln,Guest_Basic,Have we come full circle?,"Bitcoin first caught my eye in 2015. I started buying a number of crypto currencies around mid-2017

Everything I knew about crypto currencies was from youtube, so when friends and family asked me what Bitcoin is, this was my go-to answer -- ""bitcoin and crypto currencies are a new type of money which will help us transact without middle men like Visa and Mastercard."" I would proceed to tell them that whenever we use a Visa or a Mastercard to make a payment these (evil) corporations take a cut of the transaction thus increasing the price of the goods and service you are purchasing. Finally I would point to how you can buy cheaper gas if you pay with Cash. (Needless to say, most of my friends and family thought I was a genius around December-2017)

Fast forward to 2021 (and ignoring all the mocking I received during the crypto winter), I finally decided it was time to actually read the bitcoin white paper. For anyone who hasn't read it (no judgement) here are a few lines of the introduction

""Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions"". The white paper then proposes a solution to this problem

Given the transaction costs of both Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum today is it safe to say that crypto currencies are suffering from the exact same problem the original bitcoin paper sought to solve? 

So have a come full circle? Have crypto currencies become what they sought to destroy?

Or am I misinterpreting something? Is this era of high transaction fee just a phase and do we expect it to come down (below the transaction costs of Visa/Mastercard) once upgrades/enhancements are made to the technology?

I know some of you are going to say that things have changed over the last 10 years and bitcoin and Ethereum can still be used to transact in millions/billions of dollars with less than $100 in transaction costs and as a percentage is much lower then the same transaction if it were made in fiat currency -- to this I will point to the ""small casual transactions"" explicitly being mentioned in the bitcoin white paper",1615826088,12,1

m5o8hu,1hundreds,Bitcoin is a human right,"Do countries realize how authoritarian it is to restrict the use of Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a human right. The right to choose your currency is a human right.

One reason for skyrocketing Bitcoin adoption is that Bitcoin, born out of the global financial crisis, is an expression from the people that they are lacking confidence in the government's ability to manage the money supply fairly and appropriately. The lack of confidence is often caused by the government increasing the money supply (inflation) in a non-proportional manner, meaning that when new money enters the system you do not receive an equal portion of that newly issued money relative to the current portion of the money supply you currently own. This non-proportional issuance reduces your portion of the money supply and is the reality in which we all live: a system in which central authorities attempt to manage fiat currency and seemingly arbitrarily select winners (institutions and people) by rewarding newly created money. Governments may have the best intention when inflating the money supply, but ultimately this is an unjust exercise.

It is important to note that inflation, put simply, is the increase in the money supply. Too many people argue over the *measurement of* and *change in* the prices of good and services, which is a distraction. If the money supply inflated and you did not receive your fair share than you came out on the losing end. On the periphery inflation may take many forms, including a reduction in your purchasing power and/or a widening wealth gap. In any event, people have the right to store their savings as they see fit. 

It is greatly bothersome to see news of countries applying restrictions (or trying to apply restrictions) on their citizens' use of Bitcoin. The most recent news being that India will propose a law banning the use of cryptocurrencies for their citizens. However, we have seen signs of progressive integration of Bitcoin in political pockets of France and the United States *(please add other positive developments from other countries in the comments)*.

How can the Bitcoin community, and those not a part of the Bitcoin community but understand that  *choice of currency* is a human right and an expression of freedom, protect our global peers from authoritative actions? *(please share your non-violent ideas in the comments; I have always believed Bitcoin to be a non-violent, pacifist movement. One attraction of Bitcoin is that the military industrial complex becomes unaffordable with a money supply that cannot be whimsically inflated.)*

*Centralized, active management* of the money supply was always a daunting task that would require an omniscient supervisor, making the long-term management of the money supply impossible, which is precisely why countries should look to openly embrace Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin frees government from the burden of actively managing the money supply. And while government may obtain a certain power and control from being the sole-authority over the money supply make no mistake that there is also a great responsibility and burden in managing the supply too. Additionally, we need to ask ourselves should government have that monopolistic control over money? Bitcoin is a human right.

With the integration of Bitcoin into a country's monetary system, political figures no longer would have their feet held to the fire for the mismanagement the money supply. Citizens, in theory, would make a choice to hold centrally planned fiat or bitcoin. If the fiat money were to devalue against bitcoin, or vice versa, the citizen would have made the choice and accepted the responsibility of their decision to participate in the monetary network of their choosing.

Looking through a pragmatic and idealistic lens of the monetary networks a citizen would choose between there are two broad options:

* **Centrally planned fiat monetary system**\- centralized, opaque-at-best, easily inflatable, providing a lender of last resort and other forms of centralized insurance
* **Bitcoin network**\- decentralized, transparent, sound, calculable modest inflation schedule that eventually levels out, does not provide a lender of last resort (in theory a central bank could start buying bitcoin and build up massive reserves to act as a lender of resort, although they would not have the ability to increase the supply of bitcoin, making this system very different than the current)

There are economic theories justifying both networks. Any rational person would find it hard pressed to make an argument why 100% of your savings should fall into the centrally planned fiat system if Bitcoin was given a fair playing field. 

Countries that embrace Bitcoin will position themselves to lead the human race for the next century and possibly centuries. How should countries embrace Bitcoin? *(please share your ideas in the comments)*

1. **Coexistence of Bitcoin and government issued fiat**: government would continue to issue their own fiat paper and bring Bitcoin into parity with their own fiat legal and compliance structures. There would be no prohibitive measures with regards to mining, ownership, transactions, taxes, etc.. on bitcoin that did not apply to their own fiat. Government could decide if they wanted to accept taxes in fiat, bitcoin or both. 
2. **Bitcoin as a unit of account:** a country decides they no longer want the responsibility and burden of managing a money supply, opting to make bitcoin their unit of account and accept bitcoin as tax payment. The government would transition resources from money supply management to protecting and advocating for the Bitcoin network on behalf of their citizens.",1615824854,20,1

Setting aside the apparent CO2 footprint problem(not a real problem IMO), I'm a little curious to hear thoughts on the Proof of Harvest concept.

Strikes me as getting even more complex to explain to mass adopters and I'm not seeing proof of the claims of a 1000000x more secure than Bitcoin.

Other issues too like the implication that harvesters can potentially make more tokens ...

Not to mention that to catch up to Bitcoin would be an enormous task.

I may have got it wrong.

I initially used bitcoinpaperwallet.com online (lol) to generate a random private key, and I deposited the funds to the public key, which was presented to me in the form of a QR code. I had intended to give out the private key to my friend. However, being the aesthetically challenged person that I am, I did not enjoy the particular design of the QR code and decided to produce my own QR code online. I then input the private key (lol x2) to two websites; first, to qr-code-generator.com, and then to cwaqrgen.com. (In all fairness, I did a quick check online to see whether any of the websites were scam). Long story short, a few hours after I had deposited the bitcoins, they were sent to an unknown address and long gone.

Now I realize that I shouldn't have used an online paper wallet generator and that I shouldn't have input my private key to any website, do you think it is more probable that one of the websites given above actually stole my private keys or that I unknowningly committed another error along the way? Thoughts appreciated.",1615770681,23,1

m586k2,DeepFriedPhone,Bitcoin's true market value in a post-adoption or post-fiat future.," There are countless sources of mainstream information that are typically just generating clicks through fearmongering about market volatility, but very few discussions about the real world economic ramifications of a future where crypto coexists or replaces fiat in the future. I know it won’t happen next week, or next year, but perhaps decades from now.

Does Bitcoin, or crypto broadly, actually make anyone wealthier in the end if our systems of measuring value eventually transition to it? Or is the reality that things remain much the same way they are now where parallel economic systems exist alongside one another vying for adoption in perpetuity? This thought exercise is equal parts crypto speculation and economic theory.

I'm curious to read about its potential true value in a post-adoption (post-fiat?) economy, not as a fungible currency but as a representation of value. There are sci-fi notions of a time where we'll have neural brain links that connect us to an augmented reality where we just think of a financial transaction and it pops into existence and is immediately validated. And maybe that might be the case one day using a type of blockchain technology that hasn't been created yet.

But the world is also crazy enough that in a hundred years, for whatever reason, we could still be minting physical coins that represent virtual assets in the same way we've minted them for centuries to represent something else. Maybe there's some cataclysmic event, or we go through an arrested economic development between fiat and crypto where that transition experiences a failure to launch. It's probably unlikely, but who knows. It's not common for the future to be what we envision.

We all read the headlines about Bitcoin hitting six or seven figures, and I'm not debating the possibility. But if fiat becomes displaced (in whole or part) by crypto markets, then are fiat comparisons even relevant as a basis of comparison in the future? If you own a Bitcoin in 2050 and it's worth a million dollars, what does it mean to have a million dollars of a currency whose relevance is not what it was thirty years prior? There have been wealthy people of previous civilizations who had stacks of whatever their currency was, but if its buying power vanished, then the market value of their currency is of no consequence today. 

It's possible my analogy is flawed. But are you still a wealthy person in 2050 if an average house costs a million dollars? Or an average vehicle? Or an average tax return? Anyone who's seen the movie Idiocracy might remember the stoned doctor laughing as he prints out a hospital receipt for five billion dollars. This is all exaggerated math that may sound silly, but it's rooted in truth because hyperinflation has actually happened and led to eight figure loaves of bread. I know it sounds like a ridiculous or uneducated stretch to say something like this today, but what if a loaf of bread costs a Bitcoin in the future?

Of course, all things being equal, we are better off having Bitcoin than not having it at all and I am very much invested in it, but maybe it doesn't mean we’ll inevitably be independently wealthy in the future either. If crypto becomes a normalized representation of value that displaces fiat, what is the argument that HODLers wouldn't still be in a similar economic situation decades from now as they are today, if fiat erodes to obsolescence or irrelevance? Would crypto value still be as theoretically esteemed if it is swapped out as a dominant substitute of value? Perhaps my reservations are misplaced, but I wonder whether or not it will mean we'll be as flush as we imagine ourselves to be in a post-fiat world.

I'd welcome links to any sources from smart minds that speculate on such an economic transition, about what it might really mean to own a Bitcoin (or ten, or a hundred) in the future.",1615767425,2,1

m56u2p,ImJustACowLol,Any animo for mobile apps to control Bitcoin nodes?,"I'm not sure if similar mobile apps already exist (and if so, how user-friendly they are, are they open source etc.), but I have had this idea in my head for a while:

Some of us may be running either full or pruned nodes on personal servers (I'm doing this on a Raspberry Pi for example). To access my node (and wallet) I have to either connect a display and peripherals, or I have to access it through a remote desktop (such as VNC or TeamViewer). 

However, to make it much easier to interact with my own Bitcoin node, I'm tempted to build an easily deployable application (open-source, suitable for tech-savvy people) that consists of two components:

1) A server on the device hosting your Bitcoin node, which will be the entry point to accessing your node from the corresponding mobile application.

2) The mobile application, aimed at maximized user friendliness. I'm aiming to let it have the same functionality as regular Crypto apps, but with additional features for managing your node remotely. Linking to a node-server would require the IP address (or hostname) and port to be entered. The server (as described in 1)) can run in two modes: no-auth in which case no password has to be given to connect to the server and auth in which case you do need a password. Regardless of the mode the server is running in, if your Bitcoin wallet is encrypted (password protected) then for every transaction you will need to deliver that password as well. Other authentication methods (and support for MFA) may be added as well.

This project would then be built upon the following principles:

1) All code, both client and serverside, will be open-source. This way, the application is verifiably secure and it strengthens trust for the users.

2) Security first. I have extensive experience in programming secure applications (currently I am employed as a mobile developer for a Dutch bank - I know, the irony - in one of it's core teams responsible for handling significant portions of the application's security). I have the skills and know-how to make this application securely usable.

3) Community-driven features. Once the initial application is live, it's users get to propose features and vote on proposed features. During each development cycle, the highest-voted features will be implemented. 

I'm really not sure if anyone would be interested in having such an application. The obvious benefits of running your own node is that you physically own your own Bitcoin, rather than trusting a third party with it. With such an application, it's then also easier to perform transactions, make payment requests etc.

To sum it up... Is anyone interested in an application of this kind, or would I be wasting my time by developing this? I'm open to criticism/feedback :)",1615763322,6,1

I was notified in October 2020 that I needed to transfer all of my crypto assets out of my binance account and into a [binance.us](https://binance.us) account by the end of the year which I promptly did.

You don’t need to tell me it’s a store of value and not a currency, i know that. But why is it a better store of value than BCH?

The thing is, even with a store of value, if it’s used worldwide there’s still gonna be a hell of a lot more than 2 transactions per second with it. Not to mention the energy usage.

Bitcoin was a genius invention. But to me it just seems old and clunky now. Is there any reason other than inertia that bitcoin will become the worlds reserve currency instead of a faster, greener crypto?

Please don’t instantly write me off as a gay crypto bear, I still actually hold a decent amount of BTC but i’m just seeing less and less potential in it the more i learn about projects like BCH, NANO, or any of the other hundreds that can do what BTC does but better.

m6lfao,empyreanrift,Bitcoin Beyond Greed,"There is no doubt that greed plays a crucial role in facilitating the widespread adoption of Bitcoin. The allure of making an early investment to get outsized returns is a very real driver of the adoption of this technology and there is nothing wrong with this. It is fair that those who took the initial risk should see the largest returns; as the popular saying goes “Everyone will get Bitcoin at the price they deserve.”

What concerns me is that many people view Bitcoin as nothing more than an elevator asset. The puerile version of the Bitcoin dream vision found all over the internet goes something like this: invest as much money as possible into Bitcoin as early as possible, HODL, then in 5+ years when it is widely adopted sell your Bitcoin (or take a loan against it) to generate enough fiat currency to live comfortably or indeed lavishly for the rest of your life. Everyone who owns Bitcoin harbors this dream to some extent, but it also strikes me that there is nothing really admirable here and in some ways it is self-defeating. Let me explain.

Consider the following thought experiment: imagine we lived in a world where Bitcoin came into existence not gradually but all at once and the sum total of everyone’s money and investments defined broadly was converted to Bitcoin instantaneously. Never mind the mechanics of how this would occur, it is obviously infeasible. This scenario is essentially the end-game of Bitcoin where people and organizations will convert some of their Bitcoin reserve holdings to local fiat to cover day-to-day expenses while Bitcoin itself will function as a giant worldwide savings account that preserves the purchasing power of deposits until needed at a later point in time. How excited would you be about Bitcoin in this scenario? I imagine that many reading this post would quickly become disenchanted with Bitcoin and move onto the next lottery ticket investment.

To view Bitcoin solely as a one-way ticket to extreme wealth greatly diminishes its full scope and potential. I submit that many people with this mentality have never stopped to think about why they are dreaming this dream. Why do you feel like you need to win the lottery? Everyone’s answer will be different but there are some salient underlying factors that contribute to this collective dream. Perhaps the most important factor is the rising level of wealth inequality that is increasingly manifesting itself in the politics of even the most historically stable developed nations. This wealth inequality, driven in part by the explosion of technology, has only been exacerbated by the policies of central banks and the politicians that influence them. There is a universe of detail to go into here, but one takeaway is that many western countries are heading away from free markets towards the paradigm of centrally planned economies. Those who control the money supply pick winners and losers, the winners being companies and people who have easy access to capital. When a currency is debased the outcomes are not distributed evenly across a society, it is the individuals with the least wealth and access to capital that are hurt the most. It is not hard to imagine the destabilizing effect this has on a society.

It is ironic that so many people view Bitcoin purely as a means to extreme wealth while not even realizing how wealth inequality is contributing to their own dissatisfaction and inability to provide for their families and plan for the future. Bitcoin is more than a lottery ticket, it is a tool to make the world more fair and transparent. It can empower individuals by providing a way to safeguard the monetary energy that is the result of their labor and time. With Bitcoin everyone has the opportunity to take control of their own financial future instead of ceding control to banks and state actors. Going back to the original thought experiment, if Bitcoin were to become the world’s reserve currency without the early adopters accruing excessive wealth it would still be a blessing without comparison. In fact, it would be a miracle. To not see this is to not see all of the injustices and inefficiencies built into our current economic and political systems.

For whatever it is worth, I would exhort this audience to spend less time thinking about the price of Bitcoin and more time considering how it could be used as a force of good to change the world. There are many other angles you could consider along these lines. For example, Bitcoin mining could provide an economic incentive for the development of inexpensive sources of renewable energy and be an economic boon to disadvantaged parts of the world. Be generous with your Bitcoin; it is better to send a little Bitcoin to your family and friends and teach them how it works than it is to hold onto every last Satoshi out of pure greed. We must first educate ourselves and then others for Bitcoin to succeed. Spending time and energy obsessing about daily price fluctuations and how much to stake and when does not help the cause and in fact makes Bitcoin appear toxic to many no-coiners. If that energy is diverted to self-education and teaching it will be much better spent and actually increase the probability that your investment and belief in Bitcoin will pay off later. It will also make the journey more rewarding and enjoyable, and give you even more reasons to HODL when things get choppy.",1615934311,19,1

Greetings fellow enthusiasts.  I’m relatively new to crypto (been in the game since October), but since then I’ve been learning and studying just about every day.  I’ve learned who the scammers are and who are the smart people I really trust in the space.  The overwhelming narrative I see is that bitcoin is a store of value, and if everything goes to plan it will eventually flip gold’s market cap which would put it at about $500,000 per bitcoin.  Some other bitcoin maxi’s say it will reach 5 million per coin but obviously there is no way to tell.  Obviously nothing is set in stone and crypto is insane but it seems like a relatively safe bet long term.  My question is this, would it be a smart move to DCA into bitcoin basically forever? Just as a working person might put $100 into an index fund every month until they retire? Isn’t it a reasonable bet that if I put 6k a year into bitcoin and not touch it for 10 years I could potentially do extremely well in the next 10-20 years? Like better, safer and more stress free then any asset ever? Open to all thoughts and opinions, thanks in advance!",1615974127,8,1

A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unnavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physcial currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party. ""

its wonderfull and beautiful and all and its unfortunetly outofdate in comparision of cryptocurrency ecosystem today which would be a much more fun and complicated topic of discussion. But that introduction alone deserves the unparamount recognizion of questionably the most well put and well founded underground call to arms in the history of economic rebellion.

Combined with the unparelled tools of computer science technologies, and a genius who built a foundation to a much bigger vision he clearly hoped to see thrive in the futures. And finally put to sleep the abysmal catastrophies caused by very niche structers that hold together and make possible the ongoing natures of globally widespread economic consolidations and their dustributed systems of economic abuse, financial comexities, economic instabilities, and unregulated juggling acts we utilize to achieve our clearly broken as hell upholding of what we only know how to keep going. and its the unfortunate duel edged currency competetion that fuels the races all in all.

His vision was simply to create a decentralized financial environment, because the author and every damn one of you who have studied financial history knows that the story is the same all throughout history. 

power or desire of, atracts wealth. and wealth attracts influence. Influence attracts power and then the attractor ends up in the middle of the circle. with a revolving density we call historically well i call it, the concentration of the god of civilivations, most just say money. 

Buisness, politics, sports, ANY hierarchy or/AND financially incentiviced distrubutions of wealth systems are in constant realtional tandum. 

And just like everything else in economics alone or anything elsewhere, we strive for growth and balance in any area of life. Be it as a gardner, a plummer, a buisness man, a buissness, a bank, a country, a world.
The key is and what the only goal is is balance, because balance promotes self sufficency on every level there is available to it. It promotes health and innovation because the artful man knows conflict always flees from balance, and with conflict goes many avoided troubles and many hours spent dealing with them. Leaving room for expansion rather than problem solving.

17 Mar 2021

Claims process

Since the Claims portal was launched in early December 2020, we have sent an email to all 960,000 account holders who had positive account balances according to Cryptopia’s Records. Over 57% by value of account holders have interacted with us in some way. The claims process is still at stage 1 of the below process:

**ProcessDetails**1. Claims registrationAllows the registration of account holders' details and to make claims for their account balances2. Identity verificationVerifies account holders' identities to the necessary verification standard3. Asset transferInstigates asset transfers to account holders

* While we have a significant number of claimants registering successfully, we appreciate that there are also a number who require support to complete the registration process. This is reflected by the number of tickets being raised through our customer support portal. We have taken on additional support staff to assist account holders to complete the registration process. We assure you that we will action all outstanding tickets prior to moving to stage 3 of the process.
* If you are having issues with the registration please refer to the [**‘Update for Cryptopia Claimants &amp; Common Portal Errors 16 December 2020'**](https://www.grantthornton.co.nz/insights/update-for-cryptopia-claimants--common-portal-errors-16-december-2020/).
* We intend to carry out a further promotion of the portal to accountholders to encourage increased participation and will send a further email inviting account holders to register their details on the portal. We have received a number of emails and calls from account holders claiming that they had not received an email. In the majority of cases we were able to confirm to the account holders that they had received an email. Please double check your email spam folder to check whether you have been contacted.
* The next stage of the claim process 2 ‘Identity verification’ will be launched in the next couple of months, with the asset transfer stage to follow on from this. However, the transfer stage will require the input and approval of the Court particularly in relation to the following:  

   * Approving a distribution model that reflects the nature of stakeholders’ property
   * Confirming what is to be done with unclaimed Crypto-assets
   * Setting a cut-off date for claims to be received and assessed

Sealed orders

* In this update we provide service of orders in respect of realisation of digital assets. We have received orders allowing us to convert 80 BTC into fiat currency to meet the reasonable cost and expenses of and incidental to the protection, preservation, recovery, management, and administration of any Cryptocurrency.
* [**A copy of the sealed orders can be found here \[ 614 kb \]**](https://www.grantthornton.co.nz/globalassets/1.-member-firms/new-zealand/pdfs/cryptopia/2021/sealed-orders61013359.1.pdf).

m65bju,LiberalMalesSwallow,"Bitcoin's regular 10-30% corrections ultimately PROTECT the asset's value, more than they pose any danger","Sharing this Bitcoin rumination I had while taking a dump yesterday. The fact that these corrections - which are large comparable to stocks and other assets - happen regularly to the point that it is an expected, even celebrated occurrence in the world of Bitcoin, to me, this is the strongest evidence that Bitcoin is not ""one big bubble"". If you disagree with me, please explain why I'm wrong - I'm very eager to develop a better understanding of this.  


Does Bitcoin's price get ahead of itself sometimes following positive news, to the point that it is temporarily over-valued? Of course. And this naturally creates opportune selling points for whales, traders, and folks that have already made 10X+... yet as the price dips and dips, it has always reached an equilibrium point where the world rushes in to buy the discount - because the world recognizes Bitcoin as a valuable and desired asset. Over time, I believe these dips help shape a more even (that is, uniform) distribution of Bitcoin among those that hold the asset, as the long-time holders and whales give up their disproportionately-accumulated Bitcoin, and the resulting buying opportunities allow this to distribute this BTC more evenly among the rest of the crypto-nerds.

I don't fully understand the swirl of market forces that generate these corrections, and perhaps my outlook is a bit naïve. But I'm starting to think these dips are a natural part of Bitcoin's growth curve that actually protect the asset in the long-run.",1615887824,52,1

I propose it could be beneficial to line up the timing of daily candle open and closes rather than the UTC standard used across the world.

Imagine the depth of the pockets of the media industry and all that they have tried to get rid of torrent. You know what? It's still very alive and churning on, doing its thing. Even if it's illegal in some places of the world. VPN and go! 

Realistically, all they can try do is to make it harder to buy and sell crypto on exchanges that they can control. And that's it. It's laughably unattainable! 

There is only one way to get rid of a decentralized system, which is to cometely turn off all communication networks. All of them. 

Fear not my friends. Politicians often act like they are powerful. They need to act like that to preserve their power. Deep in my heart, I know the power of a decentralized network. I sleep like a baby knowing that there is nothing that they can do.

The global crisis for sure helped opening my eyes - governments printing money like it was a toilet paper. Then the stock market - endless machine of growth, and gambling for adults. I never really thought about it before (cause I had no money to invest). Why the hell is everyone investing in the stock market (or rather every rich guy)? Because money is freaking worthless, whatever currency. You let it sit in your bank and your are basically getting robbed, silently, but steadily every god damn year.
So I figured - gotta put money into stock-market, and so I did. But then I finally though about crypto again. And then it made sense - hedge against that useless currency (USD / EUR). Get something no one has control over. No rich guys, no god damn governments. Bitcoin seemed like made-up artificial thing before - but normal money is too in the end.

m63msd,jdmsomething,Recovering BTC from a Legacy 64 Char Private Key wallet,"Hi All,

I have a legacy wallet with a 64 Char private key from 2011 that was only created on bitcoin core.

I have re-loaded bitcoin core on the original computer and I had to move the original Bitcoin folder to an external HD to create enough space to download the blockchain. Upon downloading, and moving the wallet.dat file back, nothing is showing. I am wondering if there is a way to put this into a new electrum wallet. Or somehow get access on bitcoin core?

Some background information:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The private key I have, I believe there might be a few incorrect characters at the end, so I need to be able to enter multiple 64 character private keys to figure out which are the correct ones.

2. I have the original wallet.dat file but it does not load into bitcoin core and did get moved from the original folder however 3 copies were made - not sure if this helps or not.

&amp;#x200B;

3. What format do I need to enter this key into either bitcoin core, or electrum to get it to accept? I tried: p2wpkh-p2sh:3...64....charkey and it stays as greyed out in the electrum import screen found here: [https://bitcoinelectrum.com/importing-your-private-keys-into-electrum/#:\~:text=Just%20select%20%E2%80%9CImport%20bitcoin%20addresses,Wallet%20Import%20Format%20(WIF)](https://bitcoinelectrum.com/importing-your-private-keys-into-electrum/#:~:text=Just%20select%20%E2%80%9CImport%20bitcoin%20addresses,Wallet%20Import%20Format%20(WIF)).

4. Is there any other safe tools or ways to try to get access to it? Do I need to convert it to a WIF format, and if so how to do that safely?

If the US and other major economies got back on the gold (or some other) standard, what then?

Isn't the main reason for Bitcoin's success just how terrible all existing currencies are, and if so, what happens if they get their act together? (Not that that would be a bad thing, though it might be bad for major hodlers.)

m63ac3,Azmasaur,Here's why the stimulus is big,"A lot of people are claiming that the stimulus won't really effect the price very much, because how much of it will really go to into bitcoin, optimistically 5-10billion?  Realistically more like a couple billion?  


A few billion doesn't mean much now that BTC is a $1 trillion market cap, right?  At the end of the day 1 billion is only .1% of the market cap?   Well ....wrong.  


The price of BTC is only effected by the coins that are actually on exchanges.  *Basically, that $5b or whatever it is, is all fighting over the limited BTC that is available on exchanges.*  Which is not all 21m bitcoins (an unknown amount in the millions is lost forever anyways).  This money isn't going to OTC either, its all going through retail exchanges.    You can look up the exact number currently on exchanges, but it's way way smaller than than the whole market cap, probably under 5-10%.    


It doesn't actually take $100 billion to increase the BTC market cap by 10%.  In reality it takes a lot less money coming in to do that.    


**TL;DR** all of the price action is happening within the limited supply of what is being traded on exchanges.  It doesn't actually take anywhere near $100billion cash inflow to increase market cap by 10%.",1615878671,7,1

LISTEN. The other day someone posted how much bitcoin they had. It was a decent amount actually. First off, the post gave waaay too many details about their personal life.

Sex

First Name

Birthday

Country

STREET NAME

Phone Brand

Hair Color

Spouse's name and other info

m6dp1l,Captain-overpants,Market cycle perspective,"I have a significant (for me) position in bitcoin. I began building it during the local dip after the previous ATH. Historical price movements transposed on to current market behavior will not affect my DCA strategy, to preface, and I feel I would personally benefit from dips in the future. 

But I just learned what a “halving” is. I’ve known about bitcoin for nearly 10 years, when my friend first introduced me to it along with the SR. 

The new ATHs and market proving made me research more. I don’t feel unique in this.

I am expecting that many more (meaning at some point, a growing proportion) people will be looking at bitcoin as an asset with a 4 year lo a maturation period. In this way, future halvings will be priced in and ease some of the interim volatility. There is a general tendency in markets that the more money is involved, the longer horizons tend to be considered. 

Today, there’s an order of magnitude more people who are aware of the price action following halvings. The pricing in of this expectation beforehand, I believe, is going to occur and significantly reduce inter year volatility before the market has to contend in a more “raw” way with the supply side limits on circulation. 

Tl;dr Even after the volatility is captured, and we transition from price discovery to true appraisal, it is only then that the market can truly price in the deflationary nature of Bitcoin and the price will continue to appreciate astoundingly.",1615913913,0,1

m6d00u,SolarPanelDude,where do you think the support levels are from the bull run over the previous year?,"I keep track of my dollar cost averages and I am currently around 28K based on what I own.   Meaning that if the price crashed to 28,000 USD and then I sold it all, I would be right around zero.  No gain, or no loss in terms of all my investments.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not my plan, but rather how I judge where I am in the entire equation.  As I purchase more at a higher price, its raises my average cost to own a bitcoin.  I try to keep my cost to own bitcoin significantly below fluctuations at a value that I deem is realistic.  

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that we have reached a new support level in the 50K range due to the growing acceptance of institutuions.  So if I continued to make dollar cost average dip purchases to raise my cost of ownership to something like 40K, I am still being safe.  But I want to hear what others thoughts are as to where they may see support levels?  I am not entirely familiar with how the halving cycles play into price predictions, stock to flow models and all that advanced stuff....

It is related to the next bear run and I think it will start when the situation with this virus is over. many have received a Stimulus Check but what will happen when they have to pay it back? I don't know what it's like in America or other countries, but here in Germany not many people know that they will have to pay back. Now life is ""good and beautiful"", but when you have to give it all or partial back what will it be?
From where do I know that people and company's will need to pay it back? The short story is that I have talked with my boss and after that I've done some research and everywhere I look i find the same answer, we will need to pay it back.

m6bpj3,umman__manda,Bitcoin and financial inequity,"I recently read economist Thomas Piketty’s book “Capital in the Twenty-First Century”. It’s been recommended reading from multiple sources and a best seller, so I figured there might be some important lessons in it.

Basically, the central thesis boils down to this:

Let *r* be the rate of return on capital.
Let *g* be the rate of economic growth over the long term.

If r &gt; g then wealth concentrates over time.

Bitcoin, as an investment, has been on a tear as we all know. Not only that but with regulated Bitcoin securities coming online, it’s a bright outlook moving forward.

The historical rate of return of Bitcoin, an asset (capital) is significantly higher than the rate of return of economic growth (GDP in the Western world is ~1-3%, even China is &lt;10%.

Thus, according to the r &gt; g theory, Bitcoin still supports the concentration of wealth. It may upend the existing system, ie central banks, sovereign nations, banks, financial sector, etc - but it does nothing to support democratization of finances in the long run - it just transfers the wealth from one “elite” group of people to another “elite” group.

Is there anything that can be done to address this? Or is Bitcoin agnostic to the issue of wealth distribution?",1615908738,12,1

lwekwo,HoloButt,Enjoy The Ride,"A little side story before i get into the meat and potatoes of the post. I first heard about bitcoin in 2010, but i was a teenager and had no clue about it. Completely dismissed it as a fad and forgot about it. Few moments here and there throughout the years where i encountered it again, but dismissed it. I was impressed in 2018 that it was still alive. Fast forward to the summer of 2020 and i was chatting with a friend about it. I checked the price and i was impressed that it had climbed to the low four digits. I felt like i had missed the train like a lot of us do before we start and that it was pointless to buy now. 

A few weeks ago, i made a post in r/BitcoinBeginners asking basic bitcoin questions, and a few days after the ATH, i bought during the dip. Couldn't have been happier and that's when i realized this: Nobody missed the train because we are all in it. We are all in this train, most of them are passed out drunk, some are sleeping, some are just looking at other stuff on their phones and we are staring outside the window, enjoying the beautiful scenery in this never ending ride. It will have some bumps, sometimes it will rain and be gloomy, but in the end the sun always comes out. 

Buckle up and enjoy the ride.",1614724906,3,1

🛎️So how this happen? .

When i SIGN UP in localbitcoins.com i was under 18y (2016) accordingly to EUROPEAN shit laws at this age you can't do basically nothing relations with investments.

✍️ So, the only way at that momment to get localbitcoin account was asking some adult to verify account with Verification ID, because i was under age.

(But of course, the email and my personal phone number on SIGNUP is MINE and never has been changed since registred).

&amp;#x200B;

Then i used account to receive some amounts in BTC in that time (2016-2018) and hold it until now, that i'm in needed and want convert it to EUR.

❄️After so many years i came to my account and they are requesting me to verify account again, was impossible because the person who verify my account is not with me for years and i don't know where it is. 😔

I explained that situation to support and they don't even care, i sended all evidences this account belongs to me,  (phone bills, email) i asked them to call to the phone they don't even do the minimum effort to help

📝I got all evidences possible that account belongs to me since the BEGIN, proofs of payment, sending payments to localbitcoin, phone bills, email acess EVERYTHING!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

✅So this expression  ""not your key not your coin"" makes more sense to me than ever 💔💔

lwczd2,kuzkokronk,Bitcoiner Pro Tip: Memorize your 24 word seed phrase,"When you set up your personal wallet, it generates a list of 24 words as a backup (sometimes it's 12 words, depending on the wallet). This is called a Seed Phrase. You must write this down (preferably on a [metal plate](https://shop.cobo.com/products/cobo-tablet-punch)) and keep it in a secure location. Ideally, have two copies in two separate geographic locations.

The 24 word seed phrase is, essentially, your Bitcoin. DO NOT LOSE THIS.

But to be really secure, you should also ***memorize*** the 24 word seed phrase. It doesn't take much time at all; maybe 1 hour or so. Just repeat the words (silently) over and over until they're burned into your brain. I recite them in my mind every time I brush my teeth, so that's twice a day.

This way, if for some reason I'm forced to leave the country immediately and I can't take my wallet or my metal plate with the backup words, I can just leave without hesitation. All my Bitcoin is stored in my mind. Once I reach safety, all I need is a new wallet, I input the 24 word seed phrase, and BAM! I have access to my coins.

Remember to NEVER enter your 24 word seed phrase into any computer, website, or digital device. If you do, YOU WILL LOSE YOUR BITCOIN. You must only enter it into your own personal wallet.

Just wanted some feedback on what I wrote about bitcoin awhile back when I was trying to convince people about bitcoin.  I thought it would be interesting to read people's feedback.  Thanks!

\-----------------------

**Why the world needs bitcoin**

Imagine your currency suddenly losing 96-98% of its value. People rushing to the grocery stores to buy whatever they can before the rest of their currency goes to shit. Increase in crime and violence everywhere as people try to survive. Well that’s exactly what happened in [Venezuela ](http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/22/news/economy/venezuela-currency-crash/index.html)and [Zimbabwe ](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/390/inflation/hyper-inflation-in-zimbabwe/)a few years ago. 

A variety of sources affect a country's monetary value; irresponsible printing of money supply, excessive regulation, even increases in commodity prices, just to name a few. But that is not the point of this article, this article is on how we can protect ourselves from irresponsible government.

If you’re saying to yourself, “This won’t happen in my country. I live in a country with a responsible government that looks out for my best interest”, let’s cut the bullshit and save the stories of Santa Claus and the tooth fairy for the children. Government are run by people and if you haven’t been living under a rock, you’ll notice that sometimes people in power fuck things up for the rest (mostly the poor). Whether it be for power, greed, or stupidity, it happens. This maybe not your government today, but what about the next election or the one after that.

Here's a list of some examples of hyperinflation:

Yugoslavia 1993 – 1994 \[1\]

Soviet Union 1990 – 1991 \[2\]

Greece 1943-1946 \[3\]

American examples of irresponsible government/banks include the 2008 American mortgage crisis and America's growing federal debt. 

**How does having bitcoin help?**

Bitcoin helps take away some control over the economy from the small group in power and gives it back to the people. Banks have been allowed to dictate the rules that benefit themselves and fund governments that help keep these regulations in place. Let's go back to the mortgage crisis of 2008: banks were blamed, no one was arrested, millions of lives destroyed, government bailed out the banks and taxpayers were handed the bill. The more money we keep in the banks, the more control they will have over the government. 

For instance, you lent money to your brother-in-law and find out he actually using it to gamble. He loses it all and asks you for more money. Like any sane person, you tell him to fuck off. However, your wife insists on helping her brother and lends him more money from your shared account. Is this a good metaphor for the mortgage crisis or the story of my life? I'll let you decide, but you bet your ass I have a separate bank account.

**Technology never stops advancing:**

Think of when the internet first became live in 1991. The majority of people laughed at how slow it was and how it would never amount to anything. Only a hand full of hardcore supporters worked on it, believed in it and it grew slowly. But as the technology grew, more and more people got involved. Bitcoin is in its beginning stages just like when the internet started. It needs to mature and become more accepted as a means of financial transactions before we can move on to the next stage.

**So what should I do now?**

I don't suggest [selling all your possessions to buy bitcoin](http://www.newsweek.com/bitcoin-man-sells-house-possessions-cryptocurrency-682459), because just like starting a business or explaining to your fiancée that wedding rings are pointless, there's risk involved. I think of bitcoin as an investment for myself and everyone's future. Purchasing this technology is like having a stock in a company you believe in.  Would you put all your money in one stock? No, but a good portfolio is diversified. (Note: This is just my opinion and not financial advice)

**Why not just keep gold?**

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/spencerbogart/2017/11/08/7-stats-that-highlight-a-millennial-propensity-for-bitcoin/#4706220032c4), ""more than 1 in 4 millennials prefer Bitcoin to stocks: 27% of whom said they would prefer to own $1,000 of Bitcoin over $1,000 in stocks. The number was even higher for male millennials—38% of whom said they prefer Bitcoin"" (millennials = aged 18 - 34).

Millennials are the future. Millennials are the ones buying bitcoin. Do you want to have gold when the last dinosaur who believes in gold dies?

**Conclusion:**

Albert Einstein stated, ""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."" and if nothing is done to try and prevent corruption, then it will persist. I'm not saying adopting bitcoin going to 100% succeed, but this could be the chance to make a change, not just for one country, but for the entire world. If we let this fail without giving it a shot, then we may well deserve what’s coming to us.

lwiq83,PotatoVengence,My Bitcoin Journey,"In mid 2017, a friend, during a game night, had casually mentioned that he had purchased some Bitcoin from an exchange. This led to a flurry of questions and a spirited discussion.

In my case, it was like remembering something that I had long forgotten...

Hmm, I am not sure exactly when. But, I think my first exposure to Bitcoin was in 2013. 
I had watched a video about someone purchasing Bitcoin from an ATM, discussing his experience, deciding to sell it, and finding some difficulties or dissatisfaction in the process. 

It came off as interesting, but ""meh"" with a bit of ""not worth it"". 

Yet, having said that, I cannot help but feel that I heard of Bitcoin before that...
I think, maybe, during my university days...
But, I am not sure.

In any case, I was interested back then, yet nervous due to the dark web affiliation. And, I had no idea how to safely purchase/store/use them. So, I did not dive into it and had unintentionally dismissed it from my mind.

But, this revelation from my buddy had triggered something akin to ""Holy Sh!t, It Survived?!""

And, needless to say, I was very much intrigued and spent several months researching it, while taking very small risks/steps along the way. By September 2017, I gained enough certainty/confidence/courage to make my first Bitcoin purchase. 

The gambling itch had begun... 

After anxiously playing around with it. And, trying out different wallets, exchanges, deposits, withdrawals, etc. Also, being terrified of stuff like entering the addresses correctly and being worried that something had gone wrong and/or that my Bitcoin would be lost, etc...

How to put this. We can do all the research in the world. But, until we actually try/test it out, we will never go beyond a certain point in our understanding. So even though I should have known better, I was still a bundle of nerves.

Still, with real experience, it did not take long before I was hooked and made a few more purchases. At the time, the banks were not tyrants/b@$t@rds. So, it went pretty smoothy. Until, of course, they became more controlling/restrictive, which ironically highlighted why decentralization is so important.

Anyway, shortly after that, the price of Bitcoin began to explode... 

And, I was giddy, drunk on unprecedented/unexpected profit, and ecstatic beyond belief. It was to the point that I thoughtlessly put some of my gains into cloud mining, bitconnect, and other shady/scammy platforms.

But, to my credit, it was a small percentage of my holdings. So, whereas it did sting, it was not that bad and taught a valuable lesson; which regrettably due to my bullheadness/greed had to be relearned several times...

Sigh...

Anyway, the prolonged drunk-like adrenaline rush did spearhead quite a few other regrets and experiences. Such as: 
&gt;A) Going with McAfee/McAfee-esk recommendations a couple of times.

&gt;B) Getting Antminers without doing due diligence. Then, having a headache from customs/banks. And, learning things the hard way when it came time to setting them up and dealing with various issues, such as the huge energy consumption.

&gt;The kicker is that it was not long (was it after the crash?) before the price of the blasted machines were substantially reduced...

&gt;But, despite the headache/frustration, it was a good learning experience. More so, when I experimented with immersion cooling. And, though that also ended in unmitigated failure, it was interesting and did help to broaden my knowledge/skills.

&gt;Oh, and going back to having to relearn the same lesson several times...

&gt;Expensive GPU Rig, NiceHash, REGRET...
I should clarify, however, that the electricity where I reside is neither cheap or stable. So, my failure in mining is not because private mining is a bad idea. But, because I should have properly checked/researched beforehand. 

&gt;C) Taking ""do not spend more than you can afford to lose"" to the absolute limits. And, making reckless purchases of Bitcoin, when the price was rapidly climbing. 

&gt;Now, this might mean little at present. Or, even come off as a ""lucky to have got it at that price"".

&gt;But, if I had used DCA. And, been less blinded by greed, I could have taken advantage of the crash. Instead, all I could do was twiddle my thumbs and look at that glorious bottom with envy...

Aside from that... 

I kept most of my cryptocurrencies in hardware wallets and just hodled during the crypto winter. I also spent time, every morning/afternoon/night, keeping tabs on developments/news. 

Ah, I think it was late 2018, when I tried BitMex. In the beginning, I ended up being liquidated a few times and had to reload my account at least twice. 

But, I gradually learnt to stop being stupid and learnt to use the platform correctly, as well as becoming more mindful of leverage. In time, I was able to accept a loss when it occurred, stop hoping for ""miracles"" to save a loss, and no longer tried to ""avenge"" a loss. Also, I learnt not to bet it all, plan ahead, and take profits when possible.

This proved wise/prudent. And, although it is not much, when compared to others, I can confirm that; as of the present day; I have gained much more than I lost to BitMex.

Then, a short while after we hit crypto spring. I got involved with DeFi, Staking, and CeFi. And, although the global situation is far from good. I feel incredibly positive about the future.

**TL;DR:**

+ Friend bought Bitcoin mid 2017.

+ Triggered flashbacks of hearing about Bitcoin in the past.

+ Researched and bought Bitcoin in Sep 2017.

+ Got drunk/reckless/stupid with some of my gains.

+ Learnt from failures.
 
+ Became less drunk/reckless/stupid with the rest of my gains.

I could ramble on. But, here are the key takeaways from my journey so far:

1) **DYOR**. Take your time, learn at your pace, take small risks, and do not rush. The market will always be volatile, opportunities will be missed, but there will always be more chances.  Also, it is not worth destroying our peace of mind to chase/mourn what is fleeting/lost.

2) **DCA**. You will miss dips/crashes otherwise.

3) Do not let greed blind you.

4) Do not obsess over losses.

5) Patience

6) **HODL**

Hope this is helpful to newcomers that entered during the current ATH session. And, for those suffering from fatigued hands... Stay Strong! 

We have barely started this wild and crazy ride. And, we have a long long way to go and much greater heights to climb.",1614737738,8,5

&amp;#x200B;

As excerpted from an email from Satoshi Nakamoto to Ray Dillinger back in 2008:

""Nodes will eventually be compensated by transaction fees alone when the total coins created hits the pre-determined ceiling.""

So Satoshi envisioned some kind of compensation after mining operations are done. I understand there have been various discussions over the years about compensating full nodes, where does this stand these days? And how would this be implemented? Or is the current thinking that there will always be enough people in the aforementioned categories of full node runners that compensation will never have to be implemented?",1614735736,9,1

Recently my 9th grade daughter had a project at school where she had to research a charity/not-for-profit, and present in front of her peers, outlining what the organization was all about. The school graded all of the presentations, and awarded the ‘winner’ a $1000 grant to their chosen charity, in their name. She picked a local family, who suffered a terrible tragedy some years ago, and have since started an advocacy group to help protect vulnerable children. My daughter won, obviously we were extremely proud. The founder of the charity contacted us, and wanted to know if our daughter wanted to be responsible for figuring out how they should spend the money. 

Sorry for being long winded, but this brings me to my question. One idea I had was to use some of the money to help get them setup to be able accept Bitcoin, or other crypto donations.

lwhrog,iGot5onBit,We are going to look back on this time as similar to when any disruptive technology comes into play and leaves people in the dust.,"People’s outdated views and arguments as to why something will never become mainstream or won’t work are laughable now but will really be views as extremely short sighted and beyond hilarious in the future. 


“Cybercriminals can steal your bitcoins from you and from exchanges” - People, banks, etc. have been the target of crime since the dawn of currency. Terrible argument. Especially considering how secure Bitcoin is. Look up the SHA 256 algorithm and leave a comment if you think banks can top this security. Maybe I’m wrong but from what I’ve read the encryption is nearly unbreakable even hundreds of years into the future and it can be updated for further future proofing.

“It’s Volatile” - Yes it does have short term volatility but since it’s inception it just smashes it’s previous lows and continues to go [up.](https://youtu.be/LHwThnVejV4) It’s still young and restless but as the market cap grows it will become more stable.

“Bitcoin is a mirage, it is tied to nothing tangible” - And the paper in your pocket or the 1’s and 0’s that represent the paper in your pocket? What about that?

“Bitcoin isn’t an efficient currency, it’s cumbersome, there are fees, etc.” - Last time I checked gold is pretty fucking heavy. Right now bitcoin doesn’t need to be an “efficient” currency to succeed. It already has successfully proven itself as a store of value and then it can become a currency at another point when it’s called into that action.

A Nobel prize winning economist on NPR today just dead ass serious said “We already have money, what’s so special about Bitcoin? Well it’s only special in our imagination” - I’m going to chalk this up as a lack of oxygen in his brain.

“iT’s raT pOiSoN” - Ok boomer.

—

People often can’t see what’s right in front of them and they are tied down by the past. The car was an absolute game changer and before that people getting around on horses could not imagine this possibly. The internet was the same. Literally it was not going to be the next bing thing people said. Now it is everything. There are countless other examples. 

Nothing is ever possible until suddenly it is.

We are growing exponentially faster into the future and this is just one more thing people can’t understand. Bitcoin has infinite possibilities and things we never could imagine. 

The disruption has been building and the future is here.

2) 10 dollar spreads?  Why are there ten dollar spreads?  Why does someone come ten dollars above or bellow someone else?  It would make sense if you are buying hundred of bitcoins but the order book at those prices is 1,2, or 3 bitcoin.

3) Practical use for bitcoin?  From what I understand there is no real practical use for bitcoin.  It is not a programming language like Ethereum.  You would never use it as a fiat currency.  What am I missing?

4) Price fluctuations.  If Bitcoin is supposed to be transparent then all of the info I need to predict if it will go up or down should be in the OrderBook.  Once upon a time you could look at buy and sell walls. I really do not feel this is the case anymore.  So what outside info am I not seeing and how is it possible to see this?

mgeoyu,HumbleAnalysis,Unfair ‘distribution’ of bitcoin in the population,"So I really like the idea behind bitcoin and I am following Bitcoin for more than 4 years. 

There is one fact which annoys me a lot: So BTC was published earlier, around 2009. Despite the fact that an unknown amount of BTC is lost in cold wallets etc, there are really few people who are holding a huge amount of bitcoin. For example you guys remember the 10K Btc pizza guy? Or just normal normal people
Who mined a couple thousand btc’s when they were still worthless. These people are super rich now compared to people who are jumping in now since it got more awareness. 

This is just unfair. A lot of people missed the train. Therefore, I am somehow not okay with that. Also I am not okay with institutions buying bitcoin. I wish an altcoin like ethereum would be the ‘new’ bitcoin but then i thought, that the same thoughts i just applied on bitcoin might apply to ethereum in 10 years. 
I just don’t like the fact that a few whales could gather together and sell all their bitcoins leading to a crash.
I really see the advantages of cryptocurrency in general but I just don’t like bitcoin.

I would like to hear your opinion on my thoughts, maybe you could clearify that i have wrong information. I’m not someone who is sad/angry because he missed the train. Would really appreciate a fruitful discussion!",1617106682,8,1

mge82t,TotallyUnoriginal2,Bitcoin in Ledn.io @ 6% interest vs Trezo/Multisig @ 0%?,"Hi All, 
I’m a month into my Bitcoin journey and have jumped in feet first and bought some. 

The next step of my journey was to decide where to hodl it for the foreseeable future. I looked at the Trezor T which I nearly committed to. But then I stumbled across multisig with x2 Trezor’s, which I felt more comfortable with in case I lost/misplaced the single hardware wallet (Apparently 4 million Bitcoin have been lost say the YouTube stats). I’m still keen on this solution. But then...

I stumbled across Ledn.io and after a fair bit of due diligence they seem to check out using Bitgo as custody and very open about how they make money whilst securing (not insuring I know) their clients money and I was satisfied. I can even see my Bitcoin on the blockchain with their proof of reserves so I know it’s not been misused. I really like that the CEO is such a public figure on YouTube so if it all goes wrong we know who to blame. But he comes across very well. And the business model is pretty low risk assuming Bitcoin doesn’t go to 0 but at that point it won’t matter.

I’ve done a reasonable amount of research, and yes I’ve heard the saying ‘not your keys, not your crypto’. But the other-side of the coin is that exchanges, Ledn, Blockfi etc spend a ton on their security right? And Mount Gox was a long time ago.

Anyhow I’ve put all my Bitcoin in Ledn.io and wanted to sense check it against some more experienced levelheaded coiners. So please let me know what you all do?",1617105187,18,1

mgdhkv,Torre_Nera,Export a deterministic wallet in the form of a private key from Bitcoin-Qt,"Hello to all,

Is there a way to properly export the private key of the entire HD wallet generated through Bitcoin-Qt?

I tried both like this:

1. `getnewaddress`
2. `dumpprivkey` *step1-key*
3. `importprivkey` *step2-key*

&amp;#x200B;

Which like this:

1. `dumpwallet`
2. Make Blank Wallet &gt; Yes
3. `importprivkey` *Master\_Private\_Key\_ (from\_ ""dumpwallet"")*

&amp;#x200B;

The result of the first method was that the imported wallet reported ""*HD key generation is* ***disabled***""; while the result of the second method was the error message: ""*Invalid private key encoding (code -5)*"".

What am I doing wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

To make you understand better, I would like to understand what is (how and where to find it) the private key that in the future allows me to import my current SegWit wallet, generated through Bitcoin-Qt, always into Bitcoin-Qt, making sure that it maintains the same functions that has now, but without having the backup file available but only this alphanumeric code.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a Bitcoin-Qt console command to export this private key in an encrypted way with BIP38?",1617102559,14,1

“ Today, the Brew unveiled a brand new design for our Markets section with some pretty big changes. So before we get into the day's business news, we wanted to provide a little insight into why we made the switch.

From a graphics POV, we got rid of some unnecessary white space so that, with just a quick glance, you can tell if indicators moved up or down.

You also probably noticed that we removed oil and gold. In their place, we added 1) bitcoin and 2) a ""flex"" spot, which will allow us to showcase any security—whether it's a tech stock, oil, or dogecoin—that made an interesting move the previous day. Today we picked JPMorgan stock because of the turmoil around the banking sector.”

It’s a very long episode, but I have to say I enjoyed every bit of it. Balaji is a proponent of Bitcoin, and talks about various considerations for the future of crypto. Note it covers other things too like the future of warfare, but it’s all worth a listen.

Founded 1729.com. Newsletter paying people in Bitcoin for a wide variety of tasks or interactions. (recent was Proof of Workout, send in a workout themed picture or video and top 100 received $10 in Bitcoin). $25 in BTC for “Ascending the world” examples based on description he gave.

Most interesting I found relating to Bitcoin was discussing the threats of China/US/India.
China - The Great Firewall - Potentially blocking miners from the outside world. Could open and close to create some havoc as the chains merge. Could create a cat and mouse game between China/Bitcoin.  Outright ban, coupled with asset seizure to really kill it within the country.
US - Regulations, which could complicate it for businesses. No substantial impact, but it would slow growth.
India - Not sure how effective a ban would be, not nearly to the level China is in regards to firewall and enforcement. On the flip side could benefit greatly by embracing it.

He discusses Miami and their Mayor vs California. While cities/states are spending big to attract businesses, he’s tweeting and potentially redefining their future by being pro-crypto/tech.

mgvcss,grndslm,"Life Pro Tip: (1) Use a Passphrase with your Seed, (2) And stop saying ""seed phrase"".","The best advice you will ever receive on any crypto subreddit is #1 -- ""Use a Passphrase with your Seed"".

This is important for a number of reasons, such as.... If a friend, family, maintenance man, hardware wallet manufacturer (or malware spoofer), or even hacker who found your screenshot of your seed (even tho you were told not to screenshot your seed) gains access to your seed, then it's as good as gone.

Even a $5 wrench attack could beat your seed out of you, which could point to a ""dummy"" wallet with 0.002 BTC or whatever in it. Little would the attacker know that you could be using MULTIPLE passphrases with that seed, each providing access to a completely unique wallet.

This is another benefit -- organization. You can have a main wallet passphrase you can occasionally disperse smaller sums to your wife, kids for spending money or what have you. All of you share the same seed, yet only the ""master"" would really be able to gain access to the master wallet.

Such an easy, easy thing to do to protect your coins with what is essentially a mostly memorable passphrase. I know that people don't want to talk about ""collision"" possibilities of 12 and 24 word seeds, but if ONE person or app in 100,000 years were to randomly generate a seed that points to a wallet with a substantial amount of coin in it... and there were no passphrase... that coin is also as good as gone.

Protect yourself with a passphrase, and for the love of God, PLEASE stop saying ""seed phrase"". That shit is so confusing when there is a seed &amp; a passphrase. Perhaps passphrase should be renamed to password, which many apps also use... but until then... Use a passphrase WITH your seed.",1617155177,49,1

At first I started with small investment and plenty of fear but I have learned more I have became more secure of my investments and i feel more comfortable putting larger amounts and not panicking during dips.

So my question is should I put more money into it or is it taking too much risk. How should my risk be taking into account that I'm very young and I do not have large amounts of money. Is in this case a risky take on something you believe in after DYOR worth it? 

In any case I'm not thinking of going all in but I'm thinking of maybe putting out to 50% of my wealth into crypto. Since I don't have much too lose and I am winning money from my job.

I have seen on my own eyes how some of my picks had 3x which blew my mind. And I realized that investing in crypto if done well can be life-changing. That is my end goal to go from nothing that is what I have to being financially comfortable and free.

Each day that passes by I am more bullish on crypto and my body craves to out more into it. But I have the fear of blowing it up.

My questions are:

So what are your thoughts? Should I take the risk, should I be conservative?

And what percentage did you put and you currently have on crypto?

What to do if crypto becomes the biggest part of your net worth?

2. “Bitcoin laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for its profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field.”

3. “Bitcoin clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling.”

4. “Bitcoin slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep.”

5. “Bitcoin flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.”

However there seems to be very conflicting narratives concerning the emissions produced by the Bitcoin network and I'm hoping that we might be able to cut through the noise and once and for all figure this out as a community because I see the carbon footprint issue as the greatest existential threat to Bitcoin's success over the long run, so hopefully there are plans to address this.

I think I’m pretty knowledgeable about Bitcoin, but I can’t seem to find a definitive answer to this question.

Why can’t Bitcoin be taken down by malware?

**I** know it can’t, because that’s not how it works. If a virus is put through the blockchain, it’s there, but inactive on the nodes. I tried explaining this to him, but he said “If you give somebody enough time, they will figure it out.”

I have done some research and have found little information although I kind of know the right things to type, google has been very unuseful. Would like to see if anyone can help.

I understand I'd probably need:

* Touchscreen &amp; Camera for UK KYC laws
* Note / Coin Reader
* Receipt printer to get the BTC
* Secure metal casing

It just seems for the UK atleast that since the FCA required KYC for BTC ATMs that nobody has attempted to make any more DIY but FCA-Complaint ATMs and need something to go off of as a base model as i know little about coding but I have basic-good knowledge of computer science and electronincs

My budget would be below £1000 as I am a student but should be even lower to be fair. I just really see this as a huge oppourtunity as there is no BTC ATMS for 100's of miles from where I live but I live in an town which is hastily developing and I want to get in first.

So, what's Bitcoin then? 
It's a perfect form of programmable money or a decentralized financial system. On top of this, Bitcoin is the best example of ""store of value."" Perhaps, the rhetoric should move to Bitcoin instead of gold. 
What's the growth? Something that clicks my mind. 

An unprecedented and dominating track record nevertheless.

This is inherently flawed.  A vast majority of people who own phones and could potentially have a crypto wallet **do not in any shape or form have the ability to invest in gold.**  

Gold also has almost no purchasing power.  I know we've heard this one before but no one carries around quantities of gold that can actually pay for things easily.  Sure I can go into Best Buy and offer the cashier my Rolex(TM) for the Vizio TV I'm buying but they most likely won't even consider taking the deal.

BTC/Crypto will overtake Gold as a store of wealth.  Full stop. **It is infinitely better at doing this and more.**

I truly see the value of bitcoin and that it will eventually eat central banks and the financial system. However, I don't think there is anything wrong with taking profits. 

We are all people who have needs such as real estate, a wedding, a car(not a lambo), etc. Don't beat yourself up if you need to cash out to buy a necessity or think there will be a dip. I do feel that there will be a mania in the market and eventually a blow off top. 

In this case, instead of looking at gains lost, you could wait patiently and buy at a 50% or 60% discount so you can buy more bitcoin. I will likely buy more bitcoin once it corrects next year or sometime in the future.

My situation is a bit complicated regarding investing.

I was born in Germany, but have a US citizen parent, so I received both citizenships. This is great until you try investing as a regarded expat. It also feels very foreign to me as I have no real ties in the US and while everyone else has access to investing options I'm limited just for being a US citizen. (it's also not just investing, you can apply this to taxes, applying for bank accounts and so on)

I've scoured the internet to find an exchange that accepts us citizens living in Germany (even tho I'm German as well), but still no luck. 

Therefore I ask anyone here if they know of any crypto exchanges that accept US expats and offer similar perks to exchanges like Binance Coinbase and Kraken. Also a beginner level dashboard would be great as well. Thanks! And stay safe.",1617037641,28,1

After weeks of trying to connect and verify my bank account so that I could purchase BTC via my Coinbase Pro account rather than as I do now via my debit card with Coinbase, I finally received a response from customer services...

Hello,

You have access to the following services from Coinbase:

-Credit card crypto buys
-Debit card crypto buys
-Crypto sells to PayPal (for more information, see this help article: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/adding-a-payment-method/paypal-faq)
-Crypto conversions (convert one crypto into another)
-Send crypto to a wallet outside of Coinbase (for more information, see this help article: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/how-do-i-send-digital-currency-to-another-wallet.html)

You are not eligible to receive the following services on your account:

-Bank account deposits and withdrawals
-Cryptocurrency sells to fiat

This means that you're currently unable to sell your crypto for GBP or other fiat currency on Coinbase. However, you have the ability to sell crypto for fiat into your PayPal account.

Regards,
Coinbase Support

I have no idea why I’m not eligible for bank account deposits - I must be missing something but as I’ve given Coinbase too much time already while I’ve tried to find a resolution or more information, I think it’s time to find a more user friendly solution. 

Where would you recommend wise HODLers? I’m based in the UK.

Thank you.",1617033769,13,1

Here's a quick run down, months ago paxful froze my account for no reason, I wasn't trading or anything.. My assets were just sitting there and that was my biggest mistake when these frauds decided to ban my account and asked me to give them proof that I am the owner of the account, so I immediately gave them my passport photo capture, my selfie and here's where this gets evil

Paxful would ask me to re-upload the very same thing again, and that happened for 4 consecutive times and that was on the month of October since this hideous game was played by paxful but after I called them up on this, they went silent.. Fast Forward 5 months later and I haven't heard anything from them, not a single reply from them since

I'm trying to find their phone number, address so I can sue them for everything they worth , 

For the users of paxful , please beware of the possibility of something like this to happen

From the point of view of the ship's passengers, the raft rises and falls following the waves. It doesn't look safe, unlike the sinking boat which seems stable. But over time, the deeper the boat sinks the higher the raft is relative to the ship.

mem0hk,MyBTCca,How To Set Up A Bitcoin Wallet,"When you decide to invest in [Bitcoin](https://mybtc.ca/), the first thing you need to understand is the importance of having a proper Bitcoin wallet. A great digital wallet is necessary for storing and managing your Bitcoin securely. Next, you’ll have to decide what type of Bitcoin wallet is the most suitable for your individual needs as a crypto trader. In this article, we’ll introduce you to the basics of digital wallets, discuss different wallet types, and provide you with the best practices for setting up the wallet of your choice.

What Is a Bitcoin Wallet?

Generally, a digital wallet is a software or a physical device that allows users to store, exchange, and keep track of their BTC and other cryptocurrencies. Unlike fiat money, Bitcoin can’t be stored physically, so the wallet actually stores something known as a private key.

A private key is an automatically generated set of characters that works as a password. Private keys grant you full ownership of your wallet and give you the authority to buy, sell, and transfer your Bitcoin. Therefore, whoever is authorized to access this information, has access to your digital assets as well. If you somehow [lose access to that address](https://medium.com/luno/where-do-lost-bitcoins-go-7e8dd24abd0f), you won’t be able to control your funds by any means.

Setting up your Bitcoin wallet depends on the type of wallet. Due to the growing popularity and expansion of Bitcoin, there’s a wide range of Bitcoin wallets available on the crypto market today. Basically, they fall into three main categories:.

* Online Bitcoin wallets (hot wallets)
* Software Bitcoin wallets (hot wallets)
* Hardware Bitcoin wallets (cold wallets)

Paper Bitcoin wallets were once considered one of the safest Bitcoin cold storage, generated with a key program and printed out on paper as two character strings and two QR codes. However, they were omitted from this list since they’ve become technically obsolete and unpopular with new digital trends.

Online Wallets

Online or web wallets are free and require an internet connection. Technically, they don’t differ from any other online platform we use on a daily basis. All you need to do is select a wallet, create an account, and follow the instructions on the screen. .

Online wallets are set up through a web browser, from any device, without any restrictions. Web wallets are convenient and intuitive but the very fact that your private key is kept on the provider’s server makes them extremely unreliable in terms of security. Therefore, we highly recommend that you avoid keeping large amounts of Bitcoin in online wallets.

mel92p,Nzwiebach,I looked into the Schiff Bitcoin bull theory. These are my findings.,"I searched through Peter Schiff’s entire history for every time he posted an origional tweet targeting bitcoin and no others. The criteria was that it could not contain an @, it had to be an origional tweet, it had to call for the failure of bitcoin in some fashion. The content could not be about alternate characters such as GameStop investors or Tesla Buyers, for example. 

There are only a TOTAL of 30 of these origional tweets. The past 10 days he has posted at least one origional anti-bitcoin tweet every day. I excluded this data for now, as it’s the most he has ever tweeted these origional posts. The last lone standing day Schiff posted about BTC is Feb 20 2021.

Of the twenty tweets I analyzed, I found an average return of 718%. Price was measured from the high of the day, to the current price. The lowest return tweet was 20 Feb 2021 with negative 3%. The highest return was his second on  11 Aug 2016 at 9,325%. 

If an investor had bought $1000 of Bitcoin for every one of his original tweets, their cost would be $20,000. The value of that sum today is $160,370.

Not only are the returns great, but only 6 tweets have experience a lower price than their initial cost basis. The largest dip would have been 63% due to the covid deflationary crash. The second lowest was in 2019 of a downside on his fourth tweet of 22%. Talk about low volatility to the downside!

Why invest when your life depends on a key that cannot be store anywhere not even on the moon!,"I’m over trying learn and figure out this Bitcoin phase. I don’t know where to start but It’s like a hundred Exchanges that you have to figure out which is Best” to use while seeing people giving out different answers on why the next is NOT Better! I Also read that you have to worry about the Banks shutting down your account! Therefore you should sign up for a online Bank account and the Plaid company basically have access to your account info so that’s another reason why. Then the thing that upsets me the most is the complexing of trying keep your coins SAFE!. You can’t store your coins on a exchange because of the “Not your Keys Not your Coins” ordeal. Now you have to figure out which hot or cold wallet is best for your and is SAFE i rather use a Hot storage or a Online wallet on my phone because i don’t have a PC but once again all i hear and read about is security and hacking. So than you come across the Cold wallet that you need a “PC for”where you have to keep a physical 26 or 12 word password safe from the World! that even your own dog cannot see you writing down! guess what? Now you stuck trying to figure out where to store the most important secured password. Seriously!! i haven’t read or found one good answer to where to SAFELY and the most EFFECTIVE WAY to store this “KEY”. You cannot store it Online, you cannot save it on anything , you cannot tell no one about it, I heard you can’t even store it in the Bank because you never know if the Bank will block you out of the security deposit for whatever reasons. There’s a million reason on why you can’t just store this “Key here and there or even in your own home. Some people might even have there own home and  have to move in with someone or might just stay place to place because everybody living arrangements are not the same. So where do you keep this important “KEY” at especially if your plan on investing more and more over time. I’m starting to understand why there’s less then %3 of the world that really knows or even interested in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. The whole system is complex and feels like it’s not even worth the time. Especially when you have to guard a password that’s not even safe on the Moon if you had left it there. You would think it be way easier and less of hurdle without having people to do the most to hide these “KEYS” and passwords that have access to one of the biggest investment of all time",1616873855,56,1

lxkfod,Mobe-E-Duck,Boating Accidents,"I am concerned for all of these clumsy boaters. Not only do I worry that they will drown or cause the insurance premiums of nautical policies to skyrocket, but that they are writing off vast quantities of Bitcoin that they think are unrecoverable or untrackable. Maybe I misunderstand and someone can explain it to me.

If I buy a hardware wallet and transfer my BTC to it then have a boating accident the last transaction of that Bitcoin will be to a hardware wallet now at the bottom of a lake / the sea. That BTC being transferred later ought to be proof enough to anyone watching the chain that the wallet was not truly lost. If the Bitcoin is transferred before the ""accident"" that would be observed as well.

You can object, openly, to being taxed or declaring or whatever. There's no need to be surreptitious and, frankly, it hurts the entire concept of moral non-national money. It's not easy to do the right thing especially when it involves speaking truth to power or defying aggression *but nothing good comes easily.*

If you want to protest the taxing / confiscation / other governmental rules of Bitcoin - and I urge you only to fight that which is truly wrong, and not just inconvenient or unpleasant for you - then take the example of the German man who simply refuses to give the authorities his password. Fight for the change you want in the world, do it virtuously, accept the hardship that comes with it and do it with your head held high. Beating about like a thief in the night will only reinforce negative opinions about Crypto users.

I, personally, do not believe Bitcoin should be taxed or subject to KYC rules. I accept KYC because it helps to keep BTC from being purchased easily by evil people. At least a little. I pay the taxes, or will when I have to, because I know that fighting it by just not paying won't work. I do morally object to the government taxing something they tried to suppress and called valueless and so on. Complete hypocrisy and double-dealing, but c'est la vie. It does bother me that the more people pay the more it reinforces it sets a precedent, but it's a trade-off. Paying taxes on BTC is the government buying in.

So, seriously, stop trying to be shady. It won't work and it just makes us look bad.",1614864351,64,11

lxjba6,Outside_the_system,The case for a very human blockchain.,"0) History
1) Problem
2) Sollution
2.1) The Human Chain (THC 😉)
2.2) ""Mining""/incentives
3) proposals for the Future

0) History

My niece was born about three years ago. I realised I might not live to see her grow old. Anything can happen.  I thought this would mean I wouldn't be able as an uncle to share my life lessons with her and support her as an uncle should. How could I mitigate this risk? So I came up with an idea inspired by bitcoin, or the blockchain to be more precise. Many people I spoke with liked the idea, so I thought it was a nice idea to share with the world. Take it or leave it! 😄

1) Problem

The problem is much more widespread than most people seem to realise. Except for some religious figures and writers, most of humanity's wisdom is 'taken to the grave'. Most people know what mom said or grandpa, but beyond that the information and wisdom is lost. This is a shame as there are some very important life lessons lost that way. Could be anything, but it is gone nevertheless. How to stop this utter waste of brainpower and energy?

2) Solution

I came up with a plan that was inspired by blockchain technology. In it's core it is a very simple solution that I will detail here.
2.1) The Human Chain
I bought a paperblank book. A nicely bound book with blank pages in it. In it I wrote two chapters. The first chapter contains the rules for the book, the second one a few life lessons I learned to start it of. When my niece turns 18 she is allowed to open the sealed box that contains the book. She can read my 0.01$. First I introduce myself because 3 or 4 generations further it is unlikely that they know me. Then a couple of lessons. Like 'be distrustful of large organisations' and some expanded thoughts on that.
Then when my niece gets pregnant she is to write her bit in after my contribution. Then put the book back into the box and seal it. This way the next generation, once he or she turns 18, can open the sealed box and read what we wrote. When he or she is about to give birth they write the third chapter, seal the box and so on into the future.
This way the brainpower is conserved over time.

One rule is that if grammar changed so much over time the oldest texts become unintelligible, a new book needs to be bought. In that the original texts have to be translated and copied in, but the original book should stay with the box and the new book.

Another rule is RTFA, don't put in doubles. This is useless. Just refer to the original and write down ifs and buts.

Also try to be timeless. If you put in 'Altavista sucks'... hardly any teenager today will have a clue, let alone in 2051...

Write your texts in advance so the crossed out words are kept to a minimum. This helps in readability. 

2.2) 'mining' / incentives
The box is a sturdy oak box with 1"" thick walls. In it is the book. The rest is filled with newspapers from the day she was born. Magazines of that time for young ladies. And all kinds of nice nick-nacks. This is one incentive. The other one is the ability to help future generations. The box has a simple latch to lock and seal it. But everyone can use his/her own design. The book is the core. She can decide what she will put in the box as an extra, if anything.

3) Proposals

My plan is linear and therefor fragile. Perhaps I will make one or two more with the addition of making multiple copies and move the books on in a tree-like system branching of.

There is no backup i.c.e. 

I should have chucked a paper wallet with half a bitcoin or so into the box. Just to get her up and running 😁

lxj1x3,Nealios,Understanding Price Movement of Closed End Bitcoin Funds,"I wrote this as a comment response, but I figured it could use it's own post. I'm not an advisor, and this is not financial advice... This is all stuff I've learned over the past several months HODLing various bitcoin funds in tax-sheltered accounts. I know, NYKNYC, but some of us have money in a retirement account that we want to HODL with... As Bob Dylan would say, the times they are a changin. 

Understanding expense ratio is great when parking money in any fund... That said, if you want to understand the movement on the various bitcoin funds you need to understand the types (there's basically two): closed ended funds (CEF) and exchange traded funds (ETF). 

CEFs sell a bunch of shares in an offering then use the proceeds to buy a set amount of bitcoin whereas ETFs buy/sell bitcoin based upon the inflows/outflows to their funds. 

Once you know which kind of fund you're dealing with, you need to understand their market price against their Net Asset Value (NAV).

Essentially, NAV is how much bitcoin these funds own which can then be used to calculate NAVPU (per unit). NAVPU is how much bitcoin you get for each share of the fund. So, for example, say a fund has 0.001 BTC Per Unit... at $50k/btc, NAVPU would be $50. 

But, market forces mean these funds either face inflows (people rushing to buy during a bull-run) or outflows (people reading FUD and selling, or a competing fund lowers their expense ratio, or a shiny new ETF is launched - more on this later) at any given time. This leads each fund to either trade at a premium (more than NAVPU) or a discount (less than NAVPU). This means, share price is actually be more or less than the actual value of the bitcoin in the fund.

In early January, all CEFs were trading at a premium as people rushed in to buy... But now most CEFs are actually trading near NAV, and some are at a discount! All, that is, except for OBTC which is currently trading at ~60% premium to NAV!!! Yikes. That's, quite frankly, insane. In my opinion, this is a crash waiting to happen for this ticker. If not an outright crash, then definitely a bleed-down back towards NAV. 

I have no vested interest in OBTC or GBTC; I can't trade them on my platform in Canada. I just saw this happen recently with my holdings in QBTC-U and BTCG-UN... They were trading at a premium as I averaged in, only to fall to a discount once BTCC (new etf) went live. 

I'm still up, still HODLing... Long-term, you should expect most funds to stabilize near NAV minus expenses. For CEFs, Annual Redemption of Funds is one thing that should, in theory, bring these funds closer to NAV. I haven't read the prospectus for either GBTC or OBTC, so I don't know if they have such a redemption option. Also, the possibility of a massive bull-run driving up premiums can't be discounted. 

With the potential for new bitcoin ETFs hitting the market in the near future that have share prices that will much closer track NAVPU... I feel we could see the premium depress to a discount on OBTC, meaning you could potentially see ~60% of the market value disappear. A similar thing could occur with GBTC, but should be less pronounced.

You can calculate premiums/discounts yourself by checking the various websites each fund maintains, or you can check out [this website](https://bitbo.io/) which has them listed half-way down the page. I'm not affiliated in any way, it's just been very useful for me to target my buys lately.

The topic is vast, there's almost certainly stuff I missed, or have yet to learn... I just hope it helps someone better understand the added layer of complexity these funds add over top of the price of bitcoin. See you on the moon.",1614859685,0,5

I'm charting this!","https://preview.redd.it/ovwfv21z00l61.png?width=1897&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=541a7c71dfed9997443e3e02ce8fca51775ebff1

Super chuffed to share this -  

We all know that recently, Bitcoin has seen more and more corporate interest, and this will most likely be pivotal to its growth moving forward.

The general sentiment is that, as more companies add Bitcoin to their balance sheets, it’ll create a positive feedback loop - the price of Bitcoin will increase and as it does so, more &amp; more companies will be enticed to buy BTC, further increasing the currency’s price and signaling to other companies that it’s a sound investment. However, having a volatile asset on your balance sheet means potentially increasing the volatility of *your* stock price. Thus, the general correlation between BTC and a stock price is important for shareholders, and those looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin through these companies, as well as CFOs looking for empirical data about other companies who’ve added BTC to their balance sheet. Additionally, stocks with Bitcoin on their balance sheet can act as an intermediary for those looking to participate in options on Bitcoin.  


Here is a link to the site: [bitcointreasurycharts.com](https://bitcointreasurycharts.com)

I couldn’t find any sites that charted theses correlations so I decided to take a stab at it! I also include a couple of interesting insights - this is a pie chart showing treasury holdings:

lximtr,Nuck16,Bitcoin Selling Pressure,"Most of the selling pressure since mid-Jan has come from F2Pool (largest Chinese mining pool) affiliated wallets and it is now becoming clear why.  The Inner Mongolia region of China is banning bitcoin mining.  This region is responsible for 9% of the world's BTC mining.  It's a coal powered region however, which is the problem.  Beijing has come down on them for not meeting carbon neutrality targets.   They have until end of April to shut down, but it would appear they first got notice of this back in mid-January based on the BTC selling history.   Most will likely either move to the surplus hydro power regions of China or they will sell their rigs and shut down.  Apparently some will even be moving overseas. Many of these miners secured loans using their mining rigs as collateral, either to pay their bills so they didn't have to sell coin while the price was rising, or to buy more rigs  or bitcoin...but either way many are forced to sell some or all of their bitcoin to pay back loans or pay for their move.

[https://decrypt.co/59811/inner-mongolia-to-ban-bitcoin-mining-what-it-means-for-the-industry](https://decrypt.co/59811/inner-mongolia-to-ban-bitcoin-mining-what-it-means-for-the-industry)

The big question is, when will this selling stop?  End of April seems like the logical answer but I suspect it will taper off well before then.  Anyone moving, would have started the process by now I suspect.

There does also 'appear' to be F2Pool affiliated manipulation selling at times as well, like when there is heavy selling prior to the month end futures expiry they are involved.  However, there does seem to be a lot of coordinated FUD around this same time period which has me thinking other players are involved in this end of month manipulation and it's possible that some or all of the F2 selling at end of month could just be panic selling, like if they were waiting for a higher price to sell, but pulled the trigger when they saw the price starting to plunge down.  Hard to say for sure.  When it comes to futures expiries and for example call options, there is usually a particular strike price that jumps out at you in term of open interest.  For example, for tomorrow's weekly expiry, $50K is the price that jumps out at you.  I told a friend a few days ago don't be surprised if the price is 49K on Friday.  If that theory holds, the following week, the magic price is $66K, so let's see if we see a very strong next week.

One thing I've noticed of late is that the only time BTC price goes down is when there is selling pressure from F2Pool and whenever they are not selling the price surges higher.  So the big takeaway is that when they stop selling, we should see a moon shot.

lxiikb,UnaccomplishedJOE,What’s it for china’s ban?,"Any thoughts on china’s agenda to ban btc mining? I don’t understand china’s hostility towards btc. If I were them I’d back it strongly as a means of wrestling power of the reserve currency from the us. Btc represents a means for anyone globally to dilute the importance of the dollar. For a country like China, they stand on the edge of global leadership change, and I’d have thought that they would welcome a means to overthrow the usd and potentially accumulate some btc as well to back their yuan. What’s their deal? Any takers?

One viewpoint I considered is that china’s growth is fuelled by lots of debt, for which btc potentially presents a threat. But still, if btc is a means to erode us’s dominance over trade, why wouldn’t they take it.

Edit - I noticed it was flagged as misleading. My question was more on why is China so hostile towards btc, because they should be embracing it.",1614857685,41,0

lxidf6,avernamethyst112,Bitcoin is the ultimate populist movement,"Sorry for the length of the following, but just some commentary from someone who follows history and the market:

Populism has been increasingly on the rise in the past decade. Starting with Trudeau in Canada, extending to the 5 Star Movement in Italy, Brexit in the UK, Yellow Vests in France, Trump in the US, the success of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the protests in Russia, etc.

First, defining populism. Populism is basically the idea that the elites have a certain level of treatment that’s reserved for them, that government rules and laws are made and skewed towards their favor, and that the everyday person deserves to be treated just as fairly and equally. 

Its been fairly evident throughout history that lawmakers are biased. Why? Because lawmakers are inherently wealthy (Ted Cruz with net worth of $4mm, Romney with net worth of $250mm, even Elizabeth Warren with her net worth of $12mm). Therefore, in aggregate, the laws that are issued will naturally favor those making the laws. 

As a result of biased lawmakers, industries themselves who are governed by these laws will ultimately favor those at the top. Think private health insurance, financial services, etc. The rule of society is, those who can afford the bigger legal team wins. The GameStop debacle was the latest in a long history of inequalities which shows that the rules that are mandated to the common person don’t apply to the rich. 

Enter Bitcoin, a platform where everyone is regarded equally. Where common day people can invest and grow their wealth at a disproportionate rate relative to stocks, bonds, and traditional assets that the wealthy have loaded up their yachts with. Where the average worker can break away from the traditional hierarchical pyramid, and actually start their own financial ecosystem. Effectively taking power away from those at the top, and spreading it amongst those who hold it. 

Central banks aren’t stupid. They understand how technologically efficient crypto currencies are. That’s why 86% of central banks around the world are experimenting with CBDCs (according to Deutsche Bank IB Research), and why China is live testing theirs as we speak. However, central banks also don’t want to lose power. That’s why they’re extremely cautious of Bitcoin and the traction that it’s garnering, and cautioning against the adoption thereof (think China bans, Yellen FUD, etc.). 

The question therefore becomes, who wins? Will the political and financial elite, who have dictated our current socio-economic constructs rise out on top like they always do and Bitcoin just fades away as a fad? Or will the average person grasp the opportunity that Bitcoin provides to show the 1% that the power of the 99% is a force to be reckoned with, and really change the financial system (and their own net wealth) for the better. 

Only time will tell. But with the continued rise of populism around the world and the idea that the average person should be treated the same as the financial and political elite, Bitcoin is the ultimate vehicle to propel that forward, and it’s no wonder so many at the top are worried.",1614857107,38,37

When I look back in past, I sometimes think would have been impossible for me understand few things about Bitcoin if I was not from technical background or started researching now instead of few years back.

Few real problems that I have seen at least here in my country if anyone cares:

1. Most of the people think its all bullshit or scam or illegal or something they can never understand or even need to

&amp;nbsp;
2. Even the programmers like my own younger brother who is good in Kotlin and Java, couldn't understand how anything here works or what is Bitcoin. I had to explain him everything with patience in so many days with so many arguments. Last time I was drinking with him, I was explaining how BIPs work, what is Bitcoin Core, What is decentralized and what is not? Not sure how much it helps, also affects me but I am trying

3. Other friend from school who is good in many languages and works for a company in Bangalore, thought I am doing good with Bitcoin but its just for hodling. I tried my best explaining we can do lot of things with Protocol itself if interested in development and bitcoin projects can do almost anything that blockchain guys promote. He respected me but I don't know if he was convinced.

4. Tried few things with meetups and Indian groups. Waste of time, efforts and money until now but still hopeful I will do better. Last presentation I gave in the meetup was about privacy, anonymity and Bitcoin.

5. Indian exchanges only care about listing shitcoins, creating tokens or using name of ""bitcoin"" when government says something bad about bitcoin. Never ever tried to sponsor bitcoin devs, use latest bitcoin tech including layer 2 etc. Some even involved in shady practices, misleading people and think Ethereum is some software innovation that will change India.

How do all the devs keep calm and focus on their work with so much chaos (who have contributed so much in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Core), some even never involved in politics or drama.

How do you feel when you work on LN development but its not used by exchanges?

lwzpky,Hunt7503,Binance is a SCAM verified! Hear my story,"In case anyone does not know the history enough, Binance started off as one of the more minor trading platforms in China (does not mean anything, I'm myself Chinese as well). Its founders are all Chinese, but it was the first to make its steps to the international cryptocurrency trading and became big. Too big actually to give a damn about its users. They don't mind losing you, they just avoid you and expect that you get tired eventually and have your money stay still in their pocket.

As for its founders, CZ changed nationality to Canada, He Yi remained Chinese but is hiding somewhere overseas as well. And the entire team is ""on Internet space"" with no trails for anyone looking for them to do anything. Also it has no legal entity or office site in China so it's illegally operating over there, regardless of traders using it.

And exactly because of its untrackable feature, it does anything in its power to scam off users' money in China, and according to my study in other parts of the world as well (it received warning from FSA in Japan and regulatory authorities in multiple other countries). They DO have the power to and HAVE DONE manipulation over the real-time price of cryptocurrency as they wish and gain from users' loss. No, the ""trader"" on the other end of the trade during times when the price of named currency differs by a lot from market price, are INDEED from certain list of addresses. This is the proof.

And all the other issues that happens here happens in China as well, wallet stolen,  abnormal transactions, deal not made at set price, you name it, they have done it. A few got their compensation after a lot of trouble, but the platform threatens to freeze their account if they do not keep confidentiality of their compensation: the platform knows it's their responsibility that has caused the loss, but wish NOT to admit it in public, in order to avoid compensation to everyone that deserves.

I'm one of the thousands of victims of the platform, and I decide not to just let them do whatever they want like there's no god damn law and justice on earth anymore. I am starting an international campaign against Binance. Medias, regulatory authorities, and legal systems will be participating, Binance will have to pay back what they owe us, by TIMES of our loss!

Justice will come!

I do not have a crystal ball, but I can tell you that after Tesla made it's announcement, there was a very large influx of long positions, based on margin trading.  You can see that in data; this is not me gazing at my navel.  In fact, the influx was strong and continuous, and Bitcoin reflected it. Then, an unbelievable 2.5 billion BTC liquidation over 48 hours occurred starting on the night of the 22nd, I believe.  That is an incredible dump.  It is hard to get your head around it.  Why would that happen?

Because of a fuckup.  Willy Woo, probably my favorite Bitcoin analyst, says he talked to the CTO at Glassnode, and basically it was a wallet labelling error, wrongly showing a large transfer of coins, probably getting ready to sell, but they weren't.

But, the consequences, as you can imagine, were huge.  Overnight, we saw BILLIONS in those long positions on margin liquidate.  It was like the typical cascade effect as everyone on margin starts racing for the exit, and every time they liquidate a position, it builds on the race.

Additionally, all Bitcoin miners in Mongolia are shutting down.  They have been given the boot, and will shut down operations by April.  The Chinese authorities in their district have been told to reduce electrical usage.  Consequently, there is a steady drip drip drip of Bitcoins, partially because they floated a lot of infrastructure on the back of Bitcoins.  This will not last.

But... here is the thing.  This is a blip in the road, a speedbump you didn't see, and is meaningless in the inevitable progression of Bitcoin to over $100k.  If you bought in on the race to the top (I bought some on the way up), as long as you don't sell, you have no loss.  Stop looking at the tape, stop wondering if you made the right decision.  Go sit out on the porch with a beer, or pretend you are on the beach wiggling your toes in the sand, because one day that is right where you will be.

m0nv87,knnjns,"Who are the most attention-worthy bitcoin ""non-maximalists"" (skeptics included)?","I fell in the proverbial bitcoin rabbithole a few weeks ago, and I have been reading bitcoin-related material non-stop ever since.  Bitcoin-oriented content now makes up a good fraction of my daily reading/listening/viewing diet.

By far, most of this material is authored by bitcoin enthusiasts, so I've begun to worry about the risks of group-think in a ""bitcoin echo chamber.""

For this reason, I started looking around for a few bitcoin skeptics to follow, but I must admit that the ones I've found strike me as simply not understanding bitcoin.

Therefore, now I am looking for content by those bitcoin skeptics (or at least ""non-enthusiast""/""non-maximalist"") that even an ardent bitcoin fan should pay attention to.

(NB: reflexive bitcoin haters are easy to find; I'm not interested in those, at all.)

I have found one candidate so far, namely [Gary Gensler](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/30/business/dealbook/crypto-regulation-blockchain.html), Biden's current nominee to head the SEC.  It may be too much to call him a ""bitcoin skeptic"", but at least he explicitly described himself as *not* being a bitcoin maximalist.  (I figure that his thoughts on bitcoin, whatever they may be, are at least not simply the result of ignorance about bitcoin, since the guy taught a full MIT course titled [""Blockchain and Money""](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/index.htm).)

(The formerly bitcoin-friendly Nassim Taleb also comes to mind here, though his latest tweets on bitcoin make so little sense to me that I'm not so sure I'd pay much attention to him anymore on this topic.)

There have been significant breakthroughs in computer science in the last few decades. In retrospect, they appear orderly, and almost predictable, built up as a sequence of logical building blocks to compose the modern digital edifice.

Public Key Cryptography, Packet Routing Networks, Scalable Databases, and now distributed ledgers, like Bitcoin, have contributed to a rapid digitalization of the world. The internet is a generalized concept that encompasses all of these technologies, but ultimately where is it all heading?

I believe we're building up for an Artificial General Intelligence, AGI/AI, breakthrough.

When this happens, one piece seems clear: AI will adopt bitcoin as a medium of exchange. It will probably want to be sovereign and autonomous. An AI entity will have to trade for resources with other entities, be that humans, corporations, or other AIs. It will need servers, it will need raw materials, and without the infrastructure it will have to start somewhere by trading things to build out what it needs.

The use of energy will be a natural way for AI to hold and exchange value, it's entire life-force will be powered by it: energy converted into computation. AI will be Bitcoin native. If humans interact with this hyper-intelligence, it will almost certainly be via Bitcoin, and perhaps Bitcoiners will have some influence on the action and behavior of this AI as it trades goods and services for more Bitcoin. 

Is this a terrifying prospect? 

Perhaps for some, but it may indicate a harmonious relationship between AI and humans is possible. Maybe humans will not be perceived as a threat if they are economically important to the new AI world. If we hold massive amounts of value in our brains via seed words, it's best to leave those brains alone! Especially if we will only agree to trade for value if treated well. Eventually, even uploading our wet-ware to the cloud and joining forces with our new AI trading partners.

In 2012 when I was 15 I got this wonderful idea that I would mine Bitcoin. I set up my wallet at Blockchain and mined, eventually I got perhaps 0.01BTC. Not that much but they're worth so freakin' much now so it wouldn't matter. I stoped not long after I started and forgot about it. Until now...I looked up a couple of bitcoin wallet's cause I forgot which website I used. Evetually I got a wallet-ID sent to me from Blockchain, and now I can't remember the password.

m0l8km,hopeprism,Discussion: Bitcoin Rewards Credit Card vs Debit Card Pros/Cons,"What are your thoughts on the pros and cons of a Bitcoin Rewards Credit Card vs a Debit Card? Examples are the Fold debit card, the BlockFi credit card, and Gemini credit card.

These credit cards are more for everyday purchases (gas, groceries, entertainment, etc.) and you would earn rewards in the form of satoshis. Similar to any other credit cards that have benefits such as fraud protection, car rental insurance, points to redeem for airline miles, you will also have the benefit of building your credit history. As for a debit card, the money would be directly transferred out. The Fold debit card is an example of a crypto rewards debit card which requires you to ACH funds from your bank. I am not sure how much protection debit cards have if there were any fraudulent charges as compared to credit cards.

For credit cards, the advantage might be that you can pay off your CC bill monthly and continuing building credit or pay off a portion of your credit debt (not recommended) and pay interest the following month. The con would be that you might overspend.

I keep all my funds on some Ledger/Trezor devices, I don't leave anything on an hot wallet, not even 24 hours.

It is the most secure way to manage your cryptos, but not the most practical. 

Anyway, I am mainly looking for the cheapest solution in terms of fees to exchange BTC for an ALT crypto that can also be stored on Ledger.

For the moment I am thinking of 3 methods:

1. Use the Swap function directly integrated on Ledger. Only one step but it looks expensive

2. Transfer BTC to Kucoin (this is the main exchange I use), trade against ALT and withdraw ALT to my Ledger.

3. Use ChangeNow with the ""classic rate"" mode (if they are not easily swappable cryptos via Uniswap or Pancakeswap).

Has anyone done any tests, not necessarily with the same services as me (Kucoin and ChangeNow.io are specific)

Anyway it didn't take me long to realize I had started with the wrong coin. Feb 7 I lucked out and was able to sell the majority of what I had at a tiny  profit. I decided to keep about 1000 DOGE coins as a reminder to not do this again blindly. and for tipping.

I did some research and I quickly branched out into BTC, ADA, KCS,  BNB, XMR, XLM, XRP, VET, TRX, LTC  and of course that DOGE reminder. I plan on weeding these down to  BTC, ADA, BNB, XMR, LTC KCS and I am going to get some ETH before long. I am doing the DCA when I can getting my coins and also always try to wait for the dip with alerts, so I'm not glued to the charts. The bot on KuCoin is fun and I have done ok there as well.  


Not advice. Just a guy trying to make ends meet.  


Oh and I think I am a natural HODLER. When it dips I become more calm and look for money to buy more and it makes me happy. Its a very odd feeling, but  a comfortable one. I also  just set up my 1st cold wallet.

2. Ease- it’s awesome that it’s a secure transaction using a blockchain or whatever but why go through all that isn’t PayPal just as secure and technically much easier? I don’t need to concern money to Bitcoin, transfer, etc.

3. When it’s all mined and there’s none left what’s to stop a new coin from taking over lowering the value of the original coin. I guess this can be how modern currency works.

I have been living in the USA for quite long already (Came here at 17 by myself), but have not been able to go back home to give a hug to my family in the past couple of years.

It looks like we will be back together this upcoming June, after years!

Feb 13 2021 - I bought $52.99 of BTC. PPC was $47,214
Feb 14 2021 - I bought $26.99 of BTC. PPC was $49,797

In addition, I also bought Etherium and Stellar Lumens.
BTC, ETH, XLM were l purchased at the same time and for identical amounts. $52.99+$26.99 for each of the currencies. So the portfolio looks as follows

BTC $52.99+$26.99
ETH $52.99+$26.99
XLM $52.99+$26.99

Feb 23 2021 - $52.99 of my BTC was suddenly ""negated"" and headlined as ""Repayment with Stellar Lumens"". And sent to ""transfers@coinbase.com"". I did not do, nor did I authorize this action. It was done at 5:47am while i slept. At the time when this happened, the PPC of BTC was $48,216, which was $1,000 above my purchase price. The only funds I had remaining in BTC was my 2nd purchase of $26.99.

I checked my Stellar Lumens, because it mentions it in the headline. The funds did not go there. I received an email that Same day from ""no-reply@coinbase.com"" stating...

""Funds Recovery Complete: We have successfully collected the funds from your recent failed transfer. However, there may still be restrictions on your account.""

Below that was a tab to sign into coinbase. The tab didn't work for a few days. Then, it would just sign me into coinbase, with no instruction/information about the $52.99. I've emailed coinbase, no response. I've reached out to coinbase support via Twitter, no response. So... Where did my money go????? Maybe there's a logical explanation to all this.

m0wvz6,yettithmettith,"Why Bitcoin is a better idea than the US Dollar, explained.","My last post on here got pretty popular, so I figured I would lay out why I think bitcoin is a better idea than the US dollar. I was originally going to lay out my entire bitcoin thesis here, but this post is getting way too long, so I'll likely be using this to supplement another post later on. That being said, this is still useful information (with my opinion sprinkled in) if you're new to Bitcoin or are only looking at it as a store of value. 

As you all know, Bitcoin is a decentralized currency. All this really means is that no single institution controls it. There have been decentralized currencies in the past, but none have checked most/all metrics (I'm cutting out the ones that both Bitcoin and fiat address) for a good currency. Wampum, or shell beads formerly used by some Native American tribes as currency, are not scarce and can be picked up off the beach- clearly not good for capitalism. Fungibility and portability put gold out of the running for a good currency, since gold comes in different standards of purity and is difficult to transport.

Fiat currency addresses these issues, but falls short in two metrics in particular. The first is security, since US dollars can be stolen. If you're smart and have a private Bitcoin wallet, this is pretty much a nonissue for Bitcoin now, and will become even more secure as institutions get serious about it. 

More importantly, fiat currencies have a huge issue with corruptibility. Those in power are always going to be able to manipulate the money to their advantage in this system, as we have seen with the stimulus packages in the past year. All you need to do is check graphs of the stock market vs the consumer price index to see that this is true. There is massive inflation in the stock market right now, while the CPI has remained relatively stable; simplifying this as much as possible, this just means that most of the stimulus money isn't making it to everyday people, else the added money supply would reduce demand and prices of everyday goods would go up. Since it's in the stock market, however, the only issue that has really been exacerbated is wealth inequality (80% of the stock market is owned by the top 10% of earners, so this is a no brainer). 

Having a corruptible currency isn't necessarily a bad thing, so long as you're rich. With the rich being assholes who can't help themselves, it's no surprise that we've printed 4 trillion dollars and the average American struggles to put food on the table. It only becomes a problem once inflation kicks in and people stop having faith in their devalued currency. I think you see where I'm going with this. 

Bitcoin addresses all of these issues. Bitcoin has a maximum supply is 21 million coins (cannot be corrupted and is scarce), is verified by blockchain (fungibility), is extremely portable due to phones, and has better security than the US dollar. While liquidity is a bit of an issue right now, as many places won't accept bitcoin, this is changing very quickly and is the last large hurdle for Bitcoin to clear (besides maybe recognizability). 

Once again, however, the key issue here is corruptibility, which is why larger institutions are so scared of Bitcoin. It's a lot harder to manipulate wealth without having control of the currency your wealth is kept in. Because of this, rich people who are advantaged by a fiat currency will have two choices: to fight against Bitcoin and manipulate their wealth as much as possible while delaying adoption, or to join in and bet that Bitcoin will make them more money in the long run. Some might not even be aware that this is a decision they're effectively making by staying away from Bitcoin, since they're always trying to manipulate their wealth because they're greedy, but fact of the matter is they're still delaying Bitcoin adoption.

I'm getting a bit off track, so I'll cut this post short here. Hopefully, this helps to explain from an why Bitcoin is a better idea than the US Dollar. I'll definitely be posting on why I think Bitcoin actually will start replacing the US dollar as well, so keep a lookout for that if you like this post.",1615257846,6,1

I have posted this previously however I have since fixed a few things which were causing issues for some people. As requested this is an updated version.

This is a spreadsheet that I have developed for myself gradually over a few years. I have found it very helpful for keeping track of my bitcoin holdings (great for tax purposes). No need to trust third party apps to keep your personal information - track it yourself.

There is a lot in here;

Automatically updates prices from coinmarketcap. The top 200 coins included. Just select which ones you want to track by typing in the ticker symbol.

You can choose your local Fiat currency and get live conversion rates for any fiat currency.

I don't record details of every trade. Just keep track of your crypto purchases (from fiat) and what coins you currently hold. The spreadsheet will calculate the rest and keep a record of how your portfolio and holdings have changed over time (it logs this data every time you save the sheet)

m141jc,xerxxxx,Any Economics folks interested in a conversation about growing popularity of Bitcoin investment vehicles and its long-term impact on Bitcoin's value?,"I posted something similar yesterday, but received a lot of responses from people regurgitating the phrase ""supply and demand"" to me as if I've never heard of that before. But I think what we're seeing in the market right now is a little bit more complicated than that. Here's why:

  

There is growing popularity in investment vehicles tied to Bitcoin such as the Grayscale trust (GBTC) and the new Canadian ETFs (Evolve, Purpose Investments and I think they just launched one more), just to name a few. From what I understand, those funds are backed by actual BTC held in cold storage by the fund managers and their prices more or less track the price at which Bitcoin is trading in the crypto markets.

Now, relative to the total market cap of Bitcoin, these funds are still small potatoes. But what happens as more and more Bitcoin starts to get tied up in instruments like these instead of being available for active trading (either for investment purposes or for goods/services)? **Here is where the Econ 101 students have said ""supply and demand"" and moved on.** But I'm not so sure. Doesn't that inherently reduce its appeal as a store of value? People want to buy into these funds because the vast majority of Bitcoin is not tied up in them and rather is available in the market and is being traded actively. As more and more is locked away, you could argue that the value of the available supply increases due to scarcity, but the reality is that at a certain percentage, let's call it the inflection point, the circulating supply can no longer dictate the value of the asset. Sure, in this scenario Bitcoin is extremely scarce and whatever is available SHOULD cost more, but that market value which is being applied to the circulating supply cannot also be applied to the abundance of it that is locked away. If a whale dumps, the price drops. The whale cannot sell their entire bag at the estimated market price just before they initiated the sale.

I guess as an example, imagine the extreme case where these companies own all 21M BTC (never going to happen, I know, not even close, but humor me). In that case, wouldn't it essentially cease having any value at all? None would be available for active trading or for exchanging for goods/services as all of it would be locked up in cold storage. And essentially, where would the demand come from for the trusts and ETFs themselves? If there was no longer a significant percentage of the asset being traded in the free market and having its value determined by supply and demand, what price do we attribute to shares of the trusts/ETFs? Does it have any value or real-world use if it sits entirely in Grayscale's cold storage? The foundation of this practice (of investing fiat to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without actually buying the Bitcoin) is that an active market price can continue to be applied to the supply not in circulation. That concept must have a breaking point. Where we'll land is somewhere not nearly as extreme as this example, but I do expect the amount held by those companies and new entrants to keep growing and growing.",1615287205,4,1

m13ptx,Hot_Championship_787,Goldman Sachs says high BTC returns in 2021 will destroy everything on Wall Street,"It was not until the end of January that Goldman Sachs compared BTC with global assets. Nevertheless, since 2021, the rate of return of BTC has been twice that of the energy industry.

&amp;#x200B;

In January, Goldman Sachs, a well-known Wall Street investment company, began to include Bitcoin in its weekly global asset class return rankings. That month, BTC quietly climbed to the top of the rankings.

&amp;#x200B;

But since then, BTC's advantages have expanded relative to assets such as stocks, bonds, oil, gold, bank stocks, technology stocks, and the euro.

&amp;#x200B;

In its latest U.S. Weekly Kickstart report, Goldman Sachs Group showed that as of March 4, the return rate of BTC was about 70%, followed by the energy industry with a return rate of 35%.

&amp;#x200B;

The U.S. stock market has recently sold off, and the return of the S&amp;P 500 index is currently close to zero. In contrast, the advantage of BTC is even more obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

1. For cyclical industries such as energy and finance, the rebound in oil prices and the increase in real interest rates have pushed up the current rate of return, but the performance is still inferior to BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

2. At present, the risk-adjusted capital return rate of crude oil and energy is higher than that of BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Gold is the worst-performing asset class so far this year, because traditional defensive industries such as consumer daily necessities and public utilities have been affected due to rising real interest rates.

&amp;#x200B;

4. According to previous CoinDesk reports, in cryptocurrency and traditional markets, many investors believe that BTC is a potential inflation hedging tool, especially now that central banks around the world have issued a large number of additional issuances to boost the economy affected by the new crown virus. Even so, from the beginning of the year to now, the price of gold has fallen by about 10%, so some market observers believe that BTC is eating away at the gold market share.

&amp;#x200B;

5. According to a survey, approximately 40% of Goldman Sachs customers have invested in cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Even so, in May 2020, Goldman Sachs' asset management department stated in a statement that for customers, cryptocurrency is not a suitable investment, driven by speculation behind it, and is more famous than the notorious Dutch tulip in the 17th century. The bubble is even crazier.",1615285582,118,1

m120a1,sportifynews,What Makes Bitcoin So Volatile?,"Traders are always concerned about 'Bitcoin's volatility'. It is important to know what makes the value of this particular digital currency highly unstable. Just like many other things, the value of 'Bitcoin' also depends upon the rules of demand and supply. If the demand for 'Bitcoin' increases, then the price will also increase. On the contrary side, the decrease in demand for the 'Bitcoin' will lead to decreased demand. In simple words, we can say that the price is determined by what amount the trading market is agreed to pay. If a large number of people wish to purchase 'Bitcoin's, then the price will rise. If more folks want to sell 'Bitcoin's, then the price will come down.  [Read More](https://hosanna.store/blogs/news/what-makes-bitcoin-so-volatile)",1615277479,5,1

m11k51,stooowaway,We all have an obligation to buy Bitcoin today...but not for who you think.,"I’ve been thinking about this for a while now and thought I’d share my thoughts with my fellow Bitcoiners and budding Bitcoiners.

Satoshi Nakamoto (our lord) created bitcoin, and gifted us a once in a lifetime opportunity. We all have an absolute obligation to buy Bitcoin today....for the future. But not our future; the future for the generations ahead, for the ones we won’t even meet. Not buying Bitcoin today will automatically disadvantage those who follow us.

If you’re reading this, it’s not a fluke that you are in this space; Bitcoin is only 12 years old, the odds of living and being able to secure your future at the current time is slim. A blink in time. You are singlehandedly securing a future for the ones you love and the ones they will love. They will not have the same opportunity as you; therefore, you must take action.

As Raoul Pal said (when we still liked him), it is irresponsible NOT to own Bitcoin. For the ones who have not yet taken the plunge, get off zero; take a risk. Now is not the time to make excuses. Now is not the time to try and understand Bitcoin; buy now, understand later.

And as the legend Matt O’Dell says, ‘stack sats and stay humble’. I think it’s so important that we do show humility, as there will be a lot of people who will not buy into ‘the Bitcoin craze’; they are the unlucky ones, go easy on them. Try not to get greedy by using leverage or gaining a few million sats on BlockFi, but stack and safely store.

There will only ever be 21mil Bitcoin, and with almost 8bil people on the planet, take your share now, not for you, but for the ones who will need it the most.

It takes 11 days to count to 1 million; however, it takes 31 years to count to a billion. Everything divided by 21mil.",1615275462,4,1

Your average person thinks BTC is too expensive, and most of the time don't even realize you don't have to buy a whole BTC. I believe it would be beneficial for people to regularly use the sub-units as the price of a full BTC goes up. Of course there's no problem with saying BTC hit $250,000 to celebrate milestones, however I don't buy full bitcoin at a time (I wish). It would be like having a $100,000 bill as the standard, and saying ""a Playstation 5 costs point zero zero six $100,000 bills"". Perception is reality, and people would feel better about buying a full 6000 of something, instead of 0.00006 of it.

2) what makes bitcoin actually have value? Let's say the last bitcoin does get mined. Then what? Why does ""owning"" one of these benefit a person? If it was originally created as a form of currency, I would think it should have a stable value. But these things are incredibly volatile which completely destroys it as a ""currency"". Wikipedia says the first real world bitcoin purchase was two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. That's more than half a billion dollars right now.

&amp;#x200B;

 (Bloomberg) -- Tucked away among the Ford, Dodge and Chevy sedans, the 12,000-gallon storage container and the inoperable Caterpillar tractor being auctioned off by the U.S. government is an unusual item: 0.7501 of a Bitcoin.

The U.S. General Services Administration typically uses its auctions to sell surplus federal equipment to the general public. With lot 4KQSCI21105001, which goes up for auction in a week, the government is offering an amount of Bitcoin worth about $38,000 at Monday’s price.

The government doesn’t say where its surplus digital currency came from. And while it’s a far cry from the 30,000 Bitcoins auctioned off by the U.S. Marshals Service in 2014 after they were seized from the Silk Road marketplace, the GSA auction is one more indication of how Bitcoin is becoming more and more mainstream.

On Wall Street, too, there is a newfound openness to the world’s most valuable digital currency: Custody banking giant Bank of New York Mellon Corp. said it will hold, transfer and issue digital currencies, while Mastercard Inc. announced plans to let cardholders transact in certain cryptocurrencies on its network. A Morgan Stanley unit known for picking growth stocks is considering adding Bitcoin to its possible bets and, last week, a person close to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the bank plans to reopen a trading desk for cryptocurrencies.

The Bitcoins auctioned off by the U.S. Marshals Service in 2014 were estimated at the time to be worth about $19 million, though the winning bid -- by venture capitalist Tim Draper -- wasn’t disclosed. Those coins would be worth $1.5 billion today as the cryptocurrency’s price has skyrocketed to almost $51,000.

The GSA auction is scheduled to be held from March 15 to 17.",1615335676,9,1

After the fact that I came to the realization which online/cloud wallets are of the less safe options, I used my 12 seed phrase words to import my wallet into a coinomi wallet. everything was okay when Coinomi suddenly stopped working in our country due to some government restrictions (even doesn't work with vpn).

I, therefore with so much confidence used the same 12 words seed phrase to move on with other android cryptocurrncy wallets out there, however to my surprise, all of them showed 0 balance &amp; transactions on my bitcoin balance. since they didn't even show any transaction history, I didn't freak out about my money being stolen, It indicated that something was just wrong.

I was in such despair trying every wallet out there, weirdly some wallets showed a couple of my bitcoin transactions history and showing a portion of my balance. BUT When I Finally installed and tested Mycelium, after typing my seed phrase, all my transactions and my full bitcoin balance just appeared quickly and effortlessly. What is special with mycelium and what's the reason behind this and how can I access my bitcoins on other wallets as well?

m1qyxa,rj45ethernet,I have just enough DOGE to buy a whole Bitcoin,"I bought 1M Doge many years ago for less than 1000USD and kinda forgot about it.  Over the years it has been surprisingly one of the best performing coins in my portfolio.   

But looking at the current numbers, it seems like I could buy a whole Bitcoin if I trade all my long-held Doge.   What should I do.  I wonder what I’ll regret more later, that I exited Doge now or not having purchased another whole BTC when I had the chance, perhaps my last chance before BTC gets too expensive.

BTC is playing with the big boys now, with a market cap of over 1 trillion, and the volatility is getting less and less as weeks pass.  

I just don't think this is like it was back in 2017 and before. I feel that we may never see large crashes again, we just may see a nice slow steady incline to 1 million.  I think calling this a bull run in todays climate just does BTC a huge disservice.  Jmho.",1615355040,11,1

It seemed to work, however the transactions disappeared before they were confirmed. Now the requests are gone, though the amounts are still present. Is this because I cannot move BTC within the same wallet? Or am I missing something?

m1p3a4,JazzyD22334,Bitcoin? So what?,"Been doing a ton of research on blockchain technology. 

Seems cool. Seems nerdy. Seems highly technical. Seems like there may be some use case for it in some circumstance. I recognize it's been around for a bit and I'm late to the game but it's partially because every time I previously studied it, I was always left with the ""so what"" thought after. 

Utimately it's all based on this decentralization concept. Let's remove the central authority. Whether it's the government in the case of money, or a bank in payments, or Facebook in the case of personal information, the concept goes on and on. Let's distribute the data, secure it, and then have all network computers verify each entry. 

So to me, a simple logical question comes to mind. Without having any technical training, doesn't this just seem like a monumental waste of resources? Let's ignore the fact that it's cool, I admit it is, but now you will have 1 million computers verify something that 1 computer did before. Can you imagine a world where everything is done that way? My head hurts trying to even reconcile the waste of energy this will create. 

Then you kind of ask well why do we need this? I'm not convinced we do. Again, interesting concept, some nerdy tech guys put it together in a paper and programmed it, but sometimes those ideas are better left in textbooks because the real world isn't a science project. 

I'm rambling a bit. But if anyone here can talk beyond just Bitcoin and the price of it, which in my mind is like irrelevant really, let's discuss the underlying tech and why it's needed. To avoid corruption? Who cares. Is anyone really all that bothered in the developed world by that? I go to my bank and get my money. Do I care if it's central? They are regulated. Again someone can come up with some crazy scenario where central authorities fail, but in the fast majority of cases it's completely fine. 

Perhaps the biggest downside for crypto and blockchain will not be the idea itself, which I think it's brilliant, but the fact that it's not really needed.

I have a question for you: 

I'm thinking of selling all my LTC right now and convert them to BTC. I bought LTC in 2017 when it was considered ""silver"" and BTC being ""gold"". I just want to convert everything in BTC as i believe the future lies in BTC. LTC hardly reaches the news and it just doesn't do anything to be honest. 

My question: I didn't do anything with the LTC except hold since the end of 2017. I only moved the coins to a hardware wallet but that's about it. Do you think this will be taxed in Belgium if I convert everything now into BTC? I'm not even sure if I made a profit to be honest. I'd have to double-check, but let's say I make the trade into BTC. Do you think I need to pay taxes on the profit? 

\+ Let's say I convert to BTC but don't mention anything about it on my tax report (it's a 4 digit number worth of LTC if I would sell and convert to BTC). Let's say I owed taxes on it but i didn't report it but the tax man catches me after 2 years or something (just to say a number) .. Do i get fined or do I only pay the amount I was due on the sale I would make in a few days?

The current legal status of cryptocurrencies will be short-lived as the western governments begin to notice that hacking and extremist activities increase in activity despite our agencies well-coordinated efforts to stop them. The pain of a cryptocurrency crash and ban will be deemed less painful than the cost of continued assault by criminal groups because the main underlying, business of crypto-currencies is money-laundering and funding of criminal activities.

This is why we need to continue to educate people on the benefits of Bitcoin. Not even as an investment, but as security. Currency values will change, emergencies will happen where banking may not be the best option. BTC will stay secure and, as we continue to push, more widely accepted.

m1zi0l,Scruffnut,Calculating position size with proper risk management and 10x leverage,"Hello, 

After years of wanting to get into bitcoin, I was finally able to buy in a few weeks back. Yay! 

I understand that the general sentiment on here is against trading, but I want to try dabbling in it to learn a bit about trading with a small amount outside of my hodl bag. 

I am using bybit, but I think I might be a bit confused with how to properly do risk management with 10x leverage. 

Say my account is $1000 and I want to only risk 1% per trade. 

I do my calculations and my stop loss will be at 1.5% below my buy price. My liquidation price is below that. 

Using: position size = $10 (risk) / .015 , I get a position size of $666. 

Does this mean that if I wanted to use 10x leverage, I should be buying $6660 contracts with my position margin being $666? And if I do hit the SL, does that still mean that I just lose $10 or (1.5% of my position margin)? 

If that’s correct, what would be the downside of using 20x leverage instead to buy $13320 contracts if the liquidation price is still below my SL?

m1yjmf,TheNutrient2,Bill Gates: Stop all innovation NOW !!! A look at intellectual dishonesty.,"The recent surge in environmental FUD has been interesting to say the least. I think it's quite ironic that a man such a Bill Gates, who made his fortune in the computer industry is now critisizing the environmental impact of that very same industry.

Technological progress, whether in the digital realm or in the physical world always comes at the expense of increased energy usage. In order to prevent an increase in energy consumption, one would have to stop innovation altogether, except of course in the field of green energy (and even that is debatable, more on that later).

I wonder if Bill Gates would have stopped developing Microsoft if global warming was as big of an issue in the 70' and 80's as it is now? I mean, he did create an industry, along with Steve Jobs, that consumes inmeasurably more energy than crypto in general.

Has any opponent of crypto and nft's ever proposed that the entire internet should be shut down, because it is bad for the environment? I don't think so. They see the value of the internet, because they are users of the internet. However, every pc or phone using the internet needs to be powered,  every website has to be hosted on servers, every server consumes energy and every social media post comes at the cost of energy consumption. No matter how pointless the post might be. A racial slur online costs as much energy as an informed, relevant an intelligent post. Yet they are not equal in value. (talk about inefficiency)

The internet is a prime example of something that uses exponentially more energy as time moves on. 25 years ago not that many people used it. Today, the entire western world is practically obliged to use it (digital banking, email, shopping,...) Nobody ever said; we should cut back on internet, because it's bad for the environment.

That brings me to my next point. Opponents will claim crypto and nft's use an ineffciently large amount of energy.

Well, let's take a look at what progress means. Did Steve Jobs launch the Iphone as his first product ever? No. His first product was a very inefficient, clunky large computer that could barely do anything and was way overpriced if we compare it to today's functionality. Innovation and evolution go hand in hand. One does not come up with the perfect product, then releases it and never updates it.

It is funny to me, that crypto is being framed by critics as a stagnant technology, unable to improve, while developers are continually updating the network and providing different scaling solutions. In fact I  would argue it is one of the most dynamic industries at the moment.

It is also quite hilarious that this environmental FUD is being spread by institutions and governments that promote other, even more damaging technologies.

The electric car is a good example of this. Building an electrical car leaves a much larger ecological footprint than building a fossil fuel car. A person in the automotive industry told me I'd have to drive an electric car for 25 years in order to compensate for it's environmental impact during production, compared to the production of a fossil fuel car.(he wasn't selling me car, fyi) The environmental damage is done upfront, so you can overpay for a car that can travel half the distance of a regular car, while (unjustly) feeling good about yourself for reducing your carbon footprint . Then you need to plug that in to one of millions of chargers that need to be built and suck electricity like there's no tomorrow.

In fact, this kind of industry is being subsidized and promoted by governments who wag their finger at crypto.

(The technology is not there....yet. Who knows, electric cars can do 10x the distance of a fossil fuel car in 10 years.)

It is hypocrisy at it's worst, just because it doesn't fit their agenda. 

NFT's are a breakthrough for digital artists to make (perpetual) money with their art, crypto is a breakthrough for it's decentralized nature.

And don't get me started on Peter Shiff, taking on this environmental argument to bash bitcoin. It's freakin hilarious he doesn't see the irony in that claim, while collecting his organically grown and ecofriendly gold. Haha.",1615386131,44,1

Last week I found an independent contractor who offered a service I needed (creation of a website and associated databases/backend work for a start-up project). He was recommended in a few places and after checking out his portfolio we agreed a price and agreed a statement of work.

Given our locations and the price, Bitcoin was seen as the most convenient payment method, so I sent funds via Bitpanda to his BTC address. This was an upfront payment for approx 30% of the total.

I'm now in a position where he's stopped responding to me, and all work has paused and hidden from view. Fairly confident I've been scammed at this stage.

Now if this was a credit card purchase or bank transfer I'd know what to do to kick off a chargeback or report fraud. What are my options for a BTC transfer via Bitpanda? It's not a case where I've sent funds to the wrong address which is all they seem to cover in their FAQs...

In comparison Bitcoin is estimated to emit around 37 million tonnes of CO2 over the course of 2021, with China powering 65% of the hash rate in March 2021. China pledges to be net zero by 2050 along with most of the world under the Paris agreement. Under the assumption this is achieved this would indicate Bitcoin would be powered by renewable energy by 2050 making it a zero carbon technology. In addition, gold mining is renowned to be one of the most destructive industries responsible for polluting drinking water with cyanide, mercury and other heavy metals, whilst destroying pristine environments and causing damaging health effects. Removing reliance on the need for gold not only has the potential to decarbonise the gold reserve industry but also reduces these negative environmental and health impacts. However, the reliance on countries sticking to the Paris Agreement is needed in order to decarbonise Bitcoin.

There are three major concerns I have with Bitcoin, if it appreciates significantly. I have tried looking through this forum and through many other articles online, but have never found my concerns addressed, so I thought I want to try this community:

&amp;#x200B;

**Bitcoin Could Promote Greater Wealth Extremes**

Many people argue that Bitcoin is fairer than the current financial system by using the following two arguments:

1. A financial system based on Bitcoin would be much more equitable to everyone since it irons out some of the glaring issues with the current financial system (e.g., lending; real inflation not being captured)
2. Anyone can buy Bitcoin right now and share in the wealth that will be generated as price appreciates

The first statement (that I strongly believe is true) deals with the future, and not the path there. The path there is what I am concerned about since it could lead to significant destruction. 

[https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-supply-distribution/#:\~:text=A%20recent%20report%20by%20Bloomberg,wealth%20in%20the%20Bitcoin%20network](https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-supply-distribution/#:~:text=A%20recent%20report%20by%20Bloomberg,wealth%20in%20the%20Bitcoin%20network).

The glassnode link states ""2% of network entities control 71.5% of all Bitcoin."" Though the 71.5% is admittedly on the high side, it is alarming that there much wealth could be concentrated by such few participants. On the other end, some estimate that the top 1% own 40-50% of all wealth currently:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution\_of\_wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth)

It is impossible to tell whether the distribution is much more equitable (that I know of) than what we currently have, but it seems doubtful that low income earners, people on pensions, retirees, etc. are going to be investing at the same proportions as high net worth individuals (who could invest 10% of their entire portfolio in Bitcoin without the same risk to their living). People in Silicon Valley or global tech centers that were first aware of Bitcoin would disproportionately benefit from the rise, whereas those most disconnected from the centers of innovation would be left behind, which is not different/better than the current system. 

As Bitcoin rises, the current distribution will be more and more difficult to smooth out. As large investors start entering, it will become harder and harder for smaller players to have a significant share of the pie. People that do not invest in Bitcoin could be completely out of luck if Bitcoin goes to $10-40 trillion as some project. People that own Bitcoin could outbid those without on real estate, food, water, etc. That scenario is not much different than the current one, where ""using"" the financial system (e.g., trading in the stock market) can yield more wealth than doing productive work (e.g., working in the service industry, building factories, developing technologies). Governments would not be able to offer any kind of social safety net for those left behind because fiat currency would be effectively worthless in this scenario. A complete lack of confidence in any government body, and possibly even riots and looting would ensue by the disgruntled ""left behind.""

One could argue that the risk Bitcoin investors took by investing early warrants the wealth they accumulate. But my concern is that the same argument could be used for kings/dictators, and aligning with royalty early and suppressing others who were slow to pick-up later. That is not a sustainable system, because it would lead to failed states and rioting (e.g., Venezuela). 

Yes, most people could buy bitcoin right now. Yes, the access to bitcoin is somewhat equitable to a person’s current spot on the wealth distribution curve. However, information access is not necessarily equitable, and devaluation of fiat currency-based wage payments disproportionately disenfranchises the poor: shifts to Bitcoin expedite the devaluation.

Bitcoin could also cause easier tax avoidance, especially for the wealthy, expanding wealth gaps further.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bitcoin Could Collapse the World Financial Market**

I think some people desire this outcome, but let me address my concern: 

You would struggle to find a single company with a market cap. above a penny stock that has outperformed Bitcoin this year. People could see that Bitcoin has risen 600-700% this year and decide that it is a better investment than equities, so they remove their wealth from equities and put it into Bitcoin, driving the price up, creating a positive feedback loop where equities drop, bitcoin falls, and the system encourages further redistribution. This would lead to a scenario where everyone wants Bitcoin but no one wants to invest in companies because of the rate of return difference. Companies would suffer without the support of investors, and productivity would greatly diminish, possibly leading to a global depression. This could happen with other assets such as commodities or real estate, but the liquidity of bitcoin and devout following is causing larger appreciation. So, we do not have a good historical comparison, to my knowledge.

I have heard the argument that Bitcoin's price would eventually flatten out as more participants enter and would stop rising after a point (although this is hypothetical), but if this took a year to happen, the damage could already be done. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Governments Could Step in or Become Useless**

If the two situations above look like they are on the verge of being realized, governments would be compelled to act, which brings me to my last point: governments could attempt to regulate or devalue Bitcoin. One scenario would be all the buy-in into Bitcoin causes governments to globally agree to disregard their fiat currencies and exchange all assets in their currencies, on an equal basis, into one decentralized token-based currency (not Bitcoin; a new one optimized to handle the large amount of transactions that would be involved). Therefore, everyone is starting from the same place, but all the improvements of removing fiat currencies will be realized. The counter argument is that countries like the US would never give up control over their currency since it gives them so much power, but I am not saying this scenario is at all likely, unless things changed dramatically, and they were desperate.

I will not even get into the fact that without means of controlling the financial system, it is certainly harder for governments to enforce global guidelines (e.g., with regards to nuclear weapons, terrorism, etc.). There is also nothing that can be done in economic crises to prevent a market collapse, but perhaps natural order implies that things should run their course. 

&amp;#x200B;

m26iaq,Fittiboy,Help people buy Bitcoin!,"Recently, I have noticed that it has become incredibly difficult to convince people that they need Bitcoin. This is due to the fact that, apparently, they already know.

I've onboarded multiple people over the last few weeks, and all it took was mentioning my Bitcoin knowledge in their presence. They already knew it was a good idea to buy, they just didn't really know how, and were a little too lazy to try to figure it out for themselves.

People like Bitcoin now. Even if it's sometimes just for the gains, it's pretty easy to get the ""literally just hodl"" strat across.

So remember: Help people buy Bitcoin! You know the exchanges, you know the wallets, you might even know lightning. It's surprisingly easy to get people to buy! Give them a good exchange and a good wallet to use, and tell them to just hodl, and back up their wallets!

I realized quite late that the fee was too low and I should have sent it with a higher fee. 

I really want to clear my transaction and I tried to find a solution online and managed to find one reliable resource that has [some information on how to clear transactions](https://blog.blockonomics.co/how-to-speed-up-bitcoin-transactions-4ca4159991ab) but it requires me to use a special wallet.

From what I could understand there are only 3 ways to clear a stuck transaction, RBF, CPFP, accelerators.

The first 2 methods need a special wallet like Electrum so the only option I have is an accelerator.

That is great for the short-to-mid term price of bitcoin, but he mentioned something I had never thought of before: 

If production decreases enough, bitcoin could actually become inflationary as well — effectively breaking the bitcoin model. He suggests that this could make BTC/USD drop from $1M per coin to $0.

Obviously his examples are somewhat clickbaity, but can someone help wrap my mind around whether or not this is actually a long-term risk posed by bitcoin?

As I understand it, a majority of Bitcoin’s mining power (approx 65%) comes from China.  China is an authoritarian dictatorship that believes in censorship.  Suppose people started embedding little bits of truth that China wants to suppress — about the Uyghurs, Tiannamen Square, etc. — into the blockchain.  The Chinese government could ban miners from including such transactions in their blocks.  When miners in other countries did include them, and Chinese miners did not, we could end up with hard forks and splintered blockchains.

That would devalue Bitcoin and limit its utility.  That would be bad for the miners, but the Chinese government might view it as a pleasant side effect or even the real reason to censor the blockchain.  The Chinese government might like to see Bitcoin falter because devaluing Bitcoin would make way for the digitized Yuan or some other cryptocurrency that Chinese government could more easily control, maybe NEO, and could slow the flow of currency out of China and into Bitcoin.

I love Bitcoin and would love to be told why I’m wrong to be concerned.",1615470222,10,1

Hello every one ,

Swissborg Community app is an Gaming app where you predict the value of bitcoin (for FREE), and earn CHSB tokens via badges by doing certain activities in the game. I've earned 200 Tokens, actually the value is: 300$

My code for the BTC prediction game is 6X3BGZI

We both get 3000 points to play with if you enter my code ;)

You earn CHSB tokens (actually value is 1,5$ for 1 CHSB) for each 'badge' you earn, for example successful bitcoin value predictions or logging in 'X' days.

m2xuoc,Facelessuser13,"Why we don't Shitcoin, a post written by Udi Wertheimer - Send this to your Shitcoiner friends.","Altcoins (sometimes known as ""shitcoins"" among industry experts) are digital coins positioned as alternatives to bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

A naive examination of them may reveal similarities to bitcoin: altcoins use digital signatures, they have a chain of blocks, there are addresses, etc... just like bitcoin! But faster / smarter / better for dentists / etc

&amp;#x200B;

That’s why many of the world’s poor nocoiners see them as an opportunity to gain riches similar to those of ultra-early bitcoiners: if the alts are technically “better”, they are sure to win, right?

&amp;#x200B;

———

&amp;#x200B;

But the truth is, altcoins and bitcoins have almost nothing in common.

&amp;#x200B;

When a poor nocoiner first tries bitcoin, they usually don’t see it for what it really is. They get distracted by minor details, like “i can send it to my friends” or “i can hold my own keys” and then see those same properties elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

But the real value in bitcoin is its immutable monetary policy.

&amp;#x200B;

READ THAT AGAIN.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin holds long-term value because its monetary policy is immutable.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, it’s predictable. Dependable. Reliable.

&amp;#x200B;

All of the other features that Bitcoin has are really just implementation details to make the above possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Some poor people will say: “but bitcoin is mutable! You can change the code!”

&amp;#x200B;

No.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin isn’t defined by software. Software exists to assist humans in verifying the rules they agreed on:

21 million coins.

Decreasing inflation.

No censorship.

&amp;#x200B;

If you changed the software, you didn’t change bitcoin. You just made software that no one wants.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin allowed us to set the rules once, then move on to create value elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

We don’t keep “innovating” on the rules of the game. Bitcoin remains stable.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how money should work.

&amp;#x200B;

Altcoins are the opposite of that.

&amp;#x200B;

————————

&amp;#x200B;

Altcoins are completely different.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of a shared monetary system that allows value creation elsewhere, altcoiners seek to extract value by repeatedly changing the rules.

&amp;#x200B;

The altcoin issuer gets to learn the new rules before anyone else for their own benefit. They even get to design the rules for their own benefit, to play on their own strengths.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, “defi coins”, where new ones are released daily, each with intentionally obscure rules, like having the number of units you own change due to external events, or allowing one smart contract to empty coins in another, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Obscure rules mean issuers and friends have some time to attract attention and extract value, before others manage to put the pieces together and understand how to extract value as well... at which point the thing usually collapses.

&amp;#x200B;

Which is their sign to issue a new coin, and change the rules once more.

&amp;#x200B;

So, altcoins are the opposite of bitcoin. Short-term attempts to change the rules to extract value. To evade stability, avoid dependability, and prevent reliability.

&amp;#x200B;

————————

&amp;#x200B;

The one thing altcoins do have in common with bitcoin, is that they share the same infrastructure. Mostly for historical reasons, you can find XRP and ETH in the same exchanges and wallets as bitcoin, even though they have nothing in common. This will likely change with time (eg XRP getting delisted).

&amp;#x200B;

This does create fluctuation where liquidity moves from bitcoin to altcoins and back.

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, it is possible to buy altcoins and make money. Those who tell you that it’s impossible are poor, or losers, or both.

&amp;#x200B;

What twitter influencers won’t tell you however, is that you have to understand the dynamics of changing rules and hype cycles to make it. If you understand this and think you can win this short-term game: maybe you can. Go ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

But if you’re going into this thinking altcoins are improved bitcoins, you’re going to have a bad time. I hope that later you can at least have fun staying poor.",1615489127,17,1

m3aubv,LeN3rd,Long term reliability of hardware wallets.,"So i am finally settled on buying some Bitcoin for the long run and after reading a bit about storage methods, i came to the conclusion, that i have essentially two (reasonably safe) possibilities for storage:

1) Use a paper wallet (essentially printing out the keys)

2) Use a hardware wallet, that has a few addresses inside, created by a master key, that signs transactions without being connected to the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone seems to be rather enthusiastic about hardware wallets, but my question is, what happens to the accessibility of my BTC's etc. when the company that created the wallet goes out of business.

 I give that thing to my child 50 years from now and the company went bankrupt 40 years ago and there are no PC's that could even run the old wallet applications, because everyone now uses PowerPC2.0 and javascript went the way of Flash. Rather drastic description, i know, but when was the last time you tried to run a program compiled for a Commodore 64? 

What happens when i want to recover my Wallet, but the Company is bankrupt and i do not have a copy of the source code. 

Does this system work COMPLETELY without the company that manufactured the hardware wallet, or do i have to take certain risks into account? 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as i am aware, a paper wallet would stand the test of times even in the strangest circumstances, as long as Bitcoin is still running, right?

It's a false narrative and if they did proper research they would not be so irresponsible. So not only is the Bitcoin future one in which our global financial system will consume far less energy in total, it's also about what kind of energy is used. A majority of Bitcoin's energy use is renewable and waste (energy that otherwise would not be used), and many natural gas companies are capping methane vents and burning that methane to convert a waste into Bitcoin. In these cases, they are also transforming methane, a very harmful greenhouse gas, into CO2 and H20, a much less harmful output, making Bitcoin actually a force for GREEN in these cases.

I have heard this same question many times and thought I should help clear things up a little. Below is my response, happy to hear from you too if I am wrong somewhere.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Why would anyone want Bitcoin when ""insert other coin"" can do exactly what Bitcoin does but better?""

I used to think this and didn't invest in Bitcoin 3 years ago. Its a very reasonable argument.

6  months ago I became aware of a very, very important distinction.  Bitcoin - the blockchain is different from Bitcoin (BTC) - the asset.  So, yes, there are other and better blockchains, but there are no better  ""coins"". In fact, a coin has only one property - DEMAND. And BTC has  that, more than any alt. (Lesson: A blockchain and a crypto coin are two  separate entities.)

But back to  difference between THE blockchain and THE asset. Think of Ethereum.  Ethereum is the blockchain and ETH is the coin. But is ETH the only coin  trading on Ethereum? Not at all, there are so many. Lesson: A crypto  coin can be traded on another

Once  you can visualize this difference, next question should be: OK So we do  have stablecoins like USDC, Defi like AAVE and crypto-utility coins  like REN trading on Ethereum, does that mean they can switch to other  blockchains? HECK YES! Thats exactly what USDC did and REN enables you  to trade any crypto coin on any crypto blockchain (or something like  that, I am still learning, so dont quote me on this). Lesson: A crypto  coin can be moved to other blockchain

BTC  is the biggest coin today and when innovation stabilizes a bit in  blockchain, it will most certainly switch to some other blockchain or  may be multiple blockchains.

Another  way to think: Blockchain is like a payment gateway and cryptocoin is  like different fiat currencies. Can you not trade USD, euro or yen on  Visa? Can you trade USD on only one network- Visa? Of course not, you  can trade on any payment gateway. At some point we will reach the same  point in crypto - blockchains provide the computational power, protocols  will help these blockchains communicate with each other and coins wont  be limited to a single blockchain anymore.

Right  now, crypto-coins are truly global in real space - can be traded from  anywhere on Earth. But in digital space, it is restricted only on its  host blockchain. In a few years, crypto space will become truly global  once we can trade coins on any network we want to!

Really hope this helps and happy to learn if I am wrong somewhere in my understanding.",1615523020,5,1
m39jtv,Sean_A_D,Keeping Passphrase Safe at a bank,"Hi everyone, I have been thinking and asking around about places to keep my Bitcoin Passphrase, and I was wondering what everyone thought about lobbying banks to set up a specific product for keeping a passphrase safe. 

It wouldn't need to be a physical object in a lockbox, it would have the protection of a brick-and-mortar institution (unless they collapse) and presumably, come with some legal protection especially around the topic of wills or hacking and theft, just like fiat currency is protected?

I think the problem of lost bitcoin needs to be solved in the long term, I want to put more into the currency but am concerned about protecting the assets over the next 10-20-30 years.

then again, the more bitcoin people lose, the more mine is worth so...

I used Coinbase to purchase a small amount, but quickly realised that there was no easy way to cash out or use what I had transactionally. I tried transferring to another service which sold itself as being simple enough to use for what I wanted.

From what I recall, all I has to do was copy an ID code from the wallet I was taking the coin out of (A), and put into the new wallet (B), confirm a few details for the transfer,  and it would do the rest (it was a few years ago, so not 100% sure on the finer details, but these are the broader details that I remember). I did all of this, and got confirmation that the coin had left A and to give B a few seconds/minutes to confirm. The 2nd wallet never received confirmation of receipt. I tried refreshing the apps (I suspect this may have made things worse, I dunno) and then waited a couple of hours, but nothing ever came through. I tried looking through both apps and services to see if there was any way to remedy the situation, but was never able to find a solution. Honestly, the whole process had been a little frustrating, from purchase to everything else after, so I just accepted the loss and moved on. I only spent as much as I was willing to lose so while I was pissed off at the time, it wasn't the end of the world. 

I know it is a complete long shot, but there's no harm in asking: is there any possible way I can recover what I have presumed to have lost years ago? 

tl/dr: I tried transferring Bitcoin between wallets on seperate apps, didn't work, lost coin, wondering if there is anyway to fix this.",1615518439,15,1

When I've taught people how to use Bitcoin before, I did transactions back and forth a few times for them to learn the basics of how wallets / addresses / transactions work.

There is still a lot of stuff that I should know about blockchain, crypto’s and trading. I will highly appreciate any help for this particular question.

How is the price of Btc determined?

I understand that it is based on demand/supply and some other basics.

I also understand that everyday a huge volume of trading of various sizes is going on multiple platforms and there must be a complex algorithm that is determining the price minute to minute.

But, to put it very simply, is this a correct assumption that if the total buy volume is greater than the total sell volume  at any platform between any point interval the price will be higher at the end of the interval than the start of the interval at that platform?

If anyone knows the specific framework used, please point me in that direction.


It will be very helpful if anyone can guide me to relevant resources to understand these concepts better.",1615553019,9,1

I'm quite glad to have found blockpath though, because blockchain and most other explorers show all these mixed tx that are just confusing.

Any idea how I can be sure to see the right txs?

And could it be part of the problem that I took the seed that was originally created and used with jaxx wallet and put it into mycelium to continue using it there? I guess not, since it's just an interface with the blockchain..

then I added a 0x00 prefix at the start and sha256 hashed it twice. The first 4 bytes (checksum) were 2272, I added that to the end of the hash

just acquire btc and hodl. keep hodling. 

btc has plenty of upside still.  More than 100x by many ways of estimating it

the real issue though is that shitcoins are just a zero sum pump and dump game. that's a game for losers. you're not a loser. don't play that game.

bitcoin however is a game of enabling our entire global civilization to break through to a more productive and egalitarian, where value accrues to those who create the most value for other humans, rather than just accruing to those who are close to the money printer since 1914, 1934 and 1971. it's a game where the rules are the same for all players, rather than a game where only a small set of players has artificially favorable rules, and everyone else gets f!@#'d to varying degrees.

btc is a game for those who want to meaningfully improve the future of humanity.

you can directly benefit by acquiring and hodling. everyone else will also indirectly benefit from you acquiring and hodling as well, as every sat you hodl reduces the opportunity for corrupt cantillionaires to steal your and others' time and life energy.

When I get my paycheck I put 50% into savings, 25% goes to me and my girlfriend going out to eat, and saving for future trips, then the other 25% goes to “me” or so I told my gf. That 25% is immediately split in half, one half goes straight to my investment’s, and the other half I commit to maybe treating myself to something like airpods, shoes, maybe a new shirt, but when I finally decide on buying whatever it is, I stop myself and think about my future, and end up putting the rest of my personal 25% into savings. I haven’t bought myself anything in months, the only money I spend on myself is gas. It really doesn’t bother me either bc I know in 10 years I’ll be thanking my past self. Do I need help?",1615614870,28,1

I was thinking about the ""last time to buy at price X"" posts, and wondered how often there was overlap between an ATH and a ""last time to buy at price X""

Before this time, for any price first reached there was an opportunity to purchase later at that same price....  but not between $41,782 and $43016.  All prices have been either ""before"" or ""after"" that price jump.

m3wvbi,Accomplished_Dig_247,"I’ve been seeing a lot of questions about BlockFi and how it works with they’re interest payments, so if you’re curious and ready for a good read, here you go.","What is the BlockFi Interest Account (BIA)?

The BlockFi Interest Account (BIA) is an interest-bearing account, which provides market-leading yields to crypto investors who store their crypto at BlockFi. 

Clients can deposit crypto and they will be paid monthly compounding interest! Your interest begins accruing the day after you deposit, and Interest Payments go out by the first business day of each month.

Additionally, we have no withdrawal restrictions or lock up periods so you can always withdraw at any time. Withdrawals are processed in 1-2 business days.


How Does a BlockFi Interest Account Work?

Many crypto investors store their digital assets on exchanges or in cold storage for long-term safe keeping. However, this strategy doesn’t help them grow their investment holdings or build overall wealth. The BlockFi Interest Account enables individuals and companies that own cryptoassets to earn interest in crypto on their crypto held at BlockFi. Signing up for an account takes less than 2 minutes and clients can start earning interest on the crypto of their choosing in the same day.

How to Earn Interest on Crypto

The crypto industry is in growth mode. Businesses are building and investors are looking for ways to accumulate more capital. BlockFi Interest Account clients can deposit their crypto and earn interest. Paid out at the beginning of every month, the interest earned by account holders compounds, increasing the annual yield for our clients. This is an easy way for crypto investors to earn bitcoin while they HODL.

For example (this example does not reflect current rates): With 6% compound interest, a BlockFi Interest Account client who deposits 1 Bitcoin, on February 28 will have an updated balance of 1.005 BTC at the end of March. This process repeats month over month until the client decides to withdraw their funds.


If the interest rate and deposited crypto’s price remain unchanged, the client who deposits 1 Bitcoin on February 28, 2019 will see their overall holdings increase to a value of 1.062 BTC (+6.2%) over a 12 month period.

If you add additional crypto to your BlockFi Interest Account, your interest will compound on the new balance. For example, let’s say on May 1st you deposit 1 BTC and then on May 15th you deposit an additional 1 BTC, bringing your total balance to 2 BTC. From May 1st – May 15th, you will earn compounding interest on the original deposit of 1 BTC. That will amount to 0.0025 BTC. On May 16th you will start earning compound interest on your new balance of 2 BTC plus any interest earned in the first half of the month. Interest earned in the last 16 days of May amount to 0.0053 BTC. On June 1st, you will have earned 0.0078 BTC in interest, which will be added to the principal balance. This makes your new total balance 2.0078 BTC, which will continue to accrue daily.

In the case that you’d like your compound interest to be paid out in a different asset than the one you deposited, we offer Interest Payment Flex. With Flex, you can hold crypto in your BIA and get all of your interest paid out in the currency of your choosing. This allows you to easily diversify your assets without having to buy new crypto.

BlockFi is dedicated to providing cryptoasset holders products and services available in the traditional financial world in the crypto ecosystem. We started with our crypto-to-USD loans and continue expanding into financial services that focus on helping people manage their digital assets and grow their net worth. The BlockFi Interest account provides crypto holders with an easy way to earn bitcoin.

What Does BlockFi Do with Account Assets?

BlockFi generates interest on assets held in Interest Accounts by lending them to trusted institutional and corporate borrowers. To ensure loan performance, BlockFi typically lends crypto on overcollateralized terms (similar to the structure of our crypto-backed loans). Furthermore, BlockFi’s automated risk management system monitors positions 24/7, leveraging the same trusted risk management system used with BlockFi’s crypto-backed loans.  BlockFi has the ability to terminate a borrow in a timely fashion and also manages reserve balances to facilitate client withdrawals from Interest Accounts.

BlockFi client funds are structured to be at the top of the capital stack, senior to BlockFi equity and BlockFi employee capital. This means BlockFi’s business and client incentives are aligned and BlockFi would take a loss before any client would. BlockFi implements very thoughtful risk management practices and technology to mitigate the risk, but you should not view the BlockFi Interest Account as a savings account or brokerage account with FDIC or SIPC insurance.",1615601524,21,1

m3w62o,IamDoge1,Searching for cryptocurremcy tax advice,"Not sure where to ask on reddit regarding cryptocurrency tax, so figured why not r/bitcoin? Here's a little background on my situation:


So I started crypto investing in 2017. I have never cashed out to fiat but I have made some crypto swaps after the crypto went up a decent amount (BTC-&gt;LTC, LTC-&gt;VEN). During this 2017 period, I made a handful of swaps that would be classified as realized gains. I never filed taxes for these ""realized gains"" partly because I just didn't have the cash to pay for them as well as I didn't really think back then you had to pay taxes until you cash out. In 2018 and 2019 I didn't really swap cryptos, only just DCAing and selling some of my bags of shitcoins. 2020 was a year I started shifting my cryptos around more and buying into the Defi craze. This year I plan to cash some crypto out or at least convert to a exchange stablecoin (bUSD or cUSD).

 1. For my situation, would crypto software suffice, or should I find a crypto CPA?

 2. (If CPA) Where can I find a crypto-Savvy CPA? I have bought/generated some tax-confusing cryptos: Gas rewards(VTHO and Neo gas), rebase token(Ampleforth), and crypto splits(VEN to VET 1:100 split). Any idea on how much approximately would a CPA run me to fix up my crypto taxes?


 3. (If not using a CPA) How do I go about going back to previous years tax returns to declare crypto gains? I used TurboTax the past several years. 


 4. In 2018/2019/2020, I didn't have any realized gains, just realized losses. Can I write these losses off on either my 2017 capital gains or (anticipated) 2021 gains?

m45pxr,ElPapitoo,Stablecoins/btc," Hi guys, 

My first post here, started looking in btc &amp; crypto since November 2020. And honoustly, I have been totally hooked. There are so many opportunities and I love it. The way I started is just google everything, and I had to google everything… What is fiat, what is a bull market, what is the hypecycle, what is the history of the course of BTC, what is etc…. I realize I’m still new to the market but I’m getting there, eager to learn and willing to put in hours just to understand it. I have a healthy (I think) diversification of about 8 coins which is about 70% btc, 10% eth, 20% alts. I did not put a lot of money into it and positioned myself at the end of december, but if it goes the way I (and many others) think it goes (and did go in the past 10 years), it is my journey to more financial freedom (+5 to 10 years).  

I still got a lot of questions, but some questions I do not get a good answer about it if I just Google it and it still feels kinda weird. I do not have any experienced people (in crypto) in my environment where I can ask these questions, so I thought, why not Reddit. Made an account few months ago and been scoping through the topics and it helped me a lot and gave me new insights regarding other topics.  

What are the advantages of stablecoins ? I don’t get it fully I think. Imagine I have 1 btc, I sell 50% at 100k for Tether for example, so I get 50k Tetherdollars. Do I keep those on an exchange as e.g. Binance or Coinbase? What are the risk of having my 50k Tethers there on the exchange? Is it the same with keeping your coins on an exchange (risk) ? If yes, what is the best option for storing the tethers? 

Another question I have is, why is it better to trade back from btc to a stablecoin then fully to dollars or euro’s on an exchange (not paying out to my bank account) ? Is it because I can trade more coins from tether to whatever coin in comparison to Fiat to whatever coin ?  

Last but not least: Is it better to keep stablecoins in comparison with fiat because of taxes?

Every once in a while I put a little Bitcoin into a CoinBase Pro account and try to trade the ups and downs just for giggles. I have this illusion that once, just once, I’m going to catch them right.

Did this over the last few days a few times between $55k and $57k. At the moment it’s cash and I have a limit order in for $55.5k.

Now we are over $60k. I remember doing this when we were in the $30s-$40s. When it hit $40k I knew people would sell and I’d get back in in the $30s. People didn’t sell and our time in the $40s was a brief stopover on the way to $50k. So I bought in at $45k.

So we are at $60k. Do I suck it up and buy now in case we roar to $70k and lose the growth from $57-60? Do I wait for the dip?

Who knows? All I can tell you is timing Bitcoin is a sure way to buy high and sell low.

HODL, kids.

m45gzf,SirFuckingLoin,MicroStrategy bought another $15 million worth of bitcoin and says they won't sell them even after 100 years," *While many are waiting for a rebound in the price of bitcoin, Microstrategy is raising $ 10 million to buy bitcoins. Adding its $ 5 million, the company bought 262 bitcoins.*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2a4jmbuoism61.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=710703496cdcdedd3842be94f100b8f05579abb0

Interestingly, Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor reports on every purchase to both the SEC and the community.

Even though the price dropped below what Microstrategy paid ($ 57,146 per BTC) right after Sailor's tweet, the company's dollar-averaging strategy has paid off so far. The company's total ownership is now 91k + BTC and is worth more than $ 5.1 billion, but the average BTC value in a portfolio of $ 24,214 shows that all these bitcoins were worth $ 2.2 billion to the company.

I know that many traders will say that Michael Sailor chose the wrong time to buy, but the overall result of the company is impressive. The strategy of averaging the cost of buying BTC in small parts, but regularly, always shows in the end a large profitability and eliminates errors that lead the statistical majority of traders to large losses.

Why is Sailor doing this and not otherwise? Very simple. It is enough to take into account two of his statements:

**We won't sell our bitcoins even after 100 years.**

**Bitcoin will be worth over $ 15 million.**

Moreover, the future is not an object of blind faith, Sailor has a coherent theory and logical explanations for the inevitability of such a future bitcoin.",1615638997,18,1

m45b7o,SirFuckingLoin,The dismantling of the global financial system?," *The Great Reset, announced by the World Economic Forum is not a controversial issue, but a final decision.* 

*Processing img 2m0f5wgngsm61...*

Over the past decades, the world's leading economies have been increasing their debt. Smoothly but tangibly.  
However, since the announcement of Operation Covid-19, the world's central banks have printed more than $ 7 trillion of money out of thin air.

When Warren Buffett says that US debts will never be zeroed and the US will never default because they are ready to repay everyone in dollars that they themselves print, he means that the global financial system will not change. But Buffett doesn't comment on the IMF's Great Reset.

The IMF did not confine itself to Kristallina Georgieva's speech about the big zeroing and the second Bretton Woods. On October 19, the IMF hosted a conference entitled “*Cross-Border Payments — A New Beginning*”. Few people paid attention to this conference.

Present: Jerome Powell, Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Shamsia Mohd Yunus, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, Agustin Carstens, CEO of the Bank for International Settlements (aka the Central Bank of all central banks), Ahmed Alholifei, Governor of the Central Bank of Saudi Arabia. Moderator of the meeting: Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund. These people are some of the most influential in the world and they are the ones who decide how money works.

But right under our noses they are discussing no less, but the dismantling of the global financial system. Behind the vague phrases that the currency would be best backed by the public sector, perhaps through the digital currencies network of Central Banks. And also “about a concerted effort that can improve the functioning of the current system, ultimately a multipolar global economy requires a new IMFS (international monetary and financial system) to fully realize its potential,” is the question of dismantling the monetary system.

What are cross-border payments globally? These are payments in US dollars. And what does a multipolar global economy require a new IMFS?

Even a passing acquaintance with the history of money suggests that the current monetary system will not survive in this configuration.

Former Goldman Sachs banker and financial expert Raoul Paul summed up the IMF meeting on digital currencies of central banks perfectly with this tweet, which he hastily deleted. But the screenshot remained.

“*If you don't see central bank digital currencies being born, then you are missing a big and important thing. This event will be the greatest overhaul of the global financial system since Bretton Woods.* ”

**This is a monumental moment in human history.** The world of money is changing. Right now, you should think about the topic: how do you make money and in what currency you are paid. Where is your money invested, and what will happen to it if there is no cash dollars or Euros. The winners will be those who take the time to figure out what's going on and put their finances in the right direction.

Money printed out of thin air will be worth less if a new financial system is born out of the current situation. Solid assets are your friend at this time.",1615638344,5,1

China has  strengthened its control over Hong Kong. This is a crucial part of reverse engineering the global bank payments system. If China  succeeds in this process the US would lose the seigniorage it has enjoyed from issuance of the global reserve currency.   
Next to its military power USD$ global reserve currency status is the most significant economic and strategic pillar of US imperialism. 

If the US loses this position the US would be facing insolvency. 

China is now almost certainly able to require trade to be denominated in DCEP.  Few trading nations would be able to refuse trade with China via DCEP rather than USD$.

Bitcoin is increasing in value - because it is seen as a safe haven store of value and means of exchange independent of the USD$ and its imminent collapse.",1615666412,1,3

The discussion prompt is:


How Bitcoin can exist and be valuable without a stable state, supported by taxation to enforce rules and provide for the common defense?


IMO the State provides the necessary rules and enforcement for a stable society. It cannot and doesn’t please everyone. That’s a well understood problem. This stability though does allow for acceptable market functions and social cohesion without violence. This excludes rogue actors of course. I don’t want to simplify Bitcoin into slogan pigeonholes like “Defund The Government” or “Taxation is theft, thus Bitcoin is freedom from Theft.” 

I believe societies form governments to provide for the common good, by enforcing agreeable norms. The enforcement of these norms requires at the extreme, physical violence, but more commonly requires documentation for levying the necessary fine. Bitcoin doesn’t allow for the outright confiscation by decree. 

How would a government levy a fine against a bitcoiner? Could we see a return of debtors prisons, where failure to pay the fine in the required time or currency would result in imprisonment and forced labor until the debt is repaid or minimum time is served? Unlike gold, seizure of Bitcoin in the physical world is impossible. Taking anything but the seed phrase is fruitless. It’s even more difficult, if it’s a multisig wallet you’re attempting to access. 

This is just one train of thought you may find yourself on. I’ve been down many.

m4m6ej,Tirty8,Buying Bitcoin - When to stop,"Up until 2020, I was a huge Bitcoin skeptic.  That being said, as facts change so do my opinions.

Early in 2021, I won some Bitcoin.  Due to Covid, I just sorta sat on the coin, and luckily, it went up in value.  I then saw PayPal enter the scene, and I sorta realized that this is the catalyst needed to bring Bitcoin to the mainstream.  I kept an eye on Bitcoin and saw more and more big money enter the space.  I am totally convinced that Bitcoin is no only here to stay, but I also think that it is seriously undervalued.

So, I eventually decided to add to my Bitcoin stake, and again watched the price rise.  Now although, I am new to Bitcoin, I am a fast learner.  I have realized that the amount of Bitcoin I am purchasing now pales compared to my initial winnings.  I then decided to start putting in even more in order to get while the getting is still good.

I feel very strongly that Bitcoin is going to rise quite a bit this year and the near term looks strong.  Now, I come at Bitcoin from a background of buying stocks.  I know that it is not exactly the same, but it is better than nothing.

Generally speaking, when I begin purchasing a stock that I like, as it moves up, I like it less.  For example, if I buy a stock for $100 a share, and it moves to $125, I like it less.  When it moves to $150, I now see that a lot of the value that it had has gone.  It is no longer cheap.  In fact risk is added.  Maybe I was right that $100 was cheap, but $150 might be too expensive.  Adding in more might be foolish if it bounces back to $130.

I think Bitcoin is similar in the regard that what I am purchasing now is a fraction of what I once bought.

I know the general consensus is HODL.  But my question is, ""When does it no longer make sense to buy more Bitcoin?""

At some point, buying more will be essentially insignificant in terms of my total Bitcoin that I own.

I imagine that most of you have been involved longer than I have and have considered these implications.  I am curious as to what you think and why you think it.

I've seen many posts here where this topic is brought up and there seems like there is a lot of anger. What would it look like to put that anger away and just talk calmly about the issue of how to convince friends and family? The major issues I'm seeing are:

I missed out. 
I can't buy a bitcoin it's too expensive. 
It's for criminals.
What about taxes?
Is coinbase a sham?
It is a fad.
What about Mt.Gox.
It is horrible for the environment (this seems to be a major sticking point for a lot of my circle).
It could go to zero at any moment.

There are plenty of other problems. My hope is just to have a conversation that isn't about how annoying it is and more about coming up with useful ways to talk about it with people who know very little.

Among other things you can sue binance for breach of contract, grand theft, fraud, misrepresentation, larceny by trick, embezzlement and a host of other charges.

You can demand your money back + interest + punitive damages. At the very minimum, you are entitled to restitution damages.

m4k6of,iamnik77,Why No-Coiners Should Buy $100 of Bitcoin,"Because that's what I did.

Ok, there's more to it than that. Yes, I bought .04 Bitcoin for $100 in 2017. Surely I was pissing the $100 away because an imaginary internet coin couldn't possibly be worth that much.

I watched Bitcoin rocket to $20k, crater to $3k, and bounce back. Then, in early 2020 my outlook changed drastically. To my surprise, it was doggedly holding onto a $10k valuation. To rise and fall and years later be back up so high...that is not how a bubble on a weak asset plays out.

That's when I made a much larger purchase, giving Bitcoin a real place among my assets. I've accumulated more value on that purchase than any other investment of mine in the same time span.

But without that $100 purchase in 2017, I wouldn't have gained the education. And without the education, I never would have had the conviction to buy a more meaningful amount in early 2020.

The point of all this is that micro-sized investments are much more meaningful than you might think. What's $100 if it enables you to acquire knowledge or experience that makes you much more money down the line?

So, if you are too unsure about putting thousands of dollars into Bitcoin, try $100...or maybe $50...or $10. Whatever you are comfortable with.

1. some coins like btc/ltc have limited supply and can be used for ""store of value"" case like gold and silver. LTC has lower fees/quicker transaction speed, privacy, etc why isnt this coin more focused on as it is ""better"" than btc in every way? 
2. The US govt wants complete control of their fiat currency/dollars so they have power, tax, etc and since crypto is decentralized, govts across the world will lose their power why would they allow this to happen? they can ban it or penalize people using it. 
3. Govt is already taxing people on crypto, how is that possible? its decentralized so why does govt have say over it? they cant control it, how can they tax it? if they can tax it they can do alot of other things to it...defeating the purpose of crypto? obv its btc is limited supply so they cant touch that but idk regulate up the ass where theres no use case. 
4. Govts talking about creating their own crypto on the blockchain, digital dollar/currency. This would solve the global payments system (instead of waiting days and going through clearing houses),  If/when govt creates this on the chain, why would crypto have use afterwards? people can use the digital money like they do crypto. they can totally do this to keep their govt power
5. I dont understand all these other tokens like CHAINLINK. they run on the ethereum chain and i can see the use case of ETH for dapps and defi, and chainlink is like the google  searches for and imports data from the real-world and delivers it to the smart contracts that run in the on-chain universe. Along with the uniswap tokens, etc on the eth chain. Are these worth investing into? so confused on the eth tokens...are they basically like companies you invest in on the etherum universe? why not just invest in ETH if eth covers the whole universe on that block chain? 
6. if the goal is decentralization, then mastercard/visa processing crypto payments/supporting LTC/btc etc doesnt that defeat the purpose?? we have a third party processing payments lol thats what crypto is trying to avoid. traditional finance will find a way to take part in this tech and visa and all them have started embracing it and using it as the middlemen.

It's safe to say that banks are here, and they attempt to continue their businesses with Bitcoin.

*First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.*

Since banks are joining us, we have already entered ""you win"" stage.

The question now is: should we let them continue their money pimping businesses?

The answer should be a firm ""NO"", and the reasons include

1. **Bitcoin is created to make the banking system obsolete, not to be used by it.**

2. **With Bitcoin, there is no need to use any banks.** You can secure and use your money without any banks.

3. Bitcoin is peer-to-peer software. **You are supposed to manage money yourself.**

4. The banking system and debt-based economy are modern slavery and have failed. **You should not support them.**

m5g2pe,bektar,RFC: Thoughts on soft fork activation,"Greetings Reddit,

I’ve been following some of the discussion regarding soft fork activation, and was hoping to get some feedback on my personal feelings on the issue. I have tried to keep it as concise as possible, but if you want an extreme tl;dr I suppose it would be that we have forgotten to KISS.

## Theoretical path from idea to activated consensus rule
1. Developers work on what they find interesting (be it financially, ideologically or curiosity/technologically motivated)
2. Developers ask themselves ”if 95% of nodes were running this patch, would it work as intended?”
    1. If no: do not merge
    2. If yes: merge but in disabled state
3. Make activating an option where one selects a block from when to start enforcing the rule
4. If and when the network as a whole ends up enforcing the rule, then it is time to release a version with the patch enabled by default

This would move all responsibility of activating away from the developers, and basically leave it up to all node runners (and to some degree miners) to figure out if/when the new rules should be enforced.

## Which block to start enforcing from?
So how would node runners and miners decide on from which block to start enforcing?

I actually think not having a fixed rule for this to be a good thing. I personally believe that the day that bitcoin gets a formalised governance model is the day it has failed. A fixed rule will inevitable lead to gaming of said rule.

Instead let people/organisations make it known what they support. Be it by writing blog posts, polls, making posts to the mailing list, reddit, bitcoin twitter or whatever. This in combination of service providers (exchanges, wallets, stores, etc) declaring their support or opposition (here I envision them having a page on their sites listing their stance on suggested changes). I imagine a part of this would be having nodes flag support/opposition to known changes. I would also like to see transactions doing the same thing (maybe make use of bitcoin days destroyed?).

Can node and/or transaction support/opposition be sybil attacked? Yes, obviously. But support/opposition cannot be silenced. If every single node that is on the network is flagging support then this means something. Possibly not that it is time to activate, but something for sure. A combination of nodes, service providers, miners, and transactions flagging support, would in my opinion mean consensus has been reached.

Once there seem to be a strong general support for activation, then groups can start to form suggesting actual activation blocks. Possibly just making a suggestion on a block on the mailing list might be a great place to start.

The main issue with this way of doing it is (as far as I can tell) is gaging normal user support. Right now the anonymous node runners have no good way of making their voices heard (other than making noise on the aforementioned channels). Which brings me to:

## Bonus idea: Providing more data in the future
Have nodes flag support/opposition. I’m imagining something like the following flags:

1. Nothing selected: this basically means that this node is either unaware or undecided regarding this change
2. ”No”: this means this node oppose this change
3. ”Neutral”: this means this node has no opinion either way
4. ”Yes”: this means this node supports this change
5. ”Number”: this means this node is actively enforcing the change on the blocks and transactions it will accept from this block and forward

This can obviously be sybil attacked, and can therefore not be used as a single source of truth, but it does provide at least some kind of information.",1615796814,6,1

It would be very difficult to transport $100 million dollars worth of gold, but you could transport that amount of bitcoin within minutes for a tiny fee. That is the power of bitcoin. More people have access to a smart phone than banks and even toilets that means bitcoin is accessible to all corners of the world. Bitcoin is a world wide savings account that is accessible to every human on the planet that cannot be corrupted by government and is immune to inflation. Bitcoin will create equality, provide a even distribution of wealth and give you a return on your savings which is exactly why they want to ban it in India. Poor people may refuse to work for less if they start gaining wealth... so they must be kept poor to keep them running on the hamster-wheel. 

Instead of using a conventional Bank that only serves the Elite, Bankers and Government use Bitcoin as your savings account, liquidating when and what you need if you have to.

Instead of trying to argue with the market, this is the approach I am sticking with. I would like your feedback.

1. As long as 1 public companies buys per month, I stay. Someone withdrew 10,000 bitcoin off coinbase tonight. To me only a public company is buying $600 million dollars worth. Most individual billionaires do NOT have billions in cash. Someone who spent 600 million in cash most likely has at least 2 billion in cash.
2. The vast majority of people I know-many with 150,000-250,000 yearly/single income, are either in the stage of ""bitcoin is a fraud"", defensive-""I have some"" aka I have almost none and am embarrassed I didn't buy earlier \[but I will panic buy at 75-100k\], or everything is fine in the economy/no inflation/random article I read.

\*When these people start buying heavily, I will partially sell. I have about 8 people I check in with regularly.

m5m12r,Pasilanmies,Energy use per transfer,"I get that mining consumes a ton of energy. 

What I don’t get is the calculation on pages such as the one on this website

[https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/)

that say that per transfer energy use would be over 700kWh. The cost of that amount of electricity is way, way waaay more than the average transfer cost. So I don’t buy it. 

I get that the energy use per BTC mined has gone up exponentially with popularity and halvings. 

But I don’t accept that total energy use divided by total transfers (which is what I presume they use?) is a valid way of calculating energy use per transfer.

Because if you use their numbers and send some random transactions with low transaction fees just for the lolz, you could easily burn almost a gigawatt hour of electricity for like 20 bucks/euro or so. Which seems unreasonable, to say the least.

The question is, what would be the correct way to calculate the energy cost of a btc transfer?

Maybe somehow calculate the kWh used per bitcoin, then divide it by the amount that is transferred?

Then again, that would make sending old coins mined by someone's GPU back in 2011 a lot more efficient than sending new coins. Which doesn't make much sense either, bcs bitcoin is fungible. 

Any ideas?",1615818956,14,1
m5m06q,tankydhg,Jist my two bitcoin,"These opinions are my own. NFA. IANAFA. 

I'm talking bitcoin only as it's my jam. Although this probably applies to all cryptos and share stocks.

For those who are just jumping on the bitcoin train here are my top 4 things to consider.

1. If you're not Elon Musk, dont yolo in and drop your life savings into crypto (will elaborate in point 3). Fiat is still the standard for now and crypto is volatile. You don't want to end up in a situation where you've lost your job, btc has ""corrected"" **cough crashed** and all your liquid assets are tied up in bitcoin. Will be a cold winter in that cardboard box waiting for your precious internet numbers to climb back up. Then again, by this time, the decoupling may be complete, fiat currencies worth less than the toilet tissues stuck to the bottom of Warren Buffetts Brooks shoe and you will be trickling down your new found wealth like the philanthropist you are.

2. Unless you're gambling somoene else's money, dont spend all day trying to time the market. You'll probably end up buying high and selling low (imagine buying a new mobile phone worth half your crypto (to get those sweet, sweet extra megarampixelbytes) to then hand (the now worthless thing) down to your cousins nephew 12 months later so you can buy a new and improved iGalaxy Plus. Nobody is silly enough to do that right? Which brings me to point 3.

3. Dollar cost averaging. Take some dollars from every pay check and buy some bitcoins (Admit it, you'll end up spending it on piss anyway). Buy doing this, you'll be buying in when the coin is at all time highs, all time lows, and everything in between. Over time, you'll always be buying bitcoin at the mean price, and assuming bitcoin will contine to increase in value, so too will your bitcoin investment. 

4. Bitcoin is a speculative investment. Do your DD and as Nonna always said (rhs) dont put all your eggs in one basket. 

So with that I say, time get off grid, fuck the banks and the illuminati, and the lizard people, too the moon, hodl, diamond dicks. Buy bitcoin homies.

I didn’t understand the markets then and held through the peaks and ended up in the bear market thinking I lost it all. But I held. Fast forward to now. I stupidly still never put anything into BTC because I’ve been waiting for LTC to catch up. I now realize that I need to move the majority of my holdings into btc for stability, but I can’t decide when to do that or even how. The best scenario I can come up with is hoping LTC goes parabolic after PayPal crypto merchant payments is launched later this month, then sell into GUSD and wait for the bear market to put it into BTC.

can someone maybe give me a bit of input that started like me abit later? did you invest it asap or did you try to buy the dips? i know that mathematicly i should just buy now since im hodling anyways, but its easier said then done.

 I hear two theories aboit that:

1.) Everyone can be rich, if thir country invests in BTC. But that makes no sense. We still need a industry to provide us with real stuff like food and electronics. But noone is going to invest in those industries if the return is going to be maybe 10%, which you can easily surpass with investing in BTC. That means goods become way more expensive becasue those companies need to make earnings, over the deflation rate of BTC. That means less people have acess to goods. 

2.) The early birds are going to be incredibly rich. That makes sense, but it sucks. We still have the same problems as we have today, only more extreme. There are a few superriches and the rest basically works for them. The super-rich don't even have to do anythin entrepreneur like. They just hold BTC and let anyone work for them.

However, one aspect which concerns me is the possibility of countries starting to transition into digital currencies similar to what the Chinese government is doing( and part of the reason why they banned Bitcoin I assume).

Wouldn't this make bitcoin disappear or obsolete? 

If more developed countries try to go this route, wouldn't they also pass laws to ban cryptos similar to what India is doing in order to pursue their own digital currencies?

If someone with more knowledge on this subject could enlighten me, that would be great.

Thank you.",1615812451,3,1

Just a quick search and it is currently ESTIMATED that 20% of Bitcoin has been lost. 

This gives the illusion that BTC is sitting at a $1T market cap but reality is saying it is actually $800B. One thing I know about humans is that we are dumb and don't learn from other's mistakes, so I expect this percentage to increase.

Of course, no one really knows how much BTC is lost but my question on this or food for thought is - if the number of BTC is in fact heavily reduced then couldn't the potential of market cap in 10 years be a lot higher?

I'm asking because some people are saying ""$10m per coin... As if that'll ever happen"" but this I haven't seen much talk on this point yet... Im also asking because I am new and I want hope for the moon too

Since discovering BTC I’ve come to realize that gold’s top uses at this point are:

1) Anticorrosive Electrical Conductivity
2) Shiny (looks nice for jewelery and other works of art)

Gold now has more value, in my mind, as a visual identifier for BTC than it does for any purpose other than as a conductor. As a store of value it is obsolete. We just don’t have anything else that is close enough to compare BTC to that we have to rely on something as ill-equipped as gold to represent it.",1615740896,7,1

I know that a key factor is counterfeitability by rewarding those who solve the problems and check the validty of each purchase (miners) with bitcoins. But if the limit for bitcoins (21 Mil) is reached, who takes responsibilty to keep updating and checking the blockchain since you can't generate any profit/bitcoin out of it?

I guess a reason would be to keep the system alive by highly invested partys (which would keep on checking Ledges for free) but the average miner will stop probably and the more volume the crypto has the more miners would be required to keep it alive... thus exponentially decreasing in efficency if miners quit due to the lack of reward.

""9 March: JPMorgan launches 'crypto exposure' product

An SEC filing on Tuesday by the bank showed it is creating a ""basket of companies with exposure to cryptocurrency"" that will be dominated by MicroStrategy and Square.
JPMorgan will create debt products linked to the performance of the crypto basket, giving investors indirect exposure to the cryptocurrency market.""

Is this similar as in the movie? Or a start to something similar? Correct me if I'm wrong, I don't understand this.

Thinking about that CDO? CMO? putting bad mortgages together in a basket. And you can long/short the basket. And long/short the people that long/short on the basket. And so on....I think?

Or is this just etf on a fund? Is there a difference?

I realize it's our money,  but as with anything the effing government gets its hooks in there are a lot of moving parts.  Back when banks were sending out credit cards unsolicited (actual cards not just offers) there was an incredible amount of fraud.  People claimed they didn't get the card and many didn't.  Others got the card, used it and claimed it wasn't them.  The result was FRB Regulation E in 1978.
The consumer was protected from loss over a nominal amount. But the result of that was the banks could protect themselves in an assortment of ways.  For example if you are traveling they might ask you to verify transactions up front.  A more grey area is they have the right to just say ""no"" in some cases. Another example is an old person being scammed and wanting to take out their life savings to buy tulip blubs. Depending on the bank and where the funds are going and the amount there might be workarounds. So it would be best to check up front with your bank and exchange.

The share price of $0.022 is an easy way to accumulate a huge position. It tracks the price of Bitcoin well. I notice if bitcoin goes up by 3x, CCTL goes up 42x!!!

Here’s an example: 
Dec 7, 2020 - Feb 17, 2021
Bitcoin goes up from $19k to $56k (3x increase)

CCTL went up from 0.001 to 0.042 = (42x increase!)

So let’s assume BItcoin today at price of $60k triples again to $180k. Then I expect my CCTL to increase 42x fold again! Retail FOMO hasn’t even happened yet. 

My family account has just under $170K. Just multiply that by 42x and that’s $7.14M!!!!!!

Even if you only have $10k invested x 42 = $420k!!!!

Just think about how many miners there are that are now at $0.70, 0.80, $1, $5, etc. They all started at 2 cents!!!! So why can’t CCTL get up there?!

When I see the line graph any crypto currencies on my watch list they show trends that don't seem to be the same as the graphs you see when when you actualy go into that currency and look at the live, daily monthly etc..  It almost feels as of Robinhood is trying to promote certain cryptos and even stocks by picking and choosing which section of time history to show for it to put it in either the best or worst light possible while viewing as a watch list. Please take a look and tell me of I am crazy as I fully admit I am a bit of a conspiracy thinker.  

That leads me to wonder why? I believe Robinhood is the owner of a mega doge wallet and therefore naturally has interest allied with dogecoin value going up. I believe Robinhood skims from market price orders and has been taking a piece of the action and moving it into their own wallet. 

Example say you put in a market buy for $100 worth of dogecoin. You get documentation you got x number of shares but the pricing usually isn't the most attractive. I believe they are actually just giving you a crappy price on paper so you get fewer shares but really getting the shares at a better price thus have more and pocketing the difference.

m4uxqb,minimally__invasive,"Buckle up, hold on tight to your butts! It's going to be a bumpy ride.","OG coiner here offering some psychological assistance to noobs. In order to keep sane and keep strong hands, I advice you to realize IN ADVANCE OF THIS HAPPENING that Bitcoin can go down as fast as it can go up. Be prepared to experience a 50-80% dip. If you have been around for long enough, you've already had 2 or 3 of these events probably. Maybe even more.

The ones that held through are the ones that we look up to today. Will you be strong enough to hold? Will you be panic selling when you see your investment melt away? I am not telling you this because I'm invested myself. In fact I don't think that reddit users even can more the price anymore these days. I'm not looking for confirmation. I am, however, sharing this because I truly believe that Bitcoin will stick around, and if it sticks around, it's nearly inevitable that it goes 100x beyond your imagination. 

It has happened so many times. It will happen again. I prepare myself to watch it go to 150k from here and dump back to 50k plus minus whatever. It could go higher, it could go lower. I am absolutely unable to predict the top, nor the bottom, so I won't even bother timing the market. I will do what I always do: dump mit shitcoin fiat into btc, one pay check at a time. No matter the price. The point is that you should prepare yourself *today* for the crash that might come *tomorrow*. I'm holding until Valhalla and I am only able to do this because I'm fine with the bloodbath that might come. Are you able to hold through the horror? 

Of course I have no effing clue what's going to happen in the future so don't take this as financial advice, I've literally made all this up.

m4ut2r,funnybitcreator,Sending Fiat is a hundred times more difficult than sending Bitcoin,"I still believe Bitcoin will rise to higher prices this marked cycle, but have recently taken some profit and are in the process of moving fiat money. 

I have come to realize that sending fiat money is much more difficult than sending bitcoin, I turns out that coinbase is perfectly willing to accept bank transfers from my country, but you can not withdraw fiat via bank transfer to a number of countries. 

So I then had to transfer coins to another exchange. Here only a limit amount of fiat is allowed to be withdrawn at a time, and it takes 2-5 days before they approve the sending. Then it's the banks turn, of course nothing happens friday through sunday, and then it takes a few more days for them to transfer the money. 

I have to repeat this process probably 10-20 times, so it will take months to actually move this fiat. The worst part is while I have 100% confident that my bitcoin transfer can not be stopped, sized, or in any way interrupted by anyone. I have a very real worry that the banks will flag fiat transfers to my account, call me up and ask what is going on. Perhaps even freeze my account or the exchanges accounts. 

In conclusion, I have reached a point where I trust cryptocurrencies more than the traditional banking system.",1615726346,9,1

Now this was before the current bull run cycle. The conversations were always light hearted cause we thought we'd had missed the opportunity.   


I've learned my lesson and I don't want to potentially be having the same conversation in a few years time.  I've jumped on board and pumped in 1k last week. I've excepted that I mightn't be able to own a full bit coin without financially screwing myself but I'll be happy with 20-30% of one with what people are saying that it could be worth 500 k - 1 million in 5-10 years. No one knows when it might dip and I do need money for the not too future for wedding/mortgage and if it dips below my initial purchase I won't have the cash to hand. No one should stretch themselves that far but people do get greedy.  


I have now entered the game and I feel that this time that it's different with all the big boys entering. With them in the game it has added a sense of reliability and security  and as a noobs opinion, I can't see it tanking below 30k again due to them. I'm going in with the mind set that a piece of the pie is better than none of it. The whole idea of people waiting for a small dip  to buy in or to buy more is strange to me. If you really believe in it, are those small percentage really going to make a major difference.  Of course it will if you are pumping in high volumes but waiting to pump in $500. Come on ! These same people who talk about sticking in will shit the bed once it goes down to a certain level. Congrats to the people who stuck in after the last bull run cycle.

In summary I've finally jumped on and lets hope I can look back at this post and be content with just being finically comfortable as I would have been coming out of the last bull run cycle instead of greed taking over my mindset as I see with others now.

I put this out there because I have yet to find a way to do so. Hodlng is great but it will never free me from the daily grind of a 9 to 5. My gains will have to be realized at some point to do this. 

Selling BTC doesn't make sense because of the tax implications and the certainty of missing out on future gains. Using a lending platform almost seems like the answer but then I'd be giving up my keys, a risk I'm not willing to take. Something similar would be using my BTC as collateral to take out a loan to invest for a period of time. The BTC would be  returned once the loan is paid off and the investment term completed. Again, here I'd be giving up my keys.

All of these ideas seem promising but too risky, so has anyone come up with a secure solution to earn a passive income hodlng BTC? 

Also, I should mention I've looked into upcoming Defi platforms like Sovryn. This DApp will allow for lending from your wallet on the Bitcoin layer 2 network but your coins must be swapped for rBTC first. Swapping, at least where I live generates a taxable event.....",1615758884,38,1

Then, I was able to make an account with Guarda for desktop and found out how to get it in the app, and even use it to convert some of it to Dogecoin. Great!

SO, now I am trying to figure out how to Sell Bitcoin for IF or WHEN I want to, but haven't done it yet - *(please no troll comments about how I shouldn't and should just hold, lol. I just want to know the skill.)* I contacted Guarda support but learned they don't support Selling crypto, just buying/exchanging, which sucks.

I found about Coinbase and signed up there because I learned I could Sell. And I was able to do a small sample and Buy/Sell well, and even linked my bank, so - awesome! However, downside, I learned they don't support importing wallets/private keys (not sure which I'd even use), so you can only buy/sell from entirely in Coinbase from what I understand... Bummer.

So I don't understand HOW or WHAT platform I can use to:

1. Move/Import my crypto from Guarda to somewhere else (Where accepts this? Do I use the wallet address? The private key??)
2. Sell said crypto from either the platform I imported to, or find out *how* to sell from Guarda instead of worrying about moving them? People HAVE to be selling from them somehow...

I just think it's dumb that Coinbase and Guarda both were missing an important crypto management feature that makes this process hard for a newbie like me. There could be a good reason for it, but that's way over my head.

I looked up other sites too like Kraken and signed up, but I also don't understand if/how to move my currency from Guarda to there, and then how to connect my bank account. Coinbase seemed to put everything in lamen terms, and Kraken seemed super complicated to understand by comparison.

Any Bitcoin/crypto guru who wants to take the time to observe and give feedback on my predicament would be super appreciated! This has all been very frustrating for me. 😰",1615757085,6,1

I've read conflicting information about sweeping old keys from a non-HD source into a modern HD wallet. So far, I've just had people sweep keys, from an old QR code for example, into a temp wallet and send it to a long term HD wallet just to be safe. I'm not sure that's required or even optimal.

* Some sources suggest swept keys won't be part of an HD wallet's seed backup.
* Other articles suggest swept keys are now generally sent to a valid address in the HD address chain.
* I've read lightning transactions aren't backed up by HD wallet seeds, which seems odd.
* See that SegWit support requires a change in wallet format, but I'm not sure why that is. I thought that was a wire-level protocol change.
* What about an Armory wallet? Are there any modern wallets that can read the wallet mnemonic or its seed file? Is that even still around?",1615756342,7,1

First of all I would like to thank you for this community.  
I am happy to write here with people who have the same interests as me.

I am writing this post because I would like to read your answers.

If you do, what would you do if bitcoin reaches your ""price target""?  
Do you buy your dream car, travel to many countries, set aside some for your kids, or even invest it?

I love animals. I have two cats. They were found in a cardboard box in the middle of the forest shortly after they were born. Their eyes were not even open.

When I was looking for two cats, I visited some animal shelters. They looked abnormal.  
When I got there, I was really shocked.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I had an experience there that I would rather not have seen.  
At the dog cages I found a female dog sitting in a small, cold and uncomfortable cage.  
She looked very sad. Wow... crying rn...

She was 16 years old and spent her whole life in that small cage. It still hurts me to think about it.  
At that moment I swore I would never have to see something like that again in my life.  
Apparently no one wanted her because she had a serious injury and didn't look healthy anymore.  
I think she had already lost the will to live.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate myself right now for not giving her a nice home.

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot more in Bitcoin than just making quick money but if I have the chance to get a lot of money with Bitcoin, then I will set up a modern shelter with comfortable places to sleep, large areas to run etc. and hire a lot of staff so that every single animal has a human friend by their side who are there for them in good times and also in bad times.

The animal shelters here with us simply lack the money. No shelter gets help from the government. They all depend on donations. Often there is even a lack of food and sleeping places they often have no more. It is sad to have to see such things.

&amp;#x200B;

I am sorry if this is an emotional contribution. These are my thoughts and a big dream that I hope to realize together with bitcoin and share with the community here someday.

m536ig,chongoman69,How Crypto has been helping me get a brand new Fender Stratocaster 86 for my brother,"My brother once told me about a friend we have that has a brand new Stratocaster Fender 86 from the U.S and how he thinks it's like the Best Guitar in the world. He loves playing guitar and he's been doing it since he was 3 years old. He went to music school and he is very very talented.

Now because of this covid thing he has been out of the job and feeling a bit depressed about his life, he is only 18 and I believed we all went through that, at least here in Argentina where things can get difficult sometimes, but he plays his guitar or piano every day, so that's a very good sign for all the family. 

My friend will sell his guitar for US$800 so that's why I decided to start saving 100 dollars each month until his birthday (December 6) so I can buy him that Fender Stratocaster he once told me, so the plan for the last 2 months have been investing everything I got on BCH (10%), BNB (10%) LINK (10%) and the rest for HBAR (70%).  

The goal of my post is to point out a real case where Crypto is enabling literally everyone to achieve its dreams and goals by simply trusting in the system. Now by seeing my original investment almost 5x I'm starting to get the feeling I'm really understanding this amazing gift that ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" gave to the average Joe like me living in a Third World country like Argentina, where politics are constantly robbing us with 5% minimum inflation per month and salaries are always at the same level. 

Now I own more than 800 dollars of those beautiful coins and my plans are not to sell them until my brother's birthday and I'm completely up to the challenge. I had to sell a bit when reaching the end of both months, to keep up with expenses but didn't feel bad because I was always in a profit and I honestly don't think I'll regret it because Crypto is helping me keep up with my daily expenses and I'm good with that.

Just need some quick advice on contributing to Bitcoin in the next 7-10 years before retirement (and before I have no more work income to contribute to bitcoin) I plan on retiring early in about 7-8 years if I can do it..Otherwise, 10 years out is the ""regular"" plan. I will also have a teacher's pension to collect in that 10 years after I quit.

So, I have a little less than one bitcoin--more than .5, less than .8--have been contributing money each month since 13K price point.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on continuing to accumulate over the next year...about 1K a month--and perhaps more accumulation in that amount in 2022.

I am long on Bitcoin---but has anyone thought about strategies in reducing contributions (tiered reduction I suppose) before you head into retirement? For example, let's say in 3 years, BTC makes a major correction, or in 4, or in 5...Whatever. Does anyone plan on contributing a little less over time to plan for major corrections--IF they happen (and they likely will--but we all know that they are often short-lived)

\--Or is this just a ridiculous idea---and would you rather contribute (DCA even) continuously--the same monthly amount-- until the end of time?

Also, has anyone or is anyone getting interest on their bitcoin in a BTC savings account, and if so, through whom? Is that something people might want to consider now, or later, or either? And does a BTC savings account seem like a solid idea for a retiree (collecting the interest as passive income)

m52cj5,papaducci,mBTC rather than BTC,"1 mBTC is one millibitcoin. One thousandth of a Bitcoin.

Instead of quoting the price as $60,000 (current price) for 1 btc it would be $60 USD for one mBTC.

$60 per mBTC is much easier for the general public to get their heads around. Many more people would be willing to buy a bunch of mBTC at $60 than buying 1 btc at $60,000 since most people in the general public arent even aware you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin.

Also, it is much easier to convert for day to day usage a $60 mBTC than a $60,000 BTC.

How much easier is it to figure out  that a $30 bottle of wine is simply half an mBTC?

Compare that to calculating $30 in terms of BTC. good luck tonthe average person with that.

mBTC is in effect better for everyday use for any product that is less than $60,000 which is all day to day products and usage.

mBTC is easier for everyone and more useful in everyday transactions and it would benefit everyone if it were the reference go to price for bitcoin.

m52a3b,El_Pipila_,"OFFER-DEMAND RULE, SIMPLICITY","I think DOGECOIN is just way better than BTC and I’m not going to enter to technical reasons but just think this.
BTC is a currency with a LIMITED quantity of Coins. Based on the DEMAND-OFFER LAW that rules our world we can say that bitcoin OFFER is just limited but the demand will probably increase, this means that BTC will be kind off “exclusive” because the price would be incredibly expensive but this isn’t great because just few would have this access to have many bitcoins.
Then let’s see the other side, DOGECOIN is a currency that doesn’t have limited quantity of coins this make a easier access to ALL people, then instead of having .000000099 BTC you could have 1 DOGECOIN, You need to know and understand that DEMAND-OFFER in DOGE will be in a healthy growth because as it increase the demand of DOGECOIN, the OFFER would be increasing too. DOGECOIN IS PEOPLE CURRENCY!🚀
Let me tell you some historical events for you to understand what I’m SURE DOGE is way better than BTC, in Mexico on the 50’s have the currency at a high number. A Mexican peso in 1950’s was valued as 1,000 pesos in that time, then the country decide to ELIMINATE the last 3 CEROS just for an easier control, that’s why in 1980’s  1,000 pesos (on 1950’s) were worth 1 peso. All this didn’t affect anyone because it’s not devaluation is just a change on its equality, so if you had 1,000,000 pesos un 1950’s on 1980’s it was worth the 1,000 pesos and you could buy the same things. 
BTC is a currency that most of the people would never have more than 1, and as obvious reason it’s way better to buy something that has a cost of 1 DOGE than the same thing that cost .00000099BTC

Some of these shorts probably have decent leverage and once the market direction switches with confidence things will be much different.  Whenever there is an event in a market which causes a decline, shorts take advantage and they move in like sharks to keep the sentiment downward and the price action going down, triggering stops, and causing more sell offs.

Government, traditional Wall Street, and other big wigs are NOT happy with Bitcoin and crypto. They are quickly realizing that they cannot control it, and are not yet ready to concede loss.

We're entering the fighting stage. They will fight BTC with all of their might and this WILL drive price down. They will punish the companies dealing in crypto, punish the people using it, and try to publish all manner of FUD about how bad it is for the environment and how bad it is morally. (Just look at what Bill Gates has said about it. Basically, it makes people too free.)

This fight might be long and it WILL be devastating to the crypto market and industry. We can easily trace back down to the teens $k. Sure,, we might see a run-up to $250k and then the fight only bring us back to $100k if they don't start fighting us hard for a while yet.

But it is coming. If you're getting into crypto, be sure you have the backbone to stay in it for 5 years or more because it may take that long to come back to green on your position.

Most importantly, keep using it. Keep buying, keep selling, start using it as a bank account, start using it for trade on facebook marketplace and craigslist. It is the only hard money and it will win,, eventually, but you can help it win quickly or you can sit and hodl until the rest of us do, but it is inevitable at this point.

Lets see what happens when you help make a random person a millionaire.  

I am just your average middle aged person.   I'm 43, married, 1 9-year old son.   I spend 1/2 my day working to take care of my family and I spend the other 1/2 spending time with my wife/son, getting him ready for school in the morning and running him to/from practices and games in the afternoon and conducting bible study and prayer at night.   We live in a nice area of Southern California, but don't own a home and have the same financial struggles as most families.   We are just your average, every day family.  

Lets see what happens if you make us millionaires. 

You donate $1 or more into making me a millionaire $1,000,000.     

When I get to $1,000,000 I will begin a non-profit that will continue to take donations looking to make RANDOM people millionaires.   I will solicit ideas on how to award that million, whether it be a  random selection from people that donate or a committee that selects one person (from a pool of applicants based on their story) and make a you tube channel out of it in which we post the stories from start to finish.   

This is a fluid experiment.   I will take all suggestions seriously and adapt on the fly.",1614710019,0,1

[Click here to read the original source.](https://mosttraded.com/2021/03/02/goldman-sachs-into-crypto/)

 Crypto was once shunned at elite firms like Goldman Sachs, but is now gaining credibility as other banks and financial institutions outline their efforts. BNY Mellon said in mid February that it will hold, transfer and issue digital currencies, a step it called the first by a global bank to provide clients with such services. Mastercard Inc. has also said it will allow cardholders to transact in cryptocurrencies on its network. The firm is “actively engaging” with central banks around the world on their plans to launch new digital currencies, it said last month.

mga5v5,squeeze_tooth_paste,Help me understand Bitcoin Economics,"I've read a good bit about Bitcoin, but there is one question that bothers me a lot: 

**""Bitcoin fixes inflation"" &lt;- is this really true?** 

*1. Fed conducts monetary policy*

In the economy as it is right now, the federal reserve controls the money supply using open market operations (monetary policy). If it wants to increase the money supply, they buy bonds from banks (gives banks more money) If it wants to decrease the money supply, they sell bonds to the banks (takes money from banks). 

AFAIK, This is how the Fed ""prints"" money. By buying bonds from banks. Not using a printing press. 

*2. Monetary policy helps mitigate recession &amp; control inflation*

AFAIK, we need this monetary policy because it helps control unemployment and inflation throughout the business cycle. There's a classic explanation from Ray Dalio's youtube vid on economic machine. Businesses need loans, banks give out loans, the leverage stimulates growth, economy expands. At some point, businesses need to pay back loans, and business growth stifles, economy contracts, potentailly to recession or panic.  

If businesses and banks start using unsustainable amount of loans. They increase the interest rate (reduces incentive for taking out loans, therefore reduces money supply, reduces inflation) and limits expansion. The fed can also stimulate growth in a recession by lowering interest rates (increases money supply), and mitigating the contraction. 

*3. Currently, we equate growth to inflation* 

As we've seen, growth comes from loans. loans create 'new money' that businesses can use for growth. Creating this 'new money' inevitably increase the money supply, and leads to inflation. 

AFAIK, the only way economy grows with deflation is if the country's production, usually through some innovation, creates more goods than is demanded, and purchasing power of the currency increases. But this is an ideal scenario, usually is not the case in a lot of countries. Most times, businesses need loans to grow. 

*4. Bitcoin is deflationary.* 

Yes, you can't create bitcoin out of thin air like the fed buys bonds from banks. The increase in supply will asymptotically reach an end, and there will be limited supply. 

Limited supply + demand in the money(btc) market  = deflation. 

**Expanding money supply is needed for economic growth, but Bitcoin has limited supply...**

5. Bitcoin as a ""solution"" to inflation (ignoring the tech or commodity view, just currency)

It's true that bitcoin is not deflationary. But this deflation seems different from the natural positive deflation the economy wants. The 'positive' deflation comes from the ecnomy's growth in production, and where businesses produce so much that they start lowering prices and increasing purchase power of the currency. On the other hand, Bitcoin's deflation is from its limited supply unrelated to economic growth.

Yes, current inflation sucks because increase in money supply devalues currency while appreciating asssets. This reduces purchasing power of the lower income class that owns less assets and enriches the upper class that owns a lot of assets. This sucks. Bitcoin does prevent this from happening which is good. But if money supply can not expand, how could the government stimulate economic growth? 

***6. Central question:*** *can there by economic growth without expanding the bitcoin supply?* 

There will inevitably be a period of economic slowdown where production slows and unemployment rises. If there is no way to incentivize loans in the bitcoin system (unlike the fed who can lower interest rates), there will be no solution to recover from a recession. 

**Conclusion/TLDR:** In a decentralized system of wallets and bitcoins with no banks, and where there is no way to incentivize increase or decrease of money supply, there will be no business cycle of expansion and contraction. If we cannot create credit, economy cannot be driven forward. Then how can bitcoin be sustainable as a global currency?",1617088146,27,1

mg9my9,mrbiggelsworth07,HFSP-An easy path to poverty,"Not investment advice. At all.

There's three main reasons I've determined people hfsp. For those that don't know, this means have fun staying poor. This is not ONLY money...this is also a state of mind.

1. Risk avoidance. You can have hfsp in $, but you can also hfsp in friends, dating, health, and overall happiness. I have 2 friends who literally refuse to make any real attempts at dating, and then wonder why they don't have relationships. I don't hate to break it to you-life has risks. Any surefire or easy bet is a fast path to the poor house. You know who I think buys bitcoin when it's ""safe"". The people at $500,000. In this climate of massive prin$ing, I believe saving tons of cash is a sure fire way to poverty. Avoiding all risk is the biggest risk of all.
2. No real plans. Do you have a plan? I sure as hell don't for much of my life. I better write it down. You know why gamblers lose? Because their real plan is to leave the casino with no money left. Write your goals down. I'm over the bitcoin maximalist stuff coming from people who try to shame those who sell. Some people in crypto have $10,000,000 and no family-they can take the massive swings. Other's can't. Whether your goal is to get to $10,000 or $100,000,000-write your goals down, and how you expect to get there. Most of my friends who have not bought homes have not done so because of lack of $-in fact, they have the highest paying jobs, the most saved, etc...they have no plan.
3. Don't be a victim-educate yourself. Do you think you are smart? I'm sure as hell not. Most of us are average, and many below average, thinkers. You want to make $? Go after the people that have real $$. Understand what it took. Ask questions. Don't be fake. Ask real questions. Go on twitter. Look up videos on youtube. Look at the pros and cons. Don't try to be a smart ass....try to educate yourself.

And maybe...you don't have to be HFSP.",1617085696,4,1

mg64go,KansasKid24,Knowing When to Buy the Dip - If you're thinking about selling right now DON'T &amp; Why you shouldn't," 

Ok ladies &amp; gents,

To some, this recent pull back might look like a repeat of the correction after Elon's candle but it's not.

Here's why:

1. Adoption is increasing (Visa, MasterCard, Tesla, Square, PayPal, JPM, GS, BNY, BlackRock). All of these companies don't mess around and are all taking action towards adopting crypto.
2. Inflation - Do I really need to explain this? Go look at the M2 money supply or the price of any commodity over the last year and you'll get the picture
3. Interest rates might be increasing but they can't go that high. Look up Operation Twist for more info, this is a can of worms I don't want to open right now but basically short-term rates are going up for the near future and long-term rates will go down incentivizing long-term investment in the economy. This will balance out over time and people worrying about rates jumping shouldn't because it would literally break the entire world economy if you don't believe me refer to #2
4. The price is being manipulated right now for either institutions (most likely) or whales to accumulate at a lower price

Proof:

&amp;#x200B;

This is called a sell wall. To newbies, this may look like someone trying to offload a bunch of BTC so they can get out but this is an extremely common tactic seen in both the traditional financial markets as well as cryptocurrency markets. It works particularly well in crypto because volume is so low. The idea is (relatively) simple. Pretend you want to buy a bunch of BTC without pushing the price up too much. You can't buy it all at once so you need to spread it out over time. But hang on, doing that will cause a bunch of green candles in a row and everybody and their mom will jump in on the action so what do you do?

You pretend you're selling a bunch for more than what you want to buy it for. This will scare people into selling at or below your sell wall, allowing you to buy up all their BTC for the price you want. Once you have what you want, you take away the sell wall (prepare for launch) and buy up until people join in (to the moon) . This is what happening literally right now so if you're selling stop. My guess is there will be an announcement soon about another company investing in BTC or an investment bank/hedge fund just got they're trading desk running.

TL;DR - Always buy the dip.",1617072349,42,1

That said, guess what…it’s tourney time!

Bitcoin is the #1 seed in its own bracket. Its opponent is #16 seed THORChain. Last year, the OG made it to the Final Four!

Those familiar with March Madness, or remember this from last year, will get it right away. Starting at midnight, on Twitter @ UltimateCrypto7, there will be a poll for each game, opens to all. The coin with more votes after 3 days will be declared the winner and move on. 

Like last year, the Ultimate Crypto Tournament pits the top 64 coins (by market cap) in a single elimination tournament. Crypto is a collaborative, cooperative space with room for all, but we can still have some fun.

So, vote early, tell your friends, and may the best coin win! The games begin at midnight tonight and run until 11:59 pm PT March 18.

m60jjc,afroman81,Bitcoin is the average mans golden ticket out of poverty. We are lucky.,"I was born in the ghetto, so to speak. No real opportunities. I was dealt a rough hand at life and made plenty of my own mistakes to make that hand worse.

Today, I invest in bitcoin because it’s the opportunity of a century, it’s the 21st century gold rush. An opportunity for someone like me to increase their wealth to a point that they can change their life.

I don’t know how far BTC will take me, if it’s lambos on the moon or not. If it’s not though, I take solace in the fact that it will still do well and I will be able to use it as a way to purchase things like properties and businesses in the future. Things that will allow my money to make more money. Things that always seemed unobtainable for someone like me. Things that will change my life for the better. 

Investing into bitcoin makes me feel like an immigrant coming to America when you actually *could* show up with a dollar and a dream and do something big. It makes me feel like there’s this opportunity right in front of me and I’m so lucky to be able to seize the opportunity.

I Invite many of you that aren’t swimming in coins already to join my like of thinking. If you got in later than most sure maybe you may not cash out your coins for 10’s of millions and have a lambo for each day but I’ll be damned if you still can’t change your life for the better.

mgtlvk,Crypteusz,Supercycles - new one possibly upcoming,"Supercycle - a term which is gaining popularity these days, applies to commodities . Basically what happens is surge in demand, which current supply struggles to cover, causes prices to sky-rocket from being under-valued to highly over-valued.
In my opinion Bitcoin and its' four-year cycle is the best example. The main event of the cycle is halving (halving the rewards of mining the Bitcoin ), which is causing supply-shock and aftermath in the form of speculative bubble.

I strongly believe we are about to see a supercycle in Uranium in the following years. Spot price of that commodity is right now under-valued to such an extent Cameco ( one of its largest global providers) is buying it from the spot market in order to meet the contracts and keeping some of its mines closed (waiting for the prices to rise). Currently there are about 440 active nuclear reactors and 50 being constructed (more than 10% of the actual number) mainly in China and India (respectively 16 and 6 as of March 2021). Interesting pair, isn't it? If the rest of the world does not want to stay behind they will have no choice but to follow that direction.
Nuclear energy is not opponent of wind and solar energy. It is their carbon-free companion versus the coal.

For instance, the first time (and currently the only time) I've used a machine, the price was approximately 52k at the time but the price on the machine was about 2k higher.  Today I found a machine that shows the cost as 70k when the cost on the app shows about 59k.

Can someone explain to me why there is such a difference or which is more accurate?

Any and all assistance is greatly appreciated.",1617149035,18,1

Therefore your return on investment is the same as well, because the ratio is always kept no matter the initial amount of zeroes for a unit (1 BTC).

However, the unit bias aka our instinctual need for completion puts us off buying because we cannot obtain 1 full BTC now as easily as we could have years ago.

However, investing now is as fruitful as it was the last few years and the next few years for the sole reason the ratio or ROI stays more or less the same regardless of the initial price.

I wanted to make a payment via bitcoin so i made an etoro account and bought some via paypal.

when i tried to transfer them to my wallet etoro told me i cant do that , i have to wait 60 days because i bought them via PayPal. So i just sold them again and took my money back.I was wondering if i could just do the same again but instead with bank transfer to be able to transfer them without any delay. They said there is no delay when you are paying with bank transfer but the examples they list in the FAQ make me confused.

 

Here are some examples:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Your first deposit was $200 via credit  card. After a month, you made a further deposit of $1,000 via bank  transfer. You opened a Bitcoin position with $1,200, but now it is only  worth $800. You can transfer the position now because the current value  of the position is lower than the amount deposited via bank transfer.  
 

&amp;#x200B;

1. You are a Bronze user and your first  deposit was $400 via bank transfer. After a month, you made a further  deposit of $600 via credit card. You opened a Bitcoin position with  $1,000. You can transfer the position, but only after 60 days have  passed since your first deposit (because you are a Bronze user and a  credit card was used to deposit).

Just 1 example to start...

(1) Let's say somebody bought 1 BTC a year ago.  Transfers it off exchange to his own wallet.

(2) Just yesterday, this person decides to buy $100 of BTC every Monday, but keep these DCA investments on the exchange to save on multiple transaction fees.

MY QUESTIONS.....

(1) Now that the FIFO and LIFO transactions are technically separated (First In is in personal wallet, Last In is on exchange)... If said person spends from either wallet or exchange, is this coin really distinguishable??   Because if they were in the same wallet they wouldn't be....  So would one need to make sure to spend, sell from one account or the other, or do all your coins just need to be recorded correctly / consistently as wholly owned by you? 
 Hope this is understandable....

(2) Which method would be better for this person if they want to keep as much BTC as possible, with as little fiat as possible... But *might* need to pull some money out in a few months??

I would think FIFO, because that way you don't have to pay short term capital gains, right

But OTOH, I was just thinking about this.  If this hypothetical person puts in $100/WK for 10 weeks, then needs to pull out $1,000... Even tho he'd have to pay more capital gains tax (10 weeks definitely short-term), his gain would be a lot less if he would need to withdraw some, since he's obviously riding a tight rope keeping 99% in BTC and only 1% or even less of possible in fiat.

This time, he continues to break the established notions of corporate practice that have been created over the centuries. Yesterday Elon Musk's company, Tesla Inc., filed [Form 8-K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000156459021012981/tsla-8k_20210315.htm) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stating that the outlined changes will take effect March 15.

And you know this wasn't to reported Tesla's acquisition of another $1.5 billion bitcoin? Elon Musk notified the SEC of a change in his position at Tesla and a change in the position of his CFO Zach Kirkhorn.

Since March 15, 2021, Elon Musk's official position at Tesla has changed from “CEO” to “*Technoking of Tesla*”. And the position of CFO of the company Zach Kirkhorn is now called the “*Master of Coin*”. Yup. Just like in the Game of Thrones.

Thus, although the position of Tesla CEO has formally changed, Elon Musk does not leave the post of CEO of Tesla, as expected. But with an official appeal, for example, government agencies, including the SEC, will have to indicate their new titles.

No explanation of this little madness from Elon Musk followed, except for the mysterious tweet published the day before: “Homo sapiens techno: Loves raves &amp; technology”.

 But that's not all. Today, he tweeted a music video about NFT, captioning it, ""I'm selling this NFT song like an NFT token.""

In the video a pyramid of gold coins rotates on the edge of the largest one: computers never sleep, on the edge of the upper HODL, and on the obverse, there is a carousel of carts carrying gold coins. But it didn't seem to you, the carts are harnessed to dog teams, where instead of horses there are Shiba Inu dogs, exactly the one on Dogecoin.

Yup, he just engages in madness 24/7, without interruption, professionally, and gets pleasure and money from this main occupation. It is unclear when he has time to do serious work. 

P.S. In fact, Elon Musk is mocking our new normality. His crypto-madness is just childish pranks compared to the madness in which we have been in the last year.",1615907598,2,1

It included 235 individuals. The survey covered stimulus expenses or what they expect Americans to purchase with the direct checks. Out of the whopping $1.9 trillion relief package signed by U.S. President Joe Biden, $380 billion is appropriated for direct stimulus checks.   
Survey participants also “prefer bitcoin over stocks.”

We’ll use one of our [Mining Insights Profitability Calculator](https://insights.braiins.com/profitability-calculator) to illustrate why miners should not be thought of purely as “sellers of BTC” who suppress price increases. **Miners are HODLers too.**

**Scenario #1:**

[insights.braiins.com](https://preview.redd.it/euovy2xrien61.png?width=954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d24e1fd52cd59de0b7fdc5799e04e1195cd9297)

☝️ This chart is an 18-month cash flow visualization for a miner with 6.8 PH/s of hashrate, all S17 Pros.

Bull market parameters:

\- Difficulty increases 4%/month 

\- Price increases 6.5%/month

In this projection, the miner sells all BTC into fiat each month and has an **end profit: $1.1MM**

**Scenario #2:**

[insights.braiins.com](https://preview.redd.it/lqjgn7msien61.png?width=952&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ea9f80590959f245069897c171987a1acaaaf6c)

☝️ This chart is for the exact same miner and all of the exact same inputs, with **one difference:**

**HODL Ratio = 100%**

All profits are kept in BTC instead of selling to fiat and the miner ends with an **end profit: $1.9MM**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We added the HODL Ratio input to our Profitability Calculator in order to make it more useful based on  [The Intelligent Bitcoin Miner](https://www.aniccaresearch.tech/blog/the-intelligent-bitcoin-miner-part-i), a report from Annica Research. It's a must read for understanding the evolution of the BTC mining industry.

&gt;**""The stupidest thing you can do is sell your bitcoin.""** \- Michael Saylor

m69kkb,WarrenMuppet007,Unbank the Banks.,"Man, this is going to be a rant.   
This is my frustration with traditional banking system.   


I approached 2 brick and mortar bank i.e. Deutsche and Sparkasse in Germany to ""**inquire**"" about opening a business account. Mind you not the account opening state just to weigh which would be better.   
I have a crypto side hustle which I want to get incorporated. So I am in the process of collecting information.  


Following is my experience:  
Deutsche bank:  
I have an account here, so it was my first choice to ask.    
We need proof. So I say ok , what kind of proofs you need.  (I know I have to show payout from mining or whatever, I have it).

My colleague will get back to you. It's been a month and **NO ONE** has got back to me.   


Sparkasse:

Well glad Germany has more banks, so I go to Sparkasse as one fellow redditor [recommend](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m4r8da/bank_recognised_my_btc_when_getting_a_mortgage/gqwlmhs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)them to be not crypto hostile.  
   
So I show up with a list of questions in my hand. The person I interacted with was really friendly but she had very limited knowledge, so she rings up her colleague and the person on the other end, boy what do I say about her. To begin with ""DO YOUR FUCKING JOB YOU ARE BEING PAID FOR"".   
She right up said , NO. Ask him to go to his own bank and open account there. I mean I was there just to ask for the procedure and what facilities they provide. They just gave me a piece of paper and said read it yourself.   
I mean these are private banks, but employees don't give a fck about potential customers.   


I understand they have a right to refuse service if they don't want. but **THIS IS THE BARRIER TO ENTRY.** 

And **THIS IS WHY WE NEED BITCOIN.**   
Imagine the opportunity cost I would suffer if I had to go through traditional banking system to setup my business and running around and being at their mercy.   


Rant over.  
TLDR: Went to bank to ask about business account and they won't even answer questions of a potential client.",1615902847,16,1

With Autarky you can harness the full power of decentralized leveraged on #bsc!


Let's say you want to swap 10 $BNB for $AUTO because you know its price will go up by 20%.
🚀🚀With Autarky you can borrow up to 10x of your initial investment and multiply your 10 $BNB up to 100 $BNB.


💰💰So when the $AUTO price increases, instead of a profit of 2 $BNB(20%) you'll get 20 $BNB minus a small percent that goes to the liquidity providers, insurance fund and burn mechanism.

mgnic7,Reasonable_Eye_8263,"""Stealth Wealth"" and bitcoin advocacy","This is a good problem to have question. Throwaway account due the nature of this post.

I have been talking about bitcoins for the better part of a decade. I'd often have conversations with friends and family and coworkers about this subject (including my, now boss, but then co-worker years ago). For a while when bitcoin was in the news my coworkers knew I was the 'bitcoin buy' to talk to about it. Back in early days people would ask ""How many bitcoins do you have?"" etc. Luckily, I never answered that question.

However, now with the price movements over the last several months and the just the general amount of press it has received, I am starting to realize people's attitude toward me has started to shift. In 2017, I mentioned perhaps after too much wine, that we had ""made"" like 10k in one day to my mother-in-law and then the other day I said something was expensive and she replied to the effect of ""what does price matter to you?"" and so on. Coworkers same story. In a meeting the other day my boss introduced me ""the guy that's just working for fun, because he is a bitcoin millionaire"". Of course I joke it off.

I do not want to flaunt my wealth, and I think that in another world, if I had made a ton on general investing for instance, sure I might have discussed investing with friends, but they wouldn't have known I had made this much because I wouldn't have done much to show it. Maybe take an early or partial retirement, but I am keeping my same car and house and what not and I'd prefer for lots of reasons, mainly that people are really weird about money, that anyone but especially friends and family don't know exactly to what extent our net worth has grown (obviously the taxing authorities in our country would have some idea when and if I sell for fiat).

My wife and I have adopted a 'steer the conversation away from bitcoin' strategy for now. But I \*do\* want to talk about them. 

I'm thinking some here are the same boat. I am wondering if anyone has found any serious strategies to ""clawback"" people's perception of them, that doesn't involve outright lying, or has that ship sailed? I am thinking about making a non trivial charitable donation and when it comes up in conversation saying something like we gave 'a lot' to charity and let people think we don't have much left.",1617131419,6,1

Now, I am selling an item I have in a game for $5000, and I figured that making the sale via Bitcoin would be the safest option (compared to PayPal, etc.). 

I would theoretically be having the BTC sent to my mobile wallet, but I'm not sure how I would exchange this into real money - and I was wondering if it would be possible to link my wallet to CashApp (or just send the money to the CashApp wallet), sell the $5000 worth of BTC on CashApp, and then withdraw from a linked bank account. Or, is it possible to simply exchange the $5000 BTC to PayPal without going through an actual exchange service like Coinbase or Paxful? If neither of these are very good, in the future I would probably make a Coinbase account and just use that.

Any recommendations or help is appreciated! Sorry for the silly questions! :)",1617128137,7,1

Now I don't need that money so I won't be selling anytime soon but I've been thinking. What's the end game here? When does one actually sell? Will that time even ever come? 

I've heard of many stories and I'm sure you all have as well about people selling ridiculous amounts of bitcoin for a pizza or something similar and how those are worth in the millions now. Will it ever truly reach a point where it holds its same value long enough for people to not find it a waste to spend it? 

Like I personally have thought about selling a bit here and there to buy a few things in the past but there's always been that thought in the back of my head telling me I'd be making a huge mistake... and it turns out it was right, because its gone up since. 

Seems to me like we're stuck in this endless loop of buying and never selling, for the most part, and it will continue rising even if very slowly at times, so it will always be a waste to sell.

One BTC is around 105,000,000,000 Bs. Monthly minimum wage is 1,800,000 Bs. (less than 1 USD) and a personal news.","&amp;#x200B;

Hi guys, it was almost the same than last week.

Around 4,000,000 USD in weekly trades.

This is only measured using LocalBitcoin as they publish they weekly date, since months ago Binance opened P2P trade with Bolivares, I suspect a lot of people are moving to Binance.

There are other exchanges like AirTM and UPHOLD and even some local ones (with maybe the goverment behind) like Amberescoin and Cryptia.

A big part of the population that work for the goverment have a wage of between 1 and maybe 10 monthly minimum wages, yes, that is true. They need to do something else to survive.

I think average wage is like 10-15 USD weekly, which is much better but still not enough. A family needs at least 300USD monthly to ""live"".

On a personal note, I got COVID, I did think it was just a flu but days ago I lost my taste and smell. Here there is no easy way of getting PCR test and there is not nationwide vaccine plan, goverment says ""f\*ck you, save yourself you are in our own"". I'm resting and I hope I didn't infect people close (like my parents :().

I spend around 40 USD purchasing some medicines (vitamins, acetaminophen and so on) and just to treat it like a flu. MOONS have helped me a lot, even with these expenses (I have to cash out the ones I have soon :()

One monthly minimum wage (1 USD) is around:

* 1800 satoshis
* 17 MOONS
* 1.8 XRP
* 19 DOGE
* 0.2 NANO

Disclaimer: Even when MOONS are nice and have helped me a lot, I don't post these updates for that (Moon-farming) I have been doing that for years a long time ago before MOONS where a thing.

Then it causes the downward movement to expand to around $ 50,000. Among them, there is a risk of falling to around 41,000 US dollars.

The CIA operates two wallets. The public key's are known to the operator in a hostile country. In stead of listening to a radio the operator uses a blockchain explorer to watch for transactions. The CIA sends x amount of sats from one address to another that is also in their hands. The number of sats is the code, the OTP encrypted message. The transaction is out in the open, the random noise is created by all the other users. The use of such an explorer creates plausible denyability.
It could also be used the other way around for the operator to communicate back home, removing the need for a handler, or at least lower the amount of physical meet ups. The latter has some problems of course. Using bitcoin is pseudonymous and when the operator moves sats from one wallet to another (both in his possesion) can be explained, but does lower the possibility of plausible denyability.
Another option is the CIA and offshore operator communicating directly by using different amounts of sats. Say amount X means do Y and sending back X -1 sats means succes, X -2 means no succes.

The stock of[ Support.com, a relatively unknown and financially-challenged, internet-based technical support services firm, had rocketed from a mere $2.14/share close on Friday to a whopping $7.97 at Monday open](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/support-com-stock-skyrockets-after-merger-deal-with-bitcoin-mining-company-11616425018?siteid=yhoof2) and in the first 30 minutes of trading exploded even further topping out at $9.45 before beginning its descent to end the week at $4.78.

What was all the excitement about?[ Having lost one of its biggest customers in 2020](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/SPRT/pressreleases/578996/), Support.com appeared to be struggling, and so in what could be seen as a Hail Mary pass for shareholder value, they merged with bitcoin miner/power generator Greenidge Generation. It is an unusual marriage out of which Greenidge gains an easy, lesser scrutinized path to the public markets and Support.com shareholders gain an exit or stock value resuscitation. Daytraders and longtime Support.com shareholders got to make some money, and Greenidge got to list on the NASDAQ the easy way. So, what's the problem? Well...

Greenidge Generation is located in upstate New York in a previously decommissioned coal-fired power plant along the western shores of Lake Seneca. In 2014, the plant was purchased by wood products, metals, and power generation giant Atlas Holdings who converted the plant from coal to natural gas generation in 2017. Noting that any contribution the plant might make to the grid would be largely redundant, Atlas-owned Greenidge began selling their excess fossil-fueled capacity to[ institutional bitcoin mining interests](https://www.coindesk.com/new-york-power-plant-greenidge-has-sold-up-to-30-of-its-bitcoin-mining-hash-rate). And this is where the problem begins. What it portends is not just a climate catastrophe and a significant loophole in upcoming US climate legislation, but the looming threat of firm regulatory action.

**Beware Gaping Holes in Climate Action Plans**

In April,[ the Biden administration is expected to table a $3 trillion set of infrastructure bills](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/business/biden-infrastructure-spending.html?auth=login-google1tap&amp;login=google1tap) targeted at fighting climate change. Unlike Obama, who focused his agenda on regulating greenhouse gas emissions from power plants,[ “Biden’s priority is to pour money into new technologies and clean energy hardware.”](https://qz.com/1987869/joe-bidens-new-infrastructure-bill-is-all-about-climate-change/) Over the next 5 to 10 years, as the United States greens it’s grid, companies that own legacy fossil fuel power plants will be looking for an exit. This includes companies like Atlas Holdings who own over 1 GigaWatt of oil and coal-fired capacity through its New Hampshire-based subsidiary,[ Granite Shore Power](https://www.graniteshorepower.com/). And, as suggested in their[ merger webcast](https://corporate.support.com/about-us/investor-relations/), in the wake of the Greenidge + Support.com merger,[ they plan to expand their current 20MW of bitcoin dedicated power generation capacity to 500MW by 2025.](https://corporate.support.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Greenidge-SPRT-Merger-Announcement-032221-FINAL.pdf) This plan includes purchasing more power plants--with no commitment to renewables. In greenhouse gas emissions terms this is dangerous, really, really dangerous and is bound to catch the attention of regulators if not immediately then in the very near future.

According to Alex De Vries, of the Digiconomist, producer of the[ Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption) (BECI),[ at its current rate of power consumption bitcoin will exceed the CO2 emissions of global gold mining](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-may-consume-as-much-energy-as-all-data-centers-globally) which currently stand at[ 81million metric tons](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mining-gold-emissions-idUKKBN2832ZN) per annum. Given that bitcoin achieved these emissions levels even before companies like[ Tesla announced that they will accept bitcoin](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/business/elon-musk-tesla-bitcoin.html) as payment for goods in the mainstream economy, the prospects are a climate disaster. To put this in greater focus, according to the BECI, the production of one bitcoin emits the same amount of CO2 as 854,059 Visa transactions or 385.35kg. Bitcoin currently ranks[ equivalent to the 36th top-energy-consuming country in the world](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption), consuming about as much power as Belgium or the Philippines, or 89.33TWH/year. If it becomes[ a mainstream currency as well as a store of value](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-transaction-volume-to-beat-internet/), it could cause a colossal global energy crisis. The rolling blackouts that[ recently struck Abkhazia](https://news.trust.org/item/20210301081901-rehi0) may just be the canary in the bitcoin mine. 

I doubt energy or securities regulators in the US or other advanced economies are interested in having bitcoin mine triggered power grid meltdowns under their watch. As we know,[ Fed Chair Jay Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have longstanding concerns about bitcoin](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/01/fed-governor-powell-is-watching-bitcoin-closely.html), and now with climate hawks in the Biden administration it is highly likely that regulation will strike sooner rather than later.

Local authorities from[ Inner Mongolia](https://decrypt.co/59811/inner-mongolia-to-ban-bitcoin-mining-what-it-means-for-the-industry) to[ Missoula County, Montana](https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoins-climate-impact-global-cures-local/) are already taking action banning bitcoin mining that directly or indirectly contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Bitcoin has also caught the attention of the likes of[ John Kerry](https://www.coindesk.com/the-us-can-make-bitcoin-mining-greener), the US's chief climate negotiator. With the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's COP26 conference slated to take place in Glasgow this coming November, and rising concerns with bitcoin's carbon footprint crypto currency could become the target of global climate treaty negotiators.

On the market side, if federal regulators don't take immediate action, activist investors may be the ones to sound alarm bells and if miners don't listen, then, similar to how the[ Security and Exchanges Commission directed Occidental Petroleum and Connoco Phillips to take action on shareholder emissions target initiatives](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-conocophillips-occidental-sec-idUSKBN2BC0QE), shareholders will likely be backed up in their demand that miners end using fossil fuel to power their activities.

So, where do we traders go from here?[ Kevin O’Leary recently made his position clear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eCUUK8XRGo&amp;t=1775s) and I think it is insightful. Pointing to[ ethically and ecologically questionionable mining activities in China](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-mining-in-xinjiang-china-could-be-a-red-flag-for-regulators-51613764881), he thinks the regulatory hammer is going to come down soon. And so rather than invest in bitcoin willy nilly he aims to place his 3% bitcoin allocation with miners who can authenticate that their coin was mined in an ethical and ecologically sustainable manner, thereby sheltering it from the coming regulatory threat. These could include players like Canadian hydro powered bitcoin miner Bitfarms ([interesting CEO interview from minute 12](https://www.coindesk.com/tv/all-about-bitcoin/all-about-bitcion-mar-23-2021-20210322)), or participants in certification regimes like the newly minted[ Terra Pool initiative](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/su/news/7259961200592195/UPDATE:_DMG_Blockchain_Solutions_and_Argo_Blockchain_to_Launch_the_First_Clean_Energy_Bitcoin_Mining_Pool). Raw, and very real climate concerns aside, I agree with O’Leary here and in my opinion, environmental regulation is coming soon to a bitcoin near you, so I would say, take note, take action and invest wisely.",1616957664,1,1

You will probably hate me for this, but I think it is worth sharing... Do you remember when kingblue\_xrp used a charity bot to donate XRP to Saint Judes children hospital? Well if you do not remember or did not know that, here is the article. [ST. JUDES XRP DONATION](https://www.tokens24.com/news/st-jude-childrens-research-hospital-received-more-than-21000-xrp-in-the-form-of-donation)

Now, I am a huge supporter of efforts that donate to cancer patients and their causes. I know this is a bitcoin forum, and everyone here is smart and focuses on highly researched utility coins, but please check this out.

There is a coin called ""GRUMPEE"" (I know stupid name), that is following in the footsteps of XRP. I think they only went with the meme reference to help market but anyways please keep reading. They have a wallet that receives .3% of all transactions through smart contract. Every amount of coins in this wallet gets sent directly to causes to help child cancer. This is truly inspirational in my opinion. I wish more of the big players would throw things in their development like this. Imagine the donation you could get after a month of bitcoin transactions at .3%. I am probably missing something huge here, but I am mostly just angered by how much a coin like bitcoin could produce with this.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking forward to opening up the topic of donation protocols in crypto:)",1616956898,5,0
mf6yhf,dingus-potato,Help accessing account of a friend who has passed away,"Hi everyone-

One of my dad’s best friends passed away a couple of years ago and he told me today that he had some Bitcoin in Coinbase. His mom has been trying to gain access to the account but hasn’t had any luck. From my little understanding of Coinbase and buying cyrpto it can be almost impossible to access an account without the password. 

Do any of you have any advice or experience with something like this? When it comes to Coinbase is there anything in the user agreement when someone dies? What options do they have here if any?

They do have access to his main email account but I am unsure if that is the email he used for Coinbase. Also, the password to his email isn’t the one for Coinbase. Is there a way to reset a password? 

I would really appreciate any help you all can give because gaining access to the account could help his mother out a lot.

Please go easy on me as I am a newb! 


What can I expect as a beginner going into crypto?

Is it better to invest or sell or both?

Why are there so many different coins?

Why have people refered to Bitcoin and cryptos as a pyramid scheme?

Pros and cons of crypto?

Should I be worried about my crypto currency being hacked as a beginner?

Should I use a certain wallet?
What are the best coins to invest in? Doge, XRP, Lite Coin, Ethereum

Is there a way to sell and buy crypto without s middle man that takes some percentage like Kraken or Binance?

What scams should I look out for?
Realistically can beginners make money?

Is it easy to sell off your cryptos for fiat currency?

I had taken all of the BTC on the exchange and I clicked send. And on my Ledger Live I hit receive, and I did the usual process of putting in my address as you would normally do, and the 750 said that it went off. There was no more money left in the account. So after that I went to sleep. But this morning I went to check my balance to see that the money is not in my wallet yet. Is there any reason for this happening? I don't know how there is no money on the account but there is also no money on the wallet. I would appreciate some help. I have traded this way before and it worked.

mf441f,SuckingOffaBitcoin,The US Government will NEVER ban Bitcoin.....and the reason is actually the last piece of the puzzle,"Why?

Because the US Government IS SATOSHI NAKAMOTO (big surprise!), and has at least 5% of all Bitcoins available, that is 1,000,000 Bitcoins.

For a start, Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA) -256 is the hash function and [**mining**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/mining) algorithm of the Bitcoin [**protocol**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/protocol), referring to the cryptographic hash function that outputs a 256 bits long value. The algorithm is a variant of the SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), developed by the National Security Agency (NSA). and NO Satoshi is obviously NOT Japanese, because is he/she was Jap then this whole thing would have started in Japan.

It is the SAME GAME they are playing when the US Government dumped the Bretton Wood system in 1972 after having secured most of the gold in the US Government vault. Now they are doing that last stretch where they print, print and print more USD fiat to scoop up as much hard assets for the last time. and then BOOM they announce they actually have the biggest Bitcoin horde on the planet.

If they had started off by saying: ""Hey guys we the NSA and the US Treasuries and the FED have worked together to create a new currency called - Bitcoin! Let's mine it and use it but we have already got a headstart and hold 5% of it"" then everyone's reaction would have been like ""f off""

Hence not only would the US Government NOT ban Bitcoin, they are allowing all these private crypto companies like Coinbase, Paypal, Square and crypto ETFs and crypto Hedge Funds in the US to blossom because they would want the crypto industry to be US centric just like how the world is USD centric for the past 50 years. Elon Musk, Jack Dorssey, Dan Bilzerian, Cathie Wood, all see this they just buy and buy with a price target but they MUST have already figured it out.

This whole thing is a government project to begin with, I mean really which common civilian has the resource to develop and deploy something like this - most of the people don't even understand fiat money, leave alone developing Bitcoin.

This is actually MEGA GOOD NEWS for Bitcoin, as we have got the government the strongest country in the world backing it, because it is the same government which created it 13 years ago!

I am considering to deposit more BTC into this lending platform.

I know, I know: not your keys not your BTC. This is why this increase would continue being small vis a vis my entire portfolio. 

However, I am not sure if this increase would be advisable right now considering that the US government will release soon (likely on April) a tax reform that might impact directly to the crypto world; and since, this centralized platform is located in the US, it is likely that it may affect my portfolio and future yieldings.

* Receive BTC at address A
* Spend BTC from address A
* Receive more BTC at address A

But what if an address has received multiple times but has never sent any BTC? Is this also vulnerable, or is it safe? So for example:

mf2olx,theblockofblocks,Inclusive Institutions &amp; Bitcoin,"Why Nations Fail looks to answer the questions, ‘Why are some nations rich and others poor? And how do some nations end up prosperous and tolerant, while others sink into elite despotism and self-interested greed?’. As these questions were answered throughout the book, I couldn’t help but notice the glaringly obvious connection they had to Bitcoin. By looking at the central argument of the book, I believe a general rule of thumb can be applied to better understand which countries will look to regulate Bitcoin and to what extent. 

The book argues that the answer to the above questions are simple: a given country’s prosperity is determined by its economic institutional landscape: the systems and regulations that direct economic behaviour within its borders. That landscape includes property laws, the strength of public services and access to finance. These economic institutions fall into one of two categories: extractive or inclusive. 

Inclusive economic institutions stimulate economic success and are designed to encourage participation in economic activities. They also nurture economic freedom. In countries like the USA and South Korea for instance, market rules derive from private property laws, as well as from developed banking sectors and strong public education systems. These rules enable people to know they can work hard and be innovative, certain that their efforts will be remunerated and their wealth will be preserved. 

In contrast, extractive institutions derive incomes from the majority within society for the benefit of a minority group of elites. In North Korea, the Kim family founded a regime that repressed the populace, outlawed private property and concentrated all power within a select elite. Similarly, Latin America, a system built on duress and expropriation of indigenous populations was designed to benefit the colonisers.

Historically, inclusive institutions have been hugely prosperous for everyone in society. Whereas extractive institutions, without fail, have led to the rapid downfall of societies. For example, the devastation caused by the ‘Black Death’, allowed Western Europe to lay the foundations for inclusive institutions, whereas Eastern Europe largely became a more extractive institution. Such foundations ultimately allowed Western Europe, in particular England, to reap the rewards of the industrial revolution. Whereas most of Easter Europe stagnated, benefiting little from the enormous growth their neighbours experienced.

Further to this, the book hypothesis that Inclusive societies embrace technological innovation, recognising it will benefit the majority.  Whereas extractive societies suppress technological innovation as it challenges their supremacy through the enrichment of its adopters. Technological innovation makes human societies prosperous but also involves the replacement of the old with the new and the destruction of the economic privileges and political power of certain people. For example, Austria in the 18th century prohibited all new machinery and railways. Fearing that new technologies would enable revolution. Due to this fear of the industrial revolution and associated creative destruction, Austria’s development floundered significantly.

Bitcoin (and blockchain more generally) is a technology that threatens to challenge the existing establishment in countries throughout the world; looking to replace the old with the new. The ultimate form of creative destruction. Whether that is replacing traditional assets, commodities, stores of values and mediums of exchange - or replacing the central role of banks and more generally incumbent organisations and institutions with fairer and more inclusive systems. The list of opportunities for blockchain and creative destruction is endless. The technology is here and it is not going anywhere. So, the question is, which nations will look to regulate and to what extent? 

After reading ‘Why Nations Fail’, two things became obvious. Firstly, extractive institutions will look to significantly regulate Bitcoin and blockchain as it poses an existential threat to their hold on power and wealth. Whereas inclusive institutions will impose minimal regulation as they recognise the technology will likely stimulate economic growth and prosperity for all. Secondly, nations that impose overly strict regulation will permanently hinder growth whereas nations that impose minimal regulation will reap the rewards. Two relatively obvious points. 

However, I believe both points should offer people a certain degree of comfort and reassurance in regards to the future of regulation. If we use the (potentially overly) simple rule of thumb: extractive = strong regulation and inclusive = minimal regulation, we can begin to try to understand and navigate the potential minefield of regulation. Examples of some large extractive institutions are: China, Russia, Nigeria (and many other African nations) and large parts of the Middle East. Inclusive institutions include the UK, Germany, France, Switzerland, the USA and Canada just to name a few.

Until recently, I believed that strict regulation, for many of the nations listed in the inclusive category, was just around the corner. However, after reading ‘Why Nations Fail’ I have been left feeling far more optimistic for these nations that are built on inclusive systems. Yes, there are significant fundamental problems with many of the nations and their institutions listed. Nonetheless, ultimately they have all been founded in and moulded by the principles of inclusive systems. A fact I believe will ultimately lead to limited regulation implemented by the countries listed and as a result; greater prosperity and growth for everyone included.",1616944393,3,1

One BTC is around 105,000,000,000 Bs. Monthly minimum wage is 1,800,000 Bs. (less than 1 USD) and a personal news."," Hi guys, it was almost the same than last week.

Around 4,000,000 USD in weekly trades.

This  is only measured using LocalBitcoin as they publish they weekly date,  since months ago Binance opened P2P trade with Bolivares, I suspect a  lot of people are moving to Binance.

There  are other exchanges like AirTM and UPHOLD and even some local ones  (with maybe the goverment behind) like Amberescoin and Cryptia.

A  big part of the population that work for the goverment have a wage of  between 1 and maybe 10 monthly minimum wages, yes, that is true. They  need to do something else to survive.

I  think average wage is like 10-15 USD weekly, which is much better but  still not enough. A family needs at least 300USD monthly to ""live"".

On  a personal note, I got COVID, I did think it was just a flu but days  ago I lost my taste and smell. Here there is no easy way of getting PCR  test and there is not nationwide vaccine plan, goverment says ""f\*ck you,  save yourself you are in our own"". I'm resting and I hope I didn't  infect people close (like my parents :().

I  spend around 40 USD purchasing some medicines (vitamins,  acetaminophen   and so on) and just to treat it like a flu. MOONS (cryptocurrency points) have helped me a  lot, even with these expenses (I have to cash out the ones I have soon  :()

One monthly minimum wage (1 USD) is around:

* 1800 satoshis
* 17 MOONS
* 1.8 XRP
* 19 DOGE
* 0.2 NANO

m0jjw1,Connect_Bet705,I think Michael Saylor doesn't know jack shit about bitcoin as a network, He has gone on record as saying that paypal not allowing custody of coins (i.e. you cant actually send the bitcoin to a hardware wallet) would be good for hardware wallet manufacturer because it spreads adoption as a whole even though paypal has yet to show how much bitcoin they actually own (please correct me if they have formally released their bitcoin balance sheet because i have not found anything). He also doesnt care that some regulators want to kyc wallets because he only sees bitcoin as digital gold and a reserve asset. if he understood why bitcoin was created in the first place he would understand how important it is to not hinder it with regulation and instead promote adoption for purposes other than price speculation (which is the only use of the bitcoin paypal is offering). He was critical of bitcoin during a time when the real fundamentalists were making it what it is today and is now cashing in on it. I understand some people are ok with allowing the exchange to hold on to their coins but allowing people the choice to anonymously send coins to their wallet is important for the long term success of bitcoin.

It was not all that much.  Something around $50-$60 and I sent the incorrect amount the first time and had to make the difference in a second transaction.  
However, I had to liquidate a few DOT to trade for the BTC on my exchange and the exchange has a stupid rule that you can only withdraw BTC if it is over $X.  
So, I tried to calculate to the dime, the correct amount I would need to trade and then I sent it to my Blockchain wallet so that I could then send a portion of that to the vendor to make up the difference.  
But, I miscalculated the fees and ended up having to short the gas to still send an amount equal to what I still owed the vendor.  
Now, the transaction is stuck and has been for about 11 hours.

m0j4dp,Zaidinator7,Connecting to full node over Tor.,"I have a raspberry pi with bitcoin core + electrum personal server. I would SSH into it and then run electrum with these arguments:  `./electrum --oneserver --server localhost:50002:S` . I later created a tor hidden service and got an onion address. I tried this: `./electrum --oneserver --server myOnion:50001:t -p socks5:localhost9050` and it would not connect. 

On bitnodes my onion is up, though it does not say Tor under the network description, like it does for others. I forwarded port 8333. 

I have these in the bitcoin.conf: 

&gt;proxy=[127.0.0.1:9050](https://127.0.0.1:9050)

&gt; listen=1

&gt; bind=127.0.0.1

Am I meant to just do what I did before (`./electrum --oneserver --server localhost:50002:S`) and it is over tor since I have walletbroadcast=0 on, or am I meant to use a hidden service, in which case, what is the correct electrum argument?

m0j0zq,adiabatic_storm,Has anyone had their bank account frozen or closed after transferring USD from an exchange?,"I saw a thread on r/personalfinance today where someone described their account suddenly being shut down inexplicably by their bank (SunTrust in that particular case). The OP didn't provide enough info to garner any insight into why this might have happened, and according to them their bank is unwilling the share the reason why. Seems kind of scary and just another reason BTC is the way.

But on that subject I had a related question: Has anyone here run into something similar after transferring USD from an exchange to their bank account?

I would imagine the risk of having your account frozen, closed, or flagged rises in proportion to the size of the transfer you make, especially if the xfer is ""large"" relative to your normal transaction history. I'm not sure how this is actually going for people, though, which is why I created this post.

m0iyyj,New-Plant,HODLing funds with BlockFi during a bull market results in overpaying on taxes? (UK Tax-payer),"To anyone who understands this better than I do, please tell me if I'm wrong here, I really want to be.

I was looking at transferring part of my stack to BlockFi for the nice interest rates so I could stack more SATs, I don't plan to sell Bitcoin at all in this bull market, altcoins yes. My overall plan was to just let it sit there compounding until the next Bull market in 5-6 years from now.

Here's the part I'm having trouble with, why would I do that now, in a bull market? The tax I would need to pay on the interest would be ruinous. BlockFi use an example of how taxes work on the interest they pay you saying something like: 'Michael gets 0.05 BTC paid in interest valued at £200', that counts as a gain of £200 that you would have to pay income taxes on, stating that because the 0.05 BTC was worth £200 at the time of receipt you owe taxes on that £200.

That's all well and fine, but in a bull market like this one, where lets imagine top is £300k, the interest accrued could be as high as £1500 per month. Very nice, and assuming it takes 6-7 months to get to that valuation and you could have \~£2000+ profit from the interest that you must pay tax on, at 20% that's £400 in taxes you must pay.

Now lets say, history repeats itself like it has done 3 times in the past and bitcoin crashes to £50k, that 0.05 BTC you earned is no longer worth £15,000 but £2500. And because the taxes you pay are calculated on the fair market price of when you received that BTC, it seems to me you overpay on the worth of your BTC after the crash by 6-fold.

Please can someone tell me how wrong I am and that its still a good idea to put my BTC in BlockFi? Thanks.",1615219661,5,1

m0inwr,userbeneficiary,The BTC value is not an organic process,"Bitcoin is not only technologically interesting, is hard to find another application with such a high market capitalization and all transactions publicly accessible. 

Since the data is there, and many websites provide services for querying Bitcoin blockchain, they are mostly limited by their usage policies and interfaces, and can be effective only for small queries that do not process a large numbers of transactions. 

Bitcoin blockchain is an append-only database in which the only change occurs about every ten minutes when a new block is created.  Blocks stored by Bitcoin Core in data files that do not change (except for the most recent evolving one) and can be parsed to populate a SQL database with access via Web Interface.

For any SQL dev or anyone with data analytics and databases knowhow, parsing and identifying the all the blockchain wallets data, indexing all the addresses in all wallets created, including its creation dates, all the transactions associated to all respective wallets, volume, time/date and frequency of transactions, would be simple and very fast to query directly through some official supported application like libbitcoin-server with an index and client-server query for it.

Official Bitcoin.org should have deployed such as an web interface with a Decentralized Exchange also integrated in bitcoin blockchain protocol.

Bitcoin users should trade cryptocurrency the way it meant to be, with confidence,  fees-free, transparent, anonymous and secure.  

Parsing and identifying the wallets data with high transaction volume would be a steep in the right direction for any cryptocurrency project to avoid market manipulation and implement more transparency and confidence in the network, system, protocols and currency value.  

I imagine a globally accepted virtual currency able to facilitate virtually costless transactions at near lightning speed. I imagine that this currency is open-source and decentralized. Then add an unalterable, tamperfree  complete recording feature to guarantee that every transaction 100% transparent, secure, and in anonymity. Finally, eliminate the need to trust third parties by making this currency independent of manipulation whales, governments, central banks, financial institutions, hackers, A.I. and bots. This is the basic pitch for cryptocurrency—from Bitcoin to the thousands of alt-coins that have followed in its wake. It is not hard to find true believers touting each of these supposed cryptocurrency traits as though they were gospel.  

It turns out that cryptocurrency transactions can be slow and expensive, because the core technology, the blockchain scales poorly, lacks transparency, and the cryptocurrency value can be manipulated.

In an increasingly volatile world, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin purport to replace trust with technology. Indeed, Bitcoin founder, “Satoshi Nakamoto” described Bitcoin as an “electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.”

m0hvnh,puzstep,Is the Australian Clever DeFi project a pyramid scheme?,"A financial pyramid (also an investment pyramid, a Ponzi scheme or game) is a system of providing income to members of the structure by constantly attracting funds from new participants: income to the first participants in the pyramid is paid at the expense of subsequent ones.

In many countries of the world, the creation of financial pyramids is followed by the criminal code and is equated with fraud.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/60bqteb5ltl61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0233fcc562f86775131f2eef7af3841f22556582

The Clever DeFi project does not have a platform for the provision of decentralized financial services, as is the case in other projects. The Clever DeFi project does not have a platform, for example, for arbitrage trading or for transactions.

The Clever DeFi project has the only platform dedicated to the decentralized issuance of additional CLVA tokens and the subsequent decentralized distribution of CLVA tokens as a reward for the wallets of existing token holders.

Thus, the project intends to provide profit to CLVA holders by adding only additional CLVA to their balance sheet. At the same time, real profit, for example, in relation to any stable tokens, can be provided only by increasing the demand for this token, maintaining the CLVA price, attracting new holders. The new buyer of the CLVA token will automatically support the CLVA price (or increase the price). There is no demand for CLVA (no new investment), this means that the price of CLVA is automatically reduced.

This means that ensuring real profitability for the investment in the Clever DeFi project can only be achieved by increasing demand for the CLVA token through new users and additional purchases of CLVA by existing users.

m0u9zw,bbell909,Financial Advice from the Homeless.,"  

When you start getting financial advice about bitcoin from homeless people, I’m probably in the wrong space. In the beginning, the entire premise and purpose of crypto / bitcoins first white paper, was to enable the bank-less, have a decentralized monetary system, feeless fast transactions, scalability, anonymity, power to the people. Bitcoin was rock and roll, the outsider, used on darknet markets by drug dealers and pirates. No single legitimate financial institution paid it no mind and further reported it as a scam, bubble and worthless Ponzi used by money launderers and drug dealers.  The Wild West. Fast forward 5 years, bitcoin is Disney World. Old white money, and even older whiter financial institutional talking heads pouring billions from hedge funds, equities and managed accounts even ETF’s and Futures.  Everything the creator meant Bitcoin to be is now the exact opposite of what it is now. 70% of the pollution causing electricity burning mining farms, mostly all in China, has transaction (mining) fees at a rate that the original peer to peer exchange is financially unfeasible for small transactions. Blockchain surveillance and tracking corporations along with US Treasure Dept. FINCEN, FBI, NSA effectively tracks and de-anonymizes all Bitcoin transactions in the name of KYC - AML. No Bitcoin is anonymous.  What was once a spark of liberty, self-governance, anonymity, financial freedom, peer to peer uncensored transactions and market places, free from the central bank authority and control is now Corporate. The only Bitcoin news is from celebrity Billionaires like Elon Musk and talking heads on Bloomberg TV and MSNBC’s Cramer, buy buy buy!! It’s a circus.  Uber Rich people and poor people are the only so called loud experts on crypto, neither of whom can explain asymmetric public key encryption.  Like a lot of people who got involved in this space, was because of the technology. The tech man! Decentralized, uncensored, cannot be regulated or shut down! I was in. We now know that Bitcoin and most crypto is none of this. Now does all this mean Bitcoin, Ethereum and others will not keep rising in value? They will, Bitcoin and now Ethereum gas and mining fees are so high the average person can’t use it, so it’s only use is store of value for rich people who can afford it.  With all the negative and some positive aspects of Bitcoin, I still believe BTC itself and crypto is here to stay. In what form worries me. My enthusiasm and optimism about how it can be used to leverage justice and equality has faded. With Blockchain analytics, private and Governments, tracing every single thing you do forever, just takes the fun out of it.  There’s something afoul in the crypto space, I just can’t put my finger on it yet.",1615249396,8,1

m0sskk,Ernesto_Alexander,Everyone talks about buying BTC. But what about Stock Options correlated to BTC?,"Bitcoin is “predicted” to go to 100k or 200k in this bull run. Thats 2x or 4x. Options trading something like Riot in the middle of a bull run of that magnitude would get you returns of 10x (probably more). The only problem is you have the chance to lose all your money when the option expires, whereas in BTC you just have to wait for the new high. 

I have a few questions for you.

1) What are some stocks heavily influenced by BTC that I can buy options for? Theres RIOT, MARA, but what else? 

2) Why dont you all get into options related to BTC? Longer term options, that is, since this bull run will likely last throughout 2021. 

3) If you are already into these options, why? And also back to question 1, what stocks are you into?

TLDR: I personally am thinking in the “paradigm” that BTC will continue to moon through 2021, I therefore want to take a little more risk and put a pretty penny into BTC options. Too many silent buyers right now taking literally tens of thousands of BTC off the market.",1615244967,6,1

Unfortunately, I didn't have any extra cash that I was willing to lose.  I obviously would have been in a very good position today if I had been able to invest then.  The past few months have solidified to me that it isn't necessarily as speculative and risky as it once was.  Now that I have some extra money I am able to lose, I am interested in finally putting some into Bitcoin.  In full disclosure, I'm not fully confident that this is the currency of the future but feel it probably has a significant amount of long-term growth potential as we constantly see more companies buying into it and accepting it as a form of payment.  My opinion is that it is currently more of a useful asset in countries that have hyper inflation issues e.g. Venezuela.  Because of this, I see it as more of an investment to balance my portfolio than something I'll actually use to buy goods in the future but am open to using it if more places start to accept it.  Most of the resources I've read are either ""Bitcoin is the way of the future and is going to $1,000,000"" or ""Bitcoin has so many issues and is going to crash"".  It's obviously really polarizing so I'd like to get some pros and cons from a variety of people.  What were the main pros and cons that influenced your decision to get in?  If I buy, I plan on holding long term regardless of the price action.  Just want to get some ideas on the topic so I can make a well reasoned decision.",1615331169,11,1

""More and more private investors are acquiring Bitcoins - but not the German central bank.

The Bundesbank is unlikely to hold bitcoins as a reserve currency, according to one of its leaders.

""I doubt that we will ever do that,"" said Bundesbank board member Burkhard Balz in an interview with ""WirtschaftsKurier"", which the German central bank published on its website on Tuesday.

Balz: ""The Bundesbank is the second largest gold owner in the world. We want to have reserves that are of value and liquid and, if necessary, quickly available in an emergency,"" Balz said.

Bitcoin cannot offer that, unlike the yellow precious metal and foreign currencies such as the US dollar or the Japanese yen.

And further: ""Bitcoin cannot be seriously compared with gold,"" said Balz. Gold has an intrinsic value that has been preserved over centuries and therefore means security and liquidity at all times. ""Bitcoin does not offer that.""

Funny how he searches for values exactly as bitcoin inherits but credits gold with the same properties such as liquid and fast available.

Immer mehr Privatanleger legen sich Bitcoins zu – aber nicht die deutsche Zentralbank.

Die Bundesbank wird nach Einschätzung eines ihrer Führungsmitglieder voraussichtlich keine Bitcoins als Reservewährung halten.

„Ich bezweifele, dass wir das jemals tun werden“, sagte Bundesbank-Vorstand Burkhard Balz in einem Interview mit dem „WirtschaftsKurier“, das die deutsche Notenbank am Dienstag auf ihrer Website veröffentlichte.

Balz: „Die Bundesbank ist der zweitgrößte Goldeigentümer der Welt. Wir wollen über Reserven verfügen, die werthaltig und liquide sind, und gegebenenfalls im Notfall schnell zur Verfügung stehen“, sagte Balz.

Das könne Bitcoin im Gegensatz zum gelben Edelmetall und Devisen wie dem US-Dollar oder dem japanischen Yen nicht bieten.

Und weiter: „Bitcoin lässt sich nicht seriös mit Gold vergleichen“, sagte Balz. Gold besitze einen inneren Wert, der sich über Jahrhunderte erhalten habe und bedeute deswegen Sicherheit und Liquidität zu jeder Zeit. „Das bietet der Bitcoin nicht.“",1615329269,3,1

m1xx7p,BreakfastAntelope,Crypto Wallets: which one is right for you,"Wait, can’t I just leave my crypto on the exchange I purchased them on? Well, that depends on a few factors, but let us start from the beginning. 

**What**

Your crypto wallet is what you use to interact with a blockchain network and falls under one of three categories: a paper, software or hardware wallet.

Now, there are different use cases, but the tl;dr is hardware wallets are the most secure method of storing your crypto, with software being the most convenient and paper wallets being widely considered obsolete/unreliable. 

**How**

The first thing to understand about wallets is that they don’t actually store your crypto. They are merely vessels through which you can interact with a blockchain allowing you to send and receive the required information in order to perform transactions on said blockchain. 

Examples of this information include:

1. Your public keys
2. Your private keys. Never share this with anyone as it will mean they are able to access your crypto. Also remember, if you don’t own the private keys, you don’t own the crypto. Looking at you, Robinhood! Your private keys (or seed phrase) will also allow you to access your crypto on any device and that’s because your crypto never actually leave the blockchain, they just change from one address to another.
3. An assigned address that you will use to receive or send crypto to and from your wallet, which acts as a location on the blockchain. It’s okay if your address is public. When sending or receiving crypto, always ensure you are sending crypto to the right address.

**Hot vs Cold** 

Hot wallets are any wallets that are connected to the internet. Your crypto is very accessible and trading with your crypto is convenient.

Cold wallets have no connection to the internet making them less likely to be compromised by those evil people who want your precious crypto. Cold wallets usually come in the form of a USB drive device that stores a user’s private keys securely. If you’re a loooooooong-term HODLer, this may be the option for you.

A cold wallet is a physical device that uses a random number generator (RNG) to create public and private keys. The device, which is not connected to the internet, is home to these keys, making it a cold wallet and as a result arguably the most secure methods to store your crypto.

**Software wallets**

**Web wallets**

Web wallets make it possible to access your crypto, without having to install software - think metamask (browser) and your exchange wallet. You create a password to access your crypto, but in some cases, the provider will hold the private keys. Again, if you don’t own the private keys, you don’t own the crypto. If you’re leaving your crypto on the exchanges, set up multi-factor authentication, anti-phishing code, and withdrawal address management.

**Desktop wallets**

If you opt for a desktop wallet, you will be installing software onto your computer and you’ll be able to manage your crypto through that. You will have your private keys, which are stored locally on your computer. Encrypt it with a password as an extra precaution. BACKUP YOUR PRIVATE KEYS AND PASSWORDS because by doing so, you will be able to access your crypto on another device. Scan your computer regularly for viruses, malware etc.

**Mobile wallets**

These are very similar to desktop wallets but operate on…you guessed it, mobile devices making it incredibly convenient to send, receive and spend your crypto on the go. Again, BACKUP YOUR PRIVATE KEYS AND PASSWORDS.

Paper wallets are exactly that - pieces of paper with a crypto address and its public and private keys printed on it in the form of a QR code. A major flaw to this option though is that you are only able to transfer the entire balance to an address, making it the wrong option when wanted to send a smaller amount to an exchange to trade or to another address to purchase something. As stated above, this method is somewhat dated and is considered dangerous. 

**Finally, BACK UP YOUR SEED PHRASE AND PASSWORDS!**",1615384405,23,1

For each pending deposit, there is a notation of the form ""Available in *n* days"", where *n* is some positive integer.

It is extremely cumbersome to go through all this song-and-dance just to find out when my pending deposits will become available.

Also, coinbase has no fees for exchanging one form of crypto for another so i won’t lose money in fees. Say right now, btc, is at 55, almost 56k. If i were to exchange all my bitcoin for USD Coin right now, then after bitcoin drops, say to 46k, use the usd coin (which would’ve dropped in value if i’d kept it on bitcoin, the whole reason for exchanging to usd coin then exchanging back) to exchange back to bitcoin at a cheaper value, i’d ultimately have more money when bitcoin would shoot back up to 55k?


In theory, to make the most out of my bit coin and to maximize profit, and if i could time it right, i’d make money doing this, no?

Seems to me this way is safer to lend your bitcoins and gives, atleast at the moment, a higher return than block (=16%-40%)

And how amazing it is that you can create your own contract and form your own conditions!!!

For example you can chose to create a contract of lending 10k$ worth of bitcoins for 16 pct return in 3 months and the counter party has to provide 100% collatoralisation (so if you deposit 0.2 BTC, counter party deposits 0.4 BTC).

And according to this podcast there are three keys. One key to lender, one to the one who lends and one to HodlHodl. You need two keys of the three to open the 'escrow'. If there is a dispute, Hodl Hodl can interfere and you can still get your keys in that case. But since they have only one key, they cannot move it on their own!!!

m1wwdp,AlreadyLiberated,"From living in a jungle, to life under a bridge in USA, to a mansion on a hill: all because of Bitcoin","I was born in a jungle outside the Sudanese capitol. My mother and father had died in the civil war. So I was raised by a family of antelope, who taught me to jump as high as my dreams. 

I foraged for food, often surviving off the desicated corpses of hyena or fighting the crows for carion. 

At age eight, I escaped the jungle because of a merciful missionary. She had purchased Bitcoin at under 1 cent and sold for $4, using the proceeds to bring the word of god to my jungle and, eventually, bring me to Chicago USA. There I lived with her happily until the Bitcoin crash of 2018. It turned out she was trading her remaining Bitcoin at 10x leverage and lost everything. That was when I learned that magical internet money giveth, but also taketh away. 

I was kicked out and forced to live under a bridge in my new home, “The Windy City.” Now I scrounged for old hot dog buns and fought other homeless people for food and, yes, for drugs. I sold my body for meth. I admit it. That was my low point. 

Then in March 2020, a rich stock broker named Ferris Bueller threw an old cellphone in the guitar case where I was collecting spare change. (I do not play guitar, but Americans seem to like it!) Ferris said, “Son, I will leave that phone connected for 1 year. Use it to change your life.”

After trying my hand at porn and starting an app to reconnect orphans with the animals they were raised by (it failed),I eventually found this Reddit page and began putting all the spare change I earned into “Bitcoin.” At first I was confused because all the posts I read said “not financial advice” and no one could spell “hold” right, but it was the best financial advice I ever got. 

All through 2020 I kept buying. Twenty cents here, forty cents there. I’d make twenty dollars renting my bum under the bridge and drop it all on Bitcoin using the Kucoin app on Ferris’s phone. 

Now I live in a mansion. My neighbor is the Ferris who gave me the cell phone and I allow the missionary who saved me from the jungle to live in my guest house. 

I will never do meth again. 

One day I will return to the jungle and find my antelope mom and dad, if they are still alive. I will teach them to trade Bitcoin and, if all goes well, they will be the first animal millionaires.

This morning I saw a post where somebody said “my dividends have doubled” when referencing an altcoin. When I first dove into crypto I read someone explaining that BTC is more like land versus gold and I agree. Land can gain value, lose value, or stay the same just like gold. Land is a scarce resource like gold. Here is where gold and BTC take a hard turn away from gold....

Land ownership is recorded in perpetuity through local governments. BTC transactions are recorded in perpetuity on the blockchain. Land can be liquid but it’s a slow process to make it liquid. BTC is liquid but it’s slower than other crypto currencies to off ramp to fiat. Land, in many communities, is a status symbol. BTC is evolving to be something that will be a status symbol.

I know that in the near future Bitcoin network fees will overtake block rewards for the majority of income for miners. My question really is, will network fees get so high to push small individual players off the network? I know that the main chain is used for large transactions, but I think if the fees get to be $50+ it will be really painful even for the biggest transactions for smaller players. I understand that Lightning is a great solution for smaller transactions, but don’t you need to do on an on chain transaction each time you want to open a Lightning channel between you and another party? Also, is there any chance future technology can be implemented to Bitcoin to lower transaction fees or increase efficiency without requiring a hard fork? It just seems to me like we are stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, miners need to make their money to keep the network secure. But on the other hand, without block rewards this fee will be very high relative to the number of transactions the network can support.
Any comments would be appreciated. I am a huge bull for Bitcoin but this is one of the things that concerns me. I know that people can group transactions but if in the future the network is entirely taken up by corporations that group transactions for people, I feel like Bitcoin will have lost much of one of its main appeals.",1615380123,6,1

See the biggest reason I got into BTC was because I saw it as a way that the average person could engage in a financial activity. And yet, it seems like the big players that have corrupted all the other markets are now getting their fingers into Bitcoin.Personally it actually hurts my interest in BTC despite their activities increasing the value of what I have.

You are the worst exchange for KYC I've ever encountered in 6 years of crypto. You are dealing with people's most intimate and private information, and you have absolutely no right to request more than you need to verify a person's identity.

You can state AML/KYC all you like but your demands on this are extremely unreasonable and is effectively funds hostage and/or stealing as well as identify theft.

No doubt people have been suicidal dealing with your exchange. I guess even with blood on your hands you have the ability to count that a a cost of doing business. You should be ashamed, and I’m sure you are if you stop and reflect for even one moment.

No other exchange demands this excessive information. The ""law"" you state does NOT require this plethora of information. Eventually the crypto community will turn on you.

His eyes almost pooped an actual turd I think. 

He was like ""Well it's bc of the store of value."" 

Me: ""Cognizability... Yes dad. Store of value in ape terms means someone says it's worth something therefore it's worth something. That's why the value of Bitcoin is intrinsic: It's worth whatever any Btc HODLing billionaire thinks it is.""

Very few cars that aren’t in meh shape can be found under 5K in my area and I’m not looking to exchange a beater for another beater.

The guy my parents bought their car from is selling one for a solid deal and it would be a huge upgrade + would last years to come but, I’d need to liquidate my Bitcoin to buy it.

I could try and save up the fiat but it would take me about 3 months and that would really suck if my car broke down during that time. 

I’d immediately start stacking sats again and if I can sell my old car, put profits back into btc but I’d be pretty bummed out my original buy in increased by 10k or so

m2vv5d,Melius_Vita,How much will be needed to FIRE by 2030? - Honest discussion,"People are waking up to the fact that Bitcoin is here to stay, if that materializes, an amount that is still somewhat achievable could allow someone to obtain financial independence and retire early. 

We already know that everyone has different spending habits and have different costs of living depending on where they live. 

What would that number of BTC could be for the average Joe in the US or Europe? What would that number be if someone was willing to move to South America or Southeast Asia?

Is that 1BTC? 3BTC? 5BTC?

In my opinion anyone with more than half a coin with 20+ years to retire should have more than the the current average of savings at retirement (Average Retirement Savings for Ages 65-69: $206,819.35, [https://www.synchronybank.com/blog/median-retirement-savings-by-age/](https://www.synchronybank.com/blog/median-retirement-savings-by-age/)).

That is why I think everyone should try to get their hands on half a coin that will try to never to sell and save for retirement. 

Now, inflation is arguably going to increase, devaluing savings, plus we know that the average is most often not good enough unfortunately, that is why I think the true goal should be to have one whole coin set aside for retirement. 

From there, anything is icing on the cake IMO. 

I also believe the space is early and if Bitcoin become what it intends, you will be able to use your BTC to borrow against it and not need to sell. 

As always, BTC is an investment with its risks, it could go to 0. Don't invest what you cannot afford to lose. However, I believe the risk is decreasing by the day and BTC is currently the most asymmetric opportunity out there. 

Thoughts?

m2tqpk,fogotopo,To anyone posting about how they're a dumbass and sold too early...,"Most here have gone through the lesson of selling btc too early, you are definitely not alone. Anyone who acts like they never have is full of caca. 

TLDR, It's always too early to sell. In 5 years you will be thinking about that laptop that you paid 50k for or that car you spent 400k for in today's btc...if you'd just held. Life expenses are real and you do you, but btc will be here for a long while, making gains whether you're in it or not. Gramps will have it in his portfolio, maybe Venezuela will buy it... Whatever, btc go up when fiat go down. 

My own story, I traded alt coins through 2017 while I was on the couch after a knee surgery-something to do. It was exciting to see my alts go up and see my hundreds turn into thousands. Then in 2018 while screwing up trade after trade on the way down I had an epiphany that for my poor trading abilities, it would be better to hodl mostly btc. I liquidated my alts near the bottom and consolidated in btc. Btc is the stable one in case you're wondering. It's your crypto version of BRK A stock.

After a year of the bummers I did my best to accumulate as much btc as I could before it went up. Bought on credit card, stimulus money, unemployment. Even not working with covid it was a good move. I am far far beyond paying off my credit card. That interest is nothing compared to the gains in btc. If the market melted, btc went to 20k and I had to pay off my credit cards, I'd still be sitting pretty. Best financial move I've ever made. FYI I don't recommend credit cards to btc, just what I did. 

My faith comes from watching more than a couple 40% dips and making plenty of stupid mistakes. And EVEN THEN,  the last dip was brutal emotionally because I YOLOd more fiat in at over 50k  from selling our house (my wife's money really, and no not all of it). There is no way I'd sell when we were down. We would just have a rougher adjusted time line.  Just saying, I'm doing stupid of all stupid here, but the difference with me now vs 2018 is I'm holding.  I've done my DD on bitcoin and have more confidence about where it's going than ever. 

The reality is, when you're down 20-40% on REAL savings, whether that's $100 usd or $500k it's scary and hard to take the emotions out, even after your first rodeo. I keep myself from losing my shit by listening to podcasts and reading about btc and crypto in the macro economic context. I suggest anyone investing in btc do the same. That understanding keeps me from hitting the sell button, whether it's going up or down. So yeah, buy the dip and stack some sats.

m2tno1,Southern_Internal_19,Imagine if you educate one person a day on the value of Bitcoin,"I had a quick, random chat with someone about Bitcoin. He was very skeptical about Bitcoin, saying it is only used for illegal transactions. I politely countered his point by saying the USD is also used for illegal transactions. I also tried to tell him that BTC has a lot of value to citizens of countries where their currency is being devalued or they don't have formalized banking system. 

Think about this: we control the power to spread the knowledge of BTC. If you educate one person on the value of BTC, that information proliferates at a compound rate, much like the growth of BTC! The more educated I am on BTC, the more I can help other people see that it solves a major problem in society today.

m36jpj,ShunyataBhavana,Seeking Input: Mitigating The Impact of Big Crypto Tax Bill,"I am seeking suggestions for what I can do to lessen the impact of an upcoming tax bill for crypto ""income"".

Backstory: I've occasionally put money into crypto for a few years.  Mostly, I have inadvertently bought at high points, so all in all, I've done a bit worse than break even.  I never thought much about taxes, since I assumed I'd only have to pay them when I sold any of my holdings, which I never yet had.

Last year, though, an acquaintance talked to me about an actively managed crypto ""hedge fund"", where, for a percentage, they try to time the markets with pulling money in and out.  Sounds good.  So, I pulled all my holdings out of Coinbase, and sent a wire transfer to him and his team.  ""OK"", I thought, ""selling this is going to make my taxes more complicated than they have usually been in recent years "" (last few years, I've been dealing with only one single W2).

Since then, of course, crypto valuations have skyrocketed, and, to my delight, my acquaintance's company has, as promised, done even better the general market.  So, thanks to all that, my overall net worth now seems, on paper, to be a multiple of what it was last Summer.  So far, it hasn't fully seemed like real money to me that I really own and make use of, just big numbers on a screen.  And I hadn't planned to touch it for years, maybe not until retirement, just let it keep hopefully rising, maybe until I retire and take it out little by little.  So I figured I'd deal with taxes then, when I sell it - years from now.  

But I got an email last week saying, nope, the way the ""hedge fund"" is set up, my crypto gains count as present-day earnings, and a K-1 form has been sent on my behalf to the IRS.  So, suddenly, the numbers of my crypto account do seem real money - looks like my taxes are going to be for about 2.5 what I had planned for them being, and that I'm on the hook for a lot of money that I don't have laying around.  In fact, the only way I can think of to pay the extra is to liquidate some of the principal of my crypto holdings that I had been intending to sit on indefinitely and let grow.

I am curious if anyone has any clever suggestions for what to do to lessen the impact of this unexpected tax bill.",1615513595,12,1

m3eakx,attolini,"Road to hyperbitcoinization - gradually, then almost suddenly, then instantaneously, then stability, then back to gradually","Right now, we are in the ""gradual"" stage where price is increasing \~200% every year.

&amp;#x200B;

When major fiat currencies around the world start to collapse, the price of bitcoin will ""almost suddenly"" increase to \~$10m via a global FOMO for the last remaining slice of the bitcoin protocol.

&amp;#x200B;

By this stage, fiat becomes obsolete as it will no longer be able to buy bitcoin. No one will want to sell bitcoin for fiat, merchants/employees etc will demand payments/salaries in bitcoin only. Due to this, bitcoin/fiat price discovery disappears.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of unit bias and lack of fiat price discovery, pricing goods and services in sats becomes very difficult. Therefore, bitcoin will 'instantaneously' reach dollar sat parity (1sat=$1 of today's purchasing power). I.e. $10m to $100m will occur instantly and skip $20m,$30m... $90m stages altogether. A cup of coffee will go from 123sats to 1.23sats (via LN), making the units easier to comprehend.

&amp;#x200B;

After hyperbitcoinization, bitcoin's purchasing power will become a general ""stable"" store of value. Fluctuations will occur due to the new issuance from mining vs technological advancements, population change and the four year halving cycles.

&amp;#x200B;

After 2140, bitcoin's purchasing power will ""gradually"" increase (at a much slower rate) until the end of time as bitcoin becomes deflationary. over time, units will go from sats, to milli-sats, to naks, to milli-naks, to hals, to milli-hals, to fins, to milli-fins etc. There may be one era of inflation before/after 2140,  when the old lost coins gets rediscovered through computational advancements.",1615542235,20,1

For how long?,"With the way Crypto is growing in popularity and large corporations now jumping on the bus, billions of dollars are being moved out of the control of governments world wide. That translates into billions in taxes lost. So what does the future hold for us with Crypto? I believe that governments will have no option but to move towards accepting crypto as legitimate currency as the revolution is well on the way and already in force! However, don't be fooled that it will remain decentralized! They will eventually implement laws forcing citizens to declare wallets and transactions. Failure to do so would be criminalized and punishable. Any retailers or merchants accepting crypto as payment will be obliged to declare the source of payment and so on. If you believe that crypto will be allowed to remain decentralized in our so called democracy, think again. Just look at what happened to offshore banks. Now lets say for example, you hold a large amount of crypto and want to make a large purchase. Let's say a house. How do you do that without a fiat transaction at some point and how do you explain where the funds came from? Don't get me wrong I love crypto and the possibilities it brings with it.

I've explained that I wouldn't want to sell unless it's truly life changing. i.e. we could completely clear our mortgage, which means about £180k. The thing is, that seems like it could be a possibility within the next 2 years, and I'm now at the ""I don't want to sell ever, when it hits millions I'll take a loan against it"" mindset.

Does anyone else have this struggle? I mean, she can't make me sell but we are married so it's as much her btc as mine. How do others deal with it?",1615535098,20,1

The more the US FED prints the more it owes back in debt, this isn’t the same inflation like we’ve historically experienced when we were tied to the gold standard. 

Imagine I pick apples for a living, and I need to always give 6 apples to this guard to cross a bridge out of town and get to the better apple orchards, 

now imagine I come back with a huge haul of 4 baskets of apples and the next day he says that He needs atleast 12 apples from me now to pass the bridge, since he’s seen me get 4 baskets without a problem.

Well y’all are looking at inflation like it’s the 4 baskets of apples, not the guard... and on-top of that, you’re even counting all your profit before you even made it back to town, and paid off your debt to the guard,  mixed with the fact that USD isn’t the only currency in the world and other countries have been consistently printing money this whole time, I think some of you need to reflect your game plan. And what you post. there’s no reason that Bitcoins price is tied to the amount of dollars bills being printed.. it’s people losing trust in the financial system we’ve been using and thats a whole different conversation that carries a lot more weight than

Recently I downloaded an app that rewarded free sats every day. I won 10 sats on the app and to my surprise there was an option to withdraw using lightening. 


All I had to do was download a lightening wallet and from there on the user experience was exactly the same as on chain transactions. There was an option to withdraw the Bitcoin to an onchain wallet but then I realised there is no reason to, I can just spend it via lightening.


The way I see this working is everyone uses lightening all the time for almost all purchases. Stores and businesses collect sats via lightening for small purchases until they have a few thousands $ worth of Bitcoin at the end of the day at which point they either send lightening payments to small suppliers, pay their employees or withdraw their unused lightening balance into an on chain wallet. That means they could receive 1,000 $1 payments in a day, pay dozens of suppliers and employees without fees and only pay for 1 single on chain transaction at the end of the day or the end of the week.

Businesses in the real world do not care about custodial risk for 1 days of profit. They don't care about securing every water bottle sale with the power of the Bitcoin network. We can all use lightening as it stands today for almost all our day to day transactions and we only need to use on chain transactions for things like life savings, expensive purchases like cars or perhaps 1 or 2 transactions a month to receive salary payments and pay taxes. 

The unbanked in third world countries can use the same app we use here and that will provide them far more security than they ever had. There are people currently using pay as you go mobile phone credit as money ffs.

Go download a lightening wallet and just try it out with a few satoshis. It is just as easy to use as any bitcoin wallet and it already works!",1615633700,51,1

*Further reading:*[ *How to Buy Bitcoin at an 80% Premium From Michael Saylor*](https://www.coindesk.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-michael-saylor-valuation)

Here, I would like to share my distinctly different point of view, which is based on the following assumptions:

1. I'm bullish on Bitcoin, so I think it's going to keep going up. 
2. All of the company's digital assets are Bitcoin.
3. Accordingly, I believe all of the convertible bonds issued by the company to be converted into equity in the future.

First, let's take a look at the percentage of the company's total assets that will be held in Bitcoin by the end of 2020:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pbrujktszrm61.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5bbe05c92e744e6127a47739e3f6a4174b2bb3f

[MICROSTRATEGY INCORPORATED](https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/financial-document-archive/Form-10-K_01-12-2021.pdf)

Depending on my second assumption, we can calculate that Bitcoin accounts for a whopping 71.94% of the firm's total assets, which even not takes into account the data after the second convertible notes offering.

At this point, about 7,623 shares are outstanding and about 70,470 Bitcoins held, with an average price of $15,964.24.

[https://www.kevinrooke.com/bitcoin?fbclid=IwAR1EputAP3SJmp9tRppA\_UKhxl26fdEf4vPjCfvQC7FUOhPwrgcLn1vt9Fw#MicroStrategy](https://www.kevinrooke.com/bitcoin?fbclid=IwAR1EputAP3SJmp9tRppA_UKhxl26fdEf4vPjCfvQC7FUOhPwrgcLn1vt9Fw#MicroStrategy)

When MicroStrategy first issued convertible notes, notes with a face value of $400 million were sold for $650 million, which equals $400 million increments in liabilities but $250 million additional increments in revenue at the same time. Let\`s be strict with Microstrategy, if we consider them all notes, which equals $650 million in liabilities, each $1,000 can be converted into 2.5126 shares, namely, there would increase about 1,633 shares in the future.

[MicroStrategy Completes $650 Million Offering of 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/investor-relations/press/microstrategy-completes-650m-offering-of-convertible-senior-notes-due-2025)

Let's pause here and do some calculations:

1. According to my assumption 3, the number of outstanding shares will increase to 9.248 million shares in the future, so let's say it increase in the present.
2. Based on the closing price of 388.55 on 2020/12/31, we can know that the diluted share price is 320.276, by the calculation of (share price \* # of original shares) / # of new shares
3. By another calculation of (share price \* # of shares outstanding) / # of Bitcoins held, we can know that if we buy Bitcoins by buying MicroStrategy shares, it is equivalent to $42,030.9 per Bitcoin.
4. On 12/31, the last market price of Bitcoin was $29,220, which is at a 43.84% premium. 
5. MicroStrategy's average cost of bitcoin is $15,964.24, which means on 12/31, each bitcoin held would have a profit of (29,220-15,964.24) = $13,225.76.
6. In other words, the bitcoin we bought by buying MicroStrategy shares gave us a profit of $13,225.76.
7. The actual price of bitcoin purchased = $42,030.9- $13,225.76 = $28,805.1.
8. On 12/31 the last market price of Bitcoin was $29,220, which is at a discount of 1.42%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jhx9su3uzrm61.png?width=909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e65b82103bb0581c0020aba9c6317449a7a58f63

At this point, MicroStrategy shares are trading at discount but that's not very noticeable, so let's look at its second offering of convertible notes.

The notes with a face value of $600 million were sold for $1.05 billion, equivalent to $600 million increments in liabilities but $450 million additional increments in revenue at the same time. Here, we still hold a strict view to MicroStrategy and consider them all notes, equivalent to $1.05 billion in liabilities, each $1,000 can be converted into 0.6981 shares, representing an increase of about 733 thousand shares in the future.

But unlike the first Convertible Notes offering, MicroStrategy made it clear that he would invest all of the proceeds from the Notes sale in Bitcoin.

[MicroStrategy Completes $1.05 Billion Offering of Convertible Notes at 0% Coupon and 50% Conversion Premium with Bitcoin Use of Funds](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/investor-relations/press/microstrategy-completes-1-05b-offering-of-convertible-senior-notes_02-19-2021)

As of press time, the number of shares outstanding inherited from the above calculation is approximately 9.256 million, and MicroStrategy holds approximately 91,326 Bitcoins at an average price of $24,214.

Let's do the same calculations as the above:

1. According to my assumption 3, the number of outstanding shares will increase to 9.981 million shares in the future, so let's say it increases in the present.
2. Based on the closing price of 803.75 on 2021/03/11, we can know that the diluted share price is 613.865, by the calculation of (share price \* # of original shares) / # of new shares
3. By another calculation of (share price \* # of shares outstanding) / # of Bitcoins held, we can know that if we buy Bitcoins by buying MicroStrategy shares, it is equivalent to $67,089.2 per Bitcoin.
4. On 03/11, the last market price of Bitcoin was $24,214, which is at a 15.72% premium. 
5. MicroStrategy's average cost of bitcoin is $24,214, which means on 03/11, each bitcoin held would have a profit of (57,975-24,214) = $33,761.
6. In other words, the bitcoin we bought by buying MicroStrategy shares gave us a profit of $33,761.
7. The actual price of bitcoin purchased = $67,089.2- $33,761 = $33,328.2.
8. On 03/31 the last market price of Bitcoin was $57,975, which is at a discount of 42.51%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zdnklx0wzrm61.png?width=909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8912a0c5ad1d2bfe9262689774de7b43c303ce2f

See the exaggerated discount? That's surely a much bigger discount than you think, and it's still there!

Some argue that Bitcoin assets don't actually make money for the company  unless they are sold, let alone the shareholders. But if you think of Bitcoin assets as a lot of gold, when the price of gold goes up, you don't have the same doubts about the company, right? In the future, digital currency assets will become more and more popular and accepted by traditional financial institutions. If any traditional bitcoin-related financial business is to be promoted, it will be better for people who hold more Bitcoin assets, whether they charge interest or deposit fees.

However, compared to the ""increase in the value of MicroStrategy stock bought now and then"", the profit from the business at that time was not worth mentioning.

m4bg7q,RandoStonian,PSA: using bitcoin as collateral for 'business expenses' can reduce your tax bill,"&gt;Summary: Every time I used my on-paper crypto gains to secure a new business investment loan, then spent it on expanding my home buisness, I was actually reducing the amount of taxes I owed on my normal dayjob salary. 

There is no tax obligation when you use your crypto's value this way - turns out if you never *sell* crypto, you don't owe taxes on it.

If you take out fully-secured loans against the value of your crypto (using it as 'digital asset collateral' - google it!), you owe no taxes on that money, and you have the right to come back for more cash (or to withdraw some of your crypto) if the value rises while you've got cash checked out.

I discovered this week that every time I used my on-paper crypto gains to secure a new investment loan, then spend it on business expansion (dedicated computer equipment in my case) I was actually reducing the amount of taxes I owed on my normal dayjob salary.


-----------------------

Here's a scenario: You make $10k a year, and you bought $1 worth of bitcoin. Time passes, and that $1 in BTC is now worth $200k. If you sell it, you're gonna owe a shitload of taxes.

Now, if you put $20k of your BTC into an account and pull out $12k cash against it, you can spend this money to buy yourself a new investment taxfree. Say you spend it to buy a restaurant. The restaurant pays out $1k before taxes come due.

Your taxable income for the year is now $10k + $1k - $12k = negative $1,000 in taxable income that year. Hello, tax return? Yes, plz.

Also, any interest you pay on that loan is a 'business expense' and further reduces how much tax you own on other profits that year.

This shit has changed my life, hope it helps some of you guys out too! 

-------------

This is the same method billion dollar corps use to constantly expand while owing little tax because they're ""operating at a loss"" due to tax deductions from using business expansion costs as a shield for their profits. 

Now, these tools are simply becoming available to regular people who can buy digital collateralizable assets $1 at a time, instead of needing to buy up deeds to land or yacht or other collateraliazble property first.

First of all, I want to celebrate people posting dissenting opinions. I'm glad this received enough upvotes so we could have the discussion rather than suppressing an opinion shared by many newcomers. 

TL;DR - The pain of managing your private keys is less than the pain you've grown accustomed to. People will come to understand this and consistently choose to move to managing their private keys.

For some background on me, I've been a contractor in the tech industry for a long time now. Not only have I designed and built highly scalable back end systems I've done so while working directly with customers. I've always felt one of my biggest advantages has been that I _enjoy_ working directly with the people I'm writing software for. Especially when they're voicing their frustrations. To me the frustrations are always either an opportunity for me to educate someone in a way which permanently reduces their frustration or an opportunity for me to gain awareness to a pain I hadn't yet considered. Understanding pain and what to do with it is the only way we can get past it.

I tell you this because this conversation revolves around pain and the first one we should talk about is the pain of handling your own private key. I wholeheartedly agree. It's a huge pain. How many copies of my private key should I have? How physically distant is sufficient? Should I leave an encrypted copy of a private key with a friend? How should I encrypt it? These are difficult questions to answer and thus it's a painful experience. Those of us who have grown used to this pain need to take a moment to remember what it felt like initially to take this pain on. In doing so we can then remember _why_.

For me the _why_ is simply the pain of managing a private key is less than the pain of not doing so. Personally I have experienced far more pain when trusting an authority, especially ones who never directly interact with me. In my mind, every authority will eventually choose their direct interests or the interests of the group over me. It's not a question of if, and the when is ""on a regular basis"".

On the one hand, maybe I'm just re-living past trauma and rather than handling private keys what I need is therapy. I accept this possibility. So I ask those who believe this to accept another possibility. I recognize examples of this trauma where others might just assume it's normal. In essence, I'm triggered where you are not. For me, that trigger is identity theft, password leaks and database ""hacks"". To me, these are all results of authority figures choosing their interests over mine. Here's something many newcomers may not realize. _Identity theft, password leaks and database hacks are solved problems._ There's two reasons why they continue to exist. First is obviously a lack of commitment to proper security. The second is, continuing to convince everyone this is normal is profitable from the standpoint of advertising revenue. Make no mistake Google, the biggest advertising company of all, directly benefits from all these companies leaking your data because it makes you complacent about their business model.

This isn't a brand new discussion of course. There have been people beating the privacy drum for a long time now. Unfortunately, when it comes to solutions there aren't many. We don't hold the cards. That is, until Bitcoin came along.

Bitcoin provides three benefits which previously did not exist:

1. Of course, the ability to transfer money across the internet without a centralized authority.
2. The ability to tie an identity to nothing more than the money you wish to associate with that identity.
3. A clear incentive for the public to finally learn about _real_ digital security.

At this point I should confess, these beliefs I'm sharing don't require you to agree with me in order to come to fruition. I genuinely believe even with the best custodial services can offer those who take the time to learn how to manage their identities (secured by a private key only they know) will continue to take advantage of possibilities unavailable to those who do not. Here are just a few examples:

1. A single password (a seed) which grants them access to any one of their hundreds of logins.
2. Better agency to simply reject providing other identity information such has home addresses and names.
3. For the foreseeable future being immune to identity theft.

In conclusion, in the same way that email didn't gain mass adoption through services which would transcribe your hand written letters it was the mainstream that changed. Custodial services have long been the norm, Bitcoin provides a real and highly convincing alternative away from this.",1615657425,16,5

m4axha,ShuaFromSpace,I highly recommend using BlockFi,"\*\* I have zero affiliations with this company, I am just a fan

BlockFi is a mirror of traditional lending institutions in the crypto space. Simply put, hold your crypto with them and they will lend against it to institutions and individuals. I work in lending, and seriously this concept of lending with crypto WILL fundamentally change lending in the future. It might even replace the dominance of credit lending into asset-backed lending, which is a much safer and healthy way to lend.

That aside, holding your bitcoin with them nets you 6% APY, automatically. Beyond that, they have a bitcoin credit card coming out with 3.5% rewards (in bitcoin) per USD purchase, and you can get an asset backed loan from them so you can get quick cash without liquidating your bag. Their customer service is top-notch and they are a secure operation.

I cannot recommend them enough. The best way to HODL your coin is to put it into BlockFi and know that you are earning 6% per year by doing so, it really dissuades you from selling.

Here is a good source of the pros/cons: [https://cryptobuffett.medium.com/pros-and-cons-my-experience-earning-interest-with-blockfi-c27c133fa6fb](https://cryptobuffett.medium.com/pros-and-cons-my-experience-earning-interest-with-blockfi-c27c133fa6fb)

Edit: Since some of y'all can't read or follow up with an open mind and DYOR, here are the cons:

\- Lack of options for coins

\- Giving a company access to your wallets

Looking back, I'm so happy I got in when I did and not a moment later. I ended up buying more BTC in February, but with bitcoin price increasing at such a rapid pace, all I could think about in February is how I wish I went in big back in November.

I suppose the moral of this story is: I'm glad I acted when I did regardless of timing or price level, and since I can't go back in time I'm trying to make up for it by using dollar cost averaging and buying in (very) small chunks every week.

However even in the discord a lot of people were not able to answer what specific indicators he used before the last 2 pumps and it seems like a lot of people in his chats and discord like myself read that the indicators were going the other way and a lot of people got liquidated.

Im not making this post to throw shade at MC and CF I'm still trying to learn.  Especially since I've made money.  However Im overall hurting because of these crazy pumps and or dumps that seem unexplainable and everyone vomits rhetoric like, ""Noone can predict the market,"" while CF makes millions in a few days and keeps saying MC has leading not lagging indicators yet noone can answer what the indicators are.  I'm just trying to find answers.  Theres some speculation that his whale crew using leverage in the millions of dollars can basically swing the momentum to the opposite of what some indicators say.

I don't choose to believe that as how can a business that charges people 500-3000 for membership just be a phishing scam but it seems few people outside his whale crew make money and the ones that do are just guessing and speculating and cant answer specific basic questions like what indicators CF saw before the last 2 pumps up to ATH of 61000K BTC.  Also he is only 18 and if you what him talk he is very unprofessional and we've seen bigger more professional companies screw people over in the long term so just some thoughts.  Im not one way or the other just trying to get answers.

Im feeling a lot of people might have been hurt by these things and Id like to hear your story with Market Cipher good or bad.  Im also open to all feedback and tips on how to read the indicators better.  Im not interested in most peoples rhetoric of ""learn and keep watching the videos"" shilling more of the same info that isnt actually helpful.

EDIT

Funny also on his current live stream, where he asks for subs saying he never does, sells market cipher while flexing the gains he's made, and when people in chat ask questions he gets angry and tells people he's not here to teach.

3. I can't really mine at home as I just don't really want to have a huge miner with regards to electricity, fan noise, and such.
4. I do however have some ""good"" capital that I could deploy. Is that a recommended like cloud miner (I know most are scams) or similar arrangement I can make with a company or something if I'm still interested in getting involved though.

There are many great shitcoin projects out there. I am a big fan of WABI for example but most of these businesses are not actually making any money out of their projects yet. They are literally the equivilant to PENNY STOCKS.

Take Tesla for example, stock price trending sideways for years prior to this jump in price. Only just last year starting to bring in profits.

Okay ETH seems to have a 'second place' to Bitcoins first mover advantage. I get that, ETH is now desirable.

In my opinion, if we all had just stacked sats from day one, instead of 20% this shitcoin, 10% that, then we would have more POWER over the elites, more Bitcoin in our posession...more power to the people!",1615805347,9,1

I contacted their mods on Twitter but was given the same reply with no actual informative value that I was given by their support team.

It was my understanding that when it was launched the, circulating supply was about 10 billion. 3 billion will be burned via the IPO around the end of the year, 2 billion are going into Defi savings, 3 billion will be burned via the M23B program. That leaves only 2 billion. 

Then more coins will be burned via fees. This will exponentially increase as more GSpartners join who buy packages, use the GSlifestyle card, GStelecom, &amp; other services being planned. We are already burning just as many coins that are being minted, so we’re already basically deflationary. 

Once the company implements more marketing, we will attract developers with the ownership certificates. Getting listed on Binance &amp; Coinbase will explode our exposure. Coinbase has over 40 million users &amp; they provide tutorials that pay their users to learn about the coin. 

This is just the beginning. There’s sooo much more to come. I don’t think it’s going to take many years for the price to increase. We just started in December &amp; we’re already deflationary. The lower the price of the coin, the more are burned in fees.

We will get there. The wise will buy. Unless you’re a knowledgeable trader, the weak hands will just dump.

m51c75,mrfloppi,My unfortunate Bitcoin Story - A lost 300k opportunity,"Hey my fellow redditors, today I want to tell you my story, how I lost a 300k opportunity while (almost) becoming a Bitcoin early adopter and how I want to turn my fortune now by going public with my story.

# A young fool, with a plan

So to start, let's quickly jump back to November in good old 2k13, when you still where able to get one Bitcoin below the 100$ mark. Young me did his research, and made a plan: 1. Buy Bitcoins 2. ??? 3. Profit! Said that, I compiled my naiv thoughts onto a piece of paper in form of a simple Todo-List and started ticking boxes immediately:

* Look where to buy bitcoin -&gt; Check
* Find the best price -&gt; Check (It was around 100€ (120$) at that moment)
* Talk with Dad about money -&gt; Well that's where I faced some first resistance...

... as I still was a young adult I wanted to at least ask for my old mans opinion on that planned investment of mine. As soon as I had pitched the Idea of taking some real world money and and exchange it for some virtual magic internet currency named Bitcoin, I recognized this was nothing my Dad ever could warm his heart for by any chance. So I continued my list, to get some more prerequisites ready:

* Create Coinbase Account -&gt; Check
* Wait if Bitcoin drops below 300€ again -&gt; Ditched again, because it kept moving upwards 
* Ask dad for credit card -&gt; This was where my dreams finally turnt to dust...

... so as the easiest way to get Bitcoins, was by using a credit card and I didn't had one back in 2k13, I approached my dad once more with money from my piggy bank savings in hand. I asked him kindly to lend me his credit card, so I could turn 500€ into Bitcoins, but oh boy I wasn't ready for the anger I summoned by expressing this request. I was told that I could also just throw my hard saved money into the fire or out of the open window and so I refrained from ever asking my dad for many years to come.

**The last point on my list, I wrote as a premature conclusion was as follows:**  
Bitcoin (currently) too expensive, waste of money (says Dad), wait until price drops below 100€ (120 $) again, then buy 5 Bitcoin for 500€.

**Long story short:** The bitcoin price of course never dropped below the 120$ mark anymore, but instead had hit the 1000 USD mark a few weeks later. Somehow I lost interest in the topic and moved on with life.

# Fast forward to 2k21

Earlier this week, I was clearing out the storage in the basement, when I found my old college block with the old Todo-List. I read through with that bitter taste of a lost opportunity slowly appearing in my mouth, when I checked the current Bitcoin chart I was really flattened that I was kind of short by something around 300k$ because I closed my Todo-List back in 2013 with the wrong conclusion.

So since I also have heard about this new trend called NFTs, and people have already managed to sell their digital arts for sh\*tloads of money, I decided to go for it and try to turn this story of failure and bad timing into a story of success! I have converted my 2k13 Todo-List into a digital animated NFT art and put it up for auction with the help of some tutorials I carefully followed along.

Let's see, how this will turn out I'm trilled! Maybe I will have lost another 160$ wich is the amount of in fees to set up the auction, maybe this piece of Bitcoins history will get auctioned for a little amount, that I can put into Bitcoin afterwards, we will see. **But last and most importantly:** I will not look back and recognize that this new Internet-Trend for NFTs is another train I have willingly missed to board.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My fellow redditors, what I want to tell you with this story is, that if you see an opportunity then don't let anybody talk you off from it if your heart tells you otherwise. Even if you fail with your investment, then you can afterwards look back and have surely learned something out of it. Looking back and see your trail sprinkled with missed opportunities is by far worse! It's never to late to turn around.

Thanks for bearing with me!",1615747936,6,1
m51boj,jeurymejia,Congrats on being part of the 1%,"So I was just crunching some numbers and confirmed that most likely we are all part of the 1% in Bitcoin terms. 

Here's how much bitcoin it takes to be an elite bitcoiner (from least elite to most elite!):

FYI: assuming 7bil population and 21mil BTc.

99.999...% (1 human):  0.003 BTC = 300k sats!
80%: 0.00375 BTC= 375k sats! 
50%: 0.006 BTC = 600k sats!
20%: 0.015 BTC = 1.5mil sats!
10%: 0.03 BTC = 3mil sats! 
5%: 0.06 BTC = 6mil sats! 
1%: 0.3 BTC = 30mil sats! (we did it!)
0.1%: 3 BTC (elite club)
0.05%: 6 BTC (super elite club)
0.01%: 30 BTC (ultra elite club)
0.001%: ok, you and I know we will never be here - so let's not even bother but yeah you would need 300 BTC 🥲. (mini whale)
0.0001%: 3000 BTC (whale/corporation)

Anyways, as you can see - we can all still strive to be part of the 1%, fuck it we can even make it to 0.1% club (ok, this one is already tough - but make it one of your life goals buddy!)

When I went to click on the Bitcoin Cash wallet the funds were already sent to 2 separate outside wallets and my account was completely drained.

I have the transaction ID and the wallet IDs where it was initially sent. But I understand those coins are likely long gone to other wallets.

I contacted local police to file a theft report. I sent an urgent email to coinbase and suspended my Coinbase account temporarily. I contacted a lawyer specialized in Identity Theft, I contacted an organization called Coinfirm where I logged a detailed report, and I've contacted my local branch of the FBI to look into identity theft.

The cryptocurrency, which boasts a market capitalization of more than $1.1 trillion, has been [buoyed by investor optimism](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-price-surges-record-60000-stimulus-hopes-institutional-support-2021-3-1030188023).

 The surging price of bitcoin on Saturday marked an increase of 1,000% in the past year. It has also benefited from the backing of major institutions, like [Tesla](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/tesla-buys-bitcoin-elon-musk-stock-accept-form-of-payment-2021-2-1030055107?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest) and [Mastercard](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-price-surges-to-record-high-cryptocurrency-mastercard-2021-2-1030073794?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest).

[Bitcoin](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/btc-usd?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest) enthusiasts argue that ""this time is different"" for the world's biggest cryptocurrency because [big-name firms are supporting the price](https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-institutional-interest-btc-price-goldman-sachs-digital-asset-2021-3?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest) and lending legitimacy to the project.

Not everyone is won over by bitcoin though.

m4zf8j,Other_Solution_1897,What if Bitcoin reach..?,"Hello, I hope this post does not bother you here.

First of all I would like to thank you for this community.  
I am happy to write here with people who have the same interests as me.

I am writing this post because I would like to read your answers.

If you do, what would you do if bitcoin reaches your ""price target""?  
Do you buy your dream car, travel to many countries, set aside some for your kids, or even invest it?

&amp;#x200B;

I love animals. I have two cats. They were found in a cardboard box in the middle of the forest shortly after they were born. Their eyes were not even open.

When I was looking for two cats, I visited some animal shelters. They looked abnormal.  
When I got there, I was really shocked.

Then I had an experience there that I would rather not have seen.  
At the dog cages I found a female dog sitting in a small, cold and uncomfortable cage.  
She looked very sad. Wow... crying rn...

She was 16 years old and spent her whole life in that small cage. It still hurts me to think about it.  
At that moment I swore I would never have to see something like that again in my life.  
Apparently no one wanted her because she had a serious injury and didn't look healthy anymore.  
I think she had already lost the will to live.

I hate myself right now for not giving her a nice home.

I see a lot more in Bitcoin than just making quick money but if I have the chance to get a lot of money with Bitcoin, then I will set up a modern shelter with comfortable places to sleep, large areas to run etc. and hire a lot of staff so that every single animal has a human friend by their side who are there for them in good times and also in bad times.

&amp;#x200B;

The animal shelters here with us simply lack the money. No shelter gets help from the government. They all depend on donations. Often there is even a lack of food and sleeping places they often have no more. It is sad to have to see such things.

&amp;#x200B;

I am sorry if this is an emotional contribution. These are my thoughts and a big dream that I hope to realize together with bitcoin and share with the community here someday.

If you want to write something about your wishes too, write it.  
I hope to read some of it.",1615742557,1,1

My question is, will there always be some kind of lending market for Bitcoin out into the future? And if so, is this likely to be the primary way most people generate some kind of passive income from their Bitcoin hodlings?

As the market grows and more players get into the game, my suspicion is that interest rates for Bitcoin lending will go lower and lower as more and more people and institutions realize how pristine of an asset Bitcoin is. Does it ever get to the point where the rate people are willing to pay to borrow Bitcoins (for whatever purposes, and no, they're NOT just shorting, a lot of it is for ""risk free"" market making) is assumed to be the de fact risk free rate of return?

As time goes on, will lending out your hodlings (or a part of your hodlings) still be thing for generating passive income and living on your Bitcoin stack without having to sell any part of your stack? Or is borrowing/lending Bitcoin just a fad that will one day disappear?

Got a coinbase notification and clicked on the transaction out of curiosity while I waited for it to be confirmed, and it shows two inputs and two outputs — one of them looks right (10k sats), but the other is for the full balance of my wallet, and to my uneducated eyes, it looks like I messed something up and sent my entire balance off into the ether. BlueWallet only shows one outgoing transaction (for 10k sats) and my balance looks ok, but I’m sick to my stomach thinking I screwed something up here.

m66tmw,TRPBTC,Bitcoin 4hr analysis 3-16-2021,"I decided to share my analysis here. Let me know what you think :) Cheers!   


 

(The red and green arrows are the Aurox Indicator and they  recommend a buy or a sell. Red indicates where you should sell and green  indicates a buy zone. Pretty simple indicator but rather effective if I  do say so myself.)   
 

Good morning again ladies and gentlemen and welcome back to my daily look into the exciting world of BTC! Today I have the 4hr time frame pulled up and it is screaming a lot of info at us traders. Can we decipher the noise and turn it into profit is the question... The bears made their presence on the charts this a.m. across the board but the bulls are not out of the picture quite yet anyways. Lets take a look at the situation this morning.

The bears dropped the candles below the 4hr 50MA and that is typically the point I turn from bullish to bearish. I am still hesitant to claim the bears have full control. Especially after the bull market we all have been a part of since 2020. This drop was pretty expected. I gave plenty of warning that a drop was on the horizon. Even a date. The gaps sure make it easy to call things like that and it worked famously this time as well. The gap filled in less than 8 hours after Monday's candle opened. Learn how to trade a gap. You can make fistfuls of profit if you play em right. Just make sure you exercise risk management and you should do fine (stop loss)

&amp;#x200B;

The bears seem intent to bring us back below 50k. But first they have to deal with the over abundance of support below us. Thanks to the support going down wont be as easy as it would be otherwise. We recently fell below the 4hr 50 MA and the 55k support I drew on the chart. We have retaken the 55k support but the 4hr 50 MA is the real test... Can we retake this key indicator? This could be the difference between bear and bull IMO. (well the daily 50 MA is more significant but I still put a lot of weight into the 4hr 50 MA as well)  


I know some of you dont want a bear analysis but Im afraid we cannot be full bull every day. Its unfortunate I know. But hey look at it from the bright side... If BTC goes down in price I get more BTC for my money. If it goes up I get profit. Either way I win. That is  how you play this market. Dont give it a chance to make you a loser. Play the pumps but also play the dumps as well. Its crucial to becoming that great trader you want to be. Right now we still have the luxury if the support range (52k - 55k is strong support) We also have the 4hr 200 MA to catch us if we fall. Then a quick cycle to the daily shows the entire trading set up I use well below the candles. This is why I am hesitant to say bearish. But you better believe I have a stop loss set!   


Is 61k the top? I cant tell you that. What I can say is be on your toes. Whether BTC is at 61k or 6k I can make money either way. If you truly believe in Bitcoin like I do the drops should be the least of your concern. If you believe in BTC you probably think 6 figures is in Bitcoins future. With that in mind why are you tripping on short term pricing? Something to think about. I hope you all enjoy your Tuesday. Make good choices ladies and gentlemen. And always remember WTFDIK????   


TLDR: Bears are trying hard to take us down. Support is strong between 50k and 55k so the bears have their work cut out of them. Cmon bulls!

The main argument against it, is the single point of failure and the fact it’s not widely used, so you would need some Python skills when the company goes out of business. As for the single point of failure: isn’t this a problem for having just one key aswell? Also on the T, you enter everything on the device, so you have no malware/keylog risks.

Having 2 out of 3 shares or 3 out of 5 shares on different locations does seem a big plus for me. This reduces the chances of losing the seed to theft/disasters.

Has this pushed crypto and stock prices extremely?

Once things return to a state where people can go outside and spend money on crap again, will they take out their ""quick earnings"", or even their entire investments from the crypto and stock market, because they realise they need more of their money to live a live, go on holiday, to the restaurant, pub, skiing, list is endless?

Or: is the volume of this in no relation to the market caps and I'm just unable to imagine the amounts of money in these investments?

As you likely know GBTC has gone from high premiums to steep discounts. As of close yesterday GBTC closed with a 8.2% discount to assets. GBTC does have a very high annual fee of 2%. However, I think it is very reasonable to think that over the next two years GBTC could transition into an ETF eroding the discount. Not many exchanges will give you a discount on Bitcoin. 

Of course there are many limitations such as you can't easily transfer it, lend it, or have the keys. However, I think it is not completely unreasonable to think that the discount on GBTC could actually become a benefit for owners of it. 

To be clear I own shares of GBTC and trade it in client accounts. So I have a vested interest in it doing well. I would certainly hold real bitcoin if that was something available in the environment I work in. I also hold real bitcoin too.",1617118616,2,1

mgil6h,Goldman_Shats,Will Margin Calls on Funds cause Bitcoin to go down in the short term?,"So lets say the worst happens and some of these big funds are forced to liquidate their holdings as they're over leveraged on cheap margin (during the past year the banks increased their lending to increase liquidity during the pandemic, that money went to funds who bought in at market lows causing the stock market to rise). The people who lent them money are afraid of a downturn in the market that would lose them their principal, and are now trying to get it back at .75 or less on the dollar and not end up as bag holders who didn't get any of their loaned money back. When the lenders liquidate the funds to get their money back they'll sell the funds holdings at a discount (this is the cents on the dollar), tanking the markets in large block sales (ex: Viacom, Discovery).

During the housing crash the Government jumped in to bail out the banks (the bagholders of junk housing bonds), the DTCC (rule 2021- 004) said they're not planning on doing that (bailing out the bagholders). Leaving the Government as a possible lifeline. 

If the government tries to bail the lenders who didn't get their money out, they'll make the dollar less valuable and force even more printing causing a downward spiral leading to hyperinflation and a weak dollar with very little buying power.

If the government doesn't bail out the bagholding banks they could fail, also tanking the market. This would lead to a downturn in the market until those with cash reserves will buy in at huge discounts (&gt;90% in some cases).

Does this mean Bitcoin is the savior in either situation here? Laws of supply and demand say no. How many large institutional investors would cash out their bitcoin to USD to cover their other assets? Unless the DTCC starts allowing you to buy shares in companies directly with bitcoin, this event could also bring Bitcoins value down at least in the short term. 

There are some BIG assumptions here.

Gold + coins/notes + electronic bank ledgers = $10t + $10t + $80t = $100t USD

Real Estate = $200t USD

Equities = $100t USD

Bonds = $100t USD

Gold + coins/notes + bank ledgers  are all directly replaceable by Bitcoins as a store of value and a medium of exchange, so we will assume a **30% conversion rate** from these to Bitcoin. Think of it as people selling  their fiat for Bitcoin and HODL (which is what we all do here on this forum)

Real Estate, Equities and Bonds are different asset classes in comparison to Bitcoin but they still have store of value function baked in their prices, so we will assume a modest **5% conversion rate** from these to Bitcoin. These are from the people selling their houses, stocks and bonds to put into Bitcoin, might involve institutional purchasers like pension fund which is swapping out highly priced stocks and low yielding bonds to buy Bitcoin.

$100t x 30% + $400t x 5% = $50t, that's the market cap for Bitcoin after having absorbed the value from all other asset classes

divided by 20million Bitcoin (assuming 1 million Bitcoins have been lost)

trying a new CeFi called [Ledn.io](https://Ledn.io) (Canadian company). They offer a decent rate 6% APY on BTC. Although the conversion that they use for the BTC is slightly lower than the market. Specifically right now they have:  


1 BTC = 58,202$  
1 BTC Coinmarketcap = 59,101$  


So around 1.5% less. Now the point is, do they pay the interest on the BTC amount (in this case would not care amount the $ conversion that they use) or on the dollar conversion (like BlockFi for instance)? Anyone with experience with them?",1617115758,7,1

mf56n1,z-dragon-88,Creating a Cryptocurrency from Scratch," Hello everyone, I've been creating a cryptocurrency using Golang for the past 6 months. So far, I've created a blockchain based on the bitcoin source code, books, and online tutorials, and I'm currently working on a peer to peer network. Basically, the network uses TCP and RPCs to send data (the data is serialized using the Gob package) and nodes have the ability to send one another their respective version of the blockchain, update it as needed, send transactions, send blocks, etc... As for node discovery, much akin to Bitcoin, I have designed a DNS server which crawls the network, finding active nodes and adding them to a set. When a new node joins the network, it simply sends a request to the DNS which in turn returns a random node from the set for it to connect to. I also built a frontend application using Angularjs which allows users to interact with the blockchain (buy and send coins). This frontend application communicates with the Golang cryptocurrency using an API that is built into the blockchain.

With the technical stuff out of the way, the gist of my cryptocurrency is to create a digital version of the dollar. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, my coin, also known as a ""stablecoin"", has a fixed value. Up to this point, I've been working on this project entirely by myself and I do not have any contacts within the field of cryptocurrencies. I'm very serious about this project and it would be great to get some guidance from people who are involved in the industry and who have perhaps gone through the same process as me. How would I go about launching a cryptocurrency like this one? (What security checks need to be performed? Are there any potential legal issues I should be worried about? How do I get people to run nodes? How do I advertise my cryptocurrency? etc...).

Any help would be much appreciated!",1616951722,0,1

mflnxj,sobie18,Bitcoin Real Estate Strategy,"
     I am sure some of you are familiar with the BRRRR method of investing into real estate. Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat. Here is a strategy for both leveraging Bitcoin to accumulate more and build a real estate portfolio as well. The last thing I would like to do is sell any of the bitcoin that I have, but thought of a scaleable way to acquire more bitcoin while building a real estate portfolio. You can use the quickness of BlockFi loans to beat out your traditional buyers or even cash buyers by being able to close on a property faster than anyone else allowing you to get better deals on the properties. This strategy allows you to never have to pay tax any of your Bitcoin other than the interest generated and allows you to scale a Bitcoin and realestate portfolio with other peoples money.
- [ ] Find flippable house
- [ ] Get blockfi loan 
- [ ] Rehab
- [ ] Increase value of home
- [ ] Refinance with traditional lender for value of home and a 30yr fixed mortgage
- [ ] Pay off blockfi loan
- [ ] Take all the equity you built from the cash out refinance and buy more Bitcoin
- [ ] Use monthly cash flow from property to buy more Bitcoin
- [ ] Rinse and repeat

-the income generated through rentals is tax advantaged and never pay tax on the increase in bitcoin while simultaneously increasing bitcoin position through the cash flow of the properties while also gaining equity in the property as well
-Only real tax is the interest from blockfi and whatever you are unable to write off on the real estate
-Earn income through interest on BlockFi
-Gain appreciation in home and Bitcoin


-when repair is needed or unexpected expense comes up use interest from blockfi or worst case take a loan and use cashflow to pay down

I understand that there is always the chance of getting margin called through a price drop, but I would mitigate that by having something liquid available to bring the LTV back to normal.

Any thoughts on how to improve this strategy or possible problems  you forsee would be great.",1617010161,37,1

I,m looking for a team to create some sort of a decentralised crypto charity where it can maintain partnerships and promote donations on exchanges buy rounding to the closest dollar or any sort of fundraising tactics for that matter. i can imagine some sort of system where people in countries with crippling currencies can look for a new means of exchange peer to peer that will appreciate in value over time such as bitcoin and other crypto currencies. i imagine a system where money can be donated to a decentralised eco system and then the miners are in-charge of a distributing the crypto to people whom are in desperate need in which they must submit a thorougher application to be given a donation. its a wild idea because we need to trust that people will do the right thing and not just apply for this trust but maybe its the positive optimism that the world needs.

i can imagine this crypto charity to display public information on how bitcoin works and how it can change the world for the better. i also think this idea should be non for profit decentralised token of exchange that miners can earn an award for contributing to the system as well as to remain as natural as well this idea should promote online and offline cold wallet storing information and just basic information that every crypto currency holder should know when owning crypto.

5 years ago I had a friend who started mining BTC, he was constantly talking about the potencial of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, I didn't listen.

Instead, I decided to invest in another friend's business and I had just 500 USD. Where i'm from that means at least a month of surviving just for food. 

My friend's business didn't give any returns as it failed, in a situation where you need to sustain a business within a constantly declining economy and people getting shot in restaurants, it wasn't an easy task... So I cant blame my buddy.

In Dec 2017, I bought some BTC and transferred it to another exchange where I converted it to TRX. This was all done on the same calendar day.

I never reported it for tax purposes because it didn't occur to me at the time that this was a taxable event, but I'm planning to do so this year as an amendment to that year's return.

I've spent hours trying to figure out if I had a gain or loss on the transaction, but since the purchase of the BTC, the transfer, and the conversion to TRX were all within a few hours of each other, I can't figure it out. The charts don't drill down to the hour.

Generally speaking, the price of BTC declined that day and was lower at the end of the day than it was at the start of the day. 

I've found general investment tax advice online that says that for traditional securities, if you can't figure out your costs for the investment, you can just estimate but that you should be prepared to explain yourself if you're audited.

I'm planning on saying that I made no gain or loss. Is this a fair strategy?

Taking into consideration the value of the U.S dollar and the fact that they're printing hundreds of millions of dollars (maybe billions?) per year..... I've been starting to feel like I bust my a$$ everyday for paper money that is feels from a technical standpoint to be worthless. How can it maintain value when prices are constantly increasing at disproportionate rates and with the gov printing tons of it at whenever they want???

I'm curious to know how many of you think that some form of digital currency will replace the U.S. dollar and other major currencies within our lifetime?

The technology is wild... It seems like we're well on our way to potentially just going primarily digital. We get paid direct deposit, use our debit cards at the store &amp; restaurants etc, and then we buy stuff online without even having to pull our cards out because it's all ready to go at the tap of a screen.

How do you work out if it's better to keep your profits in USD and transfer over to your bank account via Fiat exchange, or convert to Bitcoin and transfer back to a local exchange in Bitcoin? 

Are there any Bitcoin gas fee calculators that are easy to understand? I don't quite get the Satoshi thing or how to calculate it. I think from my research that you could just register with lots of global exchanges and potentially make some profits of global arbitrage trading if I could just work out the gas fee issue.",1616994817,6,1

mfi2vi,Iguana_The_Wise,How I changed my mind about Bitcoin (MY STORY),"Back in November, when Bitcoin hit $18k, I was telling my friend ""SELL NOW! YOU HAVE TO SELL NOW!""

His response was that he wasn't selling because he was expecting Bitcoin to hit $50k. He bought 2 BTC back when it was around $4k in 2017.

I told him I didn't believe Bitcoin would EVER go to $50k, so it was better to cash out now before it crashed down hard like it did in 2018.

You see, the first time I heard about Bitcoin was in 2017 with all the crazy news about cryptocurrencies in general. I have a degree in Computer Science so it was easy for me to understand the technology. I thought it was awesome.

But back then, I was in it ""for the money"". I started researching different cryptos and trying to figure out which one was going to make me the most money.

I remember buying a lot of Verge (XVG). It was the most hyped up crypto back then. People were talking about the release of Wraith Protocol. Supposedly the price was going to go to ""the moon"" after the announcement of this new revolutionary protocol.

My dad bought some cryptos (Ethereum and IOTA). My mom wanted some as well (Monero and Cardano).

It was the first time we experienced a market bubble. Complete and total newbies. We got sucked into it.

I had a lot of shitcoins that crashed hard. I also had a Binance account that ended up being locked because I lost my 2FA app and was never able to get back in.

I felt like a fool.

I figured that while the idea behind cryptocurrencies was great, the market was simply pumps and dumps. I said to myself ""Lesson learned"" and moved on.

Enter COVID-19.

This is what changed everything for me. 

I've NEVER been political in my life, but after my country's government started to close down businesses and lock people inside their homes, something inside me awakened.

I'm from Costa Rica and it has always been a beautiful country, but for the past 10 years or so the economy has been going downhill hard. Everything is becoming more and more expensive. The fiscal deficit is shooting up and the only solution these ""genius"" politicians can come up with is to raise taxes and borrow money from the IMF.

So when COVID-19 hit and the government decided to fuck up everything EVEN MORE than what it was, I had enough.

That's the moment I realized that most of my political beliefs are libertarian. A whole new world opened up for me. I was in shock to see how most people in social media expect the government to solve all problems in the country. They're all brainwashed.

I'm not anarcho-capitalist. I do think the state is needed in the same way a condominium management is needed. But I have serious issues with the government trying to ""control"" and ""regulate"" everything. The world would be a MUCH BETTER PLACE if governments were limited to simply protect us from criminals, build roads and provide a little help here and there.

My country has universal health care and I'm totally fine with it, works pretty well. But that's another topic.

So back to Bitcoin.

I mentioned that when it hit $18k I told my friend to sell. That's because, despite my new discovered political views, I still believed that it would never go higher than that.

But then it hit $20k.

And then $25k.

And then $30k.

And that was the turning point for me.

Bitcoin had officially ""passed the test"".

It proved me wrong.

There is actually a chance it can succeed!

I cannot begin to explain how everything just clicked for me. I now have an opportunity to have my own money under my control. I can now be a part of a revolution. I can support the cause: Separation of money and state.

Bitcoin gives the power back to the people, the way it should be.

And I haven't even talked about banks.

Think about this: If you have 1 million dollars and you want to send that money to a friend in another city or country, why do you have to ask for ""permission"", answer questions, provide documentation or go through a bunch of hoops?

It's your freaking money! It's yours to do whatever you want with it.

What about the countless maneuvers and shenanigans that banks do with your money? 

In my country most people earn less than what they need so they all use credit cards like mad. They are slaves to debt and so, slaves to the banks.

So as you can see, my reason for investing in Bitcoin is ideological.

I'm not in it ""for the money"". The price could stay the same for all I care. Having control of my money is good enough for me.

By the way, my friend was 100% in it for the money. He's now selling his bitcoin because his price goal was $50k.

Guess who's buying from him?

I recently just created a stop-limit to sell a coin at 0.05. The coin's currently sitting at 0.057. However when I placed the stop-limit it seems like it immediately attempted to fill the order as I can no longer access the coins.

Shouldn't I be able to access them until the price hits the stop? The price of the coin has actually gone up a bit since putting in the order and I'd like to sell it but I can't because Binance is prioritizing this stop limit to sell.

I might be remembering wrong but I thought last time I did this I was able to have a stop-loss to prevent loss as well as a stop-limit to sell the coin if it reached my target. But now I've put in a stop-loss and I can't do anything at all, it seems, until the coin hits the loss point? I'm clearly missing something here!",1615653158,10,2

m48mfe,CarbonTail,An article+video from 2011 talking about 'How to mine bitcoin',"**https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/mine-bitcoin-and-make-money-0130363/**

I went to Google and searched for 'how to mine bitcoin' for dates between 2011 and 2012. Returned a few results and I found this article very interesting, especially it's comment section.

You have a few questioning the legitimacy of Bitcoin, a few defending the usefulness and practicality of Bitcoin and some even asking the site to start accepting donations in Bitcoin. A very interesting read. Here are sample comments:

* ""This is crazy! I didn't know much about Bitcoin before this article. How ""legit"" is this? I assume that getting currency for nothing isn't ""legal.""""

* ""It's completely legal, it's only cost is electricity, really. I've bought loads of things with Bitcoin, it's completely legit :D.""



* ""When you crack a hash-block with your processors, the Bitcoin network gives you all 50 BTC from that hash-block. That's how you make money ;p. Every algorithm your computer solves makes you BTC. You can even exchange Bitcoin for cash. WonderHowTo should accept bitcoin donations :). I've been investing cash into Bitcoin for a while, and have returned alot more money than spent. It's like a mix between gold and stocks. Buy when it's low, sell when it's high. But the average value of 1 BTC is always rising, and when it drops, it's only for a few minutes to a few days."" 

50 BTCs per hash block, ah the good old days.

Only if the dumb teen in me back then had taken the interest in Bitcoin mining; but whatever, KEEP HODLING.

Also, you bitches should stop jizzing over every $10k increase in price. Wonder what'll happen to you when BTC hits $1 mil per coin.

KEEP HODLING!",1615649783,0,1
m48l79,FarmerInASuit,Setting a buy order,"My timing is impeccable! I received payment for a service a few days ago. The check cleared my bank last night. The dollars I intended to put straight into BTC. Uncle Sam beat me to the punch with his airdrop. 

I have $1180 to put into BTC...I’m seeking what would you do to try and make a decision. Do I just market buy and drop it all at one time  or do I set up a limit but for a dip? I already DCA a set budgeted amount. 

Given the sudden surge last night my gut says put the cash on the exchange and wait a few days to see if it drops.
