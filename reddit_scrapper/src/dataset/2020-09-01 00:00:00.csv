inn5ou,chillinxx07,help needed with anon wallet for receiving bitcoins,"Hi gents :) sorry I'm a bit new to this..

I'm looking for a wallet to receive bitcoins from people.

I want the wallet to be anon and not linked to me in any way.

What is the best approach for this?

1) Physical Ledger Nano x?  
Buying it from Amazon would be linked to me? It's the only safe (official manufacture) place I can buy it safe where i live.

2) A digital wallet?   
But I don't want to install any software on any of my devices. Is there a strictly online wallet without ID verification?

3) Paper wallet?  


Thanks for your help :)",1599403423,7,1

inlbi4,Immediate-Host,Question about ColdCard,"I am in the process of getting routined in sending and receiving funds on my coldcard, so I created a new skeleton wallet on the sd card, connected the json wallet via sd card reader to my linux computer and launched electrum which automatically found the new-wallet.json.

I then used the receive function in Electrum and sent 10000 satoshis there as a test which went well and was displayed in my history. After I successfully received the funds I inserted the SD card into my coldcard again.

Now what is unclear to me is:

1. How does the cold card ""know"" that funds were received when it was never connected to a network? 
(With only the xpub key being exposed to electrum)

2. If I would enter my 24 word seed in a recovery situation, would the 10k sats get revovered? 

3. If I would destroy the skeleton wallet file new-wallet.json, how would I access the 10k sats I sent there, would I only be able to access them with my 24 words?

Is this really safe to do once I store all my funds on this or another skeleton wallet? 

4. Can I check the balance on my coldcard itself without connecting it to a PC that is connected to a network?",1599395900,29,1

Some elites created this ultimate money. A system that could be used to base and value everything truly. There is a reason there is 21million bitcoin and if that changes it forks. People think that it matters that the hash rate of bitcoin is mostly in china. It doesn‚Äôt. China isn‚Äôt going to attack the network, They know if they do bitcoin will fork. The miners in china will create there own bitcoin but they will leave the world behind just to transact on their own. They will essentially miss out on the new worlds economy. There is a reason bitcoin is transparent. It‚Äôs okay if China decided to attack bitcoin. Bitcoin would fork, and bitcoin would still be for the world. This is proven. Any fork of bitcoin is way less of a success because it is vulnerable compared to the world. You divide yourself from the world if you fork bitcoin. That would just make you weak and vulnerable to attacks. China knows this and has the advantage. SO MAYBE CHINA MADE IT.",1599371636,3,1

ing8xz,x23_shivam,Bitcoin legality in India ‚Äì Is Bitcoin Legal ?," 

**Bitcoin** has been a heavy financial blow to the trading world since it rose to significance. The flickering uncertainty of the traditional economy, entirely controlled by the government has caused several disastrous events in the past. But Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies in the world are completely free from government and political influence, which don‚Äôt lose its value over a political takeover.¬†

India has also witnessed the rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in some events. You may remember the demonetization and the aftermath of it. Here in India, we saw a spike of Bitcoin users around that time but the sudden ban imposed by the RBI made it all gone. Now that after two years the Supreme Court has overruled the decision of RBI, the Indian cryptocurrency market is slowly rising from ashes.

But the question remains, about Bitcoin legality in India if legal then does it have a framework and regulations passed by the Government?

Before we find answers to these questions, let‚Äôs look back at the beginning.

## The Beginning 

Started in 2009, Bitcoin first rose to global significance in the year 2017. It was the first time for bitcoin to cross the $1000 mark but it didn‚Äôt stop there.¬†

Then came a blow from the Chinese government when the People‚Äôs Bank of China decided to tighten its grip on the cryptocurrency market. As a result, the graph went down by 30%, however, it successfully maintained its steady growth. Around May, it had jumped well over $2000.

It was December 17, the Crypto exchange recorded its highest value of all time as the Bitcoin value was standing on the number $19,783.21.

But the market subsequently came down and nowadays it roams around the $10,000 mark.¬†

## India Banned Cryptocurrency in 2018

Surprisingly when the world was facing a crypto bull market race, Indian backed down from the idea and the Reserve Bank of India imposed a de facto ban on the trading of crypto.

The RBI assessed that there were multiple risks involved in dealing with crypto and should be immediately banned to trade it. As a result, the huge market that was yet to understand its potential was dismissed.¬†

Many people and respective associations spoke against it and the Internet &amp; Mobile Association of India went to the Supreme Court against the RBI‚Äôs decision.¬†

At that point, India had around 5 million cryptocurrency users, who were actively trading and using Bitcoin as a currency. But all of a sudden it all shut down, as the users were left with the option to either hold on to their Bitcoin savings or trade through the foreign.¬†

But since Supreme Court took the matter in hand the situation began to change. Unlike RBI, SC had a wider view on the matter and asked about the reasons of the Bitcoin trade ban.

While there wasn‚Äôt any satisfactory answers from the RBI, the Supreme Court lifted the ban on the use of Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in 2020.¬†

It seems like, with the ban lifted, India is currently free to deal or trade in Bitcoins without any barriers. But it isn‚Äôt that easy.¬†

## Bitcoin legality in India¬†

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t5bxt1cnlgl51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b4d014c65e4a8bb3e787531b7654eb37d736994

 

# Now having covered all the backstories, let‚Äôs take a look at the main question of this article.

# Can you trade bitcoins now?

# The answer is- Yes. Trading or dealing with bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency like Ethereum is legal in India. You can trade, buy, and sell bitcoins from domestic or foreign exchanges and even invest in them.

Startups like WazirX, Lastbit, Zebpay, and international companies like Paxful are providing platforms to market crypto as the optional currency. CEOs of these companies are hopeful for the near future as India is counted among the five countries to have the most Bitcoin users.¬†

But there are some problems yet unresolved.

Crypto Mining. Though the SC lifted the ban from crypto trading, crypto mining is still impossible in India. Mining is a work that requires specific technologies and a high supply of electricity. While the latter is a problem in India, the former is the bigger challenge. Because the machine to mine bitcoins, ASIC is still illegal to import.

ASIC standing for application-specific integrated circuit is the most advanced technology to mine bitcoin profitably. When the crypto was banned, importing ASIC was also banned. So, now the miners are left with nothing useful other than GPU technology to mine. While GPU was useful 10 years ago, today it simply doesn‚Äôt work.

It‚Äôs also unlikely to manufacture ASIC in India, because it only works for the purpose of crypto mining only. As long as there‚Äôs no stable market here, manufacturers wouldn‚Äôt take the risk to produce it here.

So, the conclusion on Bitcoin legality in India can be to trade crypto but not mine it. We think it‚Äôs still a fair opportunity to get the Indian crypto market a bit more stability and then the government might reconsider their stand on crypto mining.¬†¬†

in7ntc,spaceraingame,Why hasn't the main function of Bitcoin gone mainstream yet?,"Let me preface by saying this is not meant to be criticism or hate towards Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, etc. I've invested thousands in Bitcoin in the past, HODLed like you wouldn't believe through its massive ups and downs, and bought/sold it multiple times along with other cryptos. I see its potential as a legitimate currency, or rather I did.

But therein lies the issue I've been struggling with. To my understanding, the main function of a currency is to spend it and use it to purchase things and to pay bills. Bitcoin, a CURRENCY, is surely intended for such uses as well, as are other crypto*currencies* across the market. Therefore, why has this function not gone mainstream with Bitcoin yet? Why aren't that many people using cryptos to actually spend it on things, which is literally the purpose of any currency? And if that isn't their main purpose, why are they called currencies?

It just seems like a very tiny percentage of people who own Bitcoin actually spend it on things, and even less do so regularly. It seems the vast majority of people who purchase it simply do so with the intention to sell it later at a higher price or to add value to their investment portfolio. This is perfectly fine, of course, but that can't possibly be the main function of Bitcoin if it's meant to be a currency, something meant to be SPENT on things. 

Then there's the argument that not enough people are familiar with Bitcoin...that argument just doesn't hold anymore, especially with its value having peaked (so far) at $20K in late 2017 and continuing above 11,000 until just recently. Pretty much everyone and their grandma has heard of Bitcoin at this point and knows what it is. There's also the issue of not many major online retailers currently accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment, like Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Target, Apple etc. and they drive the vast majority of eCommerce.  

My guess is its value is too volatile and unstable for people to treat it the same way they treat their actual money (USD, etc.). It seems its fluctuating value has dwarfed its true purpose; since its value is so unsteady, people see it as having potential to increase a return on their investment if they later sell it for a profit. So they'd rather just do that than to actually spend it on a new pair of shoes or something. Plus, say what you will about the diminishing value of the US dollar, but it seems it'll be far more stable than the Bitcoin will be in the foreseeable future, possibly ever. 

And my last point is something I've wondered since I first even heard of Bitcoin. Regular government-appointed currencies like the US dollar are already pretty much digital anyway, since people buy things online and know how to send payments digitally and load them on their PayPal account or send them through online venders like Square Cash, Venmo, Chase QuickPay etc. So isn't that way too hard for cryptocurrencies to compete with, since that is far too mainstream and established and people trust it too much already? 

Yes I'm aware of the benefits crypto has over regular currencies like USD, but as it stands now, those benefits seem to be outweighed by its volatility that make its intended purpose far less lucrative. Again, please don't interpret this as hating on Bitcoin, but merely an attempt to understand it. I just don't see that many people treating it as anything other than a stock, which is not at all the same thing as a currency. Feel free to change my mind.",1599335505,54,1

ilthsj,odonnellnoel,For all the people selling their BTC and investing in DeFi...,"I just want to say what an enormous risk you are all taking.

It's almost fall 2020, BTC is almost 12 years old, and institutional investors are only beginning to **dip their toes** into BTC. And just their little toes. 

The last 4 years have seen significant financial infrastructure built around BTC such as Bakkt, CME futures and other futures markets, plus institutional funds with firms such as fidelity investments, and even after all that, investors from traditional finance are only beginning to **think about** the possibility of allocating a small % of capitol into BTC.

Do you seriously think these massive traditional finance players who are worth billions .... care about DeFi?

DeFi is so off the radar of these people, most have probably never hear of it, and if you explained it to them they'd probably laugh and say ""sounds like a nice toy"".

If you're in the crypto bubble, and are listening to the rantings of V. Buterin, and other blue-checkmark figure heads from the space, it's easy to get sucked in by the propaganda and really believe that DeFi will change the world - and it might - but don't hold your breath. The fact is DeFi is built on a blockchain (Ethereum) which has an enormous mountain to climb in terms of scaling beyond 15 TPS, and the entire DeFi space is built on this blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain size is ballooning out of control and soon will be out of the reach of the average hobbyist.

BTC on the other hand is built with incredible care and precision and nothing is rushed. It's blockchain and codebase are rock solid because the bitcoin ethos is quite the opposite of Ethereum's: Move slow and mend things. It's this attitude that has won BTC the attention of institutional investors and is the reason why they are beginning to consider looking at it as part of their portfolios.

I may be wrong, but I think Ethereum is a long way off being seen as anything but a toy by these big institutional players - especially for all the promises it makes - such as being the ""world computer"". Buzzwords are great, but high net-worth investors who know what they're doing do not invest in buzzwords. They perform rigorous analyses of the performance of the asset, the underlying algorithms and scour the entire ecosystem for any signs of inconsistencies or weaknesses.

So the BTC price has taken a bit of a tumble in the last day - I urge you to **stand firm** and do not sell your precious BTC because you heard some random YouTuber say that DeFi is the future.

If you see this dip in price as anything other than an opportunity to accumulate more bitcoin, then you are on the wrong side of history.",1599140112,117,1

### Why did I title my milestone collection ""AudioVisual Bitcoin Art""?

I will set the tone for my explanation here, with Merriam Webster's definition of ""audiovisual"":¬†[Definition of Audiovisual](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/audiovisual)[**:**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/audiovisual) designed to aid in learning or teaching by making use of both hearing and sight.

Since embarking on this mission to¬†educate the masses about bitcoin using visual art, I have contemplated long and hard about how best to impact people with combinations of images and words.

I've studied the words and practices of¬†experts in social psychology and propaganda¬†from the likes of Gustave Le Bon, Edward Bernays, Friedrich Nietzsche, and others.

The voice of Gustave Le Bon, particularly seems to always ring in my head as I take particular creative decisions, at times when questioning whether or not a certain image may resonate with ""the crowd""

¬†*""The imagination of the crowds ‚Ä¶ is impressed above all by images. ‚Ä¶ It is possible to evoke them through the* *judicious* *use of* ***words*** *and* ***formulas****.""*

*So here is my formula:* 

**3 pieces of art** using the same structure, each with their own narrative, to¬†propagate¬†the base idea ""bitcoin is better money"" with different groups of people: 1) The fundamental/economically focused, 2) The risk averse/wealthy, and 3) individuals who highly value freedom.

**4 key points** for each of those narratives, animated with full audio tracks to create a more immersive viewing experience.

**Repetition and Reinforcement** of the over-arching phrases and easy-to-understand aspects of the entire message for each.

All 3 pieces will also be released on collector's edition prints via [www.luchopoletti.com](https://www.luchopoletti.com).

Each print will offer the audiovisual experience of the animation in an augmented reality layer via the artivive app.",1599138720,0,1

I started uni last year and began to look at cryptocurrency and bitcoin at the same time.
So I've been following btc for almost a year now but never really invested anything.
I am using binance and messed a bit with its future system to see how trading in future works (lost a couple 20‚Ç¨). I really want to invest more into bitcoin, get into it (in a reasonable way) and hold for the long term. 
Though I keep telling myself that I missed the wave when it was at 8k or that I don't have the knowledge to invest yet.

Anyway, I am looking for opinions and advice, like is binance a good platform or do you recommend something else ? Using binance as a wallet ? Should I just go for it ? Should I get into trading or just holding ?

Idk what else to say, please try to convince me!

So I'm a HODLer, but I've always had a price target in mind whereupon I would sell, unfortunately pay taxes on, and then plow into dividend-paying stock and bond funds in order to generate passive income that I could simply live on, meet expenses with, etc.

I don't WANT to have to sell my Bitcoins though.

I wish, wish, wish there were better ways to generate passive income through hodlings so that I could still meet expenses but not have to sell my hodlings.

I know there are places like Blockfi, but I find it a little uneasy trusting them to custody my hodlings whereby they then generate income by letter other guys borrow it and the giving me a piece of the interest. Maybe I'm being overly paranoid and it's a fine method (whereupon please tell me!), but are there current or future ways in the works that would allow people to keep their hodlings but also somehow generate a yield to live off of instead of having to sell a part of their stash everytime to meet expenses?

For example, ways to purchase dividend-paying stocks with Bitcoin directly?

The haul was found in the lunch box of a flyer at Manchester Airport by HM Revenue and Customs in 2018, but under new ‚Äúcivil proceeds of crime powers laws‚Äù, the bars are being sold off this week.

All the proceeds are going back into the ‚Äúpublic purse‚Äù, so will be spent on services including hospitals and schools.

The gold bars weighed in at 16kg, or as the Customs described it, the ‚Äúaverage weight of an adult Staffordshire Bull Terrier‚Äù.

The passenger who had been carrying the bars has not faced criminal prosecution.

Gill Hilton, assistant director at HMRC's Fraud Investigation Service, said it was the first time the 2017 Criminal Finance Act had been used to ‚Äúseize and forfeit a listed asset, and it should act as a deterrent to criminals looking to trade assets such as precious metals‚Äù.

The wallet said to check email for authorization. I got no email. I tried login on desktop, still no authorization email.

I decided to contact [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com) support. After waiting 3 weeks they finally replied with solution to change the email of my wallet. I agreed. When I tried to change email I got an error message saying: ""Email does not match the email address associated with this wallet."" 

WTF? Blockchain wallet somehow deleted or changed my email, so I can't access my wallet anymore.

I decided to restore wallet from backup. Did restoration process and got access to completely different wallet that has not been used for 4 years. I literally have emails about receiving a transaction few month back with my wallet ID written in the email. But when I try to access the wallet with backup those transactions do not exist.

Now this wallet I'm getting access to is still mine, so it's possible that it somehow erased/lost data of past 4 years. I had only one Blockchain wallet (and all emails I ever received from Blockchain have same wallet ID written in them), so it's not possible that I mixed my wallets.

**Lending with counter-party risk, 4 to 6% interest per year**

* Blockfi (seem to be the most established one, with US regulatory approvals and etc)
* Celsius (seemed super fishy at first but the community seems to respect them)
* [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) (also seemed fishy but well liked by the community
* Nexo (quite established EU company, with very serious mother company behind them)
* [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) (They are new to the game but offer the highest interest and have been around since forever)

**Lending with exchanges with counter-party risk, variable interest based on demand**

* bitfinex (please note there are at least couple of legal claims against them so they can go under at any time, but offer lending for lots of tokens)
* Liquid (only BTC and ETH here, not sure how stable they are)
* Poloniex ( have been around for a while but you can lend only few cryptos and interest is usually small, because demand there is weak)
* (Binance) but their offers are sold out almost all of the time, so never managed to try them

**The ""farming"" kind, DeFi, no counter-party risk**

* Uniswap (They seem to be the everyone's favorite kid around the block, only downside I see is the ""impermanent loss"" meaning if you provide ETH and DAI (you have to always provide in pairs) you can end up with lots of DAI and little of ETH and effectively have sold your ETH at lower price, missing price appreciation for trading fees which likely won't offset the long term upside potential of ETH. Not sure how profitable is providing only stablecoin pairs to avoid that risk.
* Curve.fi (I'm about to research them just now, will update later)
* [Yearn.finance](https://Yearn.finance) (The mostly automate the use of the above 2 and some defi lending ones, but adding it anyway since they seem to be super hot now)

**Lending to defi ones with no counter-party risk**

I'm yet to research those

Anyone have insights as to whether I should buy and if 50% of my net worth is crazy?",1599630510,63,1

ip2oh0,jgarcya,Help me understand something about bitcoin,"I've been thinking about this for a while now.

Price is created by supply and demand... Someone has to sell, and there needs to be buyers. More buyers than sellers equal greater demand therefore increase in price... I understand this.

Currently there is talk that the number of hodlers are increasing.... So that means less and less bitcoin is being traded... Also I understand that miners are bringing btc to market to sell to cover costs, but due to halving this amount decreases every 210,000 blocks/approximately 4 years.

So in theory, as more holders come to btc...less btc comes to market... Price goes up.

Here's what I need to understand...
As holders keep holding, and buying dips....they currently are subject to the traders...

Even if 20.5 million btc are mined... And 20 million btc are held.... It is that .5 million that is being traded, that controls the price...

So as more and more btc is taken out of circulation, less and less is being traded....

It is this small amount traded controlling price...

Let's say btc stays at a range of $8500- 12k for 10 years.... This is possible if people slowly take btc off the market... Which is probably happening now.

Unless huge amounts of people flock to btc in a short amount of time, and all the available btc brought to market sells ASAP.... There is no way we can reach highs of $100,000.

If we continue at our current pace of growth...spread over years... It is most probable that for the next few years, possibly until next halving, we may stay in a range of 4k- 14k...

Back then in high school I used to use bitcoin to buy weed (semi) anonymously on the dark web, so I could sell it in person and make some extra money. 
There were plenty of times when I owned 5-6 coins at a time. (Yes I was a high school weed dealer sourcing my product from the darknet lmao, crazy times)

Anyways every once in a while I look back and think. If I had just held those coins instead of spending them on fucking marijuana, I could have seen my investment turn into 40-50-60 thousand dollars, maybe even more.

I hear a few trading for tether the other day and calling for a further drop below 10k USD.  
One of my favs called for this correction to be one that doesn't breach 10k with conviction, personally I've been on his side with this call and it was made quite early as well.  Now though it is only fair to make this assumption at the current time regarding bitcoin against the dollar.

To the traders in the room... ?¬†Isn't this a clear reversal pattern?, or is the possible inverted H&amp;S invalidated by the fact the 2nd shoulder has extended too far to maintain the possible inverted H&amp;S pattern? Or was this ""distorted inv. H&amp;S"" never really there?.  
Remembering a continued squeeze only leads to a more violent movement. Or is It¬†that i am not holding tether to be the reason i am not Bearish?, is my bullish view justified here with a possible reversal.?  
Will the 55EMA hold up here as resistance?¬† Personally i think not.

ita8pc,ztsmart,Money is the root of all evil,"*Money is the root of all evil* is a cliche that has existed for over 2000 years and one I only came to understand though Bitcoin.

First, it should be noted that the phrase is money is the *root* of all evil, not evil itself.  A root is mechanism by which flora procure the resources they need to grow large and sustain their existence.  In botanical terms roots are often part of the supported organism but this is not always the case as there are instances where trees hijack &amp; take over an existing root structure to draw resources from a root that are not their own.  In any case a large tree cannot exist without a root, as without a root the size of malicious botany is limited to moss and other tiny bryophyta.

Likewise the governments that tower over us and dictate our lives with onerous laws as they go about conducting wars with each other, running over dissidents with tanks, and wastefully consuming the hard-earned resources by individuals, could not exist without a root.

And that root is the existing money.  Governments can of course raise taxes or borrow to fund their activities but those funding sources have real-world economic limitations that constrain the growth of a government.

There is a third source of funding--Seigniorage, the profit from the creation of new currency, that allows for then unconstrained growth of government to a level that would otherwise be impossible.  And as long as this root exists, large oppressive governments will grow into oppressive regimes that rob individual citizens of their resources and even their lives.

Bitcoin's existence is incomparable with the existing root structure.  It provides a more efficient tool for coordinating economic activity among this economic biosphere and does so in such a way that governments cannot extract undue resources via the creation of new currency units.

For each instance of economic activity Bitcoin will either be gained or lost.  An entity that does not carefully consider this immutable truth will soon find itself without the Bitcoin necessary to conduct economic activity.  In other words, the only sustainable economic activity that will be allowed will be profitable economic activity.  Of course you can have unprofitable activity with Bitcoin but only when paired with activity that is profitable, and this activity when viewed in total must be profitable.

In this way Bitcoin provides a new root structure for the coordination of resources that renders the existing one obsolete.  This kills all unprofitable governments--i.e. governments for whom their actions in total are considered by individuals to be not worth their total cost.  You can still have government, but it will be tiny moss, constrained by economic reality to a size where it cannot cause much harm.

When can then say that money is the root of all prosperity and evil, at least on the scale of evil that only governments can commit is gone along with the corrupted root that gave rise to them.",1600181370,44,1

Today FATF announced a new regulatory recommendation. It contains recommendations to include p2p transactions, transactions with non kyc exchanges, privacy coins, unhosted private wallets and mixers as red flags.

FATF is a pet kept by the US gov. In other words, FATF's recommendations become the worldwide AML standard. To say that is are 'risky' is the same as saying to ban it.

The future of privacy is dark. We can use coinjoin, payjoin, or privacy-focused alt, but it will get harder and harder. This is because the modern AML mechanism works in a bizarre way of thinking that ""nothing to hide nothing to fear so no need privacy"".



To solve this, I think bitcoin will someday need to set the anonymous transfer feature as default. Mixing, zero-knowledge proof, ringCT... whatever, to make sure that traders are not considered potential criminals just to use the privacy protocol.

If Bitcoin is widely accepted then now, it will be difficult for the government to ban it even if privacy is dafault. Many traders will rebel, and the source code cannot be interfere because it belongs to the freedom of speech.

issy74,Cryptok12,.crypto domain squatting laws?,".crpto domain name squatting

Hi crypto community.

I know there is controversy surrounding domain squatting on .com and most other extensions that form part of the iCANN registry, so to my knowledge it‚Äôs ‚Äúmostly‚Äù illegal to register a domain name of a famous brand or celebrity in the hopes of cashing in by selling it to them later.

I have a question that doesn‚Äôt fit the mould above. Crypto currency domains specifically the .crypto domains bought at unstoppable domains.

Now unstoppable domains take a good approach by auto protecting most brands/celebrities as if you type in a brand name ie, Burgerking.crypto is returns results ‚Äúprotected‚Äù

There are some company names it misses and returns no ‚Äúprotected‚Äù status.

So with ICANN not being tied to .crypto domains what stops a person from registering a companies .crypro domain and trying to make a huge profit by selling it to them at a later stage. Does the company have any legal rights from a trademark perspective to file a domain squatting, trademark theft lawsuit?",1600114188,0,1

so recently I start to think what can I do to help a newbie

the conclusion is to build a website where I can categories every website related to bitcoin

so a newbie can discover the website they will need in the future if they plan their journey in bitcoin

but today I ask myself again if this really can help a newbie

isr3pz,dlerium,Ideal Software Wallet,"Been thinking about this a bit, and I keep looking out every few months and there's still no real good option IMO.

These are 2 options that I've been longing for, but it seems to be hard to come by.

1. BIP 39 seed phrase with **custom length** options. Most seem to be 12 or 24 and that's it. You can't restore a 24 word phrase on a wallet that only does 12 words, or whatever. In an ideal scenario we follow BIP39 protocols and say allow 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 long phrases. In some ways the unknown length offers some security and allowing users to select their own desired length (having a minimum of 12 to maintain reasonable security) can help with that. What's crazy is almost no wallet allows restoring of custom length phrases. I've found that BitPay actually is one of the few that works with a 15 word phrase for instance.
2. Cross-Platform. Not only just iOS and Android, but desktop and maybe even web (run locally in the browser) would be cool. Think of how Discord and Slack are loved for group messaging. They're on every mobile platform, desktop platform, and on the web. Why does this matter? Ease of use. I shouldn't have to worry about my coins if I switch from iOS to Android or vice versa. Exodus seems to come the closest here.",1600108938,15,1

iv67w1,stackingsatseveryday,Likelihood of 51% attack?,"I am relatively new to bitcoin ‚Äî I have to admit that i thought that bitcoin was a scam / ponzi scheme as many people around me seem to dismiss it and I often hear the words tulips and beanie babies every time someone bring it up. With that saying, I have done quite a bit of homework and I am convinced to become a hodler for at least intermediate term for this halving cycle. 


Now on to the question:

How likely is the 51% attack to ever happen?

Is there an incentive for someone to actually stage a 51% attack? I know that it costs a lot (seem like 20-30 billion usd from what I researched) and the attacker doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to do anything but double spending ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt seem to really be worth doing unless you have at least 10-15 billion usd in bitcoin? 


So if the price of bitcoin increase substantially, I understand that that the cost of mining will increase substantially as well? (As more miners will jump in?) 

Even then, it seems that the only incentive I can think of is to destroy the creditability of bitcoin without gaining anything much financially? 

So the most likely candidate is the US government / central banks? But right now the market cap of bitcoin is still small or its probably not really a threat to them yet? But if bitcoin‚Äôs market cap really grow significantly to become a threat, then the cost to stage the 51% attack will grow significantly too?


China? Russia?

Background: 28 year old with no financial obligations (no house, wife, kids etc). Have a stable job working for a Hedge Fund in London.

The way I see Bitcoin is essentially an asymmetric risk/reward bet. There‚Äôs a possibility it doesn‚Äôt take off from the $10k mark and the price falls indefinitely (for various reasons which we all know).

On the flip side we have a number of bullish signals which could realistically 10x the price over the next 5 years.

My argument is - with house and equity prices at all time highs, what is my best bet to maximise my income for the future? A provably scarce hard asset that has an enormous network effect and the possibility to grow into a multi trillion market seems like a sensible option.

If it all goes wrong then I will cry myself to sleep for a few days and just re-earn it all back in about 2 years.

It still feels that the inclusion of Decentralisation and Cryptocurrency is not a plan India will anytime. People can do frauds easily these days and the governments are categorizing this issue worse than rrape. If someone is good at crypto, knows how to trade, has money to risk, and more importantly is in his right mind looking to trade, what is the role of government here? They can charge and collect huge taxes if you earn money. As if crypto has much utility. 

Geopolitics around Bitcoin Price is still another issue. Nothing goes right except the fact that people believe in Bitcoin as the paper currency of the future, and we as a community don't want to pay 100$ + in fees to transfer 100$ in global remittance. We represent Migrants, labor class to send money back home and we are spot on with crypto payments. 

There is a demand for Bitcoin and there are a million avenues to spend and hold your crypto. We no longer need to rely on tuition, everything is available online.

Last week, the Bitcoin was able to break the $10,600 resistance and stay above $10,200, thus establishing a bullish trend in the short term. The BTC price reached as high as $11,185 and then formed a sideway channel, with support near $10,800.

In order to continue with the bullish trend, the price needs to stay above the current support and break the new resistance at $11,200. Due to the low volatility in the past 2 weeks, the BTC price is not expected to reach $12,000 within this week.

**Review of the weekÔºö**

The CEO of Elitium published an article on Cointelegraph, expressing his views on the future of DeFi. As mentioned in the article, DeFi is the next evolution of the financial system, but there are many factors that affect the future of DeFi. For example, one is Ethereum 2.0 and its attempt to solve the scalability of Ethereum. Its success or failure will affect everything related to the Ethereum blockchain. Another factor is the response of banks and regulators to DeFi. Currently, DeFi must supervise itself as an industry. It must act in an ethical manner and develop solutions, such as insurance, to protect people. Unless we develop and meet these standards, DeFi will not be able to compete with traditional banking systems. There is also that practitioners in crypto industry should educate the public about DeFi and help them understand why this new technology can benefit people‚Äôs daily lives. In addition, DeFi alone is unlikely to be adopted on a large scale. Some people simply don‚Äôt want to deal with completely decentralized technology.

following the instructions here - [https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#linux-instructions](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#linux-instructions)

i downloaded the tar file and dragged the tar file to the external hard drive (possible problem point?).

i extracted the file in the external drive. 

i tried to run the following command from the instructions - sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bitcoin-0.20.1/bin/\*

and got the following error - 'bitcoin-0.20.1/bin/\*': No such file or directory

now... there is definitely a bin file in the extracted bitcoin - 0.20.1 folder from the tar extraction.

I've been watching the [mempool.space](https://mempool.space) site and I think it strange that transaction fees range from a couple of sats to 500 or even 2000 sats/vB. Why is that? Are there actually wallets out there that puts such a large fee or are miners trying to influence fee estimators to suggest a higher than necessary fees for their own gain? 

If you look at the picture below, most transactions in mempool are like 8 sat/vB while the biggest fee is 500. Yesterday night was worse where highest fees where upwards of 2000 s/vB. And one a block is mined, new transactions with high fees are immediately broadcasted. It smells a bit fishy to me. But maybe I'm missing something.

iyrhzf,cryptoanalyticatech,"MicroStragegy‚Äôs Bitcoin Play is Just Smart Business, Nothing Else: CEO Explains"," MicroStrategy has been featuring more in cryptosphere and it all started when it converted its primary asset base into Bitcoin.¬†However, the business intelligence software provider is also staying aware of the possible swings in Bitcoin‚Äôs price and is ready to sell at a moment‚Äôs notice.

Safety Amid an Economic Downturn

Earlier this week, Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy‚Äôs chief executive, sat for an¬†interview¬†with Bloomberg, where he spoke about the firm‚Äôs shocking move to hold over $400 million in Bitcoin. There, he explained that they see Bitcoin as a safer asset, especially compared to cash and gold.

Saylor explained in part that he chose to make the move to Bitcoin because he had seen the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on traditional assets. Before the pandemic hit, the firm had about $500 million in assets, which it had invested primarily in short-term government securities.

Sadly, the pandemic caused yields on the securities to tumble, and Saylor knew that the company had to move into something more reliable.

‚ÄúOnce the real yield on our treasury got to more than negative 10%, we realized that everything we are doing on P&amp;L is irrelevant. We really felt we were on a $500 million melting ice cube,‚Äù he said.

The company eventually found the safety it sought with Bitcoin. In July, MicroStrategy¬†announced¬†in a formal announcement that it had switched its primary asset base to the leading cryptocurrency, purchasing about 21,454 BTC for $250 million. Among other things, the Virginia-based tech giant highlighted that Bitcoin had proven itself a dependable store of value.

In the weeks since then,¬†MicroStrategy¬†has doubled down. In a¬†filing¬†with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it confirmed that it could purchase even more of the asset. However, that would only happen after assessing its cash needs and business strategy.

Just Business for MicroStrategy

Days later, the company¬†purchased¬†an additional 17,000 BTC tokens ‚Äî bringing its total Bitcoin haul to about $425 million.

Considering that it is putting a lot of its eggs in the crypto basket, Bloomberg was curious about whether Saylor was worried about Bitcoin‚Äôs famed volatility and how much a sharp price drop could gut his firm.¬†

However, Saylor brushed off any concerns. In part, he said:

‚ÄúWe can liquidate it any day of the week, any hour of the day. If I needed to liquidate $200 million of Bitcoin, I believe I could do it on a Saturday.‚Äù

Saylor added that the asset‚Äôs volatility isn‚Äôt much of a problem as he could quickly move away from it and get the company‚Äôs money back. The CEO also pointed out that he wasn‚Äôt committing to Bitcoin as a passion project. He noted that his firm‚Äôs decision to buy the asset was merely due to its proven stability over the past few months, and he would liquidate his company‚Äôs holdings if he saw some other alternative assets with greater yields.

For now, however, Saylor is all-in on Bitcoin. The CEO further predicted that more companies would make similar moves, adding that private companies are currently in the right position.",1600926519,25,1

iyolkl,brianddk,Fun with Dynamic DNS services and bitcoind,"I realize that `bitcoind` has this capability built in, but thought it might be fun to configure it manually.  As some background, most people look at their network and they have some address like `192.168.1.105`.  That is a private network address.  Sites like `WhatIsMyIpAddress.com` will tell you what your ***EXTERNAL*** IP address is.  When your running a bitcoin node, people will connect to your external IP.

Problem is... your ISP may cycle that IP address every week or so.  `bitcoind` has a nice feature baked in called `discover` which will do the work of guessing your external IP as it changes.  But if you are doing anything where you need to expose your RPC API externally (\*danger\*) then it would be nice to have some FQDN to go after to do the IP translation.

Originally, I had always solved this by exposing my node as an onion node.  Since onion nodes traverse NATs and firewalls fairly effortlessly this was an easy option. 
 But previously I had played around with Dynamic DNS service.  I've used `noip.com` but there are likely dozens of services out there that will get the job done.

Once you have enabled a NoIP hostname, you can name it in your `bitcoin.conf` using the `externalip=coolbtcnode.ddns.net`.  Then, assuming you setup all the RPC auth and port forwarding, you could access your node via RPC at `coolbtcnode.ddns.net`

As I said... it's a redundancy, since `discover=1` does most of this for you, but still thought someone might enjoy the tip.

j0q8yf,BitcoinCanSaveUsAll,True Bitcoin Ownership Metrics,"True Bitcoin ownership goes by a simple name in our world. Well at least if you believe in the mantra of not your keys, not your coins.  It's simply referred to as the UTXO Set. The UTXO Set is the full list of the Transaction Outputs on the entire Bitcoin blockchain. These are basically how many addresses have bitcoin associated with them.  Anyone running their own node can see how many UTXOs exist at anytime by looking at the UTXO Set.

Here's the incredible part:  there's only 68 million UTXOs.  68 million!  That means there are only a maximum of 68 million people who control the keys their bitcoin in a world of 7.5 billion!  But of course we know the real amount is much lower than that when considering most exchanges have thousands if not millions of UTXOs, all the lost bitcoins, HD wallets etc. 

We absolutely must prioritize the removal of our coins from all exchanges as quickly as possible. These exchanges have been invested in heavily by the banks years ago and they have their tentacles in as deep as possible and have been manipulating the USD price of bitcoin for years. They do so using other methods that have controlled other hard asset prices for decades. These manipulation tactics combine rehypothification, commingling, cash settled futures, OTC markets, along with coordinating the denial of access to exchanges when they start to lose control of the process momentarily.

Look, the banks are the competition to bitcoin. They run the world by creation of dollars which we all currently (directly or in directly) depend on as it is the world reserve currency. Every day we sell our labor and skills for dollars that they directly control the production and value of them. Meanwhile we live in a world where they have brainwashed people to believe that inflation by devaluing the currencies we sell ourselves for is a good thing!  Thank God we now have a viable exit strategy with bitcoin!  However the only way for the majority to pry the power away from the legacy financial system is to decide that we want to determine what the value of our time is rather than let them make us work longer and harder every year for less purchasing power.  

And we can!  Well that is if we accept that supply and demand truly determines value, then we must hold our Bitcoin keys individually for it to be valued for what it truly is - the world's first truly finite asset with properties that are superior to all previous SOVs before it and one that can be carried around in your brain!

I see some of my peers have different policies like 0.5 sats base fee and 500mSat fee rate.

I got some decent amount of routing in the past, my node is running ~3 months so far and I got ~750 forwardings in total.

I want to increase the amount of routing my node does and I think opening balanced high capacity channels  to popular nodes was the first step and now I am wondering about the fee rates and if there is something than can be optimized.

My dad acknowledges the power of the tech and has some fascination with smart contract platforms like ETH.

But..He argues against buying BTC specifically. His theory is that BTC is fundamentally similar to gold from an economics stand point, yes, but there is nothing specifically special about BTC in the Crypto ecosystem other than the fact that it‚Äôs got the first mover advantage. Apparently, BTC is popular only because..it‚Äôs popular!

Gold is special in its use cases, as it plays a significant role in jewellery, manufacturing and areas that make it physically superior to other metals - But nothing actually makes BTC superior to other cryptocurrencies other than the large number of people that trust the network today. His view is that if BTC was replicated but with slightly better tech (for example, further decentralisation by making entry to mining easier/cheaper), the original BTC will lose in the long run. His view is that BTC is superior today but not tomorrow.

My dreams of confirming a low fee TXN won't come true this month.,"For a bit of fun, I created a [low fee TXN](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/itptgz/fun_with_low_fee_txns_on_mainnet/) (493 s/kB) to see if pool would confirm below 1000 s/kB.  Seems the answer is usually ""very very unlikely"".  My economic game theory went something like this... 

&gt; Given the option to mine no TXNs or to mine TXNs below 1000 s/kB, miners would always choose anything over nothing

The cost of including a TXN, is practical nothing in comparison to the cost of hashing a block.  The TXNs are just included in the root of the block header, so not really a heavy expense.  Perhaps I'm overthinking it.  Maybe most miners just use the default settings and don't waste a moments thought on anything beyond it.  Maybe there is an economic factor I'm missing.

Ultimately, Bitcoin protocol is the most secured and most high profile PoW network in the industry, thus if its possible to build extensions to Bitcoin protocol, and allow hodlers and bitcoiners to:

1. Stake and earn btc (which further democratize the space, where you no longer need specialized equipment and lots of $ to mine btc) 
2. Have smart contract capabilities ontop of Bitcoin protocol e.g. Clarity. (which allows for development of more comprehensive dapps to be based on Bitcoin protocol)
3. NFTs / Digitization of real world assets ontop of Bitcoin protocol

j2bc4d,Sobutie,Bitcoin and tax evasion?,"Hello reddit,

Before you rip me apart, please understand I am just beginning to learn bitcoin. I admit that the entire concept has really grasped me.

My question is one of legit curiosity. Not trying to stir up trouble or say bitcoin is good or bad.

But basically, if I have bit coin as currency.. what‚Äôs to force me to pay taxes? The government would never know how much money I have more how much I‚Äôm spending. Wouldn‚Äôt this make it really easy to avoid taxes?

I understand that if btc were an actual currency that was provided by w2 income then obviously it would be reported to the irs. So this question doesn‚Äôt really apply to the potential future of bitcoin.

What I am talking about the immediate future. Say somebody makes $100k on a bitcoin investment. Sure if they converted to fiat and suddenly made a $100k investment that would set off alarms, but what if they made small deposits as needed. Just a few grand here or there.

I am not promoting breaking the law. I am just curious how bitcoin people reconcile this. I have a very high w2 income and I pay my taxes. Not gonna lie though, when nearly half my income goes to Uncle Sam it hurts! And I imagine that if there were a simple and u traceable way to avoid that I‚Äôm sure a lot of people would struggle with that temptation.

Any thoughts are appreciated!",1601424196,44,1

‚Ä¢  
We could borrow the best aspects of all the political-economic theories, synthesize them, and codify them into an unbiased, unhackable, immutable protocol that would administer every type of policy that human beings rely on for survival within a global society (economic, budgetary, political, tax, social.. etc) through automation.

Unlike other political-economic systems (representative democracy, socialism, capitalism, communism.. etc), there would no vulnerabilities in the protocol that could be exploited, further ensuring the stability of the system and violence would be rendered obsolete.  
‚Ä¢  
‚Ä¢  
We could literally replace all systems of centralized power with a decentralized system that any citizen of the world could participate in and monitor from the palm of their hand, creating a perfect symbiosis between humanity and technology. We would no longer have to appeal to authority figures or institutions for the instructions on how to live our lives. In fact, we could liberate oursleves individually and, at the same time, encourage community by feeding, clothing, and housing the poor of the world.

Would it be a good idea to ask for a loan of let's say 40-50K EUR to buy \~5 BTC? Let's say I only need about 40K to get to buy it. I would pay around 500-600 EUR per month (I can use part of what I have taken on the loan and have not used), which I can assume more or less well since my salary is around 1500-1700 depending on the month.

The loan would be as long as possible (4-5 years) since the idea is to hold 1-2 years until the next big pump and take it off at once, and on the way have bought BTC at a good price.

1. Bitcoin is the one asset in human history where past performance IS an indication of future results.

2. When your local fiat inevitably fails, your friends and family will look to you to spare their lives, and with a little bit extra today you'll be able to save more of them.

3. It is ALWAYS a good time to buy Bitcoin, but that's especially true during a dip.

4. It's only gambling if you lose money, right?

5. Sure you could put it in an alt, but those are just scams to get more Bitcoin, and your timing would have to be perfect. It's safer to just go with a sure thing.

6. At this point Bitcoin has already succeeded and cannot fail.

7. Buying more today is a way to retain your buying power for tomorrow.

8. Even though some credit cards consider Bitcoin a cash withdrawal, you could max it out on gift cards from the grocery store, and sell those for more Bitcoin. Then it's not even your money!

9. Even if Bitcoin goes down in the near term, it's a guarantee it will go back up again.

10. Every time it goes up, you wish you had bought more when it was lower, so now is the time to make sure you don't EVER feel that way again.

11. The people who worry about putting all their eggs in one basket have never really looked into what a nice basket Bitcoin is.

12. Right now you can trade $1 for almost 10,000 sats. When Bitcoin hits $100,000 you will only be able to get 1,000 sats per dollar. 

13. It's not a get rich quick scheme, but you will get very rich very quickly from it.

14. If you get a little more right now, you can sell that portion when it peaks, and be able to hodl your main stash.

15. If you've already told yourself #14 before, it's still true, you'll just have a bigger hodl stash, which is obviously a good thing.

16. We are still very early on in Bitcoin's life and people will think you're a genius in the future for buying at this time.

17. The signs are all there that this thing is about to explode upwards, you just know how to read the signs because you're special.

18. You will get to say ""I told you so"" to SO many people.

19. Bitcoin is one of the safest places you can store value, but also one of the most lucrative.

[satotious.com](https://satotious.com) is a unique twist on paywall, users can access content by viewing ads or with micropayments(on the Bitcoin Lightning Network).

We think the time is right to try micropayments again as an increasing amount of content is going behind subscriptions and ad revenue is declining. Reasons we are different:

1. We have a free option with ad views.

2. We run on the Bitcoin Lightning Network as it makes micropayments feasible without the need to track users.

3. We tackle cognitive cost associated with micropayments with our browser extension/app which can auto-pay the paywalls.

For more details of our vision have a look at our site and blog posts, [satotious.com](https://satotious.com). Right now we're in beta and are looking for content creators, no matter how big or small, please get in touch: [ruby@satotious.com](mailto:ruby@satotious.com)

Okay, I can see that. But I still also see plenty of moonbois convinced that their $5 will turn into $5,000,000 if they put it into bitcoin and bury it in their yard for 5 years. That exact scenario was possible in the 2010s, but I‚Äôd be surprised to see it again.

im8t7t,graydoggames,Why you should stop looking at Bitcoin price,"We are in late 2018. TSLA just hit $75 (it recently split 5:1, so it was $300, but you get the idea), a new all-time high. Helping the shareholders is Elon Musk making a now famous tweet that he's ""taking the company private at $420"" and that he has ""secured financing.""

At the time, many people were shorting the stock, i.e., betting the stock was going to do down.

Almost immediately after, the stock crashes, eventually dipping below $35. A 50% decline. 

Then, all of a sudden, TSLA jumps to $180 per share. Never seen before.

Again, many people line up and begin shorting it. Coronachan helping, it falls below $85. Many people say that TSLA is dying, dead or a mix of the two. Many say that the ""bubble has popped."" 

TESLA hit $500 two days ago. Even if you had bought it at the WORST POSSIBLE TIME in the last year - that is, a full $180 per share - you would have hit a near 200% return. 

And this is what bitcoin is, really. When you realize it only take a couple dozen people to influence, or rather manipulate the price, day to day action becomes irrelevant. You'd be shocked at how easy it is to crash the stock price of Tesla, or bitcoin. It takes just a small coordinated effort and it's even easier on Bitcoin, which is unregulated.

But look at the big picture. TSLA recovered quickly to $500. And so will bitcoin.

The current bitcoin price is only relevant in two scenarios:

1) If you plan to buy more

2) If you badly, badly need money, but truth be told, you should have liquidity, i.e. bitcoins should be long term.

Other than that, what 2-3 manipulators decide bitcoin is worth today is utterly irrelevant to me. In 5 years, there will barely be any new bitcoins being made, and more and more people buy bitcoins for the long term every day. Bitcoin is not like gold, you cannot mine a near limitless amount of it (more gold was being extracted in 2019 than ever before). Bitcoin is bitcoin. 21M.

So stop caring about the price unless you are in one of the two scenarios above. Bitcoins price in the next 2-3-4-5 years is utterly irrelevant to you or me.

im82s9,cryptoanalyticatech,"Bitcoin Plunged Violently Losing 7% And Liquidated $100M Longs, Here Is Why","Bitcoin¬†has been rising for most of this year. However, it experienced a sharp fall on September 3 losing up to 7% of its value to sink towards $10,500. The losses happened in less than two hours liquidating more than 100 million worth of longs in the process. Taking a look at¬†BitMEX¬†alone, the sudden crash wiped out almost $99 million worth of longs.

Three major factors might have likely caused a sudden drop in the price of the flagship crypto. The strength of the U.S. dollar, miner outflows, and major resistance are to blame for the sharp correction below $11K.

Miner Outflows

According to reports that emerged earlier today, large-scale mining pools are sending higher-than-normal amounts of Bitcoin to exchanges in recent days.

This data indicated that miners were now preparing to sell their holdings which added selling pressure to the crypto markets. The CEO of CryptoQuant, Ki Young-Ju,¬†wrote:

‚ÄúMiners send a certain amount of BTC to exchanges periodically, so they already have a large amount of BTC in the exchange. Whenever they decided to sell, it seems they move a relatively significant amount of BTCs to other wallets, and some of them are going to exchanges.‚Äù

Miners represent one of the two sources of external selling pressure in the bitcoin market other than exchanges. When miners start to sell their holdings, it could cause considerable pressure on bitcoin.

US Dollar Rally

In the past three days, the US dollar has rallied against all other reserve currencies. The dollar showed some strong momentum against the euro. Based on previous reports, the¬†European Central Bank¬†(ECB) warned that the euro has become quite expensive. The ECB‚Äôs warnings rattled the markets resulting in a euro sell-off as most investors feared the imposition of various restrictions.

As the US dollar started to rally from a multi-year support area, both gold and bitcoin declined steeply.

Bitcoin Was At Strong Resistance

The $12,000 to $12,500 range has acted as a strong area of resistance for bitcoin since 2018. Bitcoin‚Äôs price tested the $12,000 resistance level for the fourth time in a relatively short period. That might have led to a reaction from sellers which contributed to the pullback of bitcoin.\

But the price of bitcoin dropped to as low as $10,625 across major exchanges. ¬†A well-known pseudonymous trader, Salsa Tekila, said it is a strong support level at a higher time frame. Thus, a bounce is likely to happen in the near term.",1599188415,16,1

im723n,atrueretard,"Business plan idea: 1 full Bitcoin loan, make monthly payments towards one full BTC","Bitcoin is expensive, like a car right now. The price keeps going up. Many people want to own a full Bitcoin, but most people can't afford $10k on a bitcoin. I know you can buy fractions, but if you buy fractions slow enough you may never get a full bitcoin because the price keeps going higher.

&amp;#x200B;

example bitcoin cost $10,000

&amp;#x200B;

So this would work like a car loan. You put 20% or $2,000

you recieve 1 full Bitcoin, but you don't get the keys until you finish paying off the loan

Monthly payments at 5% APR interest for 5 years.  =  $189/month for 60 months.

Total cost of 1 Bitcoin = $13,323

&amp;#x200B;

If Bitcoin goes down below your equity value on the loan, you wont get liquidated unless you're late on payments. If Bitcoin goes up and you miss a payment, you wont get liquidated until you fall below equity value, so you can miss some payments if bitcoin goes up.

in30n1,BuyBTC88,When a friend asks about bitcoin ..,So I‚Äôve been having a lot of friends start to text me asking if it‚Äôs a good time to invest in bitcoin. I want them to understand it before just throwing money in. What‚Äôs the single best video or article you would send them? Links appreciated.,1599319714,9,1
in30m8,BitcoinCanSaveUsAll,Don't Let Them Fool You,"The Legacy financial institutions would love to have you believe that Bitcoin is correlated to the overall performance of the stock market. But when pondering that possibility even for a moment you can see that their arguments fail to add up in any logical context.  The reason is pretty simple really. It's because when you understand the fact that Bitcoin was created was as an alternative to the existing financial institution, and that vast majority of folks who are buying Bitcoin are ideologically aligned with preserving their own Financial autonomy and voting against the existing corrupt system. With that said and when considering that supply and demand determines value coupled with the fact that this is the world's truly first finite asset, you can see that this is just a elaborate ruze.  Especially when you see that the vast majority of bitcoin haven't moved on the blockchain. 


In the short to medium-term I expect the banks will continue to try and manipulate the USD price of BTC to perpetuate The Narrative that bitcoin is correlated to the stock market performance. They will do so via a process they have done for the last few years involving  their over-the-counter exchanges, cash settled Futures, and  their control of the Bitcoin exchanges involving rehypothification and commingling. They do this out of their desperation to perpetuate their relavency but in the end I'm betting that they can't beat math. 


As for myself I will be continuing to dollar cost average buy and buy aggressively on the dips while HODLing my own KEYS. Not because of the potential short-term dollar appreciation, but because of my vote in the system of true Freedom away from the corrupt Fiat system that we are all subjects to. I do so because I believe that more and more people will decide to vote for bitcoin and join the Dollar Cost Averaging HODL freedom fighters and that together we can and will change the world for the better for all (except the banksters).",1599319711,46,1
in2to2,redditor157b,Fiat onramp/exchange/buying privacy (US),"The old local bitcoins was private. Atms in other countries are private. I see alot of folks point to bisq, a truly p2p exchange. But the fiat options are mostly reliant on conventional banking. Today it seems buying on bisq is not and cannot be private in practice. There is a face to face option but not many offers there. 
  
https://docs.bisq.network/payment-methods  
  
Buying gold locally or marijuana in a state where it's legal is more private. Btc seems more comparable to purchasing firearms than anything else. 
  
Complaints aside, what is the most private payment method on bisq, if any?

Situation:

I am a professional poker player and ventured deep into the abyss of shady/dodgy sites. Why I did so is still a mystery to me. Long story short, I finally made two withdrawals totaling approximately $3,500 to $4,000 via BTC. Next day, I load up my Ledger and see I have my balance. Awesome!  


Oh wait...it's not spendable.  
Surely it just hasn't confirmed yet, right? No big deal.  


Then I look at the transactions...  
[https://blockstream.info/tx/35c1ff29f22c251b67829ce6046a7441aa81dd67d1b6b3fffb3c518fa7a19b2b](https://blockstream.info/tx/35c1ff29f22c251b67829ce6046a7441aa81dd67d1b6b3fffb3c518fa7a19b2b)

Previous withdrawals were sent to me with a more normalized fee structure.  
These were sent with what looks like a near-zero fee.  


With my limited technical understanding of BTC, this means the transaction will either get stuck for a VERY long time, or it will never confirm and eventually be returned to him.  
This person has blocked me on socials and has said on the discord server for the site that ""the site is better off without him""

I didn't do that because I doubt BTC at all, more for educational experience. I bought my first node (lightning!) and am so excited for it to arrive. My transactions with BTC cost me fractions of a penny, and it is instant. All the previous haters that claimed the BTC fees were too high, my have the tables turned.

ikok0r,multiventure,The Euro-zone is seeing 0.2% deflation --&gt; &amp; why this gives Europeans an incentive to buy Bitcoin,"[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10545459/2-01092020-AP-EN.pdf/7c0db6bb-3974-ce20-a7f0-6281743d0d7c](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10545459/2-01092020-AP-EN.pdf/7c0db6bb-3974-ce20-a7f0-6281743d0d7c)

We often say the inflation of the US dollar will push more $USD into Bitcoin, i.e., BTC as a hedge against inflation. But the opposite is also true: when fiat currencies deflate (the buying power increases) it is because fiat savings are no longer paying enough interests. In times of deflation, people are taking their money to the stock market, and to Bitcoin.

Deflation means prices are dropping. And deflation means people will want to wait to buy new goods and services hoping that prices will continue to drop further.

So in Europe, the central banks are already speaking of the ""Deflation Ghost"", which may kill the economy (grind it to a halt). Have a look at our stock markets and see how that world is completely disconnected from reality. Our monetary-financial system is running on its last reserves. Negative interests for saving accounts have already been introduced for the wealth with savings over $250,000. But negative interests will be introduced for Joe Schmoe and Suzy Homemaker soon as well. Namely, to push people to spend more (to counter the deflation.)

Worlwide, debts are increasing and Central Banks, including the American FEDeral Reserve are afraid to ""normalize"" things since the last time they tried, stock markets collapsed. As a consequence: Central Banks are afraid to normalize and stocks are soaring to the moon, because everyone who still has money in the bank is FOMOing. Stocks aren't soaring because those companies are worth so much but because money isn't generating interests in the savings account anymore. It no longer pays to keep money in the bank.

Stocks are turning into a giant mega bubble (it already is) and sooner or later it is going to burst. Then, **money won't flow back into money but into scarce stuff like bullion and bitcoin, whereas the value of FIAT is going to zero.**

iko5ix,2016__Throwaway,Fee question,"Hi all.

To send about $300 worth of Btc from [localbitcoins.com](https://localbitcoins.com) to my Bitpay wallet I paid 0.43. When I then send it from that wallet to another wallet (non bitpay, just my brothers desktop wallet), Bitpay defaults to a fee exponentially higher between 7%-11%? I send him the same amount every 6 weeks or so and the suggested ""normal"" Bitpay fee is always astronomical. I suppose I can send to him direct from LBC in the future but am curious why the suggested normal fee is so high when sending from a bitpay wallet. It obviously defeats the entire advantage of using Btc when I pay that fee. Last time I changed the fee to 5% and it took 7 hours for the first confirmation and I was warned when sending it that it was way too low.

ikgkl4,KamiFeah,Paranoia or not?,"A bit long, but not tooo bad!
The other day I went to get my car washed. Left it with the cleaners and went to go grab a coffee since the guy said it would take atleast an hour.

So there I am, happily sitting in the air conditioned cafe, sipping on my ice americano wondering if I should have atleast tidied my car a little before I gave it to the shop...
Nah, I thought...

Then it dawned on me, I've always kept one of my Nano recovery papers in the glove compartment of my car!
As I continue to drink, I quickly ponder what to do...would he check there? Would he know what it is...would he know what to do with it? Nah, I thought...it would be safe...right?

I quickly finished my coffee and ran to him and noticed he had just finished cleaning the outside of the car. He hadn't touched the inside, all the trash was still there. I pulled out the paper and quickly out it in my pocket and sat in the room next door.

Phew! I thought! He didn't touch it...or did he? He could have easily taken a picture of it...nah, that would be ridiculous!

I spent the rest of the day thinking if I should let it be or do something about it.
So, the same day, I went home sent my coins to an exchange I've dealt with before and trust, Binance. Oh, would you look at that, it's asking me for my 2fa which I deleted long ago since I stopped trading. Fair enough, reset that and set up a new one, no problem!

So, I reset my ledger, got a new recovery seed, bought some nice cards to write them down on. Put each one in an envelope and wax sealed them so I know if they have been tampered with!

Try to send my coins from Binance back to my ledger and it says because I had removed and put back on my 2fa, I need to wait 48 hours!

Well, less than 24 hours to go...but I can't feel safe until they are back on my ledger!

ika0s9,BitcoinCanSaveUsAll,Want to ‚Çø part of the revolution? Let‚Äôs start today by Tipping Satoshi!,"Hello fellow Bitcoiners! It would seem that since the implementation of cash settled futures (right at the ATH) coupled with the banks being large investors in most, if not all, of the major bitcoin exchanges that they have been in control of the USD price of bitcoin for the past few years. Their ability to rehypothecate and commingle bitcoin seems to have no end (see Catlin Long‚Äôs Forbes articles about financialization) since no matter how often or how well it‚Äôs repeated, even so eloquently put by the great Andreas, ‚ÄúNot your keys, not your coins‚Äù there will always be a percentage of so called bitcoin ‚Äúowners‚Äù that leave their Satoshi‚Äôs on these exchanges. Sadly this seems to allow them to continue their fiat OTC market / public spot price exchange games.

And while I certainly believe that their control of the price is temporary and that the math will eventually determine its true value, I believe that there are a few things that we can do in order to push this forward in breaking the price free from the fiat currency master manipulators:

1) Don‚Äôt trust your wallets and ‚ÄúRoll Your Own‚Äù P2PKH addresses using dice. I say P2PKH as you can simply sign a bitcoin message with one of these addresses with a standardized signing message in your wallet and then verify that you are in fact of the private keys to these address by signing a bitcoin message and validating the signature via your own bitcoin node.

2) Tip Satoshi! That‚Äôs right, tip Satoshi! Wait, how can we do that? Well, one would assume that the very first receiving address (the address receiving the first coinbase transaction ( 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa ) would have had to of been Satoshi‚Äôs then we can simply send Satoshi some satoshi‚Äôs! By doing so you would be doing one of the following 

a. burning that bitcoin thus reducing the supply, or

b. You would actually be tipping the creator(s) of bitcoin!

After looking into this address, it would appear that the idea of sending Satoshi satoshis is not a new idea as there are tons of transactions that have been sent to him since the genesis block. In fact as I type this there is not only my transaction but another one pending in the mempool.",1598919685,4,1

I try to scrape up at least $300-$500 or so before I buy but I have managed to make one-time purchases of up to $1,500 or so a couple of times this year. Luckily I made one of those at about the $6900 mark so I feel good about that.

Just wondering if anyone else frets over this kind of Bitcoin price velocity and despairs of ever having even one (or one more) ""whole coin"" -- Not that whole coins matter, even, but sometimes I get panicky and think maybe I should liquidate everything I can get my hands on to get 1 more coin.

There are only going to be 21 million bitcoin, thousands of which are already lost. Let us assume bitcoin is a world currency in the future, almost everyone has some bitcoin. The average number of sats for 7 billion people is 300k. Considering there are going to be more people one century from now and even more bitcoin lost this number is sure to be lower. Lets say 200k, just to give us a number. So more and more bitcoin are lost as time goes on, sats here and there. For how long can you say bitcoin is almost infinately dividable? Clearly that is no longer the case for everyday consumables when even just one sat is very precious. Buying a bottle of coke for one sat might be like paying 10k dollars for a bottle of coke today.

il2gjf,tcbw1,2 weeks ago Apple hit $2tn. They've added another $300bn to their market cap. Surely it's time for Bitcoin to shine?,"I can't be the only one getting a little frustrated? The ~~S&amp;P500~~ S&amp;P5 (FAANG) have seen ridiculous gains in the past few months. It's fair to say BTC has also enjoyed a nice little run up too, but nothing near that of the FAANG stocks.

I do truly believe that Bitcoin will have a meteoric rise soon, but if not now, when? To me, it seems like all of the conditions are ripe, a bubbling S&amp;P5, brrrr'ing like we've never seen brrr'ing before, failing currencies (Venezuela, Argentina, Lebanon), and geopolitical issues that should make people see the utility and worth of a decentralised digital asset such as Bitcoin. Lightning is continuing to make waves too.

To me, it's not just about making a quick buck out of bitcoin, it's about establishing a decentralised, unconfiscatable, borderless asset.  When we have a single corporation (Apple) that currently has a market cap that is 10x of Bitcoin's, it's a shock to the system. When we have a single guy like Jeff Besoz who's networth of $204bn could theoretically buy 93.5% of all bitcoins, it just doesn't sit right with me. I believe that Bitcoin will succeed, but it needs a much higher market cap to get there.

[Binance lists WBTC amid the ongoing DeFi craze](https://preview.redd.it/gjmxvgu11rl51.png?width=525&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52a160636e03d94809d5b9eeaa4bca4cc807f046)

 Along with the DeFi rally, demand for Wrapped Bitcoin is increasing. 

[Binance](https://cryptobusinessworld.com/Article/4241/crypto-business-world-binance-card-to-soon-expand-to-the-u-s-as-swipe-taps-new-partnership) is the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of market capitalization. It is listing another token to support the growth of decentralized finance or DeFi. 

[Recently, it had launched the token ONT-33D](https://cryptobusinessworld.com/Article/4162/crypto-business-world-binance-issues-ont-33-d-token-for-decentralized-exchange-trading) for decentralized trading.¬†Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is a new ERC-20 token. It is pegged to the price of Bitcoin (BTC). It is now tradeable on Binance. Binance users can now start deposit WBTC as well as trade the token against Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin.¬†

Wrapped Bitcoin is an Ethereum-based token. It was introduced in 2019. It represents Bitcoin. One WBTC is equal to one BTC. WBTC is a joint initiative. It was launched by major DeFi players. These include Ren, BitGo, Kyber Network, Dharma, MakerDAO, Compound, and the Set Protocol. The token aims to bring more liquidity into the Ethereum network. It also aims to implement it in the DeFi industry.¬†It is a part of WBTC‚Äôs functionality in DeFi. The token allows Bitcoin holders to keep holding BTC while also using DeFi apps to borrow or lend money.  
 

DeFi, or Decentralized finance, envisions a brand-new monetary system. The system is built on top public blockchains. DeFi platforms connect borrowers and lenders. This directly eliminates credit checks. These enable digital assets to be collateralized. DeFi provides decentralized lending as its key benefit.¬†In 2020, the DeFi industry has been growing exponentially. The total value locked in the market has hit $9 billion on Aug. 30. Uniswap is the most widely-used decentralized exchange on Ethereum. It has surpassed significant crypto exchange Coinbase in daily volume on Aug 30. DeFi continues to see a meteoric rise. The demand for WBTC is also up, hitting $274 million in circulation by mid-August.

This year, Binance has been embracing the DeFi market. In August 2020, Binance launched DeFi staking. This was in partnership with major industry players like Kava Labs and Compound Finance. In April, Binance issued a new DeFi token. It was backed by the crypto asset, Ontology (ONT).",1599494618,2,1

History has shown in any major economic crisis, there are 5 stages that will happen leading to the apocalypse (Hyperinflation).   


Stage 1 -  Steady inflation  
Stage 2 - Deep Deflation  
Stage 3 -  Higher Inflation  
Stage 4 - Deeper Deflation   
Stage 5 - Hyperinflation   


So we have completed stage 1&amp;2 this year and we are currently at stage 3, and slowly moving to stage 4  


So, my prediction is we could to stage 4 (deeper deflation) if the government didn't release the second stimulus package which is against the Federal reserve target of 2% inflation.  But, from what I'm reading on the news the second stimulus package might be released end of september if agreed by the government which will drive Bitcoin price up and cause us to be in stage 3 for a little bit longer until end of this year.

  
Start the year 2021, we might face the inevitable stage 4 (the deeper deflation), BTC price will drop hard worse than this week because the  real economy isn't going back to normal, no jobs, no food and no shelter. People will start to liquidate BTC assets to support their daily life needs and they will cut their spending because free money from government has stopped  


And by 2021, The deflation had become so bad the government had to make the old money printer once again go brrrrrrrrr to stop the economy from collapsing. And that my fellow Hodlers, will be the start of the Stage 5 (Hyperinflation). 

When hyperinflation happen, the one who hold real money Gold, silver and Bitcoin and hard producing assets will be safe. The one who don't will be wiped out.

I don't have a ton of money invested yet because I'm just starting out and trying to learn the ropes a bit. I made 3 trades so far. The first trade I attempted was with $100, the second was with $230, and the third was $500. I used 2x, 3x, and 5x leverage respectively because I know the funds I'm starting with are rather low, and I was fine with the monetary risk involved when dealing with these lower numbers. It seems like bybit charged me $8, $16, and $32 for the trades respectively. These trades would have been somewhat profitable, but not nearly enough to offset the fees. After the first two, I tried looking into why the fees were so high, and noticed I was doing market trades instead of limit trades which have different fee models. So I switched to limit trades, enabled the post only feature to ensure my limit order was a maker, which should mean I earn a 0.025% rebate according to bybit... Yet doing all this, my final trade cost me $32 in fees. At one point I nearly took the profits at +$20, but it still wasn't worth it at a -$10 loss... Im clearly missing something.

BTC/USD hourly chart

&amp;#x200B;

The Bitcoin price had a volatile week, which started off with reaching $12,000 and then quickly dived to $10,000 within 2 days, as the stock market experienced a big drop in the beginning of September. The BTC price settled at around $10,250 the moment.

As seen in the hourly chart, a sideway channel has formed and there is some support at $10,000, possibly due to profit taking by the short sellers. If the BTC price becomes volatile again and drops below $10,000, it would indicate a bearish market and could test the next support level, which is at $9,000.

io2f4f,SparkToken,It's too easy to get scammed and lose all your money.....," I was working on a project, involving a smart contract on the Tezos Blockchain, and I was looking for help with coding. I reached out to the Tezos community on Facebook and some guy offered to help pretty quickly. He was pretty friendly, some Brazilian guy, offered to skype and help me through it, but I thought it was weird how far he was willing to help.

I was having issues uploading a smart contract, one of the reasons was because of the key I was using in order to pay for the origination of the contract. The guy helping me offered to let me use the private key he had that he suggested was ""for everyone to use"" and that he thought it was great that there were people like me doing what I was doing. At that point, I realized the guy was just trying to get me to upload money into his key, and as soon as I did he'd withdraw everything. It didn't help that the guy lived in South America and didn't have much of an identity on Facebook, no profile picture, I doubt his name was really what it said it was.

I thanked him for the help, though it did not get me far, and learned to play my cards closer to my chest. Asking for help you will get the sharks to come out. This guy figured me for a rookie, which I'm sure there are a lot trying to learn about blockchains, and he could get me to either reveal my private key or get me to use his key.

I have been purchasing crypto on blockchain wallet for a couple months now with my debit card, without any issue. I have been able to immediately access my funds.

About 5 days ago, I purchased some crypto, funds were taken from my bank and have now been completely authorized. I‚Äôve tried to withdraw my crypto and it‚Äôs locked in my trading wallet

I have been reading on Twitter from some users that blockchain has now implemented a 7 day hold period. However, I‚Äôve never had this issue.

I‚Äôve also tried contacting blockchain support for days and no one ever responds. I have tried email, social media and the live chat option, all to no avail.

I am very concerned about my funds. Can someone give me some insight on to what‚Äôs going on?

Thanks!",1599444209,5,1

inutri,littletree1234,Stop measuring your wallet size in USD and start measuring in terms of REAL ASSETS,"I've been considering the recent posts regarding Schiff's definition of real money, the Fed and the Founding Father's definition.  Bitcoin, gold and silver meet the standard, while the USD barely scrapes by.  

What does the USD have that Bitcoin doesn't?  We denominate the real economy in USD.

The USD is backed by the biggest economy in the world.  Goods, services, assets, commodities, real estate, precious metals and even crypto are all denominated in USD.

Stop measuring your wallet size in USD - start measuring it in Wheat futures, oil Futures, Gold and Silver.   

Therefore, what we ultimately need is a new 'COMEX', a new 'NYSE' - one that is denominated in Bitcoin. 

Essentially we can put this into practice ourselves by denoting our crypto profits in REAL ASSETS - when crypto goes up against any of those REAL ASSETS (NOT USD), take profit and buy gold, silver or commodity futures.  Whenever Bitcoin is weak against real assets, sell your futures and buy crypto. 

A practical way to do this is to use  [https://www.dailyfx.com/bitcoin](https://www.dailyfx.com/bitcoin) charts - eg type XAGUSD/BTCUSD into the symbol field to see the current ratio of Silver/Bitcoin.   This article talks about how to trade ratios and ratio trends:  [https://www.dailyfx.com/gold-price/trading-the-gold-silver-ratio.html](https://www.dailyfx.com/gold-price/trading-the-gold-silver-ratio.html) 

In addition I strongly recommend accumulating *physical bullion -* we don't know what will happen to our futures when the economy collapses - but if all the crypto holders have real bullion, we will have the means to rebuild a real economy to back our digital assets. 

I've been stacking both crypto and silver since the start of the year, and patting myself on the back for it.  Now I'm learning to trade Bitcoin off real assets to accumulate both.   Ultimately I'd like to see someone start an exchange denominated in Bitcoin - but it is already possible to do something like that via a CFD exchange - just take your signals from dailyfx.com",1599429223,19,1

iowsqt,EmptyExperience0,[Serious] Need help to recover potentially thousands of bitcoin,"Hi all,

I won't give too many details for obvious reasons. I have in my possession an encrypted hard drive from a relative which has been untouched since 2013. This person invited me to buy some bitcoin in 2011, invested at least 1000‚Ç¨ in bitcoin (possiblity more) and was setting up a business related to bitcoin back in 2013. He then passed away and we now have his hard drives but they're all encrypted. He was very security savvy (his passwords were in his head with a minimum of 25 characters sometimes) so brute forcing is not an option. We asked some very knowledgeable people who said we should give up for the time being because current CPU power would not be able to crack anything in the next coming years (we even talked to companies which only purpose is to have high end CPUs). There is nothing written from his belongings that would point in the direction of a password, but he had a purple usb key which was also a fingerprint reader so I'm guessing he used it for 2FA.

Knowing him very well, he was extremely obsessed with security (he had a dedicated router working as a firewall on top of his router modem at home), so I would expect the worse in this case. The hard drive was an internal hybrid disc from a Sony Vaio.

Did anyone else go through a similar situation? Any creative ideas? Or are we SOL? I was just listening to the reply all podcast and they were talking about a bitcoin hunter so I just thought of asking here for ideas. Thanks",1599582574,42,1

You link your exchange and then either set your rules that you make your self or use one of their many templates. I know I sound like a shill but after doing my own do diligence to find what I was looking for in an easy to use, programmable trading bot coinrule was perfect. I'm not going to include the links because it pretty easy to find on your own. I just hope that if trading is something you're interested in that you will check it out.

iomd0p,jacobmetz_,Need to buy bitcoin,Hello I need to buy a small amount of bitcoin ($60) worth and send it to an address and I was wondering what the simplest way to do that is. I tried xcoin but it takes fucking forever because they ask you to send a picture of your face with your id and write down xcoin and the date on a piece of paper. And I did that and even included my student I.D. for university for added proof but every time I try to verify they need a utility bill for proof but I don't pay bills. They never get back to my help requests so I need another platform that will let me pay with a credit card and just send the bitcoin without dealing with a 3rd party wallet and all of that.

If bitcoin grows around 1 terabyte each decade (i know, this is not yet the case), that is completely fine. But the fullnodes store the whole history and validate against the whole past, right? Also wallets, that ""restore from a private key"" (you setup a new wallet with an old private key, so it has to check the full bitcoin history for your funds).

**Won't those be extremely slow mechanisms in the future? What is bearable now, will it be super cpu-intensive in several years?** The mempool takes unconfirmed transactions, but in the end, it only ""accepts"" them, if they are valid. So the node has to validate all of them right? The longer the chain, the longer that takes, right? (not sure if a node really validates all of them, or if he just validates the block that a miner delivers. I read conflicting information on this topic or misinterpreted one.)

iqdh37,tws16164832569852,I want to buy Bitcoin. But I give up.,"So story here is for some time I've read and informed myself about crypto in general, specifically Bitcoin. I'm not either a person that has believed this is made of smoke and mirrors and worthless neither I defend it's the best invention after sliced bred.

It obviously can't be worthless **as long as** people want it or trust it. On the other hand it's quite complex for the first time holder, user or buyer so it's not quite the best thing just there. Filled with jargon like cold, hot or lukewarm wallets, private and public keys, decentralized, forks, strange names go on and on, and on...

So in this comes another issue, getting it. In the past it was easy way too easy. Today it's to the extreme opposite. So I managed to understand wallets enough and buying and exchanges, and fees and P2P, yada yada. 

Still I can't buy any. Either it's because of banks (maybe) freezing your account, credit cards rejecting the payment, or jumping thorough the hoops of **somewhat** understandable KYC processes.

I understand a legal tax paying business has to abide the law and even best practices. But people still are entitled to protect their personal information. Where is a selfie a legal requirement to identify a customer? Where is a photo of my ID or address a means to combat terrorism? People have got this wrong, if I make a bank transfer, there's an identifiable trail right there. Worst thing is all this ""safe, trustworthy and transparent"" customer identification is not even made by the business itself but by external companies that most times one doesn't even know who they are even if you ask.

If the issue is crime fighting, don't allow shady quasi antonymous payment methods. The main goal is to prevent people to trade good ol' funny money for another newer form of digital funny money. The secondary goal is public safety.

Anyway, due to my unease to provide any personal documents to who knows who to be uploaded to a server who knows in what dubious conditions. All it needs is to be hacked, stolen, sold or shared, because it is shared unless these exchanges have a proprietary verification system. Once it's there it's like Kim Kardashians porn video, it wont go away or disappear regardless of whatever GDPRs or other privacy laws exist. I just want my privacy, or some of it, i don't need to be completely anonymous.

So I turned to P2P in hopes of more private deals. No joy on that. Not even I would have to pay considerably more than on any of these law abiding exchanges, all of these bright minded sellers still ask for my ID and selfies and what not. Are you for real? Wont you want a fingerprint and an eye retina scan too? DNA? I understand they have a risk, but that risk is part of their business, stay one step ahead, don't use high risk transaction methods. I doubt 5% of the deals made in P2P sites are by businesses that actually need to follow Anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws. 

""Oh you're a first time buyer we have to verify you"", well look at it from the perspective of a crypto noob. I have to trust whoever is on the other side too. Now I understand that the bigger risk is for the seller, but what if you're talking to some crypto luddite no way he's gonna send with peace of mind real hard earned cash to an unknown. By the way millions are transacted on the ebays and Amazons of this world.

Well good luck in reaching 100k or 500k or living to see bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency get globally adopted by the masses if no one (new) can buy or use it.

I give up.",1599775606,41,1

Recently played with setting up an onion node and found for the first day or so it was difficult to get incoming connections via tor.  If anyone wants to increase their incoming connection count, just DM me your network and node info and I'll `addnode` you.  If you don't care about association, you can just reply with your node info on thread.

```

iq04cl,totopsgr,Bitcoin (re) denomination - Discussion,"Hi comrades, I have been looking at the top 10 coin movement and noticed a shit coin named polkadot. Anyhow the post is not about the shit coin and what it offers but an action from the developers to re-denominated the token to x100. So any hodlers having 1 token before the change ended up having 100 after the change. This increased the supply of the token 100 times without changing the overall value of the coins that the people were already holding. It did though change the value of one token from 400$ to 4$ overnight (I actually not sure what the value was whe the change happened but you get my point). This resulted in increased interest and massive influx, although nothing really changed except the perceived value of one token. 

I know the way the value of 1bitcoin is presented has been beaten to a pulp for years now and I know we could just switch from tracking the value of bitcoins to milibits (0.001 BTC) and we would actually have the perceived price of buying be reduced but practically that is not very effective or attractive to people who are used in buying shares. 

Think of the following:
 
1)There are 21,000,000 BTC. I can buy 1 BTC for 10k$. Noob thoughts: ""It is too expensive.. I missed the boat"". The noob does not know about milibits or satoshis. Even if he understands the denominations, he will still thing 1 BTC is too expensive. Because it does not feel right to buy a small part of something. People like completness. You see the pride when newcomers achieve ownership of 1BTC. Having 0.999BTC feels incomplete although practically not different much. Nobody will ever own 0.999BTC and think: ""I don't feel like buying more. I have put enough into this"" 

2)There are 21,000,000 BTC. I can buy 1mBTC for 10$. Noob thoughts: ""What the hell is a mBTC? I want a BTC. It is too expensive"". People tend to think Tokens as shares. They don't want to buy one thousandth of a share in amazon. Even if they could they want to buy a whole one, if they can't they may buy a whole one of something else. Additional problems: How much fees do I have to pay to buy 1mBTC. The same fees that I have to pay to buy 1BTC. That kind of sucks. You are paying for 1mbtc and you will receive 0.9mBTC or even less. 

3)There are 21,000,000,000 BTC. I can buy 1BTC for 10$. Noob thoughts: Awesome, that shit used to be 10k$! Also the fees are divided by 1000 so in order to buy 1BTC I will pay 0,0001 BTC, which I suppose sucks for the miners.  Obviously The block reward will be x1000 to keep the mining reward the same but the fees will be reduced to one thousanth. Market cap of BTC goes to the moon. Price of 1BTC climbs to 100$ and people still think it is dirt cheap. People who had previously 1BTC valued 10k$ end up having 1000BTC valued 100k$. Also BTC can be used for smaller transactions immediately 

Now I am not any kind of developer to be able to judge if scenario 3 is impossible to implement or not. Also I am not sure how this going to affect participation in securing the network (miners) due to the reduced fees, but it does seem to me away to boost attractiveness and therefore adoption.

The final outcome of profits over people seems almost inevitable in the tech industry, and this is exactly the problem Status is trying to address.

This simple idea ties into several of our [**core principles**](https://status.im/about/). First and foremost, transparency and openness. All of our source code is public, and our development process is very accessible and transparent. Every other week, there is a Town Hall discussion covering all important changes at Status such as hiring, core development plans, infrastructure and more. Our research, planning and brainstorming is all accessible on our [**Discuss forum**](https://our.status.im/stop-trusting-companies-start-trusting-code/Discuss%20forum), in which users are encouraged to participate. Anyone is free to follow along, and contribute, within the inner workings of our development process. There are no hidden updates, no secret trackers, and no unwanted data collection.

ipt9sk,kozm0z,Bitcoin Inheritance,"I'm not gonna lie I probably could've done some homework but maybe some of you guys can source me some good reads or provide some insight. 

Anyway, my uncle died several months ago and he had invested in bitcoins. His brother was able to gain access to his wallet and he plans to divide it equally amongst the other brothers and sisters. My Dad told my sister and I he would share some of the currency with us and we could either cash it out or take the coins. I'm curious how all this works though, can bitcoin (or even the money) be taxed on either a state or federal level? Or what happens on my end if I take the coins into my wallet and cash it out afterward?

Both A and B point to each other through a `connect` or `addnode` config setting.  My thought would be that now the ""blank"" bitcoin node (BitcoinB) would download and prune all the block data from BitcoinA via localhost.

I can imagine that I'd need separate data, block and chainstate dirs.  I'll need separate rpc-cookies and separate ports.

Of course a 51% attack on bitcoin is very unlikely considering the sheer amount of hashing, but I'm talking about cost efficiency. If an attacker had $X and wanted to do the most damage, would they attempt a 51% attack with $X worth of electricity/equipment or transaction flooding with $X worth of transaction fees?",1600103222,5,1

The bitcoin token is the best money to buy this hashrate through transaction fees so that you can write what you want in the Bitcoin ledger that is the most legit document the humanity ever created thanks to proof of work (just by reading the blockchain content, you know it is legit document). The price of Bitcoin and the transaction fee market reflect how much people need a legit and unforgeable ledger to settle their contracts.

But there are several obstacles that hinder the recognition of the BTC.

The Internet requires its own currency, and Bitcoin is the best contender for this place, said the head of Twitter and Square Jack Dorsey in an interview for Reuters. According to him, the cryptocurrency and the Worldwide Web have a common feature ‚Äî these tools are developed by the community and built according to common interests.  


‚ÄúThe Internet requires its own currency, and bitcoin is the best option at the moment. I don‚Äôt see how this can change, given all the people who have the same goal and are working to unlock the potential of the cryptocurrency,‚Äù Dorsey said.  


He added that there are several obstacles to recognizing the cryptocurrency. First, it is necessary to solve the bitcoin network problems regarding the speed of transactions ‚Äî it is low. BTC blockchain is able to conduct 4‚Äì7 transactions per second, when, for example, this figure for Visa payment system is 24 thousand transactions per second. Secondly, the society has not yet learned all the advantages that digital assets have.

Dorsey is a strong supporter of cryptocurrency and helps to spread it in the society. For example, in May, the Cash App from Square, which is owned by Jack Dorsey, was added to the opportunity to acquire digital assets. And in July, the Bitcoin logo appeared on the NASCAR car sponsored by Square.",1600078936,23,1

isf6xm,brianddk,A crappy little node walker (herder),"Hey guys, [here's a crappy little node herder](https://github.com/brianddk/reddit/blob/master/python/btc-herder.py)^(1) to try to find nodes running with the `minrelaytxfee` manually set.  I started by looking at [Addy's excellent python walker](https://github.com/ayeowch/bitnodes) but thought the amount of work I would need to do to pair it down would be better spent just busting some POC out.

The script basically just takes a nodes `addnode` list and `bannode` list to narrow the window of available candidates.  The object is to (painfully) slowly allow your node to connect to each reachable node on the network.  Base telemetry of each connected node is gathered with `getnodeinfo`.  Here's the basic flow:

1. (Slowly) Do a DNS dig to get an IPv4 / onion endpoint list from a pool of seeders
2. Test the port of each using netcat (`nc`)
3. Add known nodes to the `addnode` list
4. Gather telemetry of each connected node using `getnodeinfo`
5. Ban (24h) nodes after 5 minutes to force new connections
6. Repeat

By artificially limited the list of available endpoints, our node will eventually connect to nodes we haven't yet talked to so we can gather more info.

I ran it for a few hours on testnet (ipv4/onion) before killing it.  I found 6171 nodes, 1570 of which were accepting incoming connections on, and 415 of which I actively collected telemetry on.  About 7.5% of the nodes were allowing TXNs below the default `minrelaytxfee` rate.

Since I was planning on testing miner acceptance of TXNs below the default relay fee, I needed a way to find all the nodes that might accept them.  This was my attempt to get my node to personally handshake with each node in the network.

It's a little toy script, and I might pretty it up later, but it was still a fun experiment.

* https://github.com/brianddk/reddit/blob/master/python/btc-herder.py

^(Footnotes:)

^(1 - I realize this is an inorganic way to do node discovery and violates the spirit of TXN propogation, but its just a toy and \(I believe\), mostly harmless)",1600063034,5,8

Will sell it for a small commission fee.   ""Text me and we'll meet at Starbucks"" is what some of them say.   Outside of it feeling kind of shady, I'm actually wondering what their business model is.

My presumption is that these are the folks that sell BTC in exchange for gift cards with high markup online.  Or is there a more legit business?  And who the heck buys BTC off of Craigslist?

1) Which type of miner should I use, and will the profits be as good as they seem? At current rates, I could buy a Whatsminer m30s++ which would profit $250/ mo and pay itself off in \~7 months. After that is pure profit, but I'd also assume that newer miners will make it obsolete. What would long-term profit look like?

2) Can a wall plugin support the power draw? I've heard that some of these miners can pull too much electricity, but I'm not sure.

3) Will I get noticed? I'm not looking to do anything crazy. Just a couple of miners. This is a huge apartment with 100s of units, so the bump in electricity will likely be unnoticeable.

The CoinBase Wallet app had a bug (with fingerprint authentication) and it has managed to lock me out of my funds (BTC) and create a new (CoinBase Wallet) account with a 12 word mnemonic phrase (which is EXACTLY the same as my previous one - don't ask me how it's duplicated but it 100% is. I've been on with their support for 1.5 months and they are terrible).

I've been using the BIP39 convert tool offline ([https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39](https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39)).

I can get the private keys from the 12 word recovery phrase but non of the addresses are the correct one. I have the BTC address with the funds in and I can create a ""view only"" wallet on Electrum - but no private key to let me send the funds.

The derivation path is m/84'/0'/0'/1/0 (or m/84'/0'/0'/0/0) as I can see they use this for Segwit addresses by extracting the SQLite DB from their app (although this version does not contain my wallet - this new ""duplicated"" wallet... I also don't have a phone backup from this time).

Could someone please help me retrieve these funds - there will be a small financial incentive if recovered!

* [SoChain: 9c753076428ec9ae79da919fa227db44a2a28841af3ce38669686141f2590293](https://sochain.com/tx/BTC/9c753076428ec9ae79da919fa227db44a2a28841af3ce38669686141f2590293)

So last month, [I voiced the unpopular opinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/idg07j/node_operators_please_set_the_minrelaytxfee_to/) that node operators should lower the `minrelaytxfee` setting to allow low-fee TXNs to propagate more freely throughout the network.  Then [I asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ir5fh1/when_the_mempool_empties_why_dont_miners_mine_the/) why miners weren't mining 0.999 sat/vB TXNs during idle periods since it should be more profitable than mining no TXNs at all.  Finally I [wrote a node herder](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/isf6xm/a_crappy_little_node_walker_herder/) to walk the network looking for node operators that were running `minrelaytxfee` below the default (1000 sat).  After walking about 26% of the network, turns out about 5% of nodes are allowing low fee TXNs.

So in that vein of discussion, I decided to just sign some low-fee TXNs and send them to the 5% and see what happens.  To my surprise it showed up on one of the 23 block explorers I tried.  Surprisingly, that comes out to about 5% as well.  So hopefully 5% or so of the miners will confirm low fee TXNs.  We'll see.

BTW, to do this, this is what I did.

1. Pair my HW wallet to Electrum
3. Use the `paytomany` Electrum API to craft a TXN below 1 sat/vB
4. Import the TXN to sign in Electrum
1. Ran a full node with `minrelaytxfee` set to 1 sat
3. Walked the network to find a good number of low-fee peers
5. Use bitcoin `addnode` API to herd my node to the low-fee peers I discovered.
5. Use bitcoin `sendrawtransaction` API to broadcast TXN

Wait and see if it can propagate to a miner and if a miner will accept it.

BTW, there is a PR to lower the `minrelaytxfee` in core, but it's dragged on for years.  The setting was lowered about every year or so in the early days, but hasn't been touched for many years now.",1600235180,10,1

not sure about that title but I'll try to explain.

Wouldn't it ruin bitcoin's ideology and its value ?

It's probably already happening, I guess a lot of public figures who publicly hate cryptos are actually secretly investing but, what is the aftermath of this if there is any?

Also, wouldn't Bitcoin just become the mirror of global wealth if it isn't already? I mean, in the long run, wouldn't this whole thing become a pyramid where 10% of existing wallets would detain 85% of the bitcoins and control de market? Wouldn't this be even worse with Bitcoins being limited to 21mil?

The time to do it is really now, while everything is still yet to come. Having the smaller amount be called ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù will make things easier for newcomers.

The transaction is confirmed on the blockchain but I have not received the coins and I suspect it's because I chose the wrong chain. How can Binance make it so confusing,  this is utterly ridiculous and a sure way to lose your coins?

Bitcoin will change continuously. And asper my understanding, has an extremely slow weeks-long upgrade process, as any vulnerability will exist as long as 50% node have been upgraded. This means any future vulnerability could be absolutely disastrous.

 The worst is that most bitcoiners are just not concerned about it. The 2018 inflation bug, one dev felt responsible for it.

I would like to know if I can use the spruned Bitcoin client with a GUI, such as GTK, Qt or curses, and if it can be trusted on.

If any of this is not true (also, it has not been mantained for almost a year), would there be an alternative to this? To be more specific, a Bitcoin client that does not need to immediately download the blockchain (or does not need to download and keep more than a few megabytes of the blockchain), but it stores the user's wallet on the HDD. Like pruning, but using much less disk space than what Bitcoin uses right now (about 20 GB).",1600305423,2,1

iu57q7,brianddk,P2P questions on operation of Bitcoin Core,"I've been playing around with Core, and had a random collection of questions regarding the P2P operations of the protocol.  I've looked through some of the source but C++ is not my strongest language.  Hopefully someone knows some of the answers off the top of their head.

1. What `whoami` info is transmitted when a node connects to a peer, particularly on onion?  Since all onion connections happen through the tor service on `127.0.0.1` how do the peers know where to find me?  Is the `externalip` argument and `port` bindings transmitted to peers (must be right)?  And if this info is transmitted, why don't I know the names of onion peers that connect to me, they always show as `127.0.0.1`.
2. How is a peer that listens on a non-default port discovered?  When I look at DNS seeding, the DNS digs only give IP addresses.  Most of the time hosts listed in a DNS seed DIG are listening on the default port, but is there any way to discover nodes listening on a nondefault port?  Are they only discovered when they connect to peers and give their `whoami` or whatever message that may be.
3. If I'm connected to a peer, say `1.2.3.4:8333`, then that would be an outgoing connection my by tally.  Can that peer then turn around and issue and incoming connection to me?  Specifically, can I hold both an outgoing and incoming connection to the same peer?  Does this create and type of spanning tree violation?
4. Generally, how soon after a peer connects do the two peers begin to sync their mempools.  Is that the first order of business, or is there some random timer that triggers the sync between the peers?
5. When I issue a `sendrawtransaction` API call, does that just push the TXN to my own mempool, or does that force a message to all my peers that I have a new TXN to send?",1600291737,5,1

ivumgp,BlandTomato,Let's talk about Bitcoin price volatility.,"The idea of that as more people adopt Bitcoin the price will stabilize to its long term exponential curve. 

Here's why I think that's true. 

1. We're already seeing this. Check out the price charts to confirm. 

2. It makes sense. The ratio of seasoned Bitcoiners to new investors increases over time. N00bs are far more likely to panic sell for a loss. So as more and more Bitcoin users develop their strong aversion to selling, the sharp downward swings (caused by panic selling n00bs) are reduced in severity and frequency. 

3. Plus now we have larger, more wealthy entities who buy the dip. Microstrategy already publicly announced that they're doing this. So large dips are cut off before they gain any momentum. You'll only see large downward swings if someone cashes out a few million dollars in BTC all at once. But the severity of those dips will be blunted. 

4. Regular buyers: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust alone is buying more than 100% of the newly mined Bitcoins. Where do you think the extra Bitcoin is coming from? (BTW glorious nation of Kazakhstan just invested $700,000,000 in Bitcoin mining gear). Eventually this pool of existing Bitcoin that they're buying from will dry up more and more. That's without even considering the massive effect that the 4 year halving cycle creates. 

5. At the next halving 31months from now, the amount of new Bitcoin created gets cut in half again for the 4th time. This will run the well even drier. Let's say Grayscale continues to buy the same amount (even though they will definitely keep increasing their investment and other players will join in too). The faster the reserve of already existing Bitcoin is getting bought up, the faster the price goes up. The halvings increase this every 4 years. 

It is an absolute certainty that Bitcoin will outperform every alternative investment and one day replace or completely dominate every other type of money. 

And for the Bitcoin scaling issue, the lightning network has already solved that. It does a million transactions per second, and has the capacity to send 10 BTC at once, instantly, for a few Satoshis (practically free). The Bitcoin blockchain will always run right about at capacity. The lightning network has private transactions. How do we know that Bitcoin together with Bitcoin lightning aren't doing as much business as Visa?

There is no limit for how high Bitcoin will go. 

Compare this with TSLA. Today they have a P/E ratio of 1145. Many will consider this to be overvalued. That limits how high the stock price can go. Plus, you can't spend stock. You HAVE TO sell it first. 

Bitcoin has no such limits. The price of Bitcoin can and will continue to go up exponentially over the long term. As volatility improves, the pace of price increase should increase as well. Accelerating acceleration. You never need to sell Bitcoin. Just spend it, unlike stocks or other financial instruments. 

Eventually, after 6 or 7 more halvenings, Bitcoin will have a market cap of higher than the rest of the world's wealth combined. Every step is there between here and then. Eventually government created fiat money will be nearly entirely worthless by comparison. 

This halving period will create another bull run as more institutional investors adopt the hold forever strategy. Volatility goes down. Bitcoin becomes more famous for its performance, draws deeper attention, converts more believers/investors, more people hold forever, Bitcoin price goes to infinity with no limit. It's just a matter of time.

ivlzqi,banana_turtles,Bitcoin of DeFi - STA,"Statera is an index fund is a fund that can track a specified basket of underlying investments and in this case: BTC, ETH, LINK, and SNX all ""balanced"" with STA. These coins are set in the fund at a specified percent so as one goes up or down the others are automatically bought or sold to balance risk and maximize profit.¬†
HOWEVER, the key is that STA is deflationary (whenever a STA transaction happens for buying/selling/pooling, 1% of said transaction is burned). This token burn along with tokens being locked in pools, pressures prices up to again make sure the other coins will be balanced, but also creates arbitrage opportunities across funds.¬†


¬†
Why is increasing volume, liquidity and arbitrage useful with STATERA?¬†
Well while pooling STATERA you earn a percent of all transaction fees in the liquidity pool. Please feel free to read the medium article outlining the first 2-3 months which came out to be an APY of 36% creating dividends where there were none (https://medium.com/@stateraproject).¬†
The power of STA is that the ripple effect of: (1) compounded fees, (2) token burn, (3) price pulled by balancing with ETH, BTC, SNX and LINK leads to an exponential effect and positive feedback loop on price. This leads to the concept created by STATERA known as ""Volume Farming.""¬†

Reading through some Bitcoin Talk threads, I can see that Satoshi and bitboy had a natural exchange. I‚Äôm wondering if Satoshi ended up reaching out to bitboy directly to redesign the logo or if bitboy designed the logo without feedback; Satoshi said yes, and the rest is history.
 
Forgive me if this has been discussed. If anyone can point me to previous threads that would be great. Thx.

iviz4d,fjkcdhkkcdtilj,DCA with futures?,"Maybe I'm misunderstanding futures trading, if I am please correct me.

My theory was that instead of just normally DCA, if you find futures for a lower price than the market price, and you're in it for the long run, wouldn't future trades be a great way to stack some extra sats? Its not much of a trading strat but simply long term it seems great, market price is 10k, future trade offers you 9k. Instead of buying the btc directly you put a futures trade on. You wont get the btc directly but doesn't really matter in the long run. If the price drops further when time up it makes no difference as you would have bought the same btc for 10k anyways. If the price is higher you technically done a good futures trade, but still since your strat is dca and hodling it doesn't really matter.

Hodling is a patience game, why is it so important that the btc collects dust in your wallet as fast as possible if you can get that btc + some extra sats if you just pay for it in advance?

Feel like I'm missing something or this would be superior to straight DCA.",1600478554,7,1

iwifxg,BlandTomato,Reasons to buy Bitcoin,"What are all of the reasons you bought Bitcoin? 

Here's my list: 

1. Innovation - Bitcoin is an entirely new form of wealth. Bitcoin is the most valuable digital creation ever, and it's just getting started. Bitcoin is unstoppable because of its nature. Bitcoin can't be copied. 

2. Monetary policy - I don't even know how to say this correctly, but... I love the issuance schedule of Bitcoin. There's a block every ten minutes. Every block includes a bribe to the miners to spend electricity. That's called a block reward. It started at 50 BTC. Then every 210,000 blocks (about 4 years) the reward gets cut in half. This happens 33 times total until all 21,000,000 BTC are mined in about the year 2140, at which point the network continues on working forever existing on transaction fees alone. 

The monetary policy creates a 4 year exponential price cycle. The stock to flow theory explains this more elegantly. Gold is valuable because you can't copy it, it's rare, and not much new gold is mined/found each year. It would take 62 years of the current mining rate to mine as much gold as we have today. But Bitcoin is different. It is impossible to mine/create as much Bitcoin as what already exists today. 

Block 649258 was just mined. That means there exists 18,495,362.5 BTC. There's only 2,504,637.5 BTC left to mine ever. Bitcoin is already more rare than gold. 

How much longer do you think it's going to take before people catch on and the price goes up because of the network effect? 

18,495,362.5 BTC divided evenly across the planet would be less than 0.0025 BTC per person. 

Reason #3: Bitcoin has been battle hardened. Bitcoin is unhackable at the network level. So if you use Bitcoin at the network level with a non custodial Bitcoin wallet, then you're pretty solid. Probably safer than all the good in your Fort Knox. 

So what are your reasons for buying Bitcoin?",1600623936,28,1

iwg4v4,Mindfucker223,Is this possible to create?,"I was wondering if these points are possible or logical to consider?

I was thinking about why hasn‚Äôt crypto taken over the world by now so i came with some points

1. Is the amount of currency/coins/tokens- is it possible to adjust the amount of coins based on the value of the coin(for example like in stocks there companies do a split to attract more buyers without creating inflation) you would basically increase the amount of coins and decrease the price (if you had 1btc = $10 and split it to 10btc = $1 or vase versa)

And i know that you can have fractional coins, but that‚Äôs just because of the mental barrier, it would attract more people

2. A some sort of a crypto bank that would be integrated into the cryptocurrency that would own like 1/3 of all the available currency and therefore could allow someone to trade regular money into that crypto

That bank would also be able to have a adjustable fee on every transaction (the key here is to start at a higher transaction fee and as time goes on lower the fee until it becomes almost 0) and a % of that fee would go to mining and the rest could go into expanding the availability to people

The fee would also enable a 0 interest loan that can also attract people into the cryptocurrency world

3. Is to create custom addresses for people to remember (like shortened URLs) you would type in the custom address and it would convert it to the random address that everybody has",1600616585,6,1

iwf1ex,WorkingLime,"Weekly update. 485 BTC were traded using LocalBitcoin last week,trading Bs. /BTC and BTC/Bs. (Bolivares, Venezuelan ""official"" currency, ISO VES). These 485 BTC were 1,796,000,000,000 Bs. One BTC is around 4,100,000,000 Bs. Monthly minimum wage is around 2 USD. PhD uni professor earns 4 USD monthly.","Hi, hope you are doing ok. I'm ""ok"" considering the situation, but it is ok.

And remember, two years ago 5 zeroes were deleted from the currency. So the price of the BTC would be 410,000,000,000,000 ""old"" Bs.

September  keeps the trend around 500 BTC traded weekly. Usefultulips reports  14,000,000 USD traded  in September so far.

The  trade is only measured ONLY using  LocalBitcoin, there are other exchanges   like AIRTM (this one banned by the Goverment), Uphold, Binance and so  on, but no open data as far as I  know.   Most of the Localbitcoin    trades are in Bolivares (BTC to BS  and BS to   BTC).

Here are more stats [https://www.usefultulips.org/combined\_VES\_Page.html](https://www.usefultulips.org/combined_VES_Page.html)

Monthly minimum wage is 800,000 Bs. one USD is around 395,000 Bs. So that is where the 2 USD monthly comes. These 800,000 Bs. already include a cash food bonus.

[https://www.caracaschronicles.com/](https://www.caracaschronicles.com/)

Some people insist that minimum monthly wage is not real, but it is. I have relatives that are public workers and earn that. Some with studies and time working could reach 20 minimum wages according to the tables, that would be anyway under 50 USD monthly. 

Private companies, well a little more. A cashier in a supermarket could earn around 50 USD monthly. 

The Venezuela College of Engineers, has a table for the recomended wages. The minimum wage they propose for a engineer without any experiencie is 90,000,000 Bs. / monthly, which is around 225 USD. And... good luck finding a place that pays that

[http://www.civ.net.ve/uploaded\_pictures/70\_d.pdf](http://www.civ.net.ve/uploaded_pictures/70_d.pdf)

One professor with PhD, nationa science award and 21 years teaching earns less than 4 USD monthly. You can see the testimony here [https://twitter.com/katika48/status/1304506604147159040?s=19](https://twitter.com/katika48/status/1304506604147159040?s=19) (I think you have the option to trasnlate the tweet)

The average income of Venezuelan is  0.72 USD daily (2020 numbers), so we are talking around 20 USD monthly, and that is an AVERAGE with all that means.

In 2020, Bitcoin is in a more stable upward trend than last year, according to a new report by the analytical company Delphi Digital. Experts have found that this year the balances of cryptocurrency exchange wallets continued to fall, despite the rise in the price of the main digital coin. This suggests that traders and investors, selling the asset, put less pressure on its quotes, Cointelegraph.  


**‚ÄúThis indicates a more stable upward trend in bitcoin compared to 2019. The data indicate that the time horizons of crypto holders have increased,‚Äù ‚Äî experts believe.**  


Over the past 6 months, the balance of crypto-exchange wallets has fallen from a historical high of 2.96 million BTC in late February to 2.59 million BTC in mid-September. Then the cryptocurrency was traded at the level of $9580, now it costs $10,430. Delphi Digital emphasized that when the rate of crypto is growing and its stocks on the stock exchanges are decreasing, it indicates a tendency to accumulate an asset.",1600849470,2,1

This got me thinking about secure long term storage of funds.

Multi-Sig is the way to go. And usually I'd say something like a 3-of-5 or 2-of-3 setup, where all keys are on permanently offline media (paper, hardware wallet, permanently offline laptop,...).

But how much less secure would something like this be in comparison?

**Alice's 6-of-10 setup between her, Bob and Charlie.**

* Smartphone Alice
* Laptop Alice
* Hardwarewallet Alice

* Banksafe an Alice' name, paper seed-backup and/or hardwarewallet

* Smartphone Bob
* Hardwarewallet Bob
* Laptop Bob

* Laptop Charlie
* Hardwarewallet Charlie
* Smartphone Charlie

The advantage is, that this would be pretty easy to setup. They all have their laptop ready, a shared Dropbox folder to put the master-public-keys in. They could perform tests every 3 months or so, signing a message with all devices, and that wouldn't be too much work, because everything except the banksafe wallet is easily accessed.

Bob and Charlie can do the same thing in the same group, they would simply have their own banksafe with a different wallet in there.

I didn't really wanted to lose my time and put effort on a text that most likely will be ridiculed by many and most likely will be ignored, but I have to do it for so many reasons because World really is f'ed up place on our era, and Heroes are the ones who are poor and try to put themselves on someone's else shoes and struggles of life.  
I came to know about Bitcoin not more than a month ago, and since then I've been hyped watching videos behind Bitcoin's technology, how it runs, how it works and how is created,, Bitcoin's documentaries etc etc... Hyped watching Bitcoin wallets like top 100 etc etc.  
Unfortunately from where I come from, saving money is a big problem because an average educated person with a diploma can not get paid more than 350$ a month, and me sitting without no college due to not having the monetary wills to pursue one, I work more than 9-5 as a modern slave for less than 250$ off taxes. However, I invested and went all in on Bitcoin, and my lifesaving didn't really matter to much wether Bitcoin was sitting on 15k,10k or 5k, cuz all I had on fiat didn't even bought me 0.05 of Bitcoin at 10k\[when I bought in\], so I FOMO-ed in.  
Now I'm literally living like a gypsy, lost my work from the PlanDemic and I'm trying hard to find something else so I can provide my family making ends meet and providing food on the table.  
I'm the only man in the house coming from a broken family, 'dad' left me and my mom when I was just 1, so pretty much my childhood is having no childhood, and puberty was nothing but trouble after trouble cuz I was dumb wanting to see my self having riches. However, that period of my life is over and I'm glad it is, I converted on the religion of Islam while serving jail sentence in the minorities section for drug dealing\[weed to be specific\]. I was only 15 nearly 16 when I was caught.  
Back to Bitcoin, not long ago youtube messed up algorithm suggested me a video of Davincij15 titled  
' Buy just 1$ worth of Bitcoin' and I really loved his speech, so after the video ended I went googling' about Bitcoin and I see it's price being around 10.9-11k.   
I felt the most unluckiest person ever. I wished I never clicked that video!  
Now I've been having sleepless nights overthinking to my self that \[at what cave I've been sleeping in since 2008\] when Bitcoin was published by Nakamoto through White Paper.  
But my hopes were revived, when I finally got in touch with Davinci, and I spoke with him via text messages and also via video calls, asking him as man to man for any fraction of Bitcoin if possible a whole one to pay him back with the same amount of Bitcoin after the next bull run if giving away any Bitcoin was any big deal for him. I explained to him and opened my heart hoping he would've understood what 1$ of his investment had the potential not only to change my life, but also for the generation that is yet to come. I explained to him how valuable Bitcoin was in my eyes, and I wouldn't sell cuz I lived poorly most of my life I wouldn't mind living another decade like so.  
But Davinci showed me that humanity is LOONG-GONE!  
He showed me how f'ed up humans of nowdays are, greedy, selfish and the worst virtues a human being can have.   
I appreciate his effort on yelling at people to invest on Bitcoin since back than, but I found it hard to accept how someone who might own more than 10.000 Bitcoin find it SO DIFFICULT to revive someone's life on the nowadays societies with something ridiculous of his early investment.  
I'm really in a desperate mode, not only because Bitcoin is expensive, but also from the humans that exist today. Had I been an early investor, I have no doubt in my mind I would've helped people like me that come from third world countries and have not much to invest on Bitcoin.. to people like me, who see the next peak of Bitcoin at 200k+, 1 Bitcoin that can change 2 Generations on where I live.  
However,I've lost my faith in humanity so I'm not writing all of this to be a 'begger' or whatever of what some of you might call me. The only reason I'm writing this long sh!t, is because I need some advice, I need some counseling with other people who at least can understand from where I'm standing.",1601041938,19,1

It also set up programs that:

a) Pay up to 50% of rent AND municipal taxes for business 

b) Subsidizes up to 90% of a company's wages if it had to close due to virus

c) Double the tax credit for millions of families

d) Extended deadlines to pay taxes, removed fees and interest

e) Other programs to ""help"" Canadians through the pandemic.

Total cost of that program? 275B CAD. That's $10,000 for EVERY. SINGLE. CANADIAN.

Of course, taxes for the year are plumetting as people are working less, buying less (sales taxes), businesses are closed, etc. 

Where did they take take that money then? Well, they pretty much just printed. Our debt went from $750B to over a trillion.

And here's the kicker:

**THIS PROGRAM IS ABOUT TO BE RENEWED FOR ONE. FULL. YEAR.**

Yes, you read that right. This program will now last well into 2021. How many more billions you ask? 

So, what does this have to do with bitcoin? Well, $275B is basically $200B USD. That's the entire market cap of bitcoins, right there.

**In six months, Canada, one country, ""invented"" more money out of thin air than the entire market cap of bitcoins. And that is just one, small, almost irrelevant country of 33M people!**

Of course, by now, you got that bitcoins, unlike Canadian Dollar, US Dollar, euros (another mess with Greece btw), CANNOT be printed ad vitae eternam.

When you consider that simple fact, you KNOW that bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency and pretty much the only crypto that everyone will always accept, forever, is undervalued. It's bound to go up long term because unlike cash, it cannot be printed out of thin air. 

Even better, most of bitcoins has already been printed. There's less than 3M bitcoins left over the next 100 years.

With that being said, I absolutely refuse to believe bitcoin is not worth $100,000+ per year. As long as people choose to accept it, and more and more people choose to accept it (today someone insisted on being paid with it and gave me a discount over paying in USD), it's bound to go up, period, if only because governments are stupid and print infinite money, forever.

Why is printing money bad, you ask? Well, let's face this: the value of a dollar has gone down 99% in the last 50 years. What can a dollar even buy today? In 1950, my grandfather earned something like $50 a week and could still afford a house, a car, and his wife stayed home. Today, ten times that amount is not even enough to afford half of that.

Canada printing so much cash is bound to devalue its currency. Prices will go up around the board. I remember a Big Mac being $2 as a regular price, now it's $3 on SALE a few times per year, and $6.49 the rest of the time. What's it going to cost in 5 years, $10?

All in all, bitcoin is truly revolutionary because the government cannot bullshit its way out of any situation by printing money. It will go up as currencies go down. And if you ever think bitcoin is overpriced, remember that in six months, one small (in terms of population) country printed more than the entire market cap of bitcoins.

It is a general issue that crops up at the extremes of cryptography, with quantum breaks being just one of the extremes of (classical) cryptography.

Computational vs Information-Theoretic
--------------------------------------

The dichotomy is between *computationally infeasible* vs *informationally-theoretic infeasible*.  Basically:

* Something is *computationally infeasible* if it could in theory be done, but you would not be able to build a practical computer to do it within the age of the universe and using only the power available in just one galaxy or thereabouts.
* Something is *informationally-theoretic infeasible* if even if you had any arbitrarily large amount of time, space, and energy, you cannot do it.

Quantum breaks represent a possible reduction in computational infeasibility of certain things, but not information-theoretic infeasibility.

For example, suppose you want to know what 256-bit preimages map to 256-bit hashes.  In theory, you *just* need to build a table with 2^256 entries and start from 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 and so on.  This is computationally infeasible, but not information-theoretic infeasible.

However, suppose you want to know what preimages, of ***any*** size, map to 256-bit hashes.  Since the preimages can be of any size, after finishing with 256-bit preimages, you have to proceed to 257-bit preimages.  And so on.  And there is no size limit, so you will literally ***never*** finish.  Even if you lived forever, you would not complete it.  This is information-theoretic infeasible.

Commitments
-----------

How does this relate to confidential transactions?  Basically, every confidential transaction simply hides the value behind a homomorphic commitment.  What is a homomorphic commitment?  Okay, let's start with commitments.  A commitment is something which lets you hide something, and later reveal what you hid.  Until you reveal it, even if somebody has access to the commitment, they cannot reverse it to find out what you hid.  This is called the ""hiding property"" of commitments.  However, when you **do** reveal it (or ""open the commitment""), then you cannot replace what you hid with some other thing.  This is called the ""binding property"" of commitments.

For example, a hash of a preimage is a commitment.  Suppose I want to commit to something.  For example, I want to show that I can predict the future using the energy of a spare galaxy I have in my pocket.  I can hide that something by hashing a description of the future.  Then I can give the hash to you.  You still cannot learn the future, because it's just a hash, and you can't reverse the hash (""hiding"").  But suppose the future event occurs.  I can reveal that I did, in fact, know the future.  So I give you the description, and you hash it and compare it to the hash I gave earlier.  Because of preimage resistance, I cannot retroactively change what I hid in the hash, so what I gave must have been known to me at the time that I gave you the commitment i..e. hash (""binding"").

Homomorphic Commitments
-----------------------

A *homomorphic* commitment simply means that if I can do certain operations on preimages of the commitment scheme, there are certain operations on the commitments that would create similar (""homo"") changes (""morphic"") to the commitments.  For example, suppose I have a magical function `h()` which is a homomorphic commitment scheme.  It can hide very large (near 256-bit) numbers.  Then if `h()` is homomorphic, there may be certain operations on numbers behind the `h()` that have homomorphisms after the `h()`.  For example, I might have an operation `&lt;+&gt;` that is homomorphic in `h()` on `+`, or in other words, if I have two large numbers `a` and `b`, then `h(a + b) = h(a) &lt;+&gt; h(b)`.  `+` and `&lt;+&gt;` are different operations, but they are homomorphic to each other.

For example, elliptic curve scalars and points have homomorphic operations.  Scalars (private keys) are ""just"" very large near-256-bit numbers, while points are a scalar times a standard generator point `G`.  Elliptic curve operations exist where there is a `&lt;+&gt;` between points that is homomorphic on standard `+` on scalars, and a `&lt;*&gt;` between a scalar and a point that is homomorphic on standard `*` multiplication on scalars.

For example, suppose I have two large scalars `a` and `b`.  I can use elliptic curve points as a commitment scheme: I can take `a &lt;*&gt; G` to generate a point `A`.  It is hiding since nobody can learn what `a` is unless I reveal it (`a` and `A` can be used in standard ECDSA private-public key cryptography, with the scalar `a` as the private key and the point `A` as the public key, and the `a` cannot be derived even if somebody else knows `A`).  Thus, it is hiding.  At the same time, for a particular point `A` and standard generator point `G`, there is only one possible scalar `a` which when ""multiplied"" with `G` yields `A`.  So scalars and elliptic curve points are a commitment scheme, with both hiding and binding properties.

Now, as mentioned there is a `&lt;+&gt;` operation on points that is homomorphic to the `+` operation on corresponding scalars.  For example, suppose there are two scalars `a` and `b`.  I can compute `(a + b) &lt;*&gt; G` to generate a particular point.  But even if I don't know scalars `a` and `b`, but I do know ***points*** `A = a &lt;*&gt; G` and `B = b &lt;*&gt; G`, then I can use `A &lt;+&gt; B` to derive `(a + b) &lt;*&gt; G` (or equivalently, `(a &lt;*&gt; G) &lt;+&gt; (b &lt;*&gt; G) == (a + b) &lt;*&gt; G`).  This makes points a homomorphic commitment scheme on scalars.

Confidential Transactions: A Sketch
-----------------------------------

This is useful since we can easily use the near-256-bit scalars in SECP256K1 elliptic curves to easily represent values in a monetary system, and hide those values by using a homomorphic commitment scheme.  We can use the hiding property to prevent people from learning the values of the money we are sending and receiving.

Now, in a proper cryptocurrency, a normal, non-coinbase transaction does not create or destroy coins: the values of the input coins are equal to the value of the output coins.  We can use a *homomorphic* commitment scheme.  Suppose I have a transaction that consumes an input value `a` and creates two output values `b` and `c`.  That is, `a = b + c`, i.e. the sum of all inputs `a` equals the sum of all outputs `b` and `c`.  But remember, with a homomorphic commitment scheme like elliptic curve points, there exists a `&lt;+&gt;` operation on points that is homomorphic to the ordinary school-arithmetic `+` addition on large numbers.  So, confidential transactions can use points `a &lt;*&gt; G` as input, and points `b &lt;*&gt; G` and `c &lt;*&gt; G` as output, and we can easily prove that `a &lt;*&gt; G = (b &lt;*&gt; G) &lt;+&gt; (c &lt;*&gt; G)` if `a = b + c`, without revealing `a`, `b`, or `c` to anyone.

Pedersen Commitments
--------------------

Actually, we cannot just use `a &lt;*&gt; G` as a commitment scheme in practice.  Remember, Bitcoin has a cap on the number of satoshis ever to be created, and it's less than 2^53 satoshis, which is fairly trivial.  I can easily compute all values of `a &lt;*&gt; G` for all values of `a` from 0 to 2^53 and know which `a &lt;*&gt; G` corresponds to which actual amount `a`.  So in confidential transactions, we cannot naively use `a &lt;*&gt; G` commitments, we need Pedersen commitments.

If you know what a ""salt"" is, then Pedersen commitments are fairly obvious.  A ""salt"" is something you add to e.g. a password so that the hash of the password is much harder to attack.  Humans are idiots and when asked to generate passwords, will output a password that takes less than 2^30 possibilities, which is fairly easy to grind.  So what you do is that you ""salt"" a password by prepending a random string to it.  You then hash the random string + password, and store the random string --- the salt --- together with the hash in your database.  Then when somebody logs in, you take the password, prepend the salt, hash, and check if the hash matches with the in-database hash, and you let them log in.  Now, with a hash, even if somebody copies your password database, the can't get the password.  They're hashed.  But with a salt, even techniques like rainbow tables make a hacker's life even harder.  They can't hash a possible password and check every hash in your db for something that matches.  Instead, if they get a possible password, they have to prepend *each* salt, hash, then compare.  That greatly increases the computational needs of a hacker, which is why salts are good.

What a Pedersen commitment is, is a point `a &lt;*&gt; H`, where `a` is the actual value you commit to, plus `&lt;+&gt;` another point `r &lt;*&gt; G`. `H` here is a second standard generator point, different from `G`.  The `r` is the salt in the Pedersen commitment.  It makes it so that even if you show `(a &lt;*&gt; H) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; G)` to somebody, they can't grind all possible values of `a` and try to match it with your point --- they *also* have to grind `r` (just as with the password-salt example above).  And `r` is much larger, it can be a true near-256-bit number that is the range of scalars in SECP256K1, whereas `a` is constrained to ""reasonable"" numbers of satoshi, which cannot exceed 21 million Bitcoins.

Now, in order to validate a transaction with input `a` and outputs `b` and `c`, you only have to prove `a = b + c`.  Suppose we are hiding those amounts using Pedersen commitments.  You have an input of amount `a`, and you know a` and `r`.  The blockchain has an amount `(a &lt;*&gt; H) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; G)`.  In order to create the two outputs `b` and `c`, you just have to create two new `r` scalars such that `r = r[0] + r[1]`.  Then you create a transaction consuming the input `(a &lt;*&gt; H) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; G)` and outputs `(b &lt;*&gt; H) &lt;+&gt; (r[0] &lt;*&gt; G)` and  `(c &lt;*&gt; H) &lt;+&gt; (r[1] &lt;*&gt; G)`.  You know that `a = b + c`, and `r = r[0] + r[1]`, while fullnodes around the world, who don't know any of the amounts or scalars involved, can just take the points `(a &lt;*&gt; H) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; G)` and see if it equals `(b &lt;*&gt; H) &lt;+&gt; (r[0] &lt;*&gt; G) &lt;+&gt; (c &lt;*&gt; H) &lt;+&gt; (r[1] &lt;*&gt; G)`.  That is all that fullnodes have to validate, they just need to perform `&lt;+&gt;` operations on points and comparison on points, and from there they validate transactions, all without knowing the actual values involved.

Computational Binding, Information-Theoretic Hiding
---------------------------------------------------

Like all commitments, Pedersen Commitments are binding and hiding.

However, there are really two kinds of commitments:

* computationally binding, information-theoretic hiding
* information-theoretic binding, computationally hiding

What does this mean?  It's just a measure of how ""impossible"" binding vs hiding is.  Pedersen commitments are computationally binding, meaning that in theory, a user of this commitment with arbitrary time and space and energy can, in theory, replace the amount with something else.  However, it is information-theoretic hiding, meaning an attacker with arbitrary time and space and energy cannot figure out exactly *what* got hidden behind the commitment.

But why?

Now, we have been using `a` and `a &lt;*&gt; G` as private keys and public keys in ECDSA and Schnorr.  There is an operation `&lt;*&gt;` on a scalar and a point that generates another point, but we cannot ""revrese"" this operation.  For example, even if I know `A`, and know that `A = a &lt;*&gt; G`, but do not know `a`, I cannot derive `a` --- there is no `&lt;/&gt;` operation between `A &lt;/&gt; G` that lets me know `a`.

Actually there is: I ""just"" need to have so much time, space, and energy that I just start counting `a` from 0 to 2^256 and find *which* `a` results in `A = a &lt;*&gt; G`.  This is a computational limit: I don't have a spare universe in my back pocket I can use to do all those computations.

Now, replace `a` with `h` and `A` with `H`.  Remember that Pedersen commitments use a ""second"" standard generator point.  The generator points `G` and `H` are ""not really special"" --- they are just random points on the curve that we selected and standardized.  There is no operation `H &lt;/&gt; G` such that I can learn `h` where `H = h &lt;*&gt; G`, though if I happen to have a spare universe in my back pocket I can ""just"" brute force it.

Suppose I *do* have a spare universe in my back pocket, and learn `h = H &lt;/&gt; G` such that `H = h &lt;*&gt; G`.  What can I do in Pedersen commitments?

Well, I have an amount `a` that is committed to by `(a &lt;*&gt; H) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; G)`.  But I happen to know `h`!  Suppose I want to double my money `a` without involving Elon Musk.  Then:

* `(a &lt;*&gt; H) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; G)`
* == `(a &lt;*&gt; (h &lt;*&gt; G)) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; G)`
* == `((a * h) &lt;*&gt; G) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; G)`; remember, `&lt;*&gt;` is *also* homomorphic on multiplication `*`.
* == `((a * h + a * h - a * h) &lt;*&gt; G) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; G)`; just add 0.
* == `((a * h + a * h) &lt;*&gt; G) &lt;+&gt; ((-a * h) &lt;*&gt; G) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; G)`
* == `((2 * a * h) &lt;*&gt; G) &lt;+&gt; ((r - a * h) &lt;*&gt; G)`
* == `((2 * a) &lt;*&gt; (h &lt;*&gt; G)) &lt;+&gt; ((r - a * h) &lt;*&gt; G)`
* == `((2 * a) &lt;*&gt; H) &lt;+&gt; ((r - a * h) &lt;*&gt; G)`; TADA!! I doubled my money!

**That** is what we mean by computationally binding: if I can compute `h` such that `H = h &lt;*&gt; G`, then I can find another number which opens the same commitment.  And of course I'd make sure that number is much larger than what I originally had in that address!

Now, the *reason* why it is ""only"" computationally binding is that it is information-theoretically hiding.  Suppose somebody knows `h`, but has no money in the cryptocurrency.  All they see are points.  They can try to find what the original amounts are, but because any amount can be mapped to ""the same"" point with knowledge of `h` (e.g. in the above, `a` and `2 * a` got mapped to the same point by ""just"" replacing the salt `r` with `r - a * h`; this can be done for `3 * a`, `4 * a` etc.), they cannot learn historical amounts --- the `a` in historical amounts could be *anything*.

The drawback, though, is that --- as seen above --- arbitrary inflation is now introduced once somebody knows `h`.  They can multiply their money by any arbitrary factor with knowledge of `h`.

It is impossible to have *both* perfect hiding (i.e. historical amounts remain hidden even after a computational break) *and* perfect binding (i.e. you can't later open the commitment to a different, much larger, amount).

Pedersen commitments just happen to have perfect hiding, but only computationally-infeasible binding.  This means they allow hiding historical values, but in case of anything that allows better computational power --- including ***but not limited to*** quantum breaks --- they allow arbitrary inflation.

Changing The Tradeoffs with ElGamal Commitments
-----------------------------------------------

An ElGamal commitment is just a Pedersen commitment, but with the point `r &lt;*&gt; G` also stored in a separate section of the transaction.

This commits the `r`, and fixes it to a specific value.  This prevents me from opening my `(a &lt;*&gt; H) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; G)` as `((2 * a) &lt;*&gt; H) &lt;+&gt; ((r - a * h) &lt;*&gt; G)`, because the `(r - a * h)` would not match the `r &lt;*&gt; G` sitting in a separate section of the transaction.  This forces me to be bound to that specific value, and no amount of computation power will let me escape --- it is information-theoretically binding i.e. perfectly binding.

But that is now computationally hiding.  An evil surveillor with arbitrary time and space can focus on the `r &lt;*&gt; G` sitting in a separate section of the transaction, and grind `r` from 0 to 2^256 to determine what `r` matches that point.  Then from there, they can negate `r` to get `(-r) &lt;*&gt; G` and add it to the `(a &lt;*&gt; H) &lt;+&gt; (r &lt;*&gt; G)` to get `a &lt;*&gt; H`, and *then* grind that to determine the value `a`.  With massive increases in computational ability --- including ***but not limited to*** quantum breaks --- an evil surveillor can see all the historical amounts of confidential transactions.",1601039338,7,1

We are a small dev and editorial team, running our project for 3 years. We grow step by step, since we don‚Äôt have investments. The point is, we kept our finance in a Blockchain.com wallet since we considered these asshls to be reliable.

Well, perhaps that‚Äôs nothing new to you. Nevertheless, we appeal to Redditors as we are now desperate to find a solution - Blockhain.com support is deaf and dumb.

izi6qe,Btcyoda,The risk next ath will surprise again...,"Looking back Bitcoin has had a hell of a ride.

One aspect kept comming back though; underestimating the next step up.

Just look back at conversations in different time frames, every hurdle was going to be impossible to take, to just being rolled over...

It was never going to reach $1, for sure $100 was dreaming, reaching parity with an ounce of Gold well keep dreaming, ever going to touch $10k you are just insane, companies going to use it as their reserve pffff get out.....

And next ath will be the same..

No matter what it will be the incoming money will again surprise most. If it will be pension funds, governments, hedge funds, or whatever I don't care..

The only real risk I see is a possible panick.

Number of newly mined coins is low compared to what it was, while mentioned parties above have WAY more fiat to spill than previous cycles mainly initiated by just small parties.

If the next run gets just a bit out of hand things go nuts.
If pension funds, or governments openly step in, demand would outstrip supply by a magnitude.

Which Hodler is going to sell if price goes nuts and no end in sight since every one can do the basic math how much fiat will roughly chase that limited number of coins?

Just that attitude will make the price go even more nuts..

Look at the dire state of most fiat.

Look at the unsustainable debts.

The system will start to crumble and not just the weak usual suspects,  no this time big players like the Euro and Dollar will get hurt.

I don't know how we should prepare for such an bull run.
All I can say is 'don't get blown away, don't sell easy'.

Below is a straight copy of the post I made at r-bittrex, which pretty much seems like it's just a bunch of made up excuses.

# No email confirmation and withdrawal pending for over 2-weeks now

üì∑[**Withdraw**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bittrex/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Withdraw%22&amp;restrict_sr=1)

First of all, yes I know this is not a support forum, yes I have opened a ticked and been in contact with specialists.

So to the point, first the backstory: So I withdrew EUR like I've done multiple times before with no problems. Now when I withdrew a higher amount than usual (a bit over 500‚Ç¨), I didn't receive any email confirmation, straight up after 2fa it said ""successful"" and I didn't really think of it more. 6-days later the status was still pending, so I opened a ticket. The reply that I got was ""this is a common bug and can sometimes happen with wire transfers that they get stuck in pending status. You can cancel the withdrawal with the red X button in your pending withdrawals page. If that X does not appear however that means that transaction ID is already generated and withdrawal can not be cancelled"" and that we encourage users wouldn't withdraw using wire transfers, but SEPA transfers instead"". So there I was, stuck with no ability cancel and re-do the withdrawal. Not to mention that I never had any option to even select if I wanted a wire transfer or SEPA, and not to mention that if it's really a common bug why is there no big red warning on the withdrawal page about it?!

So they forwarded me to a specialist to talk more after I asked if there is something we can do to solve this, for me 500‚Ç¨ is not like allowance candy money and I really want it out of there obviously. The statement I got from the specialist was that their technician team is working on the issue, and that if I wanted they can enable SEPA on my account. So I said ""yeah please do enable it. And please do tell me if you can cancel the withdrawal from your end"". And to be fair they should be able to cancel it, just call your bank goddammit, if the transaction has not left that bank it can be cancelled, if it has left it should've been on my account a long time ago.

But no, they can't answer that question, they just straight up ignore it. The reply to that enabling SEPA was ""would you please confirm which account you want it to be enabled for"" and straight up ignoring my latter question.

The ability to throw out half-assed answers and avoid answering to questions when you're holding peoples money hostage is fucking disgusting.

Have a great day.",1601124598,27,1

I am not familiar with the reasons people invest in cryptos, but it looks like it's often a hedge against the financial system. I don't think people will see a need to hedge against the system if we have a system that is trustworthy and is better due to crypto technology.

So my prediction is that interest in Bitcoin will slowly dwindle once this change to the financial system is made. I'm investing in silver due to the increasing demand over the next years for industrial purposes. A lot of mines have been put on hold around the world this year, so it's a great opportunity to get in now.

izz9t5,100_Jose_Maria_001,"Antonopoulos: ""FinCen leak ...will be used against cryptocurrencies""","[https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/1308026648781086720](https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/1308026648781086720)

&gt; A lot of people who are into cryptocurrencies will see this FinCen leak as vindication and proof that banks are money launderers.   But, this will be used against cryptocurrencies...   
&gt;  
&gt; See the correct analysis of this news is that AML/CTF and KYC don't work. They will never work because they try to control the \*tool\* not the \*criminal act\*. It's not the money that is illicit, it's the use of that money to commit crimes.    
&gt;  
&gt; I've talked about this extensively. Not only is the use of money as a crime-control mechanism ineffective, it has terrible consequences that increase poverty for billions by creating economic exclusion. So it's not just useless, it is ""Worse than Useless""   
&gt;  
&gt; ""Worse than Useless"" is the title of a talk I gave about this topic. For the illusion of unatainable security and crime fighting we get two obvious and unavoidable results: billions cut out of the financial system and enormous corrupting power given to regulators and bankers.   
&gt;  
&gt; But despite this obvious truth, nothing is going to change. In fact, this report will be used to \*increase\* the use of controls and surveillance. In govt if something doesn't work, you do MORE of it. So this will result in stricter AML/CTF rules.    
&gt;  
&gt; These new rules will also not work. These new rules will also corrupt more bankers, regulators, cops and politicians. These new rules will destroy opportunity for millions more people. But they will offer the comfort of righteous rhetoric against evil while creating more evil   
&gt;  
&gt; As these new rules are applied, banking will become even harder for poor people, undocumented people and people on the fringes of society. It won't stop criminals from criming. It will stop poor people from rising out of poverty. It will make banks even more competition-proof   
&gt;  
&gt; These new rules will make government surveillance worse and will erode democratic institutions. They will make it possible for dictators to economically surveil, control, and eventually extinguish any opposition. They will use US surveillance tech to impose financial fascism   
&gt;  
&gt; Then of course, the need and value of open financial systems based on open, private, and uncensorable cryptocurrencies will increase dramatically. When all the money in the world has been deliberately broken to serve this unachievable goal, the only money that works is crypto   
&gt;  
&gt; More and more people will need to use cryptocurrency in order to participate in the global economy, because control-currency doesn't work as money. A medium of exchange can't also work as a medium of control. They break money to stop crime, even though it is a futile effort   
&gt;  
&gt; That makes crypto-currency a systemic threat, not to the economic nature of national money, but to the control and surveillance system of geopolitical money. Math money doesn't play politics, which makes it automatically ""rogue"" money.    
&gt;  
&gt; Open and private crypto-currencies won't comply with these regulations, because they CAN'T comply without breaking every feature and capability they have. If some try to comply they will have to compete against gov-crypto and facebook-crypto (they will lose)   
&gt;  
&gt; Then the war on cash and the war on ""illicit"" money becomes an all out war on the only money that still works. The free, open, borderless, neutral, immutable, censorship resistant money that crypto-currencies like Bitcoin offer   
&gt;  
&gt; The only type of money (crypto) that poor, undocumented, oppressed, and controlled populations can use will of course be attacked. But they will not have any choice but to continue to use cryptocurrency. Billions are already unbanked by fiat controls.    
&gt;  
&gt; This FinCen leak is worthy of our ridicule because it reveals the hypocrisy of those who argue that crypto-currency is for money launderers. Banking \*is\* money laundering on a massive scale. But the solution is not to tighten controls on money. That won't work   
&gt;  
&gt; The solution is to stop trying to use money (a tool) to fight crime (human nature). But if you think the hypocrites will back down and adopt sensible systems and laws that enable human trade and economic inclusion, you are wrong. They will double down with even more control   
&gt;  
&gt; This isn't good news. This is the excuse they will use to double down on surveillance and control. To make money a tool of naked political power. No matter how many billions these measures condemn to poverty.",1601094477,12,1

For some information on Mastermind groups check out this link: https://www.thesuccessalliance.com/what-is-a-mastermind-group/ . The Mastermind series will be a set of 10 meetings of 1.5 hours each once a week. The series will run from the 13th of October until the 15th of December. At this stage the meetings are tentatively scheduled for Tuesdays at 6:30pm - 8pm (AEDT)

At the meetings each member of the group will get 15 minutes allocated to them to use as they wish. The goal of the meeting will be to get honest feedback and to provide accountability towards working towards your trading goals.  

I have experience in running a Mastermind group not related to trading for several months. If you are interested, the requirements to join the Mastermind group will be to commit to attending the Mastermind meeting each week. It would need to be a priority in your calendar. 

Some optional activities that will be organised during the series as the need for them arises are: 

* Group market analysis.
* Discussions about fundamentals.
* Deep dive into record keeping systems.
* Group trade analysis.
* Group learning.
* Group strategy troubleshooting. 
* Strategy sharing.
* Risk management analysis.
* Occasional social / fun events.

The way the meetings and group will be organised will be with a google drive, slack and the meetings will be hosted on Zoom. We can help you get used to any of these programs, they are easy to use. 

As long as you have a basic understanding of trading and reading candlestick charts I would encourage you to apply. The main thing you will need is a desire to become a full time profitable trader. If you are only testing out the idea of being a trader this group might not be for you.

The printing of fiat currency by countries across the globe due to covid is in the view of monetary economics, a feature and not a bug. The ability to make money out of thin air is a powerful instrument that when used judiciously, i.e. ensuring the highest multiplier effect by making sure the currency is immediately spent and continues to be spent without adding to savings, can spur the economy without inflation. 


This is practically impossible as far as I understand with Bitcoin or any crypto currency with a cap on availability. 


In a scenario such as Covid, what kind of instruments/measures do you see being deployed in an economy that only has Bitcoin? Bonus points if the situation is such that the economy is in debt without reserves of bitcoin. 


Going further, how would debt and deficit work? If nations start maintaining reserves of bitcoin, e.g. to avert a crisis or to balance fiscal deficit, wouldn't that inflate the value of bitcoin available in circulation?",1601072061,66,1

My income has not been high enough to owe taxes in over five years due to mental health problems; this includes all forms of income such as any potential capital gains which would be negligible or potentially even losses. I am supported by my parents but they do not claim me as a dependent. Finally, if I were to ever need records  of my transactions, the wallet I have used almost exclusively for the last several years, Rahakott, no longer exists. 

Any information or ponderings are appreciated. This has really been spinning out my panic disorder since getting the letter even though it seems benign for the most part from a logical perspective.",1601069304,10,1
izsdpd,FormerSuggestion8,Why Bitcoin Has a Volatile Value?,"Price fluctuations in the bitcoin spot rate on cryptocurrency exchanges are driven by many factors.¬†Volatility is measured in traditional markets by the Volatility Index, also known as the CBOE¬†Volatility Index (VIX). More recently, a volatility index for bitcoin has also become available. Known as the Bitcoin Volatility Index, it aims to track the volatility of the world's leading digital currency by market cap over various periods of time.

Bitcoin's value has been historically quite volatile. In a three-month span from October of 2017 to January of 2018, for instance, the volatility of the price of bitcoin reached to nearly 8%. This is more than twice the volatility of bitcoin in the 30-day period ending January 15, 2020. But why is bitcoin so volatile? Here are just a few of the many factors behind bitcoin's volatility.

## Bad News Hurts Adoption Rate

News events that scare bitcoin users include geopolitical events and statements by governments that bitcoin is likely to be regulated.¬†Bitcoin's early adopters included several bad actors, producing headline news stories that produced fear in investors.

Headline-making bitcoin news over the decade or so of the cryptocurrency's existence includes¬†the¬†bankruptcy of Mt.¬†Gox¬†in early 2014 and, more recently, that of the South Korean exchange Yapian¬†Youbit. Other news stories which shocked investors include the high-profile use of bitcoin in drug transactions via Silk Road that ended with the FBI shutdown of the marketplace in October 2013.

All¬†these incidents and the public panic that ensued drove the value of bitcoins versus fiat currencies down rapidly.¬†However, bitcoin-friendly investors viewed those events as evidence that the market was maturing, driving the value of bitcoins versus the dollar markedly back up in the short period immediately following the news events.

## Bitcoin's Perceived Value Sways

One reason why bitcoin may fluctuate against fiat currencies is the perceived store of value versus the fiat currency.¬†Bitcoin has properties that make it similar to gold.¬†It is governed by a design decision by the developers of the core technology to limit its production to a fixed quantity of 21 million¬†BTC.¬†

Since that differs markedly from fiat currency, which is dynamically managed by governments who want to maintain low inflation, high employment, and satisfactory growth through investment in capital resources, as economies built with fiat currencies show signs of strength or weakness, investors may allocate more or less of their assets into bitcoin.

## Uncertainty of Future Bitcoin's Value

Bitcoin volatility is also driven in large part by varying perceptions of the intrinsic value of the cryptocurrency as a store of value and method of value transfer.¬†A store of value is the function by which an asset can be useful in the future with some predictability.¬†A store of value can be saved and exchanged for some good or service in the future.

A method of value transfer is any object or concept used to transmit property in the form of assets from one party to another.¬†Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at the present makes it a somewhat unclear store of value, but it promises nearly frictionless value transfer. As a result, we see that bitcoin's value can swing based on news events much as we observe with fiat currencies.

## Large Currency Holder Risks

Bitcoin volatility is also to an extent driven by holders of large proportions of the total outstanding float of the currency.¬†For bitcoin investors with current holdings above around $10M, it is not clear how they would liquidate a position that large into a fiat position without severely moving the market. Indeed, it may not be clear how they would liquidate a position of that size in a short period of time at all, as most cryptocurrency exchanges impose 24-hour withdrawal limits far below that threshold.

Bitcoin has not reached the mass market adoption rates that would be necessary to provide option value to large holders of the currency.¬†

## Security Breaches Cause Volatility

Bitcoin can also become volatile when the bitcoin community exposes security vulnerabilities in an effort to produce massive open source responses in the form of security fixes.¬†This approach to security is paradoxically one that produces great outcomes, with many valuable open source software initiatives to its credit, including Linux.¬†Bitcoin developers must reveal security concerns to the public in order to produce robust solutions.¬†

It was a hack that drove the Yapian¬†Youbit to bankruptcy, while many other cryptocurrencies have also made headlines for being hacked or having stashes of cryptocurrencies stolen. As an early example, in April 2014, the OpenSSL vulnerabilities attacked by the Heartbleed bug and reported by Google security's,¬†Neel Mehta,¬†drove Bitcoin prices down by 10% in a month.¬†

Bitcoin and open source software development are built upon the same fundamental premise that a copy of the source code is available to users to examine.¬†This concept makes it the responsibility of the community to voice concerns about the software design, just as it is the responsibility of the community to come to consensus about modifications to that underlying source code as well. Because of the open conversation and debate regarding the Bitcoin network, security breaches tend to be highly publicized.

## High-Profile Losses Raise Fear

It is worth noting that the aforementioned thefts and the ensuing news about the losses had a double effect on volatility.¬†They reduced the overall float of bitcoin, producing a potential lift on the value of the remaining bitcoin due to increased scarcity.¬†However, overriding this lift was the negative effect of the news cycle that followed.¬†

Notably, other bitcoin gateways looked to the massive failure at Mt. Gox as a positive for the long term prospects of bitcoin, further complicating the already complex story behind the currency‚Äôs volatility.¬†As early adopting firms were eliminated from the market due to poor management and dysfunctional processes, later entrants learn from their errors and build stronger processes into their own operations, strengthening the infrastructure of the cryptocurrency overall.¬†

## High-Inflation Nations and Bitcoins

Bitcoin‚Äôs use case as a currency for developing countries that are currently experiencing high inflation is valuable when considering the volatility of bitcoin in these economies versus the volatility of bitcoin in USD.¬†Bitcoin is much more volatile versus USD than the high-inflation Argentine peso versus the USD.¬†

That being said, the near frictionless transfer of bitcoins across borders makes it a potentially highly attractive borrowing instrument for Argentineans, as the high inflation rate for peso-denominated loans potentially justifies taking on some intermediate currency volatility risk in a bitcoin-denominated loan funded outside Argentina.¬†

Similarly, funders outside Argentina can earn a higher return under this scheme than they can by using other debt instruments, denominated in their home currency, potentially offsetting some of the risks of exposure to the high inflation Argentine market.¬†¬†

## Tax Treatment Lifts Volatility

According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), bitcoin is actually considered an asset for tax purposes.Ôªø This has had a mixed impact on bitcoin's volatility. On the upside, any statement recognizing the currency has a positive effect on the market valuation of the currency.¬†

Conversely, the decision by the IRS to call it property had at least two negative effects.¬†The first was the added complexity for users who want to use it as a form of payment. Under the new tax law, users would have to record the market value of the currency at the time of every transaction, no matter how small.¬†This need for record keeping can understandably slow adoption as it seems to be too much trouble for what it is worth for many users.¬†

Secondly, the decision to call the currency a form of property for tax purposes may be a signal to some market participants that the IRS is preparing to enforce stronger regulations later.¬†Very strong regulation of the currency could cause the adoption rate of the currency to slow to the point where it is not able to achieve the mass adoption that is critical for its overall utility in society.¬†Recent moves by the IRS are not clear as to their signaling motives and therefore have mixed signals to the market for bitcoin.",1601069055,2,1

j1yym7,ArbitraryUsernameHEH,Bitcoin for small payments,"In theory I really like the idea of Bitcoin, but as a currency there are things I don't fully understand yet. For example, lets say my friend and I go to lunch, my friend forgets to bring his wallet and I tell him I'll pay for him, and he offers to send me some Bitcoin to cover the cost of his meal.

To me, it seems the issue here is that the network transfer fee is prohibitively high for small payments. I was looking into this but trying to send approximately 15 USD worth of bitcoin to another account I have but the transfer fee was like 13-15% which I think is incredibly high, I even put it on the cheapest method and it only went down to 12%.   


Obviously this becomes more justifiable with larger sums of money, but I don't really intend on having large payments through this.  


Are there better methods, am I doing something wrong? Like I said, BTC is something I really like, and would like to see e-commerce go towards crypto because hypothetically, it might actually be *more* resistant to fraud or theft than the current methods of payment.",1601385256,26,1

Let's say I had 1,000 BTC stored on a hardware wallet and I lose it completely.

j1n76z,nyess,Why miners sell BTC got me thinking....,"Since Grayscale bought 17,100 Bitcoins last week and only 900 is being produced daily, it made me wonder why miners sell.

The way I see it, the only reason miners or people in general sell BTC for fiat/alts

1. Need of their native fiat currency to pay for electricity, food, security 
2. Altcoins to try to make more gains in fiat or try to pump and dump back into BTC (Unless they truly believe in that altcoin)
3. Knowing the demand of another currency going rise (End of Feb. when Covid was announced everyone wanted the USD, an announcement of digital currency and banning BTC) 

Once people start realizing the fixed supply of BTC is a good thing and that it is the most secure network, people would rather be paid in BTC. That is if we are continuing towards a digital world.

Now imagine if BTC was already mainstream and everyone defines it as Hard Money

1.  A portion of your BTC is used as currency to trade for goods and services like a debit card with Lighting integration and the other portion is kept in the main Vault
2. Altcoins will be used for specific purposes (think of Chuck E. Cheese tokens, or privacy coins like Monero to access Ultra Porn) or pump and dump like always
3. Physical Fiat or other types of currency will be used if the country or city is underdeveloped/Amish city/ Anti 5g Land

When I was first introduced to Bitcoin in 2015 the person talking sounded like a salesman and thought it was a pyramid scheme or scam. Then i bought in during the hype and sold at a loss because oh this thing was going to die. But it didn't die and went back up to 6k. It made me wonder why would people still want it if it was a scam. And that's when i discovered the truth about money.",1601334555,9,1

Just remember this;

1)Fiat money has the ability to become worthless due to the fact that a central entity controls its production.  In times of crisis they'll print too much and as much as they could which will just cause everything out there to be worth less.

2)Companies (stocks) have the ability to become worthless as well being that they function on the dollar as a piggyback.  They got pumped due to the dollar, NOT because they did better business.  Maybe Amazon and Tesla, but other companies no.

3)Bitcoin needs a DEMOCRACY to become worthless, meaning that for bitcoin to become worthless 100% of its participants have to agree on this AT THE SAME TIME.  All miners have to shut down, all nodes have to shut down, many bitcoin businesses need to close doors, etc.

Does anyone in this space use Messari? They're a fairly young crypto analytical tool for investments. I was curious to get the thoughts of other people interested in crypto about whether or not Messari is a useful tool and whether or not it's something we expect to grow as cryptocurrency gains popularity.

Specifcially:  
a) Did you know about Messari before this post?

b) Do You use Messari in any way? This could range from using their articles just to research a particular coin or being an actual subscriber.

c) Do you think there's a use-case for this type of company in the crypto space? If so, do you think Messari will be able to realize that market potential. If not, why don't you think it's a good use-case for crypto?

d) If crypto continues to grow, do you think messari will be a hosuehold name in the crypto-space (as much as a crypto company can be a household name) in a few years or do you think they'll disappear?

e) Messari wants to essentially be the EDGAR databases of crypto, grow into the go-to data solution for crypto finances, and is one of a few companies attempting to become ""the Bloomberg of cryptocurrency"". What do you think of this claim? Can they do it. is someone else already further ahead, or will, ya know, Bloomberg step in and be the Bloomberg of Crypto if it gets popular enough?

ilylp1,thomasbbbb,Attack on Bitcoin: start emptying inactive accounts,"Today I came up with an idea to empty inactive accounts like the one owned by Satoshi Nakamoto.

The principle is to run mining nodes that try to hack what the private key of some user is, for example Satoshi's keys, then archive nodes keep the ledger of the possible private keys that have been tried but didn't match the public key, and full nodes that verify the private key tested.  
To do so, the mining nodes need to cooperate in the sense that they only hack a slice of private keys. So they need to book the slice, which can be stored either in the Bitcoin ledger or in a tailor-made own ledger.  
The drawback of using the Bitcoin ledger is that it takes to pay to record those slices. This is why an own ledger and archive nodes could be the solution: 

1. when a mining node starts attacking a private key, it books a slice in the hack-ledger by telling the archive nodes (it takes few bytes) ; 
2. when the node has finished testing the possible private keys, it tells the full node each couple of 'private key - unmatched public key' tested (this would be the equivalent of Proof of Work) ; 
3. the full nodes verifies if the couples are true and if not the mining node is banned, otherwise they are sent to the archive node to record in the ledger as is (all the couples are recorded for further checks by other nodes. It also means that the computation is made a second time) ; 
4. if a mining node finds the private key matching the real public key, it takes all its money ;
5. the archive nodes keep the list of the private keys that needs to be attacked, starting with the ones with the more money (and it also checks that the couples send by the full nodes are matching, so the computation is made a third time) ;
6. the archive nodes keep the entire hack-ledger with up to 100 blocks of 'private key - unmatched public key' couples, and send it to each other to coordinate, and then only the slice is recorded to save memory ;
7. every now and then the mining and full nodes check that the list given by an archive node is true by reading the real Bitcoin ledger and if an archive node has a wrong list it is banned ;
8. every now and then the archive nodes ask the mining nodes that have booked a slice where they are, if they gives no answer, the slice is freed.

As I would be doing this in my spare time, it would take me some time to do, but I wanted to check first if some of you would be interested by the idea and could be running those kind of nodes, either home or on a host server.   
Typically, each person would be running all three nodes. The interest of having full nodes would be to filtrate a first time before submitting to archive nodes as these are also in charge of the ledger. But feel free to improve the workflow.

The idea is to attack the accounts that mined money in the early hours, and sometimes plenty of it, and then lost their keys.  
Against random users, the attack would not be interesting for the possible gains would not worth the computation.",1599156029,8,1

In case I can't use qt for this I downloaded bitcoind. It looks like I can start the daemon with txindex=1 and server=1 but still getting same connection problem with btc-rpc-explorer. 
  
Do I have to do -reindex=1? Can I do that within qt? If not and I use bitcoin cli will it disrupt qt in any way?

ilwdqr,PositiveResonanceSng,"Should you Buy Bitcoin? If you understand what it is, and where it's going; then Yes. If you don't know what it is and would sell at any sign of a 5%, 10%, 50%, or more dip; then, No.","Bitcoin is only a safe investment if you understand what it is, and how it will continue to be adopted into this world at this point in its life, regardless of the market price swings in the short term. Because only then will you never cement a loss by panic selling, and then seeing Bitcoin runaway in price while you're still out, therefore losing both your Dollar value and your Bitcoin position value.

I've been in Bitcoin for over 8 years now, and have seen many friends, family, and acquaintances come into Bitcoin, and many panic sell and FUD out during a down market. Most eventually coming back after learning more about Bitcoin, but some, for some it takes a long time to return. And for an even smaller few, well they never return, or at least not yet.  

&amp;#x200B;

But in essence, Bitcoin is only a safe investment if someone understands that their amount of Bitcoin is more important than whatever dollar value it has in the short term. That all they should be focused on is acquiring more Bitcoin, and that every 5 years after a halving happens, they'll see their coins grow in value. That they'll grow in value thanks to the math of its limited 21 million total coin supply, the new coin supply getting cut in half by the halvings making a more and more or the total supply being held by hodlers every year, and that its continued adoption into the global markets will always force it to eventually go up in price because those new adopters will always have to find what price those hodlers are willing to sell, finding Bitcoins new value that hodlers are willing to sell each time that happens, regardless of the short term evaluation corrections after a parabolic runs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Corrections mind, you that on average are only 80%, leaving anyone in before a 1000% growth parabolic runs to still being up 200% as long as they bought before the parabolic run started. The .com stock fluctuations were fluctuating on averages of 99% corrections during its first 15 years of life from the '90s to the early 2000s. And the ones that survived those early days were previously the best investments in history before Bitcoin came along. So Bitcoin is holding a better correction in its early day pattern than the biggest internet companies when they started, and its returns have already broken any records they previously held. Records they'll never be able to catch up to as Bitcoin continues its path.

&amp;#x200B;

 If they don't understand this, then even if they don't leave the market, they'll panic sell every time. And for some friends I know, they'll always sell at a dip right before a parabolic run, and then FOMO back in at a new all-time high, only to experience the next correction and sell again at their break-even point. With this, losing more Bitcoin position every time, but maintaining the same initial investment point which in their eyes as a win. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have one friend who came in with 10k in 2013, and today in 2020 is still only at 10k thanks to this pattern of buying and selling. Don't get me wrong, they've been up well over 100k$ at times, but they kept panicking selling at every parabolic run's slightest dip, then buying back in at the new all-time highs, only to then sell low in a repetitive cycle until they broke even.

&amp;#x200B;

People like that friend try to play the market, and yes while they do win sometimes, that pattern of buying and selling will almost always lead you to get rekt during times of parabolic growth, and correction. Had my friend just held his initial 10k investment in 2013, he'd be a multi-millionaire right now. It's one of the most golden rules with investing in any market. If you try to play it, eventually it will play you. Instead, just find a market on the path of growth, and longevity, and do everything you can to just increase your piece of that market's pie, no matter what the price. If it goes down in price in the short term, then just think of it like a rare Gucci purse or limited edition rare popular shoes that are being released on sale. Buy the damn discount and hold onto that shit until the market catches up with what you know and realizes it's true value. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of all these experiences throughout the years, if I'm trying to help anyone start buying Bitcoin, I tell them to learn about it first before buying any. To learn what it is, study its history, it's adoption growth, where it can be adopted, where it is being adopted, what it's limited 21 million coin supply is, and about what the halvings mean to its long term value. How it can and will be used, how they can protect it, etc. I always want them to learn enough about it to understand why HODLing is so important, and that the only thing that matters is that they increase their Bitcoin supply. That's the safest way to win in this game. Without understanding that, then they're a financial danger to themselves if investing in Bitcoin. Not because Bitcoin is a bad investment, but because they'll be a bad investor.",1599149314,97,1

Oracles are a crucial element of DeFi infrastructure. They are the bridge between the siloed world of the blockchain and data from the real world, and so are vital for DeFi to reach its full potential. The integrity of major use cases, including stablecoins and lending platforms, rely on oracles that are fit for purpose.

Current oracle implementations fall short of the ideal. One of the first projects undertaken as part of the Emurgo-Ergo partnership is research into Oracle Pools: a new way of bringing data from the outside world into the blockchain, and making it readily available for any dApp.

**The shortcomings of current implementations**

Oracles already underpin many decentralised applications on Ethereum, and typically work in the following way:

1. A dApp wishes to acquire information from the outside world and makes a request to an oracle by paying into its smart contract (payments are typically made using a dedicated oracle token).
2. The oracle obtains the data and submits it back to the contract that called it via a separate transaction.
3. The information is sent solely to the dApp that requested it, and no one else can use that data without paying.

While this works relatively well, typical oracles can essentially be considered as private services that employ a ‚Äòpay-to-play‚Äô model. As this was clearly insufficient for many use cases, the concept of data feeds was developed in order to improve the user experience for common pricing information.

Current data feeds on Ethereum, however, tend to be implemented in a very trusted manner. They lack a generalized approach that provides assurance about the reliability of the data, both in regards to its accuracy as well as its posting schedule. Furthermore, such approaches tend to have no clear decentralized funding mechanism to make them sustainable over the long term, but instead rely on sponsorship by centralized actors.

Ergo and Emurgo‚Äôs view is that oracles are too important to be restricted in this way. They should be public infrastructure for the DeFi sector. The oracle pools model developed through the partnership addresses this need.

**Oracle pool design**

Ergo‚Äôs UTXO model offers benefits for oracle systems that were not previously available. Pools of oracles act to decentralise the provision of data, ensuring that both the process and the data itself are more reliable.

At their simplest, oracle pools break up time into fixed epochs (e.g. 6 hours), which are subdivided into blocks (e.g. 180 two-minute blocks). The group of oracles within the pool agree on the data sources and each post their data points to the blockchain in their own UTXO.

At the end of an epoch these data points are averaged, after removing outliers, in a final transaction which reads each data point UTXO. This results in the oracle pool producing a new finalized datapoint, and moving forward towards the next epoch.

This is not particularly complicated to understand, but lays a solid foundation. One critical factor to note is that the whole process occurs on-chain. Moreover, the use of UTXOs enables the addition of incentives and governance mechanisms, allowing far greater sophistication and flexibility of oracle pools and data provision than was previously possible.

**Building on the foundation of UTXO-based oracle pools**

As mentioned previously, it is possible to implement incentives and penalties in the pools to help ensure the quality and timeliness of the data they provide. Oracles put up collateral ‚Äì a certain amount of ADA, ERG, etc ‚Äì to participate in a pool. Coins are removed from their balance (‚Äòstake slashing‚Äô) if they fail to do their job properly, e.g. if they fail to collect other oracles‚Äô datapoints, if they submit a wildly inaccurate datapoint (an outlier), or if they do not submit a datapoint in a timely fashion. This ensures that oracles do their job well. The collateral is the blockchain‚Äôs native currency, not a separate token, simplifying matters and improving economic incentives.

The model also enables governance voting to determine key parameters for oracle pools. The governance community can decide variables such as how long the epoch is, how much oracles get paid for posting valid data points, the minimum collateral they require, the number of oracles per pool, and so on. There is a high degree of flexibility, and parameters can be changed based on current needs. New oracles can be invited to a pool, others removed, and so on.

This model incorporates a strict posting schedule (epochs) and governance directly, which projects such as Chainlink do not have. Effectively, oracle pools become mini DAOs that aim to provide the best service and can compete according to the service they provide in a free market, thereby improving the overall quality of data that everyone uses.

**Payment model**

The UTXO model means that results are posted to the blockchain and are available for anyone to use for the cost of a transaction fee. This is not the standard pay-to-play approach: dApps can access data for next to nothing. Furthermore, this access to oracle pool data scales cleanly and at no extra cost even if more complicated protocols are built on top of oracle pools (such as hierarchies, or time-weighted averages).

Oracle pools are paid for by the dApps that use them over time. While everyone can use oracles and everyone who uses them has an incentive to fund them, this costs very little ‚Äì a small percentage of extra fees on a given dApp. It is expected that these oracle pool payments will be implemented in major dApps, therefore ensuring that pools always have the funds they need to function.

It makes most sense that large, flagship applications like stablecoins, wallets, decentralised exchanges, lending protocols, and so on, would pay for key oracle pools ‚Äì in much the same way that key blockchain companies run their own nodes. It‚Äôs part of their operation and part of their Corporate Social Responsibility, to borrow a term from the business world. It‚Äôs how they guarantee access to the data they need, help keep the ecosystem healthy, and show they are serious about staying the distance in the DeFi sector. At the same time, oracle pools are designed so that even small actors can run their own and have a funding mechanism baked in if they find a sufficient user base.

The pools model means the funds paid can be disbursed effectively, within a range of different pool structures. It would be possible to have a pool-of-pools, with several oracle pools aggregating data and those results being pooled and averaged. The payment goes to the top pool, which pays funds out to the next pools down in the hierarchy according to how reliable they are, and those pools distribute funds to the most reliable oracles within them. The main advantage is that it is simple for the user, since only one payment to the top pool is required.

There is also scope for using signed data ‚Äì data from trusted entities like large exchanges. These can submit signed data to ‚Äòfirst-to-post‚Äô pools, where the funds are distributed to the first oracle to record data to the blockchain; because they are trusted, the averaging process is not necessary. Or there can be pools that aggregate partially signed and partially unsigned data, giving the best of both worlds. Signed and unsigned data points can be pooled and brought together into a single datapoint, and payouts can still be made cleanly by paying the top pool.

This is the first implementation to come from the Emurgo-Ergo collaboration: the first steps in building out the UTXO-based DeFi ecosystem. There will be much more to come, and new developments promise to be very exciting.

For further background, watch Emurgo researcher **Robert Kornacki explain oracle pools** 

*The new scheme developed through the Emurgo-Ergo partnership will see oracle pools ‚Äì core blockchain infrastructure ‚Äì run as a public service, accessible by any dApp and developer, free at the point of use.*

Oracles are a crucial element of DeFi infrastructure. They are the bridge between the siloed world of the blockchain and data from the real world, and so are vital for DeFi to reach its full potential. The integrity of major use cases, including stablecoins and lending platforms, rely on oracles that are fit for purpose.

Current oracle implementations fall short of the ideal. One of the first projects undertaken as part of the Emurgo-Ergo partnership is research into Oracle Pools: a new way of bringing data from the outside world into the blockchain, and making it readily available for any dApp.

**The shortcomings of current implementations**

Oracles already underpin many decentralised applications on Ethereum, and typically work in the following way:

1. A dApp wishes to acquire information from the outside world and makes a request to an oracle by paying into its smart contract (payments are typically made using a dedicated oracle token).
2. The oracle obtains the data and submits it back to the contract that called it via a separate transaction.
3. The information is sent solely to the dApp that requested it, and no one else can use that data without paying.

While this works relatively well, typical oracles can essentially be considered as private services that employ a ‚Äòpay-to-play‚Äô model. As this was clearly insufficient for many use cases, the concept of data feeds was developed in order to improve the user experience for common pricing information.

Current data feeds on Ethereum, however, tend to be implemented in a very trusted manner. They lack a generalized approach that provides assurance about the reliability of the data, both in regards to its accuracy as well as its posting schedule. Furthermore, such approaches tend to have no clear decentralized funding mechanism to make them sustainable over the long term, but instead rely on sponsorship by centralized actors.

Ergo and Emurgo‚Äôs view is that oracles are too important to be restricted in this way. They should be public infrastructure for the DeFi sector. The oracle pools model developed through the partnership addresses this need.

**Oracle pool design**

Ergo‚Äôs UTXO model offers benefits for oracle systems that were not previously available. Pools of oracles act to decentralise the provision of data, ensuring that both the process and the data itself are more reliable.

ikt355,anonescrow,Selling My Bitcoin Escrow Service (clearnet),"Sorry if this post doesn't belong here but it is bitcoin related:

I built a website: https://www.anonymousescrow.com

It's based on this code I found on Github: https://github.com/vlad-pro/WebBitcoinEscrow  

Language: HTML and Go

The VPS Server and Domain were both purchased anonymously with bitcoin.  

**Programming Knowledge Required:** Knowing HTML and Go but also it requires a bit of programming knowledge to utilize the blockchain wallet api. You should also be familiar with Linux servers and how to secure them.  

**100% SAFE**:  

The website is anonymous because the admin can't see what is being bought and sold, only the amount of the escrow. The only way to view the terms of the escrow is if the buyer or seller chose to escalate, and even then, hopefully they were smart enough not to include any incriminating info.

There is no login required and all secret links are generated anonymously by the users and can't be accessed by anyone whom they don't share it with.  

I had to work out a lot of bugs in the blockchain api but I've done several security scans and the site is safe. I also have cloudflare configured for DDOS attacks.  

**Possible Upgrades:**  

**-** I upgraded the admin panel so that a refund can be issued to both the buyer and the seller, originally it was only the seller.

\-You could offer an Onion address by simply installing EOTK: https://github.com/alecmuffett/eotk and then configuring NGINX to serve both the clearnet and onion address.  

I'm selling it because it was a bit of a passion project for me, I came across the code and found it interesting, but at the moment (like with most escrow services) I would have to manually resolve escalation disputes and I don't have the time to dedicate 10 hours a day staring at my computer screen, and I don't have the time to dedicate to finding a simpler way of doing it.   

For more info or if you're interested in purchasing contact me:

I have a cellar space thing which is only separated from neighboring spaces with some spaced wood. Someone could easily get in there if he wanted to. The locks are old af so very easy to pick.

I know that I should separate the two parts but I feel weird having my mnemonic down there. I also feel weird having both parts in the same place. In my appartment. Because if someone gets in there (which would be harder but still possible) he could find both parts at once. The third option would be to give out more copies of the mnemonic to other family members and only keep the passphrase at my place but I feel even less comfortable with that.

Should I just keep my mnemonic phrases down in the cellar because I have a copy at my moms anyway? It's already kind of corrupted and not in my hands anymore what is going to happen to that.

You trust the adult executor to not pocket the keys found in the safe deposit box and say they didn't find any keys?
If you get past that hurdle, then the asset would probably be required to be held on behalf of the child until they turn 18, so now someone else is holding the keys for years.
If you did manage for the child to get the keys, do you trust the keys to be safeguarded by a minor child?

**Windsor, ON:** One of the hottest housing markets in Canada, is now accessible using digital currency.  

This is G Inc., sales representative, announced that they are using Umbrel, getumbrel.com (a Bitcoin and Lightning network full node) to facilitate the first Bitcoin ‚Äúfull node‚Äù specific real estate transaction in Canada. 

https://preview.redd.it/0j5nefxelcm51.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b2ec4982e483f48b7162034213c072e42574d22

**View Property:** [**http://thisisg.co/belle-isle-view.html**](http://thisisg.co/belle-isle-view.html)  

The property is located in the most southern part of Canada, minutes away from the Windsor/Detroit boarder crossing, local marinas and surrounded by the great lakes. The region is sought after due to its temperate climate and value driven when compared to other major cities. 

‚ÄúVerifying the transaction on our own Bitcoin node helps us avoid using any 3rd parties‚Äù, says Matthew Guignard, CEO of This is G Inc. ‚ÄúBy using Umbrel, the transaction as well as it‚Äôs confirmations on the Blockchain can be independently verified by us in real-time‚Äù. 

Guignard noted, that encouraging new forms of value exchange will only help society in the long run. ‚ÄúThe goal is to explore repeatable models for asset based transactions using Bitcoin. If we can facilitate real estate transactions, we can surely move to support other industries, such farm-to-table solutions for local farms.‚Äù   

The property is being listed as a private sale, as to remove intermediaries and ensure maximum value. The buyer shall be bound to the value of bitcoin on closing day, mitigating valuation risk. Key members of the Umbrel team shall actively support the transaction as well as a prominent Canadian OTC Bitcoin exchange for any spot currency needs. 

A ‚ÄúFull Node‚Äù is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Each full node keeps its own copy of the Bitcoin blockchain and uses that copy to ensure consensus, while maintaining the strongest privacy available. A full node ensures that the seller has instant notification of the buyer‚Äôs transaction.

1) can i use my ledger seed on the cold card? i know it's not \*quite\* as secure, but due to the way I had managed to store my seed over the years, it would be quite preferable to use this seed. it took a while to get my cold storage security right and it would be a pain in the ass to use a new seed. 

2) i dont quite understand the coldcard encrypted backup. why would i need a backup with an additional 12 words if i already have my seed secured? the seed phrase is the backup... if my coldcard got destroyed, i could simply restore my seed word in a new cold card or on any wallet, yes? 

also - i guess i would like to be reassured that the coldcard is not too difficult to use. i'm not tech-ey per say but i'm pretty capable. i'm technical enough that i used a raspberry pi to build a mynode, got it up and running and seemingly working fine from the dashboard, but can't seem to get it to connect to any lightning wallets, lol...",1599925356,22,1

However, my account has been disabled for deposits on their platform, and I am required to have a verified bank account linked in order to withdraw my funds. They suggested withdrawing by Debit card, but my card provider does not offer what they call ""Instant withdrawal"". The last e-mail I received said I am locked from doing any deposits, whereas I am more than welcome to buy Bitcoins through my Creditcard, what a fucking joke.

They obviously have enough evidence of my bank statements, my drivers license, my passport, and my bank account linking to the same name. My account has 2FA, and the funds are obtained from legitimately selling a website. Their Legal page is not of much help, as it is only for US states, whereas they are operating on European ground. 

Due to their bs. I unfortunately had to drop out of my education as I was required to buy a laptop with high specs, and the funds I had on Coinbase was going towards this.... 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have an idea as for what I can do legally as an European customer on their platform, requesting my fiat funds to be paid.",1600193004,11,1

iv9mkr,BlandTomato,Somebody should make a decentralized Bitcoin futures. You peg out Bitcoin with a timelock to the sidechain. You attach a smart contract on it with futures (gambling) terms.,"So you could say: If Bitcoin price goes under/over xxxxx value, yyyyy payment to (sidechain address or other) will send this particular Bitcoin (utxo) to (buyer's prespecified address) else the Bitcoin utxo reverts back to seller by (expiration date). Until the expiration date, the Bitcoin utxo will not be spendable due to the timelock. 

You could use these contracts like Automatic Cryptocurrency Futures. 

Let's say you buy Bitcoin at $10k with the intention of selling that particular utxo at $15k. You could buy it and sell it (at a chosen gain) in a single transaction. You would just need to wait for the trigger (like if the price hit $15,000). 

Nobody would program for a loss, like what panic selling creates. This would be built in holding. 

Just a thought. I guess you don't need a new sidechain. I'm not sure. That's why I came here to ask the Bitcoin community. Does this already exist or could it be a possible innovation?

I know exchanges are already doing basically this. Is there a way to add this directly into Bitcoin and possibly cut out the exchanges?",1600447357,9,2

Now big nodes can create big channels to easly consume their excess of inbound liquidity against routing fees of swapping payments. This will reduce a lot the routing fees to loop out and I expect the inbound liquidity to be more distributed in the network, great news !

iu19qf,tom98239273,"Marco Polo Describes Chinese Fiat Currency in the 13th century in his book ""The Travels"" (China was the first country to use fiat)","It is in this city of Khan-balik that the Great Khan has his mint; and it is so organized that you might well say that he has mastered the art of alchemy. I will demonstrate this to you here and now. You must know that he has money made for him by the following process, out of the bark of trees-to be precise, from mulberry trees (the same whose leaves furnish food for silkworms). The fine bast between the bark and the wood of the tree is stripped off. Then it is crumbled and pounded and flattened out with the aid of glue into sheets like sheets of cotton paper, which are all black. When made, they are cut up into rectangles of various sizes, longer than they are broad .... And all these papers are sealed with the seal of the Great Khan. 

The procedure of issue is as formal and as authoritative as if they were made of pure gold or silver. On each piece of money several specially appointed officials write other names, each setting his own stamp. When it is completed in due form, the chief of the officials deputed by the Khan dips in cinnabar the seal or bull assigned to him and stamps it on the top of the piece of money so that the shape of the seal in vermilion remains impressed upon it. And then the money is authentic. And if anyone were to forge it, he would suffer the extreme penalty. Of this money the Khan has such a quantity made that with it he could buy all the treasure in the world. 

With this currency he orders all payments to be made throughout every province and kingdom and region of his empire. And no one dares refuse it on pain of losing his life. And I assure you that all the peoples and populations who are subject to his rule are perfectly willing to accept these pa-pers in payment, since wherever they go they pay in the same currency, whether for goods or for pearls or precious stones or gold or silver. With these pieces of paper they can buy anything and pay for anything.

Several times a year parties of traders arrive with pearls and precious stones and gold and silver and other valuables, such as cloth of gold and silk, and surrender them all to the Great Khan. The Khan then summons twelve experts, who are chosen for the task and have special knowledge of it, and bids them examine the wares that the traders have brought and pay for them what they judge to be their true value. 

The twelve experts duly examine the wares and pay the value in the paper currency of which I have spoken. The traders accept it willingly, because they can spend it afterwards on the various goods they buy throughout the Great Khan's dominions .... Let me tell you further that several times a year a fiat goes forth through the towns that all those who have gems and pearls and gold and silver must bring them to the Great Khan's mint. This they do, and in such abundance that it is past all reckoning; and they are all paid in paper money. 

By this means the Great Khan acquires all the gold and silver and pearls and precious stones of all his territories. And all the Khan's armies are paid with this sort of money. I have now told you how it comes about that the Great Khan must have, as indeed he has, more treasure than anyone else in the world. I may go further and affirm that all the world's great potentates put together have not such riches as belong to the Great Khan alone.",1600280521,3,1

The coin control feature gives advanced users more granular control over their wallets. It enables them to change how and which coins are selected when making transactions. This increases their ability to manage their privacy and the network fees they will have to pay to spend their account balance.

[More control over your coins](https://preview.redd.it/8wemh7rkhjn51.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fed94aab76867601460e3388d25a02d55cbe8b0f)

## How does it work?

The account balance for Bitcoin and its derivatives consists of all the unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) in the account. You can think of UTXOs as the coins in a regular wallet. When you receive money, you collect coins in your wallet. Then, when you want to make a payment, you get to choose which coins you pick from your wallet. Do you pick the largest coins first? Or do you want to spend all the smaller value coins to lighten up your wallet? Similar considerations can be made when creating a Bitcoin or Bitcoin derivative (altcoin) transaction.

Before the Coin Control feature was released, all transactions involving Bitcoin (and altcoins) automatically selected their coins using the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) algorithm. This strategy includes the oldest coin in the account, and when the amount is not sufficient the second-oldest coin is added, and so forth.

As of Ledger Live version 2.11.1, users are able to make use of a dedicated Coin Control tool to choose the coin selection strategy and the coins that may be spent.

## Using Coin control in Ledger Live

[Coin control is available in Advanced options in the Send flow](https://preview.redd.it/l725x6qwejn51.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8eb8adaca4bed2acf0c35678f2aa26feae790fc)

1. Click on **Send**, choose an account to debit, and enter a recipient address. Click on **Continue**.
2. Enter an amount and click on **Advanced options**. You will then see:  
\- The currently selected, default coin selection strategy: Oldest coins first (FIFO).  
\- A toggle to enable Replace-By-Fee (RBF).  
\- A toggle to include coins from unconfirmed, replaceable transactions.
3. Click on **Coin control.** The coin control modal opens.
4. Select a **Coin selection strategy** from the dropdown menu:  
\- **Oldest coins first** (FIFO). This is the default strategy that spends the oldest coins first.  
\- **Minimize fees** (optimize size). This strategy tries to minimize the byte size of the transaction by spending the lowest number of UTXOs. This results in a low network fee.  
\- **Minimize future fees** (merge coins), This strategy includes the maximum number of inputs so that a potential future price rise does not make smaller UTXOs economically unspendable. If the price of a crypto asset increases too much, small UTXOs may become worth less than the cost of the network fees to spend them.
5. Select which coins may not be included in the selection by unticking their checkbox. The **SELECTED** indicator shows which coins will be included in the transaction. By changing the selection strategy and/or coins to include, the user has precise control over which coins end up being spent. The **Coins to spend** and **Change to return** indicators show how much is spent from and returned to the account.
6. Click on **Done** to return to the **Send** flow to verify and send the transaction.

[The coin control window lets you select the strategy as well as pick the coins. Coins marked SELECTED will be included in the transaction.](https://preview.redd.it/cixyoge1fjn51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffdc34db07c0941a8db7ac712631e226773cba67)

## Coin status

**The following statuses can be displayed for a coin:**

* Coins received in a transaction with 0 confirmations **without** RBF enabled: **PENDING**
* Coins received in a transaction with 0 confirmations **with** RBF enabled: **REPLACEABLE**
* Coins received in a transaction with 1337 confirmations:  **1337 CONFIRMATIONS**

By enabling the toggle *Include coins from unconfirmed, replaceable transactions*, replaceable transactions can be selected in the Coin control screen.

## The Privacy use case

One of the main use cases for Coin control is to protect one‚Äôs privacy. UTXOs are, unfortunately, not perfectly fungible due to their unique history on the blockchain. Therefore, users may want to spend coins from different sources without mixing them together, because this would indicate to an outside observer of the blockchain that these addresses belong to the same account. For instance, if one were to spend coins bought on a KYC exchange, which are associated with the user‚Äôs identity, together with coins bought anonymously using cash, the anonymous coins could be linked to the user‚Äôs identity.

Another example would be that you would like to prevent spending a high-value coin for smaller purchases because this would unnecessarily show the person you‚Äôre paying how much you have. This is similar to not showing the *boulanger* how much is on your bank account when buying a *baguette*.

## Let us know what you think!

We are excited to release this new feature because we think it will fulfill real needs of an important part of our users. This version of Ledger Live marks an important milestone, but we will continue working on more features that our community wants. 

So, we invite you to try out Coin control in [Ledger Live](https://ledger.com/ledger-live) and let us know what you think! All feedback is welcome on this thread, on r/ledgerwallet, and you can send suggestions or get help through our [official contact form](https://support.ledger.com/hc/requests/new).

We'd like to close out by underlining our commitment to the Bitcoin community, and our willingness to build the best wallet ecosystem for newbies as well as for power users.",1600275454,12,1

ity27q,VindowViper11,Bank of Kraken,"
We are thrilled to announce that the State of Wyoming has approved Kraken‚Äôs application to form the world‚Äôs first Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI), and has granted a charter to Wyoming's newest state-chartered bank, tentatively called ""Kraken Financial.""

Headquartered in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Kraken Financial will enable Kraken clients in the U.S. to bank seamlessly between digital assets and national currencies.

From paying bills and receiving salaries in cryptocurrency to incorporating digital assets into investment and trading portfolios, Kraken Financial will be the first regulated, U.S. bank to provide comprehensive deposit-taking, custody and fiduciary services for digital assets. This new institution will be regulated in largely the same manner as other U.S. banks.

Our offerings will evolve over time, but we plan to provide clients with everything they expect from a seamless banking gateway between digital assets and national currencies.

During its first year of operations, the SPDI plans to give clients the ability to deposit USD and custody digital assets at a regulated state-chartered bank. These banking services will be seamlessly integrated into the existing exchange services, providing clients better funding infrastructure, a better experience and enhanced regulatory clarity.

Additionally, because of our position as a bridge between crypto and traditional finance, we will offer the following crypto-focused services in our first year of operations:

Digital asset custody
Demand/deposit accounts (DDAs)
Wire transfer and funding services.

We anticipate supporting additional services over the next few years, including: 

Enhanced digital asset custody offerings
Digital asset staking
Trust account and administration

Other services for individual accounts:

A complete online and mobile banking suite of products
A debit card that clients can use to spend their crypto funds

Other services for corporate clients:

Account management services 
Bank comfort letters
Deposit verifications
Proof of funds attestations

Finally, we expect to be able to offer additional retail, wealth management and treasury services (and potentially other asset classes such as securities), so stay tuned!

For more information on all the ways our new license will improve the client experience, visit the Kraken blog for a full FAQ. 

Thank you for choosing Kraken, the trusted and secure digital asset exchange.

ixisjl,GoldSilver-Analyst,Bitcoin could plunge if the correlation with the S&amp;P 500 still intact," As we are publishing this report Gold is trading at $1900, Silver at $24 per ounce however the digital gold(bitcoin) is hovering around $10400.we have seen a massive sell-off in equities, the precious metal sector and in the crypto assets, last night as renewed economic turmoil and geopolitical uncertainty has created massive panic in the market. The previous fiscal stimulus and the zero percent fed funds rate has been the backbone for the fake rally which we have seen in the equities (excluding tech individual stocks like zoom and amazon) however now as the expectation of new fiscal stimulus is pretty much nil it‚Äôs not surprising to see the plunge in the market. The falling expectations of new stimulus measures, growing uncertainty surrounding the U.S. elections is adding some more pressure to equity markets. The equity market and the economy are not synchronized at the moment however this wouldn‚Äôt last long and as the threat of a second wave of lockdown measures is weighing on economic growth we expect a severe decline in the equity markets. In recent months, the cryptocurrency has been increasingly correlated with the S&amp;P 500, if the correlation remains intact we could see bitcoin prices to plunge as well along with the more significant decline in the altcoins. we have decided to sell our 40% of the crypto portfolio and convert it into Tether(USDT). we would start reallocating on selected altcoins based on our strategies as they would provide immense upside potential in case bitcoin reaches our downside target. It‚Äôs also worth noting that in this kind of environment cash is king and investors prefer it over precious metals. we believe the downside risk in gold is limited while the upside is enormous. we would also recommend investors and traders to focus on silver as it would provide more gains compared to gold in the medium and long term. We do understand that the COVID-19 epidemic will end at some point however the economic damage and tremendous loss of lives accompanied by the virus would continue to impact the economy for years if not decades to come. The possibility of the second wave of the virus is also imposing a serious threat for the world economy which could end up increasing the longer-term economic damage from the virus. The uncertainty driven by the pandemic, the influence of COVID-19 on global markets, and the global expansion of central-bank balance sheets will ultimately be very positive for gold.",1600759419,0,1

One thing COVID did was scare the hell out of older workers and investors who are rushing for scheduled retirement and in some cases, early retirement. (It‚Äôs one thing we know for sure). 

As this happens relatively quickly (people tend to move quick when they feel their lives are at risk), Bitcoin which has been the choice of millennials for years now, should see growth and adoption outpacing gold.

I read somewhere that a script descriptor can contain a private key, which makes me nervous that I will accidentally offload a private key in the descriptor from cold storage.

Can script descriptors store the private key?

Does Bitcoin core create script descriptors that store the private key?

If so, what steps do you take to create such a script descriptor (so that I don't do that.)",1601057762,1,1

Abra is paying 10% interest on money that you deposit into a number of stable coins, including TUSD. Is this safe? I know that Abra has been around for a while, but it seems like a lot of interest so it‚Äôs just natural to wonder how safe it is and weather or not I can trust them to keep paying this. And how can they pay so much interest when banks can‚Äôt even pay one percent?",1601055678,8,1

You may remember me from such posts as ‚ÄúIf I gave you $50k, would you buy BTC with all of it? Some of it? Etc.,‚Äù 

I am now returning to take the temperature on the room as to whether the cost of BTC will jump around wildly on or around Election Night? Will it plummet if Joe Biden is elected? What, with the limited prediction capabilities we have, do you think will occur? Speculation welcome! 

Thank you and looking forward to your responses!
