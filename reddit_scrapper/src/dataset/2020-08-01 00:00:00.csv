The other day I see price has risen to over 12k and go to sleep contemplating if I can time this right, I can dump and buy when it drops as it always seems to do.

I wake up and its just over 11k. I sell all I have and figure, I rebuy when it falls a couple grand as it usually does after a big climb.

So it doesn't fall, it goes back up again.

Now I'm sitting here watching it hold pretty steady and I am hoping it falls enough I can buy it all back with a modest profit giving me more coin than I had previously.

Watch it for 2 days and it just won't fall below what I sold for.

Decided I was an idiot for not just leaving it all there originally as I have always done before  and just bought everything back but lost a little in the process.

In the big picture, it was a minor loss but I realized as much as I've watched it over the years, I still have no idea what it is going to do next.

A relatively cheap lesson, but I learned I can in no way predict what is going to happen accurately.

Moral of the story is just HODL.",1596472737,208,1

A  few years ago - once I first learned about Bitcoin actually - I started wondering to myself 'what really IS money?'.  Researching that question has taken me down a fascinating rabbit hole. I have since spent the last three years researching money, the history of money, and different monetary systems.

It turns out that how a system of  money is designed affects our lives in more ways than we realize (although many Bitcoiner's realize it..).  Questioning Money is an audio newsletter created to explore this. Issues will be  short (\~5 mins each) and focused, covering one issue a week.

Apologies for the self promo but I think what this newsletter will cover would appeal to the people here.

First two issues are up now. QM001 is an intro do why I am doing  this   newsletter and QM002 gets started talking about what money is and  how   it  works.

QM001 is 4.5 minutes long and QM002 is 6.5 mins.

i2wah6,SharonRobles,We compiled a database of 11k+ investors to help you raise your seed round 🤑,"For the last 4-5 years I've been working on products that require angel &amp; VC to grow. To reach out to investors en masse I manually built out email lists of up to a few hundred investors (that I met in person, had connections with, or were just completely cold).

This strategy––aside from a handful of investor connections that didn't really go anywhere––was the only real way we could run investor outreach in the short run. This helped us set up meetings with people we had no relationships with, but obviously manually building these lists was a nightmare––one list would take \*days\*.

My friend and I decided to scale this up and automate it. We built some scrapers and compiled a list of 11k+ angels &amp; VCs, complete with emails, phone numbers, past investments, and tags representing what they're likely to invest in next.

This was really useful for us (saving us hundreds of hours of research on AngelList, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, etc.), so we decided to launch this as an independent product called [Fundmystartups](https://fundmystartups.com/).

The Bitcoin price had a strong rally last week. It went from $9,700 to $11,400 within 2 days. It then traded within a range for a few days before breaking the resistance and reaching as high as $12,097, which was up 23% for the week. The BTC price dipped to $10,548 due to profit taking and settled in a range. The current support is at $10,700.

The Bitcoin price is expected to trade within a range in the short term. **If the buyers are holding on to their positions and more buyers are coming in, the market may test the $12,000 resistance again this week.**

*Disclaimer: The above market commentary is based on technical analysis using historical pricing data, and is for reference only. It does not serve as investment or trading advice.*

**Review of the week:**

Falling interest rates are tempting some Americans to forgo safety and pour their savings into assets such as stocks and bitcoin, a recently report from Bloomberg writes, a young American was planning to convert his high-yield savings (risk-free 2%) at Ally Bank into bitcoin. He thinks the future is one of long-term economic stagnation and low rates. With the background that nationwide lockdowns enacted to slow the spread of Covid-19 have cut consumer spending, and stimulus checks arrived for millions of Americans, people came to one thought that now isn’t a great time to hold onto money or cash. Pandemic is testing confidence in US currency and dollar sinks to two-year low in July.

He told me that he owns 1 whole bitcoin which surprised me and I thought was amazing. But, then her mom asked why people buy them. So, we tried to explain to her that it’s a way for people to take control of their money, and to avoid inflation because there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin. Once they’re all mined, then no more will be added to circulation. She immediately asked “How do you know that? How do you know for 100% certain that more wont be added after those 21 million? Isn’t there some kind of ‘managing group’ that controls what happens and could potentially decide to add more?” (She’s an American businesswoman) Now, I’m not an expert but I’m also not new to bitcoin. I know that there won’t be more than 21 million bitcoins, and that they will all be mined by around 2028. I know Satoshi Nakamoto didn’t start bitcoin to make money and that its much much more than just an investment or a currency it’s a revolution. It’s a way to take the power away from the system that oppresses us. I know this, but I also don’t know how to explain to her in a way that she’d be able to understand that there’s no “managing group” that’s going to add more bitcoin to make more money after the 21 million are mined. How do I show her proof of this?",1596434637,64,1

i2qkdc,WillWam,Will Bitcoin even be a viable payment solution in 10 years?,"The complete lack of scalability on Bitcoin's part doesn't surprise me that much. In its early days, transactions were fast, cheap, and you could mine with a GPU or two to make some bank.

But now, HUGE warehouses and corporate entities are fighting tooth and nail to get every little fraction of a Bitcoin they can. Huge greenhouse gas emissions, INSANELY expensive fees (especially the other day when the price hit the 11 thousands for the first time. The recommended fee for a fast transaction was 30,000 sats per byte!!), and slow processing times.

Why is no one talking about this?! We can't seriously consider Bitcoin for anything other than investing property 10 years from now. It'll just be another commodity.

Sure, people will say the Lightning network will fix everything. And actually, it partially does. I enjoy using the Lightning network to make quick and simple transactions between myself and another party. My issue with it, is that there are still node fees!

Of course, the Bitcoin blockchain is a good 260-70 gigabytes at the time of writing, so it would make sensr to charge a small fee for routing Lightning channels. This is a network fault. 

Which leads me to ask a question.

Would it be possible to change the fundamentals of the codebase to convert Bitcoin to have a sort of block lattice technology like NANO? To have reps to set up to process transactions instantly without fees (like NANO)?

I bought btc using an ATM and it didn't have any ID verification. Now I would like to put the btc in an exchange and transfer them to fiat via a bank transfer. I am not in USA, and in my country the taxes are 10% on gains. Has anybody managed to prove only though blockchain, did it work?

Would it work in my situation?

Somebody also told me that I wouldn't have to pay taxes at all since it isn't known about the source. But that wouldn't make sense, I am assuming that person was incorrect. Right? If I have no proof, they won't take 10% on gains but 10% on the whole transfer.

i4wx75,nick-bravo,Question about creating 'fake'-transactions and about making changes to the Bitcoin protocol,"If a miner, who added fake transactions to his/her block, finds the right nonce and broadcasts it, full nodes reject it because it doesn't match their version of the blockchain. It is therefore not added to the blockchain and the remaining miners keep working on the block.

For a miner to add fake transactions to the blockchain, his/her block has to be accepted by more than 50% of full nodes (right?).  Each full node has equal voting power, regardless whether it is run on a laptop or on a super computer. Therefore, couldn't someone run a bunch of full nodes until he/she controls more than 50% of all full nodes, thereby enabling him/her to add 'fake' transactions?

So far, I thought that basically any change could be made to Bitcoin (protocol change or fake transactions) as long as more than 50% of all full nodes agree on it. After all, protocol changes are, just like fake transactions, implemented simply by changing the last block.

Apparently though, the following criteria have to be met to make protocol changes:

* Follows the correct format as specified by BIP-1
* Includes code implementations of the proposed changes to the protocol
* Has **95% support from the last 2,016 miners** (\~14 days worth of mining with 10 min blocks)

Since they are both just changes to the last block, I wonder how it comes about that for one, you need &gt;50% consensus, while for the other, you need a &gt;=95% consensus.",1596737541,8,1

2. 2022  ~90% of all bitcoin have been mined.
3. 2025  ~95% of all bitcoin have been mined.
4. 2030  ~98% of all bitcoin have been mined.
5. 2034  ~99% of all bitcoin have been mined.

From the year 2034 to 2140 (106 years), the remaining 1% of all bitcoin that will ever exist will be mined.

We come into contact with Aliens. The aliens are far wealthier than humans and have a far larger trading network spanning multiple galaxies.

Because of Aliencoin's longer life and the aliens’ greater prosperity, there is more value stored in Aliencoin than is stored in Bitcoin.

Also because of their prosperity and superior trade network, when we make peaceful contact with them, the aliens realize that they only want to trade with us for some natural resources on our planet (which are scarce elsewhere in the universe).

I recently made an account on Cex.io because I met someone who said he'd like to be my sugar daddy, but he only did transactions in bitcoin. I was very hesitant at first because I don't know anything about cryptocurrency but he offered to send me around $4000 in bitcoin upfront. I didn't really know what I was getting into and I thought it would be simple. 

To get payment, the app keeps telling me I need to put money in and when he goes to send me the money he keeps saying that the app\company (RChain Cooperative) wants more transactions from me. I've put about well over a thousand into the app and I don't know what to do. He sends me screenshots and messages that he receives from the app about the transaction and I don't know what to do. He assures I will get all of the money back together but I don't understand why I have to keep putting hundreds and hundreds of dollars just to withdraw the amount he sent me.

Even now, it says to recive the money he's trying to send to me I need to put in another $300 and I'm at my last straw because I can't keep just putting in money without receiving anything, as he assures me each time after I put in money it will be finished but it has not ended. Am I somehow getting scammed? Is there a way to get my money back? I did this in the first place to help pay my bills but it feels like I'm just digging myself deeper into a hole.

i6njk0,pinellaspete,Bitcoin Full Node: I repurposed some gaming computer parts and built a full node. (With Pics.),"I've been buying some Bitcoin lately and was interested in building a full node so I repurposed some old gaming computer parts that I had lying around.

Here's the computer specifications and costs of new parts:

* \*\*Intel i5-6500k CPU-\*\*  A 4 core CPU that was a good gaming CPU back in its day. (Repurposed)
* \*\* Zalman CNPS9900MAX-B CPU Cooler - \*\*  Cooler that was on the CPU/Motherboard when it was used for gaming. (Repurposed)
* \*\*MSI Z170A Gaming M5 Motherboard -\*\* A good gaming and overclocking motherboard. (Repurposed)
* \*\*16GB G Skill 2400MHz RAM -\*\* Great RAM for gaming and very fast at the time. (Repurposed)
* \*\*XFX 550w Power Supply (Gold) -\*\* Rock solid power supply. (Repurposed.)
* \*\*Phanteks Eclipse 300A Computer Case -\*\* Good quality case. $59.99 @ Amazon
* \*\*Sandisk SSD Plus 1TB Internal SSD -\*\* Good quality SSD with room to grow with the Bitcoin network. $99.99 @ Amazon
* \*\*TP-Link WiFi 6 AX3000 PCIe WiFi Card -\*\* Screaming fast WiFi. $39.99 @ Amazon
* \*\*Windows 10 OS Key -\*\* Couldn't find the original key that went with the motherboard. $34.99 @ Kinguin.net

&amp;#x200B;

Cost of new parts for this computer:  $235.00 USD

&amp;#x200B;

My observations:

&amp;#x200B;

This computer is way overkill for a Bitcoin Full Node but works really great! I was unsure of what was really required for a computer to run a full node but after having this computer up and running for a few days I have a much better understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

It hardly uses the CPU at all. I think that this is why you can run a full node on a Raspberry PI. The CPU on this computer typically runs at less than 5% utilization and more like 2%. It is basically sitting at idle all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I upped the data cache memory available in the Bitcoin GUI (Don't really know if this works or not?) to 5000 MB. The most RAM that I have used in several days of running has been less than 4 GB. (4000 MB)

&amp;#x200B;

Once you get it up and running you need to open port 8333 on your router or it won't allow other computers to connect to you. Once you have port 8333 open, 20 computers will be able to connect to you and you will be able to connect to 10. There is very little documentation in how to do this (No step by step.) because all routers are slightly different and use slightly different terminology. It is not really that difficult. What you really want to do is called ""port forwarding"" and you want to find those settings in your router and port forward port 8333 in both directions. (Hope that made some sense. I'm not very good with networks!)

&amp;#x200B;

My WiFi network and the connection to this computer is fast. I pay for 400 Mbps down and 20 Mbps up and I have a WiFi 6 router and a WiFi 6 adapter card in this computer. Speedtest says that this computer is connected at 380 Mbps down and 20 Mbps up. I'm about 40 feet away from the router.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bitcoin Full Node is always transferring data on the network. It seems to be in small packets/batches but it is always sending or receiving or both. It doesn't use much bandwidth at one time so shouldn't cause lag on your network. In my case it typically stays under 500 Kbps but will on occasion spike briefly to 2000 Kbps (2 Mbps).

&amp;#x200B;

I was very curious as to how much electricity this computer would use so that I could determine if I could afford to leave it on 24/7 or not. I plugged the computer into a watt meter that you can see in the pics. The computer swings between 32 and 35 watts while up and running on the Bitcoin network. This is like idle speed for this computer IMHO. 35 watts running 24 hours = 840 watt hours  840 watt hours X 30 days = 25200 watt hours or 25.2 Kwhs (Kilowatt hours is how you are charged by your utility) My utility charges $.12 per kilowatt hour so...  25.2 Kwh X  $.12 = $3.03 USD per month. I hope I can afford that!

yesterday i shared a post about Bitfinex freezing my assets and withdrawals on my account since JUL 5.  i have since receive hate messages towards me or the exchange. i might have use the wrong choice of words. 

Please note that It’s not my intention to spoil the reputation of bitfinex. my objective here is to share the problem i am facing and create awareness of my case, as it is taking too damn long to solve. so if anyone who have faced the same problem as me, please let me know. 

I do understand from a high ranking bitfinex staff that it’s because I reset my 2fa and they don’t want to be liable in law if it was a hack. To solve this problem, i am even willing to do a video call to verify my identity. 

i'll post updates here again when there is progress and hopefully i can get this done and over with soon.

i6eqe8,gloomy_chibi,"Selling BTC ""to"" or ""via"" Coinbase?"," Hello, I'm new to crypto trading and I have a few questions regarding selling options of bitcoin in coinbase.

Starting, I assume limit/stop orders are made between people, when they agree on a specific price, despite the live price of the currency (which may take time until you find one another)?! Or are they also made between you and coinbase, if and when the price of the cryptocoin reaches your desired one?  
(Eg, P1 wants to get rid of 1 btc asap for liquidity due to x reason, so he puts price a little bit lower than live price, let's say 10k$. P2 of course finds this burgain on the listing orders of other people, and buys it. So P1 gets 10k$ - minus 5% fee. \[?!\]  
Same with buying, eg I'm expecting BTC to drop at 9k$, so I list my order to ""limit buy"", and wait until it drops and someone \[or coinbase if live price goes to 9k$?!\] sells me 1 BTC for 9k$ \[?!\] )

I was also wondering, by selling through ""market"" option, am I selling instantly to coinbase at the exact live price of the cryptocoin being sold (minus 5%)?

Looking forward to clearing this out!",1596954331,11,1

I’m working with an institutional-class registered investment advisory that is currently shopping for established and reputable financial services companies which currently provide custody and/or sub-custody for digital assets like bitcoin.

(Custody means that a firm can hold digital assets for their own retail investors, sub-custody means that they can hold digital assets on behalf of other financial services institutions. Some firms, like Kingdom’s Trust, can do both (i.e. they hold digital assets for their own company but also can hold assets on behalf of Fidelity’s customers who will see them in their Fidelity account).

I bought this book because I was told it's the most bare bones explanation of bitcoin but chapter 2 left me with 2 questions and no answers. 

I even reached out to the authors and only one of them replied but his answer wasn't convincing. 

So the authors are discussing ""natural vs artificial scarcity"" and they are in favour of natural scarcity or as they refer to it ""decentralized scarcity."" 

But this is where my confusion arises and they don't explain this either. 

 • How is bitcoin considered ""naturally"" scarce if it exists in an artificial world ie the digital realm?

i8bd4u,36rnt,Philosophical Question regarding Recovery Phrase,"Hi guys,

After the Ledger breach from a few weeks ago I decided to switch my Ledger Blue to a Trezor Model T and transferred all my BTC to my new Trezor. Even though I know that my BTC was safe on my Ledger, I kind of felt anxious about the breach (If they can't even handle this, what else could be potentially breached?).

With my new Trezor I decided to get a Cryptosteel to backup my recovery seed. When initiating the Trezor and writing down my Recovery Phrase, I noticed that some of the words were the same as my Ledger's phrase. E.g. Simple words like ""ice"" or ""feed"" (not in my phrase, don't worry).

If I lose my Trezor or Ledger, I could simply purchase a new one, enter my backup phrase and I'm back in business, which is awesome.

Now here's my question, which I've been asking myself for years now: If the words are so easy, Isn't there a teeny tiny chance that if I enter 12 commonly used words for recovery seeds, I could access someone else's wallet? And isn't it possible to do it via brute-force? Isn't this a security flaw?",1597228323,44,1

ic8cji,eleanorcwhite,Ergo’s Vision for DeFi: Ergo vs CBDC,"*As blockchain technology gains traction, central bank digital currencies are among the most significant applications being developed. But these will inevitably fall far short of the ideal, for one simple reason: control. In particular, that has implications for composability and privacy, and much else besides.*

Central bank digital currencies are no longer a theoretical application of blockchain technology. The list of countries developing CBDCs is growing rapidly, with several now trialing state-backed digital cash.

CDBCs are not built on classic, open blockchain technology. While there are various approaches, they are all based on permissioned ledgers that restrict the role of securing the network and processing transactions to a group of approved entities. They also include a control layer that gives administrators the ability to intervene in transactions, blocking or reversing those they deem invalid.

It’s a far cry from the ideals of Bitcoin, and the Ergo platform that aims to build on these. But it’s only to be expected. The state has a role and a remit, and it’s unlikely to give up the control it exercises. Unfortunately, though, there are two ways that holding onto control will mean that CBDCs fall far short of what they could be, meaning they may ultimately cede ground to open platforms like Ergo.

**Composability**

As we wrote in a recent blog, composability is a core feature of DeFi. It’s what gives applications network effect, instantly adding value by plugging into existing dapps’ user bases and functionality.

Programmable money is a huge development. The current system is clunky and complicated to use, at best. It’s not possible to attach detailed conditions to transactions, and have them interact seamlessly with software, as can be done with blockchain and smart contracts.

Imagine the value that could be unlocked if CBDCs were programmable, and smart cash could be integrated frictionlessly into new applications – banking interfaces, investment services, stores, social networks, games. The list is endless. But this is hardly likely. The freedom to program money will exist, for many years at least, in the open blockchain space alone.

**Privacy**

Secondly, we consider privacy to be a core requirement of DeFi. Money is too important to be used as a tool of surveillance, but there is no question that this is what it will become as soon as the first CBDCs are rolled out to a large user base.

China is one of the furthest ahead in its creation of state-backed digital cash. This is a state that is notorious for its internet censorship and online surveillance of its population. Its human rights record is dire, and in recent days we have learned more about its oppression of the Uighur minority. Moreover, China already uses a social credit system, which grants or denies citizens access to certain services and amenities depending on their social score, with model citizens enjoying greater privileges.

There is, again, no question that a state-backed, traceable CBDC will be used as a tool of surveillance on a scale that is unprecedented in human history. And it will be the same across any nation that implements money within the same framework.

That giant eye on the dollar bill? You ain’t seen nothing yet.

**Private, programmable financial services**

Ergo has a very different vision for blockchain-based cash and financial services. In the new paradigm of blockchain, value is not retained by constraining it. It is only maximised through open systems that make it as accessible as people want it to be. Money without borders, in both senses: cash that can be programmed, sent and received freely but privately, between any two individuals or organisations – and even blockchains – anywhere in the world.

This is what money needs to be, and what Ergo is building.",1597780430,1,1

The fed could allow interest rates to rise in order to prevent a dollar collapse. They seem unwilling to go down this route, possibly because the US government would have to default on its treasury bonds and other obligations (SS, Medicare, pensions, etc). So the fed keeps printing, and eventually inflation spirals out of control.

Authorities recently took three men into custody following their alleged swindling of $226,000 in Hong Kong dollars from #Bitcoin (BTC) ATMs in the territory.
 
The apprehended male trio, ranging from age 26 to age 55, allegedly exploited six different Bitcoin ATM machines, manipulating them to cough up the Hong Kong dollar equivalent of roughly $30,000 U.S. dollars, an article from the South China Morning Post detailed on Aug. 15. The alleged robbers took the cash out across 11 transactions.
 
Authorities think the three males in question reportedly make up part of a larger criminal operation, the South China Morning Post article said.
 
Two crypto exchanges tipped authorities off to the nefarious activity prior to the arrests. Wilson Tam, superintendent of Hong Kong's cyber security and technology crime bureau, did not divulge the exact thievery methods used, although the bureau did provide the two affected ATM businesses with tips on increased security measures.
 
""It is the first time we came across fraud linked to bitcoin ATMs,"" Tam said, as reported by the South China Morning Post.

Did any of you have this thought at some point?

It being a fact that Bitcoin is pseudonymus, one must assume that such a payment system would be ""the Mans"" (the Government for you non americans) wet dream. 

Obviously if the government just came out and said; ""Here you go friends, the brand new digital USD that we can trace and track any transaction we please, have fun with it."", nobody would be willing to use it. At least nobody with a brain. This is the criticism levied against Facebook and the Zuckerbucks. 

So if I was the man and wanted such a system, the most logical way would seem to create Bitcoin. This would act as a proof of concept and make the people most likely to oppose my plan into my most loyal base and prophets for my new digital world.

iaep7w,iAmaHoboSend1Bitcoin,Why so many people shitting on Gold?,"Gotta be honest... and im expecting downvotes. What is with you all talking down on an element that is quite rare and nice to physically hold? When i had bitcoin, i was always checking the price and looking online and feeling like the governments could just turn off the main exchanges or trying to trade a dude on the street for weed. When i have a tiny tiny amount of gold i just touch and gold and feel something special and true ownership. Now i get that bitcoin has a limited amount and some guy has a few million of them but at some point... if people were purchasing gold with bitcoin, wouldn't the price of each go hand-in-hand? Sorry for my uneducated homeless ass but im a bit confused at the top posts (that i see) being about the gold and superior bitcoin relationship. Is it because the gold people were shitting on bitcoin early on? I like em both but dont have much of either. I think we can agree on one thing... fuck the USD",1597522957,43,1

iadabo,ejMileman,Why not an asset backed currency instead of Bitcoin?,"I get the idea of taking currency printing presses away from corrupt governments. Cant wait for it to happen.  I also see the point of blockchain to avoid fraud, but Bitcoin and others are not palpable so they won't be accepted. BTC has been around since 2008.  If Brexit and Covid didn't create adoption, nothing will.  Sorry guys, 12 years in, even with Jack Dorsey carrying the torch, it aint happening.

Why not just create a trade-able currency based on a mammoth ETF of all market value?  

Why not create an ETF that is a market value weighted index of the largest 100 ETFs in the world?  Then, it would include stocks, bonds, money markets, REITs, sector funds, etc.  It would  be more stable than any one fund, but it would fluctuate with market value of the world markets. And it would be backed up by the assets of those world markets. And if some of those ETFs were assets in China or Brazil, so would the currency valuation.

ETFs are easy to create and have a fund administrator oversee it.  Foreside funds manages ARKK funds and others.  Fractional shares are easy to trade on Robin Hood and other sites. So if the fund shares were initially worth $100 you could pull out your Cashapp card and buy a $2 cup of coffee with a 2% fractional share from your account.   

Isn't this a far easier to understand and easier to execute method of removing currency from govt? what am I missing?",1597518245,41,1
iad9ji,RalphAnderson_,Interesting,"Warren Buffett Buying Gold May Push Bitcoin to $50K, Investors Say
 
Berkshire Hathaway, the $503 billion conglomerate led by #WarrenBuffett, sold Goldman Sachs for a Canadian gold company Barrick Gold. Max Keiser, the founder of Heisenberg Capital and an early #Bitcoin investor, says it could help buoy #BTC to $50,000.
 
The quarterly shareholder filing of Berkshire Hathaway shows Buffett trimmed his position on most major banks, Fortune reported on Aug. 15. The firm sold a substantially large portion of its shares in JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and PNG.
 
What Buffett’s decision to enter a gold position over banks shows about Bitcoin
Buffett’s decision to completely close Berkshire’s position on Goldman Sachs follows the bank’s second-ever highest quarterly trading revenue of $13.3 billion. It suggests Buffett is not comfortable in betting big on the banking industry in the long-term.
 
Instead, Buffett purchased a single stock in Barrick Gold, whose stock has reflected that of gold in most of 2020. The firm is a gold mining company based in Canada, which recorded a 45% increase year-to-date. Following Berkshire’s investment, the stock rose by 8.11% in after-hours trading.
 
Max Keiser, an avid Bitcoin investor who has invested in companies like Kraken and Bitfinex, believes Buffett’s gold investment could benefit Bitcoin. He said the positive sentiment around gold implies a higher valuation for Bitcoin, which some consider as “digital gold.” Keiser said:
 
“Global $100 trillion fund management biz is less than 1% invested in Gold. With Buffett now moving into Gold. Expect global allocation of 5% AU min. Implies $5,000 Gold. Expect a 1% BTC global allocation ($1 trillion). This implies $50,000 for Bitcoin Expect PTJ ups to 10%.”
 
A former L/S equities portfolio manager and Ikigai Fund founder Travis Kling echoed a similar sentiment. Referring to Buffett’s skeptical statement in 1998 around gold saying it doesn’t have utility, Kling said:
 
“Today it was announced Berkshire Hathaway just bought its first gold stock ever. The reasons are self-apparent at this point. Just in case you’re wondering what the coming years are going to look like for Bitcoin, this was Buffett on gold in 1998.”
 
BTC has shown some correlation with the precious metal as of late
Although Bitcoin has outperformed gold since April, the price trend between gold and BTC has shown some correlation. Data from Skew show the two assets have increased in tandem throughout the past four months.
 
The simultaneous rally of Bitcoin and gold since the global market crash in late March hints that more investors are starting to consider BTC as a store of value.
 
Most recently, MicroStrategy, a $1.4 billion intelligence conglomerate, purchased $250 million worth of Bitcoin. The firm said BTC would act as the company’s primary treasury asset, acknowledging Bitcoin as a store of value and a potential safe-haven asset.",1597518176,6,1

iaamk8,flyvefugl,AutoInvest - Automaticallys notifies you through email when your bitcoins value is increased by a specifc amount.,"Hello!

I've created a program called [AutoInvest](https://github.com/vsp0/autoinvest).

For example, if I had 0.1 bitcoins, that's approximately 1.000 euros right now and I didn't want to manually check bitcoins value over time. This is why I've created AutoInvest so that it automatically notifies you through email when bitcoins value is increased by a specific amount.

I've have a server where the program runs 24/7 you can fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJhu4BT988Inf8VZZmir9Za-FHEcYuF9JBZF9i63QgsQGE7A/viewform?usp=sf_link) and I'll add you to the users to email.

Let's take the same example using AutoInvest.

I have 0.1 bitcoins, I want bitcoins value to be worth 5 more euro. So in the form under *We'll notify you when bitcoins value is increased by* I simple add 5 and select eur as the currency you can also pick btc as the currency.

Something like this may already exist, but I created it anyway.

Any suggestions is always greatly appreciated!

Thank you!",1597509726,0,1

Some months ago I created an Exodus wallet in order to claim my bitcoin SV and gold, the process went well and i got what I wanted, then I proceed to leave the btc gold and SV on that exact wallet for 4 months untouched, some days ago when i tried opening the wallet again i faced a problem, I had forgotten the password, but fear not, i had the 12 recovery words I wrote down 4 months ago. 

So, I write them down expecting my wallet and money to be there, but to my amazement, the wallet was a fresh wallet, no money, no transaction history, no nothing, just a blank wallet, I then tried recovering again the wallet by using the same 12 words 3 times, maybe i wrote them down wrongly, but no, the wallet was still not the one I had at the start.

The thing is, I have proof that those transactions were made(i can see them on sites like blockchair ETC), some screenshots of the wallet with money and the fact that my bitcoin cash can't be split anymore. I think I deserve an explanation from the Exodus team, but when I write them, asking for help, they give me information I already know and no help at all, now that they don't respond to me anymore, I ask anyone that has the same problem with that wallet to speak up and ask for help together, maybe this way we can obtain a solution, maybe even from the Exodus team.",1597505616,23,1

Based on the amount of HD space it said I had, I figured out that it was trying to load the index off my most recently plugged in space. It said I only had 130GB but needed 160. So, I figured if I just simply unplugged that newer HD and restarted, that when I did so the problem would be fixxed. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I did that, but when I opened the wallet again, it still said it was my first time. However, now it does show the correct HD that I wanted to load it on, but it now also says I can not use that location. If I have to g through the hell of getting the blocks again, I am honestly done for. Last time it took almost 3 months, because it would crash my pc and lose it's progress. I had to close it and reboot my pc every hour or so just to keep it from not saving its progress.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what is going on here? I know my index is a few weeks out of date, but why is it now saying it is my first time and it wants to DL the blocks again? I can even see the folder on my original external that has all, or well, most of the blocks, saved in its parent folder. Should I just select a new location, let it boot, and then will it notice that the blocks are already their? I tried googling every chain of keywords relating to this that I could and could not find an answer, or even some one asking the same question. Down on my luck, really need a lucky break...thanks in advance...",1598060558,3,1

\#1 is you have Greyscale and other companies picking up huge amounts of bitcoin almost double even what the miners are able to produce per block. Simply put the supply is dwindling and the upward pressure will be too strong at some point. The miners tend to sell some of their rewards, but they are not selling all. 

\#2 The dollar is in a really bad situation here. If people are noticing the main correlation of where bitcoin price goes it lies in the strength/weakness of the dollar. With 28 trillion in debt I am not sure how we make it out of this hole. I don't think you will see it completely collapse, however the printing presses are really going full tilt which inflation is under control right now, but for how long ? One of the major currencies Dollar, Yen, Euro, or Yuan will come close to collapsing in the next few years. Fiat can only go for so long before it needs a hard re-set. 

\#3 Mining rewards were halved. I know this was months ago, but not having double the bitcoin being dumped is a huge advantage. The bitcoin is in strong hands / hodlers.

\#3 the Defi game has changed the landscape. More and more people are going to jump on the Defi bandwagon and get their bitcoins wrapped or use Blockfi, Aave ect. In the short term these can be used to short bitcoin, but it's already creating a wave of buying so people can get the yield. This has more advantages on upward price movements as it will control the tempo. On the other side of this however is in a year or two one of these will blow up taking everyone's btc with them so be careful.

\#4 On August 1st we had a sell off where they pushed the bid down from 12k to 10,500 in 15 minutes on massive sell orders and some stop loss selling. Each tumble like that is getting more and more expensive. These pushes are to scoop up the derivatives they buy before the major sell offs . This has been a ongoing trend in bitcoin from even the early years (not the derivatives side). As time goes on and there are less and less coins these are getting way more expensive to manipulate it on the short side. That's why they did the dump in such a short time frame, because the longer the dump is going to cost even more money. 

Overall I can really see this taking off again soon after the consolidation. I also believe we take out the ATH here in a few months.",1598057075,27,1

This app runs without any JavaScript at all, so disabling scripts and running it in a tor browser (in safest mode) is easy and works well.

The app allows users to set their own key for a message, adding an additional layer of security. If the key is not provided, an environmentally injected key is used- and the app operates based on the link only (using a flag, indicating the message is to be decrypted with the environment key).   


I have been considering extending the app to accept bitcoin transaction hashes as the key. Creating different links for BTC transaction based messages would allow users to send a link to the message, input the transaction hash, and receive a message for a BTC transaction.

I own a mining company called Summit Mining. We pay our clients once per month only, because we centralised funds, costs, etc to increase the profits for our clients. Anyway, I have a growing list of clients, and for example, I need to send 0.1 BTC to 10 of them, then 0.06 BTC to 5 of them, etc. In my example, I would need to manually copy / paste 15 addresses and 10 times put the amount of 0.1 BTC and 5 times 0.06 BTC. Long ! Especially since I have 350 customers and we send 5 different cryptos 😱

Any solution for making the process faster. Something that would allow me to pick 10 addresses from a list, and then put the same amount I want to send them, and same story with any other clients ?

I've gotten into cryptocurrencies recently, thought it could be interesting to invest what little money I have and try to make some more, yknow, just a teen trying to make a quick buck

However, since I'm under 18, I haven't managed to find any website that allows minors to withdraw fiat currencies without having to give a valid ID, so I'm kind of screwed here.  
I could ask my mother to help with that, but she clearly told me that she did not care if i was ""wasting my money"" but she refused to know anything about what i was doing, even when I told her I was getting my bitcoin from mining with stormgain or from tv-two. So, not an option either.  
Coinbase doesn't let T0 users deposit their bitcoin, Kraken doesn't allow fiat withdrawal to users with a starter account, and Stormgain is only for trading and mining, so I'm a little lost

Is there any place I can withdraw fiat from bitcoin at market price? Or will I have to wait until I turn 18 to get any profit out?

At that time, the mining industry was just beginning to gain momentum, and it was easy to make money from mining Bitcoin. It was enough just to download the software, install it on your computer and start mining.

But since then the situation has changed significantly — now many people are engaged in Bitcoin mining, and it has become not so easy to make money on it. But it is still possible, and this article will show you how to mine Bitcoin profitably in 2020.

# Choose reliable equipment

Your income directly depends on the right choice of equipment. First of all, pay attention to ASICs, because they are increasingly displacing GPU rigs from the market. When choosing devices, consider the following factors:

* How much do you pay for electricity and how much does an ASIC consume per terahash? Choose the device that consumes the minimum. Otherwise, you will have to spend most of your income on paying your electricity bills.
* What overclocking profiles are available and how much power does the ASIC need to reach them? Choose the model that will allow you to achieve the maximum hashrate, while consuming as little as possible.
* How easy is it to get spare parts for an ASIC and have it repaired in your city? Choose a device that can be “put back in line” as quickly as possible, as prolonged repairs mean equipment downtime and loss of profit.

Pay attention to the following models:

* Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro (hashrate up to 110 TH/s and energy saving up to 29,5 J/Th);
* Bitmain Antminer S17 Pro (easy to overclock, high reliability);
* Old generations of Bitmain Antminer Т17 (easy to overclock, high durability);
* Innosilicon T3 (an improved cooling system).

# Take care of ventilation and cooling

ASICs consume a lot of energy, and almost all of it is converted into heat. If devices overheat, their chips will suffer, which will negatively affect hashrate and your income. Accordingly, in order to mine Bitcoin profitably and without downtime, you need to take care of ventilation and cooling.

* Clean your devices from dust regularly — clean ASICs are less likely to overheat.
* Make sure that the room is ventilated enough — if possible, open windows and doors, and install fans, directing them so that the airflow will remove the heat generated by the ASICs from the room.
* Do not install devices too close to each other. Leave some space between them for better ventilation.
* Try immersion cooling (immersing devices in a container of dielectric fluid). Using this method, you can eliminate the purchase of air conditioners and cut costs.

# Join the [pool](https://hiveon.net/)

By mining Bitcoin on a pool, not individually, you will receive payments more often, which means that your income will be much more stable. When choosing a pool, consider the following factors:

* Payout model (the most profitable option is PPS+, which means that you will receive a payment for each share that you submit);
* Pool fee;
* Transaction fees;
* Proximity of servers (the closer the server is, the more stable the mining process and, accordingly, your income are).

# Install custom Hiveon ASIC firmware

At the moment, profitable Bitcoin mining is almost impossible without custom firmware, and [Hiveon ASIC](https://hiveos.farm/asic) is the best available option:

* Using the downvolting function, you can reduce your energy consumption and cut costs on paying electricity bills. For example, on the stock firmware ASIC Antminer S17E consumes 2700 kW, while the hashrate is 60 TH/s. With the Hiveon ASIC firmware, the device consumes much less power (1314 kW), and the hashrate remains at the same level.
* Thanks to the overclocking function, you will be able to achieve a higher hashrate and increase your income.
* The temperature watchdog reboots the ASIC or stops the mining process if it reaches a critical point, so your devices don't overheat.
* You can also set up the desired temperature of the chips. The temperature will be maintained automatically, which will positively affect their performance.
* The hashrate watchdog reboots the device if the hashrate drops below normal. This will help you to avoid loss of profit.
* The autotuning function adjusts the frequencies of the chips to increase the hashrate and maintain the level of power consumption. This is especially useful for chips that are already worn out — they will last longer and still be nearly as effective as full-fledged working chips.
* Thanks to the built-in wattmeter, you will always be aware of how much electricity your ASICs consume.
* With the Hiveon ASIC firmware, you can use the [Hive OS](https://hiveos.farm/) monitoring and management system for free. In this way, you will cut your costs and be able to manage thousands of devices at the same time.

As you can see, profitable Bitcoin mining is still possible even in 2020. To do this, you need to responsibly approach the matter of choosing equipment, provide devices with ventilation and cooling, join the pool and improve the devices with custom firmware.",1598609277,2,1

ii3cnh,vowam,How to mine Bitcoin profitably in 2020,"Bitcoin is considered to be the very first cryptocurrency — it appeared on the market more than 10 years ago. At that time, the mining industry was just beginning to gain momentum, and it was easy to make money from mining Bitcoin. It was enough just to download the software, install it on your computer and start mining.

But since then the situation has changed significantly — now many people are engaged in Bitcoin mining, and it has become not so easy to make money on it. But it is still possible, and this article will show you how to mine Bitcoin profitably in 2020.

# Choose reliable equipment

Your income directly depends on the right choice of equipment. First of all, pay attention to ASICs, because they are increasingly displacing GPU rigs from the market. When choosing devices, consider the following factors:

* How much do you pay for electricity and how much does an ASIC consume per terahash? Choose the device that consumes the minimum. Otherwise, you will have to spend most of your income on paying your electricity bills.
* What overclocking profiles are available and how much power does the ASIC need to reach them? Choose the model that will allow you to achieve the maximum hashrate, while consuming as little as possible.
* How easy is it to get spare parts for an ASIC and have it repaired in your city? Choose a device that can be “put back in line” as quickly as possible, as prolonged repairs mean equipment downtime and loss of profit.

Pay attention to the following models:

* Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro (hashrate up to 110 TH/s and energy saving up to 29,5 J/Th);
* Bitmain Antminer S17 Pro (easy to overclock, high reliability);
* Old generations of Bitmain Antminer Т17 (easy to overclock, high durability);
* Innosilicon T3 (an improved cooling system).

# Take care of ventilation and cooling

ASICs consume a lot of energy, and almost all of it is converted into heat. If devices overheat, their chips will suffer, which will negatively affect hashrate and your income. Accordingly, in order to mine Bitcoin profitably and without downtime, you need to take care of ventilation and cooling.

* Clean your devices from dust regularly — clean ASICs are less likely to overheat.
* Make sure that the room is ventilated enough — if possible, open windows and doors, and install fans, directing them so that the airflow will remove the heat generated by the ASICs from the room.
* Do not install devices too close to each other. Leave some space between them for better ventilation.
* Try immersion cooling (immersing devices in a container of dielectric fluid). Using this method, you can eliminate the purchase of air conditioners and cut costs.

# Join the [pool](https://hiveon.net/)

By mining Bitcoin on a pool, not individually, you will receive payments more often, which means that your income will be much more stable. When choosing a pool, consider the following factors:

* Payout model (the most profitable option is PPS+, which means that you will receive a payment for each share that you submit);
* Pool fee;
* Transaction fees;
* Proximity of servers (the closer the server is, the more stable the mining process and, accordingly, your income are).

# Install custom Hiveon ASIC firmware

At the moment, profitable Bitcoin mining is almost impossible without custom firmware, and [Hiveon ASIC](https://hiveos.farm/asic) is the best available option:

ihxvl0,OddProfit7,Empire exit scammed,"\-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----  
Hash: SHA512  


Its now been over 48 hours of the market being down. The market mod panel has also been down that long. I had hoped it would have returned by now. It is looking very unlikely that it will. The mod panel is down and the admins are not on jabber.  


I don't think the admins ever planned an exit, planned exits usually disable withdrawals and continue accepting deposits for weeks sometimes even much longer. It was only a week ago when BTC on the market temporarily stopped working and the admins fixed it fast allowing BTC withdrawals again. If it was a planned exit i don't think they would have put in any work fixing BTC withdrawals that close to the end. They had frequently told me they wanted Empire to be the longest living market in history and for the most part i do think that was their intentions and is why the market was online for as long as it was. Having said that. It is sad the admins didn't give any notice of the closure and there is no excuse for that.  


I know the admins were getting tired of keeping Empire Market running. The market was on auto-pilot for the last half a year with no new features being added. I had made suggestions, some of the suggestions was getting rid of PINs and only using PGP 2FA or reviewing XMR code to make XMR withdrawals more reliable. Most of my suggestions were ignored. Earlier on in the history of the market they listened to me more. The market launched with allowing weapon purchases, they removed it after i strongly advocated against the market having anything to do with weapons. In the last half a year it wasn't just ignored suggestions. Communication in general between the mod team and the admins was very limited. This was frustrating but i had accepted that this is the way they wanted it.  


Here is why i think the admins closed shop.   


Empire Market started having good uptime again after the EndGame links were added 4 months ago. The market was online because the two admins agreed to make weekly payments to [/u/SchwererGustav](http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/u/SchwererGustav) to keep the market online. Gustav had been holding down the market brutally for a long time and when the EndGame links were added, he took all those down too. That was probably the closest the market came to a breaking point and a deal was made. I wasn't told of the specific details of the arrangement and i never spoke directly to Gustav but i can guess he must have been getting paid at least $10k or $15k a week maybe more.  


The market was already in a complicated spot with Gustav and when new DDOS came from a new DDOSer that could hold down 9 EndGame links. This was probably when the admins decided to call it quits. I doubt they would want to pay multiple DDOSers and at the same time it wouldn't work paying one DDOSer if another is holding the market down.  


Having said all of that, if the Tor staff team had fixed the problems in Tor that makes an attack like this possible, i believe the admins would have stuck around longer. Tor staff know what they need to do to fix this and that is to add PoW to the network. Maybe they are working on this now and its nice to see they are talking about PoW more frequently but they have been stalling on this for years. I'll go one step further and say if Tor staff team added PoW years ago even Dream Market might still be here.  


I never had server access to the market but i did host the new forum. The forum was spared from the start date of the new DDOS but after the admins took the market down completely, even the mod panel. The forum started getting attacked after that. It was up and down for the day after the market was taken down then i took the forum down, waiting for the market or mod panel to return. In my point of view, putting in the cost and time to fight the DDOS and keep the forum online was a thankless task if the admins have stopped communicating with me and stopped paying me. This is why the forum was online for a short time after the market was taken down but was taken down later. They were not hosted together. I started at Empire as a volunteer forum moderator on the old forum and never thought i would come this far. This is a sour conclusion but i am proud of the work i put in.  


I'm disappointed the admins ended the market like this. I apologize to anyone that had money in escrow. I can only advise that you use markets with MultiSig and only use that for big orders.  


Much love. Se7en.

i2krgx,wumbis,Possibility of a brute forcing industry arising from improvements of mining hardware. When will it be profitable to crack a 12 word phrase?,"I was conducting a thought experiment regarding brute forcing seed phrases and wondered what circumstances would have to arise for it become profitable. I know that this would probably never be practical but I was still curious.

the current hashrate is 110EH per second. so one block for every 66000 Exohashes

assume moores law continues as it has been, if someone knew a wallet had 1 blocks worth of BTC, and ASICs could be created in the future solely for this purpose, when would a 12 word phrase brute force be profitable?

assuming the checksum is just as hard to crack as the other words to be conservative, the amount of hashes would be 2048\^(x), where x is the amount of missing words.

punching 2048\^(x)=66(10\^21) into wolfram alpha, X approaches 7. so right now the answer is 7.

in 6 years, hashing power of the network has increased approx. 1000 times.

assuming this continues (which it wont due to physical constraints of microelectronics causing diminishing returns) then approx. every 6 years you need an additional word to protect 1 block of btc.

66(10\^24)=2048\^x. X will approach 8

2020+6\*(number of words)=2050 for an additional 5 words.

So around 2050, cracking a 12 word phrase would take the network 10 minutes hypothetically. The block reward will be around 6.25/(2\^7)=0.0488BTC. In 6 more years it would be profitable if the wallet held about 1000 times less.

24 word phrases would be safe for much longer",1596405900,15,1

i2d5vh,SoundofCreekWater,Argument: DeFi is a Bubble,"  

Here's the argument. Can you tell me why it's wrong?

The DeFi markets consist primarily of a single type of transaction: borrowing/lending, in which a borrower deposits a cyrptoasset as collateral in return for the ability to borrow other cryptoassets.

For the loan to be trustless, the value of the collateral must exceed the value of the loan. For example, the borrower must put up/collateralize 2 Units of value in collateral in order to borrow 1 Unit of value.

The only real reason any borrower would ever do this is to buy more cryptoassets on margin, in hopes of increasing his/her profits in the event that the cryptoassets in which he/she invests increase in value. In other words, DeFi lending is a tool for obtaining leverage with which to speculate in cryptoasset markets.

(The theoretical 'use case' that a crypto-owning borrower has a short-term need, such as buying groceries, and turns to DeFi for help does not make much sense bc in that hypothetical, the borrower would be better of selling the cryptoasset (instead of using it as collateral) and buying it back later. Further, to the extent this 'use case' of grocery-buying actually happens, it is far, far, far rarer than borrowers who use DeFi lending to buy cryptoassets with leverage and therefore not very important in predicting what happens in the DeFi market.)

Therefore, the DeFi markets are overwhelmingly fueled by leverage-seeking investors who are speculating in cryptoassets.

Therefore, when the value of cryptoassets stops its rapid rise, the demand for DeFi services will rapidly dry up, causing the DeFi bubble to deflate (if not burst).

Further, the collateralized cryptoassets get seized and usually liquidated/sold when the value of the collateralized cryptoasset goes down. (Typically the value of the collateralized cryptoassets must remain 1.5x as valuable as the loaned cryptoassets and if the value of the collateral falls below that threshhold, then the collateralized cryptoassets are seized and sold). Therefore if the value of cryptoassets goes down, then as a result of the DeFi markets, lots of collateralized cryptoassets will be seized and sold. The selling of those cryptoassets will drive the value of cryptoassets down further.  
 That will trigger more seizures and sales. This is an autocatalytic cycle, and it will cause the DeFi bubble to burst.

Why is this argument wrong?",1596379449,30,1

i1t0us,michaeldunworthsydne,UASF - 3 Year Anniversary - Look back,"(This is how I look at it, specifics may be a little paraphrased)

User Activated Soft Fork

*What was it*

An alternative to scaling the block size limit (and thus altering bitcoins original protocol design parameters). This alternative would permit more transactions without the need to adjust the core protocol.

*How did it come about?*

Amidst ongoing scaling concerns, we saw many people proposing that bitcoin cannot scale and requires bigger blocks than 1MB, so it can cater to larger amounts of network activity.

Proposals for combinations between UASF (Activating Segregated Witness) 

*Why it is important to understand*

Bitcoin is money to some, it’s income to others, but as a technology it solves one single problem.

Digital scarcity. In order for *anything* in this world or universe to be deemed scarce, we must be able to prove it’s defensibility. Against being reproduced, copied, weather storms if it’s raw materials, or be resilient against robbery at a larger scale (like wars between governments over natural resources).

*ELI5*

If you teleport back to cave man days, and consider a cave man with a gold bar and a plank of wood. He takes them to the market to trade for food. 1 gold bar or 1 plank of wood can purchase a steak.

Now he returns back to his cave and has his wood and gold by the entrance. A storm comes, and it blows and rains, and bashes his stockpile to pieces.

Noticing the changes to his stock, his wood is brittle and diminished from the weather, but his gold has dirt on it, although still in tact. Knowing this, he now elects to spend his wood at the market instead of gold. His gold weathered the storm.

UASF was a defining moment in weathering the storm, and that’s why bitcoin reigns supreme as the crowned heavyweight champion for the *Duration Of Immutability* title.

Whatever happens moving forward, no matter how your relationship goes with bitcoin, remember that it’s super power may appear boring, but it is the long play. Generational play. It’s immutability is impossible to catch, the longer it goes, and the longer it goes, the stronger that conviction behind it being truly immutable is.

That’s my take on UASF, and it was eye popping once the penny dropped for me (h/t to Neil &amp; Richard).

Do not dismiss immutability, ever. It’s the superpower because it requires the single thing that can’t be bought, time.

Felt this was an analogy that broke the ice to learn more, hope it is helpful to even just one person.",1596291931,4,1

The issue is that there is a black market that actually has the Lira trading at closer to 15007:1 (10x).  The central money exchanges are refusing to give dollars and only Lira as they can still claim that the value is 1507:1.  The bitcoin solution is quite clear here!

Log charts are charts that display the original trend of a chart, except that the y axis becomes log scaled axis with the same charted values to represent what the function what like if you took the logarithm of the function.  This is great because if the function was exponential, then using the log chart will linearize it and you can just follow the line to see what the trend would be over time. This isn't something you could easily do with the exponential trend. I began doing this with the coronavirus cases I saw on worldometer to see where the trends were going. Luckily some trends in deaths for some us states became linear and so the log graph began to look like the standard log function. But when this happens you can just use the original graph since it is linear. How this was a bit helpful to some.",1596567495,2,1
i3p5xt,lostcorass,(serious question) Is the entire Bitcoin Blockchain a collection of preloaded chunks of a Minecraft type world generator? (yet?),"I realize now, having used all of the softwares involved, that a single Bitcoin being created is a stack of individually identifiable Satoshis that fit together mathematically in blocks to form the full coin when mined, and each coin can be mined on any computer capable of running the same software, in a similar way that Minecraft seeds each contain an entire world of individually identifiable blocks that can be generated by any computer running the same software, and the chunks of the world are generated as you witness their connection to the previous chunks. All chunks of a seed are absolute, when using a seed, the seemingly infinite world will always generate exactly the same on all computers, although not always in the same order depending on which direction you travel when generating the chunks of your world as you move around and witness them, exactly how Bitcoins are found ""randomly"" by connecting them together in a way that Bitcoin can witness as a collective agreement about every historical state of reality in a way that fits together, called the Blockchain.

If you haven't played Minecraft, the important thing to know is that I can give you my seed, which is unique out of (something like) 18 Billion seeds, and your computer can generate the exact same world as mine with just a few numbers. If everyone mining Bitcoin is generating chunks of the same Minecraft seed, we already have a very large world ready to be explored. Minecraft already has a world based on your private key in the same way Bitcoin already has all of the private keys, we just need the correct software to view them.

 

Before you link it, I have seen Decentraland, It is similar to what I'm suggesting and looking for. Someone is already working on this i'm sure, i'm just looking for the 12-dimensional painter of this art, so to speak. 

So...

Each Bitcoin is theoretically 100,000,000 blocks of a Minecraft based reality generation software. Each coin is a chunk of the full map, the seed that builds this world is the chain itself. There are 21 Million Chunks, each one contains 100 million blocks, each block is a grain of sand that, currently, is not being picked up and moved, but having it's access permission transferred.

The Blockchain is the full map, the wallet is your interaction permission list and history, operating like the fog of unknowing you have removed from your map by exploring.

A wallet's private key is permission to load a private set of loaded chunks from the server, not just a collection of the grains of sand, but full access to where they spawned and how the permissions have traveled. It's not a private location where you keep an inventory of Satoshis, a Wallet is just a list of blocks you have permission to break and move inside this limited, single Minecraft type world seed. The Chain is where the locations are documented, the wallet is where the permissions are documented, and multi sig wallets are how you invite a friend into your world.

Bitcoin generates specific numbers that exist forever uniquely, and Minecraft generates virtual reality landscapes uniquely from specific numbers. The Matrix is Teaching us to give birth to it. This is happening. It's a land rush, not a Gold rush.

Please don't start down the rabbit hole of the validity of the question, this is 100% the requirement and it solves a lot of problems. It's needed for corporate reasons for testing machines in the field, paying invoices for common expenses, and a dozen other things.  We're also talking $20 here and $75 there, not thousands of dollars, so I don't need to worry about an employee stealing the funds.  The most they would ever make off with is &lt;$1000, ever. 

The wallet software should be for mobile. It is only needed for BTC.  It needs to be both iOS and Android.  I need to be able to fund a wallet address, and then have my employees on their phones, use this wallet app to pay/send out BTC as needed.  I should be able to see on my phone the transactions for accounting purposes.  

We could setup a common login ([wallet@coinmover.com](mailto:wallet@coinmover.com)) for the wallet and get a single seed phrase which is backed up, but I am worried about each phone having a different phone number and login methods (PIN, FaceID, Touch, Pattern), etc. 

Right now, I have a half dozen employees all with their own wallet software and their own funds all sending out money as needed then asking me for reimbursement. It's a pain in the ass to be honest. I just want a single wallet that I can periodically fund that they all can spend from.

Over and over until it at least says 256Bits or more under ""Total Bits"". The 24 words created I write down on paper and back it up.

No. Bitcoin es viejo y gordo  


Es buenísimo en el largo plazo, pero es torpe en el corto  


Pero su filosofía conceptual permitió que una bolsa de genios creara Ethereum. Y el mundo nunca jamás volverá a ser el mismo  


Ethereum permitió a otra bolsa de genios idear un universo paralelo, en el que corren aplicaciones descentralizadas lejos del control del poder central. Nacieron los tokens y las stablecoins  


Y otra bolsa de genios creó las DeFi  


Las DeFi no solo son finanzas decentralizadas. En realidad, son un nuevo nivel de finanzas. Un nivel mucho mejor de finanzas. Son finanzas para la gente común. Son finanzas mejores  


Cualquiera que tenga que lidiar con bancos, sus ridículas y exageradas comisiones, y los innumerables permisos que hay pedir para usar el dinero propio, sabe que el sistema monetario actual está increíblemente desbalanceado a favor del poder. El hombre común solo puede obedecer para disponer de su dinero. Comisiones por descubierto, por mantenimiento de cuenta, por envío de extracto, por transferencia internacional, por saldos bajos, suspensión de cuentas, intereses ridículos...  


Con las DeFi, todo esto avasallamiento se termina. Tu dinero es tuyo y no del banco

It's less the $1000 to us to reach, this means that if People HODL bitcoin back in the time they are almost getting the same price.

I want to ask localbitcoins to implement SMS based 2fa. As I scammed $33k usd for the vulnerability of Authy, people should have choice of avoid it. For login , bitcoin release and bitcoin send option, user should have choice of the type of 2fa they want. Someone might choose sms for login, auth for release, sms for sending btc or another combination.

For ""forgot password"" option localbitcoins or any wallet should verify the action with sms 2fa. they should send sms to the verified phone with the account. If this was in place, i could have saved 1.47 btc with them.

For ""changing email"" option sms based 2fa also must be used. This way none without the verified phone can change email.

For both option above, system also can check some personal details like Identity Documents no: or date of birth etc.

Localbitcoins should also maintain an emergency contacts, At least 1 person monitoring the support request during off hours and if anything urgent, he/she should take action. For my case, if someone blocked my account as soon as i emailed them, i could have saved this huge loss.

There should be a ""lock my account"" option. Localbitcoins can automate this process with a specific email or sms only phone number. If someone from his verified email or phone number email or sms to that specific email or number, the system should automatically block the respective account.

Localbitcoins should also detect proxy/vpn users. And should never let to send bitcoin or start trade with a new proxy/vpn. I always use my account from the real ip of my resident country. Suddenly someone login from proxy/vpn or from other location and localbitcoins let them to drain my account is not acceptable.

So, please all user of localbitcoins raise your voice for these security measures in localbitcons. We keep our hard earned money with them and they can't only sleep and count profit. I will soon write these to consumer authorities.",1596702583,0,1

I'm curious how the economic system would work in this situation. What would it actually look like?

Is this just a case of higher interest rates for lending out bitcoin? 

For example. If you can get 15% through deflation without lending your money, then you would need to lend out at a high enough interest rate so that your return would exceed the automatic deflationary increase of 15%? 

Is it that the basics of it? So the interest rate of borrowing bitcoin would effectively always be related to the deflation of bitcoin and the inflation from new supply. Whatever that balances out to.",1596688307,103,1

i4cy13,RalphAnderson_,Crypto Update,"Bitcoin Will Break $400K in Long-Term, Morgan Creek's Pomp Predicts
 
Amid the ongoing bull market, a major #Bitcoin (BTC) advocate has delivered another promising price prediction for the largest #cryptocurrency.
 
Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital, believes that Bitcoin will continue to grow in the long-term to break the $400,000 threshold.
 
Digital is bigger than analog — Bitcoin is bigger than gold
In an Aug. 4 interview with #crypto podcaster Peter McCormack, Pomp said that Bitcoin is poised to eventually hit at least $400,000 or $450,000 price levels with a market capitalization of $8 trillion. According to Pompliano, Bitcoin will steadily break new all-time highs because the cryptocurrency represents a digital version of gold — one of the world's most valuable assets.
 
As per Pompliano, Bitcoin will follow the success of major digitized assets, replacing the analog gold with its digital alternative and eventually expanding the market. Pomp said:
 
“Here’s what I continue to tell people: name to me a business that was analog and got digitized, and the digital version is smaller than the analog version. It doesn’t happen. It’s because digitization brings all kinds of advantages. It’s a market-expanding technology.”
 
Bitcoin is going to capture more market than gold
Pompliano continued that Bitcoin will eventually become a bigger market than gold. According to Pomp, it might take 50 years before Bitcoin hits $400,000 levels.
 
Pompliano said:
 
“You know there are people who debate what the size of the gold market is but let’s just use easy numbers. Let’s say that it’s $8 trillion. That puts Bitcoin at, depending on how many are lost or stolen, $400,000 to $450,000 today. Do you think that Bitcoin is going to be the equivalent of the gold market? I don’t. It’s better. It’s going to capture more market.”
 
In the interview, Pomp also said that he still keeps his $100,000 #BTC prediction, forecasting that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 by late 2021. As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $11,581 with a market cap of about $214 billion amid the ongoing bull market. In the meantime, gold prices are also surging. The precious metal crossed the $2,000 threshold for the first time on Aug. 4.",1596658618,1,1

i5letp,MaleficentChoice3,Generating an indexed btc address from an xpub key,"An **xpub** key can generate a sequence of bitcoin addresses.

In this [example](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/xpub/xpub6CUGRUonZSQ4TWtTMmzXdrXDtypWKiKrhko4egpiMZbpiaQL2jkwSB1icqYh2cfDfVxdx4df189oLKnC5fSwqPfgyP3hooxujYzAu3fDVmz) ,*1EfgV2Hr5CDjXPavHDpDMjmU33BA2veHy6* is the first, *12iNxzdF6KFZ14UyRTYCRuptxkKSSVHzqF* is the second and so on and so forth.

With any Bitcoin API implementation is possible to easily generate a btc address from any xpub, where the xpub key is the input and the index is a parameter defining the position of the btc address in the derivation tree.

An example using the C# NBitcoin API:

`BitcoinExtPubKey xpub = new BitcoinExtPubKey(""yourxpub"", Network.Main);`

`bitcoinAddress = xpub.Derive(0).Derive(btcindex).ScriptPubKey.GetDestinationAddress(Network.Main);`

In this example, if the variable btcindex==0 and the xpub is the one from the example, the generated address is the first, namely: *1EfgV2Hr5CDjXPavHDpDMjmU33BA2veHy6 .*

If btcindex==1, the second and so on and so forth.

Now, let's suppose we generate a btc address with index like 9999999 and send money to it, moreover **only** the first btc address has a positive amount, every btc address in the range between the first and the 9999999th has been **never** used before.

What may happen if we use a Ledger/Trezor or a wallet like Electrum? As far as I know they need to **scan** the blockchain to find the addresses, but one thing is to scan one-hundred, another thing is scanning a billion!

Will that btc address even counted? If yes, will it be done in a reasoneable time?",1596832006,8,1

If so do I need to track and report all of these exchanges to the IRS come tax time?

Do I need to go back and track the exact price I purchased them at and sent to the casino and whatever fluctuation there was in price?

i6cfn4,Mcgillby,Securely generate 24-word Mnemonic using Dice,"&gt;**Disclaimer:** This is for education purposes only. This is quite advanced for the average user. If you are to going to protect funds with a mnemonic generated using this method, use only a verified copy of tails and do all processes in a completely secure offline environment.

Let me begin by saying there is nothing to suggest that the RNG used in popular software/hardware wallets is flawed. The generation process uses TRNG's certified from 3rd parties which should satisfy the large majority of users. However, if you are the type that trusts no one and you want to verify your BIP39 Mnemonic is truly random or you just want to find out how it works, then you must generate it yourself.

The process itself is straightforward, The BIP39 dictionary contains 2048 words, each of these words represents 11 binary bits (0 or 1). A 24-word Mnemonic consists of 23 Words (253 bits) and Checksum (3+8 bits). To create our own mnemonic we start by generating 256 bits of random binary (23 words + 3 bits of the Checksum) then calculating the rest of the checksum. There is many ways to randomly generate the binary, but specifically for this tutorial we use six-sided dice. (If you have another means of generating the 256-bits, such as coin flips, then jump straight to step 10)

The entire process will be done only using tools built-in to tails. All base converisons will be done in the linux terminal using the ['bc'](https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/html_mono/bc.html) or Basic Calculator command. Calculating the checksum will use python standard library.

**Tools needed:**

  - Set of Casino Grade Six-Sided Dice 
  - BIP39 Wordlist  (**MUST BE NUMBERED 0-2047**)
  - USB stick w/[Tails](https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/08/4c0c2d36-1443-4d7f-a341-61cf63ed6ef8/resize/1200x900/749fc4d5610595d5143320e3203f658c/tails.png) Linux Distro

--------------------------------------------------

#Create BIP39 Mnemonic with Dice#

  - **Step 1** - Download Tails onto a USB stick** Follow instructions on the tails website. You can validate tails using the extension or manually.  Boot from the live USB, be sure to turn network connection to ""offline"" before starting tails. (click the + sign and it is one of the few options) [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/4mVdeHS.jpg)

  - **Step 2** - Open the built-in text editor**: [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/9W3ZQID.jpg)

  - **Step 3** - Roll your 99 dice rolls recording each roll in the text editor with no spaces between the numbers.[**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/b8XCbow.png)

  - **Step 4** - You can check the number of rolls input by going to document statistics. Click the 3 bars to the right of the ""Save"" button. It will be under ""Tools"".  Make sure there is no additional spaces. [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/e1S0Rfl.png)

  - **Step 5** - Convert the dicerolls into base6. To do this simply turn all the 6's into 0's. You can use ""Find and Replace"" function of the text editor to achieve this. [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/Z8DJKTE.png) [IMAGE](https://i.imgur.com/xt7oPLx.png)

  - **Step 6** - Open the terminal [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/0JHNWLB.jpg)

  - **Step 7** - Convert the base6 string into binary. We use ""bc"" or basic calculator which is a built-in command line function. We are converting into base2 from base6. (replace [diceRolls] with your 99-digit base6 string) [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/sLN6eSM.png)

    echo ""obase=2;ibase=6;[diceRolls]"" | bc    

  - **Step 8** - Paste the binary output into a new tab in the text editor.  (to copy/paste in the terminal you need to hold ctrl+shift c to copy or ctrl+shift v to paste) [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/mYTcVYn.png)

  - **Step 9** - Remove the backslashes and extra spaces from the binary string. It should be a solid string of 0's and 1's with no extra spaces at the end. [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/k8e3yiR.png)

  - **Step 10:** -  Check the length of the binary string using document statistics. In order to calculate a checksum the binary string must be exactly 256 characters. If the resulting binary is less then 256 characters, then add zeroes to the start of the string until it is 256 characters. This is called padding. [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/zemkcuA.png) [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/X3x0UQt.png)

  - **Step 11:** - Convert the 256-bit binary into a hex value using the terminal. (replace [binary] with your 256-bit binary) [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/X0Z1Blg.png)

    echo ""obase=16;ibase=2;[binary]"" | bc

  - **Step 12:** - To generate the checksum we need to write a small python program using the python standard library. Open a new tab in the text editor and save it as ""checksum.py"" in the Documents folder. Once it is saved copy the below text to the file or copy it directly from the screenshot. Replace the Pink ""hex_val"" with your own hex value and save the file. [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/0tOGOFw.png)

    import hashlib
    import binascii

    hex_val = """" # &lt;-- Enter your hash value here
    bin_data = binascii.a2b_hex(hex_val)
    sha256hash = hashlib.sha256(bin_data).hexdigest()

    print(sha256hash)

  - **Step 13:** -Change directory to Documents using the command ```cd Documents``` then run checksum.py by using the command ```python3 checksum.py```. The output will be a long hex value. The first 2 characters will be the checksum. [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/spqX0SD.png)

  - **Step 14:** - Convert the 2 hex characters into binary using the terminal.  The hex input for bc MUST BE capitalized or the result will be 0. In the above example the first 2 characters from checksum.py are 9c. So we use 9C as the input for base conversion. ```echo ""obase=2;ibase=16;[hex]"" | bc``` (replace [hex] with the first 2 characters given back from checksum.py. Make sure to capitalize any letters). If the result is less then 8 bits, add zeroes to the start.  Example: 2C would equal ""101100"" in binary which is only 6-bits. In this case add 2 zeroes to the start to make ""00101100"", [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/qfKgCbB.png)

  - **Step 15:** - Add the 8-bits of binary from the previous step to the existing binary string from step 10. Check to make sure the resulting binary is exactly 256 characters using document statistics. [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/SOJA4XG.png)

  - **Step 16** - Split the 256-bit binary into equal 11-bit chunks. There should be exactly 24 groups of 11 bits. [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/igDJ2rc.png)

    - **Step 17** - Convert each group of binary into a decimal number using the terminal. Record each number next to the corresponding binary. Do this for all 24 binary strings. (press the up arrow to access previous commands) [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/vXagdz1.png)

    - **Step 18** - Look up the numbers in the BIP39 wordlist. Make sure the wordlist in zero-indexed meaning it begins with 0 and ends with 2047. This is your 24-word seed which can be used with any BIP39 compatible wallet.
Take care to properly wipe the USB device after use. [**IMAGE**](https://i.imgur.com/nKIQV4U.png)

That's potentially $70 to download the Bitcoin blockchain. This barrier to entry is going to turn away people, especially those who don't have the motivation to jump through hoops to support Bitcoin.

Comcast does give one ""courtesy month"" per year where overage charges are waived, but its name, ""courtesy month"", seems to imply that they think doing it is a favour and that we shouldn't take it for granted.

i66l2h,JimmyB30,Had a thought today about obsolescence,"Back in the early naughties (maybe the late nineties) my dad bought a CD player which could hold 5 CDs. The idea being that you could listen to 5 CDs worth of music without having to change the CD.

And then MP3 came along. My first MP3 player could hold a whopping 128kb of data, so my dads purchase was still superior in a continuous playback sense. 

Fast forward a couple of years (oh shit, time goes so fast.) My 128kb player (which ran off of a single AAA battery, I might add) was outdated in about a year. The tech kept growing to allow more and more song to be played back continuously.

Then MP3 players were replaced by iPhones. And we all bought docking stations to plug our phones into our sound systems. 

Then bluetooth came along, and the sound systems were now obsolete.

And then.... we have streaming! We no longer need the third party hardware to store the information, we just play the song straight from source.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This initially started as a drunken rambling shitting on bitcoin cash, spurred by how useless my dad's CD player is now.

i63gz6,freebit,Fiat Currencies (1971-2030) RIP,"While many currencies have gone off the gold standard for a short time, we are living in a unique time where the entire world is now using fiat currencies. Before 1971, the US was on the gold standard and many countries pegged the value of their currency to the US dollar. On the day that the US went off the gold standard, every country that was pegged to the dollar also went off. While simplistic, it's partially correct to say that the entire world switched to being fiat currencies on August 15th, 1971.

It's now clear to some that we are nearing the closing chapters of that story. The date is unknown, but there seems to be a feeling of inevitability. The words ""full faith and credit"" are starting to feel like irony.  

I don't know about you, but I see my grocery bill going up every weekend. While I am fortunate to be making a wage at all, I can see that the wage I am making is buying less all the time. I know this contradicts what the government tells me. They tell me other things. They tell me things that don't match what I see and experience. The news people show me things that look bad and tell me they are good. I used to trust the news anchor that told me the news every night on TV. These contradictions bring me a level of discomfort that is like a splinter in my mind. As a good citizen, I want to believe my government, but I also see the Safeway, Walmart, and Target receipts every week as well. They are going up. I see the receipt total, purse my lips, shake my head, and sigh. Today, I am going to JCPenney because my work clothes have holes in them and are frayed. We'll see how that goes. I ate more Mac and Cheese this year too and it always makes me feel terrible, physically. I'm not young anymore. I wonder if it is hurting me. I don't quite understand why I am eating it. I just realized we are now eating it weekly as a family. It just seemed to happen.

I abide by the laws of the land. I always wear my mask because they tell me to. I always pay my taxes and obey the speed limit. I, like many people, use dollars because I am forced to. It's what we all use. They are used everywhere and for every thing. However, as soon as a better option comes along, I'm going to take it. Regardless of what all the economists say about deflationary death spirals, as a user of a money, I will always opt for the money that either holds, or grows in value, if given the choice. 

Choice, that is an interesting world. I often worry how long I can make my own choices in a country making other choices that are getting more and more worrisome all the time. I think it's very far fetched, but does there exist a possible future where my family walks across the southern border with only the clothes on our back and a memorized 12 word seed phrase? I have heard this scenario more than once and it scares me. I don't have much money and can't speak the language. 

Gosh, I hope not. This is my home. I don't want to leave it.",1596909196,33,1

i61hq4,nolith_ita,Using lightning network founds,"Hello, I’m trying to understand LN.

After reading a lot, I think that I finally understood the basics of the protocol like the scam protection and the use of multi-sig and half signed transactions. 

What is not clear to me is how to make effective use of it.

As long as I see the LN link as a prepaid card, I can load founds to it and making a lot a microtransactions will be extreel cheap. But all those coins are still locked in the LN, there’no way to use them until the channel is dropped. 

So in the end there’s still need to an on-chain transaction to effectively commit the final state of the founds and have them available outside of LN. 

I’m not able to run a LN node now so I was looking into breez wallet. Did they open channel for me, founding it, in hope to make profit on LN fees as they have the only channel linking to my wallet?

This represents a lovely looking ascending triangle with a top of 12k.  This ascending triangle was given a lot of strength a few hours ago with the recent sell that bounced of the 55EMA, (shown by arrow).

So the rule of an ascending triangle is to break upwards out of them, with the longer the squeeze within the triangle the more violent the breakout will be.  This isn't guaranteed and could breakdown out of this pattern, however with the recent wick and buyback.  My money is we breakout of this structure.

Triangle suggests breakout within 96 hours.

Next stop 14k yum yum 

Happy trading and hodling everyone :)

I found that loopholes in Bitcoin can quickly earn BTC.

I have tested this method and it works well, but it will not be shared on my blog or anywhere else.

This method requires:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Basic computer skills (almost everyone can do it, don’t worry)

&amp;#x200B;

2. PC or laptop

&amp;#x200B;

3. A small amount of funds (the more you invest, the more you earn, it depends on you)

&amp;#x200B;

Your money is absolutely safe, and even if this method is invalid, you will not lose anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Because this is not a very ethical method of making money, but I can assure you that this method is legal and they will never be able to track your bitcoins.

By using this method, you can earn tens of thousands of dollars, but you need to hurry, they may fix the error as soon as possible.

Just like in the Paul Tudor Jones, where most people thought he really bought bitcoin ( WHICH HE DIDN'T, if you actually read the details ), I have a suspicion that it's the same here. If they don't clearly specify they bought REAL Bitcoin, in 99% of the cases they're just playing on the Crypto derivatives markets and have EXPOSURE to Bitcoin, but they don't actually own any real Bitcoin.

To be honest, the term “multicurrency” does not suit our wallet too much at this stage, as we currently offer only two coins: Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, we will add more coins real soon, and we, of course, already have a list of coins we are planning to use, but we would like to hear your suggestions as well.

I did not make this post for the sake of advertisement, but we did create this app for you and would like you to use it. But for the time being, we simply need a fresh perspective. Perhaps, you will feel like something is missing, while other things might annoy you. To sum up: we need some constructive criticism to understand whether we are on the right path or not.

ibwxu1,Beneficial-Guitar-77,What are the characteristics of the bitcoin bull market?,"Bitcoin is pretty well known, but what does a bull market in bitcoin mean?

Bitcoin is the existence of a familiar transaction currency!

The price of Bitcoin could soar to $100,000 in just over two years.

You can also see that the outlook is pretty good.

So today's main question is what does the bull market in Bitcoin mean?

Let's start with four characteristics of what a bitcoin bull market is.

1. Characteristics of market sentiment

Before the bull market is coming, as a result of the decline in the currency mayor time, will be in the market to form a heavy hold disk, the sentiment is also in the constant being caught in the exhausted. But it is often when sentiment is extremely low that the currency market is not far from a true low.

2. Characteristics of trend patterns

During the upcoming trend of the bull market, technical patterns will appear to break the level and accelerate the decline, a variety of technical bottom, market bottom, policy bottom and support levels and passes, are weak, a little resistance will have been defeated. All kinds of moving average system are also in the downward divergence stage, and the divergence Angle presents a bigger and bigger trend.

3. Characteristics of the magnitude of the decline

When the market is in an upward trend, you can focus on two kinds of measurement standards: one is the peak position of the previous market, usually a strong uptrend adjustment, its lowest point is not lower than the last market peak. Another standard is this round of market rise of the golden section point.

4. Characteristics of policies

This is the market to make the most of the key factors of the bull market, which mainly includes two aspects: on the one hand is the policy of explicit support; On the other hand, the market development can be actively coordinated with the policy.

There was a big guy on Twitter who said:

""There are 7 billion people in the world, and the maximum number of Bitcoins issued is 21 million. If you only value your wealth based on Bitcoins, if you own one bitcoin, you will be among the top three-thousandth of the world's rich.""

As an investment option, Bitcoin has developed into a mainstream currency with a huge space of appreciation. In the past decade, it has even greatly surpassed the STANDARD &amp; Poor's Index of U.S. Stocks.

For traditional finance, in order to avoid risks, gold is usually chosen as the investment object, or government bonds, oil and other relatively stable investment objects.",1597738237,0,1

The opinions expressed are those of the author only.

Why invest in Bitcoin? The big picture.

Driven by a new generation of savvy investors, more and more capital is pouring in, and the cryptocurrency market is growing exponentially.

1. High return on investment

When it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies, the rate of return on investment is never going to go anywhere, because it does sometimes exaggerate as a scam.

In cryptocurrency, you never get bored because the market is moving at the speed of light and growing every day.

The returns on investments in cryptocurrencies are among the highest in any industry, so much so that many initially skeptical participants have joined in.

2. Diversify your investments

Diversify your portfolio as much as possible. Spread your investments across multiple assets.

Keep in mind that digital money is an unstable investment and most people are not advised to put all their savings into it.

As for your crypto portfolio, most people start with Bitcoin.

With more experience, you may find it attractive to research and invest in other reputable cryptocurrencies as well.

3. Why should we invest in Bitcoin?

\*8 million times in 8 years

Bitcoin has risen by 8 million times in eight years. Different from traditional financial stock market, cryptocurrency investment has unlimited possibilities.

\* Good timing

In 2020, bitcoin mining will be halved. Now is a good time to start fixed investment and allocation.

\*7x24 hours trading

It is no longer limited to trading at fixed points in the stock market. The cryptocurrency trading market is available for trading at 7X24 hours without any time limit. It keeps an eye on the market at any time and locks in earnings.

\*0 Capital threshold

There is zero threshold for opening an account. There is no minimum limit for investment amount and trading unit. You can buy Bitcoin with 100 yuan.

Cryptocurrency is not just an investment, but an ongoing technological and socio-economic experiment.

It's booming and it's opening up a lot of new opportunities, so the earlier you get to know it, the greater the opportunity to benefit from future growth.",1597736937,3,1

ibaizq,throwaway01011989,jp-ex.io : a bitcoin ponzi that is running in my home country. How can I report and stop this?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

During the past few years, there have been a number of bitcoin ""gurus"" popping up in my country (Hong Kong). While most of them are the run of the mill ""online gurus"" (follow me and I will teach you how to earn money type), some of them have recently started to promote an online service to ""make easy money while doing nothing"".

The service that they are touting is [jp-ex.io](https://jp-ex.io) or Japan Exchange. This fake exchange has nothing to do with Japan or Japan Exchange Group (JPX). From my research, it is most likely based in Shenzhen China. Users have noted the poor japanese and english translations on the website, mostly likely coming from google translate.

One of the services in [jp-ex.io](https://jp-ex.io) is called Arbitrage, which promises over 40% returns from bullshit arbitrage technologies. All you have to do is to just deposit the money and you will receive the returns daily.

This is a classic ponzi scheme which has been replicated many times (plustoken/bitclub). To make things worse, most of the people currently invested in the service are making some form of returns. These returns are the ""proof"" that they hang onto and believe that this service is legit. In the ""gurus"" chat groups, any mention of the word ponzi or any doubts about the service will be subject to a torrent of verbal abuse.

As much as I would like to just sit back and watch this whole thing implode from afar, I believe in Bitcoin and its future. When plustoken finally blew up, the dumping of btc by the scammers caused a sharp decline in its price. I believe there are currently hundreds, if not thousands of people invested in this ponzi, judging by the size of the chat groups. 

So how can we put a stop to this?

&amp;#x200B;

By declaring bitcoin inflation, you are telling everyone that you have no idea what bitcoin really is. Bitcoin inflation and deflation are absent by definition. Bitcoin is the energy Standard and Measure, from which everything is counted. Bitcoin can neither be seen, nor touched, nor smelled, nor bought or sold. You can see, touch, smell, buy and sell anything using Bitcoin only as a starting point.

The mining process itself is nothing more than a manifestation of the lower projections of the energy standard of the higher planes of erzanil. The latter are “materialized” at the level of the third dimension or society in the form of bitcoins. During mining, the three main types of energy: electrical energy, the thermal energy of the video card / device itself and the energy that the programmer potentiated into the mining process itself, are converted into energy to fill the shells of bitcoins generated during the hashing process. This energy is stored in every bitcoin forever and will increase until the last block of the last bitcoin is fully mined.

This energy, which is potentialized in bitcoin, which can neither be felt nor touched, is what you get with bitcoin and / or any part of it !!! And in the future, invest it / Bitcoin, exchange, buy, change, etc. etc.

And it is this energy, in the future, that will serve as an evaluation standard for the value of all things.

How Bitcoin is used today is tantamount to how Tom Kent used the royal seal from Mark Twain's imperishable story ""The Prince and the Pauper""",1597654371,4,1

ibac9d,Beneficial-Guitar-77,Why Bitcoin can appreciate？,"I believe that we are relatively familiar with the currency, the virtual currency can appreciate why? That's a problem.

Before we talk about bitcoin, we have to talk about gold.

Why does gold store value?

Anything rare, has a value store function

In the process of trading, there will always be an item as a general equivalent, the item must first meet the condition of rarity.

Ancient people used shells as money. How can shells become money?

If it is difficult to obtain shells within a certain range, shells can be used as money.

In 2009, the exchange rate was fairly low, with more than 1,300 bitcoins exchanged for a dollar at that time.

At the beginning, netizens believed that bitcoin was a virtual thing with no value, and its inflow into the market might have an impact on the market. Even though bitcoin was highly speculative and its price was low, many people were reluctant to buy it.

Surprisingly, bitcoin caught fire in the following years, and its exchange value soared from its initial few cents to more than 100,000 yuan.

What is the concept of hearing the news and seeing the results;

A few cents of bitcoin can now be sold for nearly 100,000 yuan, which means that bitcoin has increased by 13 million times since its birth.

That's an awful lot of money, so the people who bought bitcoin must have made a fortune!

And the idea of appreciation is that because of that 13 million times, that's what determines the value of bitcoin, and all of these currencies, a lot of people are coming in.

Now according to the appreciation trend of Bitcoin, it has appreciated 13 million times in 9 years!

So, the first bitcoin buyer is the best role model out there, and now he's a billionaire!

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is valuable because it's rare. When people don't look at it, they don't care.

The same is true of bitcoin.",1597653312,3,1

iba2ei,Beneficial-Guitar-77,Is Bitcoin a virtual currency?,"I believe that you are relatively familiar with the currency, so today I will give you a chat, bitcoin is not a virtual currency?

First of all, know about it. Bitcoin is a kind of digital currency in the form of P2P, which was first proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Point-to-point transmission means a decentralized payment system.

, unlike most of the currency, the currency monetary authorities don't depend on the specific issue, it is according to the specific algorithm, through a lot of calculation, the currency economic use of the P2P network composed of many nodes in a distributed database to identify and record all transactions, and the use of cryptography security currency to ensure that each link of the design.

The second is how to buy and invest bitcoin safely.

In fact, there are a lot of cheaters, there are also a lot of pits, so still need to see other people's posts, more accumulation of experience, to participate in the discussion.

Bitcoin real-time quotes are available on many bitcoin trading platforms. Users can search one to see the real-time quotes. Now, many platforms also list how many bitcoins have been mined and how many have not been mined.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, the quotation of Bitcoin and the trend of stocks are similar. Users can look at the trend of bitcoin by time, day K, week, month and year. Through these graphs, they can know its recent trend, but it is difficult to predict its future trend from the chart, and there are essential differences between Bitcoin and stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

The future of Bitcoin:

&amp;#x200B;

ChamathPalihapitiya, CEO of social capital and a former Facebook executive, was an early bitcoin investor.

He bought a lot of cryptocurrencies in 2013, when the price of bitcoin was around $80 per coin, and he claimed that at one point he owned 5 per cent of the entire bitcoin monetary base.

&amp;#x200B;

In a recent discussion with MorganCreek Digital partner AnthonyPompliano, Palihapitiya Shared his views on the state of the global economy and the different options governments have for getting things back on track.

Beyond that, Palihapitiya describes how Bitcoin is bearing the benefits of the great economic crisis of the 2020s.

&amp;#x200B;

While he stressed that Bitcoin is still not widely available today, Palihapitiya stressed that its chances of success as a global reserve currency have increased in the past few months.

&amp;#x200B;

Asked about her thoughts on Bitcoin at a time of global economic turmoil, Palihapitiya stressed that the currency is not ready for a golden age.

&amp;#x200B;

""It's still a speculative tool,"" Says Palihapitiya. ""It's too speculative for its reliability.""

""If you want to prove that it should replace fiat money, then you have to pay attention to the volatility of the dollar.

You can't replace it with something that is volatile and has nine squares.

It's not going to work.""

&amp;#x200B;

Palihapitiya is quick to add that traditional fiat money has become an important pillar of the way companies operate today, given its relative stability.

In his view, bitcoin's volatility makes it impossible to continue.

&amp;#x200B;

""\[Extreme volatility\] has pushed \[bitcoin\] into the space between day traders and speculators,"" Says Palihapitiya.

""And right now, this is where we are.

We're in that slum.""

&amp;#x200B;

In Palihapitiya's view, day traders and speculators must be wiped out to rid Bitcoin of the slum of volatile assets.

Beyond that, the interests of long-term holders must be preserved, and a collapse of traditional financial infrastructure is increasingly likely.",1597651006,0,1

**'We are going to pay the price': Famed investor Jim Rogers sounds the alarm on central bank money-printing and exorbitant debt — and warns the next market meltdown will be 'the worst in my lifetime'**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vz4k1wrixhh51.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=581799c91aefe0440481984f7c13586fe3639a20

&amp;#x200B;

Jim Rogers, the chairman of Rogers Holdings, thinks unprecedented amounts of debt will exacerbate the next economic downturn. 

Rogers points the finger at global central bank policy as the cause for his concern.

Rogers is joined in his view by David Hunter, the chief macro strategist at Contrarian Macro Advisors, who expects an 80% decline in stocks.

When the market started to unwind back in late February, the Federal Reserve battened down the hatches and threw just about everything they possibly could at the problem in response. 

As a refresher, here's some of what the Federal Reserve has been up to since the crisis shuttered huge swaths of the US economy:

&amp;#x200B;

Cut interest rates to zero

Announced unlimited quantitative easing

Started purchasing corporate bonds 

Announced an initiative to buy state and local bonds

The market response? A violent rally.

&amp;#x200B;

Since bottoming out on March 23, the S&amp;P 500 is now trading about 50% higher.

&amp;#x200B;

And the US central bank — and others around the world, for that matter — are showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

But Jim Rogers, the chairman of Rogers Holdings, thinks the repercussions stemming from these actions will be severe. 

&amp;#x200B;

""The next time we have a problem and we are having it now, it is going to be the worst in my lifetime,"" he said in an Economic Times interview.

&amp;#x200B;

""It is a simple statement. The debt is much, much, much higher now. It has to be worse.""

&amp;#x200B;

To Rogers, the US — as well as countries around the world — are enacting short-term solutions in response to the pandemic that will result in long-term pain. Although central bank policies have been successful in propping up financial markets thus far, Roger's sees a bleak future.

&amp;#x200B;

""Nearly every country in the world is printing and spending lots of money now and that money has to go somewhere. It is going into the markets and that is what has happened,"" he said. ""However, the debt is going through the roof everywhere, the money printing is everywhere and eventually, we are going to pay the price.""

&amp;#x200B;

Roger's assessment of the current landscape is similar to that of David Hunter, the chief macro strategist at Contrarian Macro Advisors, who expects an 80% decline in stocks when investor exuberance from central bank stimulus finally wears off. Hunter cites ""debt beyond anything we can ever manage,"" aiding and culminating in a subsequent ""bear market of historic proportions."" 

&amp;#x200B;

""There's a lot of things you can't reach with money, and a lot of things you can't fix,"" Hunter added.

&amp;#x200B;

Rogers agrees.

&amp;#x200B;

""The US market has been going up for over 10 years, the longest in American history and it was sort of a bubble there, waiting to end,"" Rogers said. ""Everything was going straight up for a while because of all the money printing and the market was due for a correction or for something to happen and along came the virus, but something always comes along.""

&amp;#x200B;

""We have these problems every few years. The next is going to be horrible.""",1597641237,38,1

this is a post talking about an hypothesis, so please no fear or hate, I'm just writing this to know other opinions, don't take this as an end-of-the-world warning.

We know how much the chinese people are involved into BTC: more than half of the BTC is mined in China, they even built mini power plants to use the energy to mine BTC.

Also, we don't know the identity of the creator/creators, who claimed to create the BTC to stand against the big FIAT system.

What if the Chinese gov't invented the BTC? If they had more than a half of the network, might they control it? What benefits would they get from this? Could they contr the ""anarchic"" currency in the shadows, like the banks control the FIATs today? What do you think?",1597605001,21,1

Unfortunately, although it is configurable, most nodes take the default config as gospel so low fee TXNs don't propagate through the network to the miners.

Why not have allow lower fee TXNs into the mempool, or make the floor more dynamic like:

```
if(mempool.size &lt; _10_MB) {
   min_relay_tx_fee = min_relay_tx_fee &gt;&gt; 1;
}
```

Just seems like eventually, if the market price keeps rising, that it might make since to lower the floor to give miners more TXNs to choose from.  I'm sure a miner would prefer a low-fee pool to an empty one.",1597601522,38,1

i9g9so,evanlinjin,Question Regarding Signatures in Transactions.,"Recently I've been reading the book Mastering Bitcoin, 2nd Edition by Andreas M. Antonopoulos and I have a questions regarding signatures that authenticate transactions.

So as I understand, signatures are appended with a `SIGHASH` flag. If this `SIGHASH` value is set as `NONE (0x02)`, the receiver can choose the outputs in which the transaction will send bitcoin to.

But, if this is so, doesn't it mean that once this transaction is broadcasted, and before it is mined into a block, the miner (or anyone) can modify this transaction to be sent to an address that they own?

So essentially, setting `SIGHASH` to `NONE` and broadcasting the transaction is basically donating to the miner who is lucky enough to mine the next block? And so, setting `SIGHASH` to `NONE` is really a useless feature?

I hope I have understood correctly. Thank you all in advance.",1597383321,1,1

But the gov is purposefully vague on what is considered business income, and could easily classify your crypto profits as business income. They state ""any intentions of profit"" is considered business income. Could easily pin you with ""you bought crypto with the intention of profiting"".

Why is this important? You get taxed twice as much with business income vs capital gains. Say you made 1M in profit. Take home pay is 770K if declared as capital gains, vs 500K take home pay if declared business income.

i9b8vg,smokiboki87,Wallet-Check Idea,"Hi All, 

&amp;#x200B;

I had an idea, which is probably not entirely new, but would like to share with you guys/get your input. 

&amp;#x200B;

How effective would it be to have a website/service where we could report, identify and search quickly the status of a BTC Wallet Address? 

&amp;#x200B;

My thought is to have a directory in a single website (or app for that matter), where you could enter a BTC wallet address and verify whether this wallet has ever been hacked or is a known hacker's wallet or if it is a legitimate wallet.

Basically, there would be at least 3 status categories of wallets: Legit | Unverified | Compromised

To get a Legit wallet you would have to apply and there would need to be extensive research done to verify the standing of the wallet status. A certain amount of age would be required on a wallet, i.e. newly created wallets would not be eligible. A certain amount of legitimate transactions would have to have occurred on a wallet. No known transactions of accepting BTC from previous hacked wallets could be eligible for Legit wallets.

An Unverified wallet would probably be the case for many wallets in the beginning. Mostly wallets that haven't really been ran through the identification process. 

Compromised wallets would be the unhealthy ones which are either hacked wallets, or have had transactions with hacked wallets, or are known hackers' wallets. I.e. they stole BTC from your legit wallet and sent to a hacked wallet.

Perhaps there could be more tiered levels to each of the above...

&amp;#x200B;

Reporting a wallet: To report a wallet, you would start a claim process, and the claim would have to be extensively reviewed by an independent team with several pieces of evidence submitted. i.e. you wouldn't be simply sending a claim and the wallet you reported is all of a sudden registered or flagged. There would be some work involved in identifying and legitimizing that the wallet being reported has in fact been hacked and or is a hacker's wallet where a hacker has sent themselves BTC to. 

Once a wallet is reported and confirmed hacked (some cases would probably be easier to prove than others). The hacked wallet address' (since they're public) could be boycotted for future use and hopefully rendered useless, or at least 'hard to use'.

Conversely you would be able to run a report on the status of a wallet to see whether it is legitimate or not. Perhaps one day banks or legitimate institutions could run background checks and only be accepting from Legit wallets that have been verified through an extensive process. Perhaps buying big things one day like a car or a house could only be done with a Legit wallet which would require a long standing to achieve.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

PS I've been hacked before (for a small amount luckily), because like a noob I didn't set up proper 2FA's. Nonetheless the feeling sucks. So I thought perhaps there is a way to identify and ""mark"" wallets in a sense to identify such hackers and hopefully one day create a standard that can protect the crypto community by boycotting hackers' wallets and rendering them useless. 

This would in turn create a higher value for legitimate wallets and users (which helps BTC's value increase since even less coins that are hacked would be accepted hopefully). It also hopefully would deter hackers since they would be limited (one day) with what they can purchase with their wallets. 

&amp;#x200B;

It can’t be overstated how much you’d be helping me. I know I fucked up, but I’m not ready to give up on my life. And I’m actually broke because of my habits and my mindset I guess

If anyone wants to help me, with this, I am also looking for a mentor. I am loyal and a straight shooter. I mean I know this sounds crazy, but if you’ve ever experienced something out of the ordinary that’s enough to show you how things be in life then you already know.

My plan is to give the bitcoin to clear any remaining karmic debt and only in exchange for the abuse to stop

And then I want to dedicate my life towards reinventing myself and helping others. It may take the help of a mentor. 

Will anyone help me, please?",1597356411,8,1

i98e7o,Nest_Fan,"Building the Infrastructure for the Future Decentralized Financial Market, Coinbase Included HBTC.Com Debut DeFi Project - Nest Protocol","As the world’s leading regulatory compliant digital asset exchange, Coinbase sets one of the most stringent requirements for digital asset listing which includes technical evaluation of projects, legal and risk analysis, market supply and demand analysis, and crypto-economics. Coinbase holds a strong reputation in the digital asset industry, and thus the “Coinbase Standard” is considered as the industry benchmark for other digital asset projects, and the market has even seen the “Coinbase effect”.

On July 25 2020, Coinbase quietly launched the pricing chart of a decentralized oracle project, NEST Protocol (NEST), into its portal. Although Coinbase has yet to announce the inclusion of the project in its evaluation list, it represents a keen interest in the DeFi sector, and particularly in the DeFi price oracle projects.

NEST Protocol is the rising star in the decentralized price oracle sector

Decentralized financial services offered by the current mainstream DeFi platforms such as MakerDAO, Compound, dYdX, etc. rely heavily on the market data provided by the oracle projects. Oracle projects act as reliable information sources to feed these price data to other DeFi Projects, connecting the price data from the centralized world to the DeFi space. As such, the price oracle is an integral part of the decentralized financial services infrastructure.

Traditionally, the price oracle collects data from different platforms and feeds these data points to the DeFi space to create data reference points to enable them to function properly. However, many problems currently exist in the DeFi space, for example, blockchain network congestion, malicious attacks, wild market fluctuations, and other factors that may cause the data given by the price oracle to deviate from the true market data. These ultimately cause users to trade on wrong information in the DeFi space and increases such transaction costs.

Decentralized finance requires a fast, secure, and reliable price oracle. The birth of the decentralized price oracle is the embodiment of the blockchain industry’s thinking, and the current market projects offering decentralized price oracle services which includes NEST Protocol, Chainlink, Band Protocol, Tellor, Witness, Oraclize, and many others.

The innovation of NEST-Price is that every data point has been agreed upon by market validators, in line with the blockchain consensus mechanism. NEST-Price synchronizes the off-chain price in a highly decentralized manner, creating real and valid price data on-chain. This is the unique differentiator between NEST-Price and other price oracles.

Compared with other price oracle projects, NEST also has other features and advantages, such as the proposed peer-to-peer quotation matching as well as its unique verifier verification structure, making NEST more resilient to malicious attacks, resulting in a more decentralized network, and it’s on-chain prices closer to the fair market price. All of this has resulted in the NEST Protocol becoming a rising star in the DeFi price oracle sector.  
HBTC.com selects high-quality projects to list and partnering with NEST to promote the development of DeFi ecosystem

During the selection of quality assets, exchanges like [HBTC.com](http://hbtc.com/) and Coinbase adhere to the principle of a rigorous selection of assets from different projects to enable a proper range of digital assets. At the same time, in order to solve existing pain points in the digital asset industry, which currently lacks a market-making management solution, HBTC.com also has launched its own “coin listing crowdsourcing [liquidity initiative](https://medium.com/hbtcofficial/hbtc-launches-bat-liquidity-crowdfunding-listing-plan-redefine-the-exchange-listing-model-566858fdf1dd) “, redefining the exchange market making model.

HBTC.com, through its coin listing strategy, effectively reduces the problem of low liquidity in the early stages of high-quality projects, ensuring the smoothness of the user experience, and achieves a win-win situation for traders, the community, and the respective trading platform. These initiatives, coupled with reliable user protection and a responsible attitude, have earned a positive reputation among users.

Since its inception, the HBTC.com exchange has been committed to the discovery of both quality and promising digital asset projects. At a time when DeFi is growing rapidly, HBTC.com has a unique perspective for the decentralized price oracle sector and has prioritized NEST as a premium partner to debut the project alongside with its global branding upgrade. In addition, HBTC.com has [100% proof of reserves](https://hbtc.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046287754-HBTC-100-Proof-of-Reserve) for traders to validate the existence of assets via the Merkle tree, which brings transparency to the extreme.

In May 2020, NEST token delivered a 883.29% of return, at its peak, after its global debut on HBTC.com. At present, HBTC Exchange addresses holding NEST token accounts in a total of 141 million, ranked first in the overall network. At the same time, the HBTC Exchange network exclusively releases NEST staking mining and data show that NEST 24-hour turnover has reached $20.4 million.

Post-listing of the NEST token, HBTC.com has also listed DeFi projects such as DF, OKS, NEST, SWTH, JST, NVT, and other DeFi projects with market potential; some projects have achieved astonishing performance in the secondary market.

HBTC.com’s path to DeFi: developing public chains to prepare for the future ecosystem breakout.

In terms of the DeFi product and ecosystem infrastructure, HBTC has deployed HBTC Chain since launched in 2018, an infrastructure designed for decentralized finance and DeFi business with patented Bluehelix decentralized cross-chain clearing and custody technology.

The HBTC Chain is the DeFi ecosystem infrastructure that the team has spent a significant amount of effort to build. It is based on decentralization and community consensus and integrates cryptography and blockchain technologies to support decentralized association-based governance capabilities at the technical level. Based on decentralized key management, combining various cryptography tools including ECDSA, commitment, zero-knowledge proof, and multi-party computation, It implements the distributed private key generation and signature for cross-chain assets among all validators. On top of that, this technology can realize light-weight and non-intrusive cross-chain asset custody. On the clearing layer, HBTC Chain employs BHPOS consensus and horizontal sharding mechanisms to achieve high-performing transaction clearing, and implementation of OpenDex protocol to help the development of the DeFi ecosystem.

In addition, with the success experience of Bluehelix Cloud SaaS and white label solutions and the HBTC Brokerage system, HBTC’s public chain also innovatively supports CEX+DEX mixed matchmaking model and OpenDex protocol and proposes the three-tier node system which consists of standard node + consensus node + core node. This structure provides HBTC public chain certain advantages in terms of performance and cross-chain transactions. Users can easily establish a DEX with OpenDex protocol at nearly zero cost, and all DEX will share the liquidity and support customized user interface and trading parameters. The trading experience can be completely comparable to centralized spot exchanges.

With the launch of its test network, it is now possible to develop various DeFi applications on the HBTC public chain, such as decentralized swap, so that private keys are not controlled by any party; no KYC, which can prevent personal information leakage; and asset security through the setting of invalidation, cancellation of transactions and other functions, cross-chain asset mappings, such as the ability to issue cross-chain cBTC or other chain tokens, fully decentralized asset mapping contracts, and 100% reserves.

Conclusion

In the past few months, the DeFi market has been extremely active, the price of DeFi tokens has been rising, and a new round of competition with the centralized exchanges has started. HBTC Chain relies on the powerful technology of Bluehelix and [HBTC.com](http://hbtc.com/), giving all public chains the ability to interconnect, and put into both DeFi and SaaS levels. Undoubtedly, as one of the first exchanges to build the DeFi ecosystem, HBTC is leading the breakout in the current DeFi craze and has now become the first choice of users to engage with quality DeFi projects.

It said "" The lack of explicit coverage of peer-to- peer transactions via private / unhosted wallets was a source of concern for a number of jurisdictions. Jurisdictions noted that transfers to the unregulated peer-to-peer sector could present a leak in tracing illicit flows of virtual assets. (...) This includes banning or denying licensing of platforms if they allow unhosted wallet transfers, introducing transactional or volume limits on peer-to-peer transactions or mandating that transactions occur with the use of a VASP or financial institutions. ""


Finally, FATF started to consider banning p2p trading. If we can't use private wallet software, every transaction would be fully monitored by government.
Also we can't do anything when coins which deposited in the exchange are stolen by hackers.

idr934,chuck_portis,Fast &amp; Cheap Bitcoin Buy+Withdraw with ACH?,"Hey guys,

I'm trying to send money to a friend using Bitcoin.  It's a decent amount ($4,000 USD).  It's not a scam or anything, he's a good friend of mine.  We want to use BTC because he's in a different country right now.

I normally use CashApp, but this is too much money for CashApp.  With Coinbase, it seems like my money will get stuck for up to 5 days if I send them an ACH.  Also, I don't want to get locked into a BTC rate, because I owe the money to my friend in USD.  If Bitcoin price drops in between now and when I can actually withdraw the coins, then it's a frustrating expense.

Are there any exchanges that allow me to fund with USD via ACH, and will allow me to withdraw $4,000 USD in BTC?  Let me know.  Cheers!",1597989599,6,1

I receive some Bitcoin using the wallet and then buy some stuff so I spend some of the Bitcoin in my wallet and do this for a while. The wallet is grooming my Bitcoin use. Creating new addresses and managing UTXOs. Then my house gets flooded and ruins my trezor. Luckily I have the seed still. Now I decide to buy a ledger to replace the now dead trezor and use the seed to recover my wallet. How does the new ledger know all of the addresses I'm using on my old trezor wallet?

idn6j8,BigTittyEmoGrandpa,The person behind the Pineapple Fund (who donated over 5000 BTC to charity) has lost their keys/wallet,"&gt; About PineappleFund.Me
&gt;
&gt; It's been over 2 years since my mission and the end of the charity project pineapplefund.org, where I donated most of my Bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have never chased wealth or fame, so all my donations have been anonymous. 
&gt; 
&gt; Life is a series of events, sometimes mystical.
&gt; 
&gt; Briefly about my situation, now my family and I are in quite a difficult situation! I lost access to a laptop with a lot of information that was part of my life, as well as access to a cold wallet with more than 2000 bitcoins! These were my last savings at Bitcoin. 
&gt; 
&gt; It just so happens that now I have to start my whole life again, and I have a long and hard way to go.
&gt; I really hope that I can get access to my cold wallet.
&gt; 
&gt; I need about 25 BTC to solve my problems and develop further, it's only almost 0.05% of the amount I donated from the Pineapple Fund.
&gt; 
&gt; I never thought that I would ever have to ask for help because I had a fortune, but there are different situations in life, and today I want to ask everyone who cares about my activities and everyone who has received help from me. 
&gt; Friends, I have been kind to you and I really hope that you will answer me the same and help me in my difficult situation. I believe in the boomerang effect.
&gt; Do not remain indifferent!  
&gt; 
&gt; I believe in miracles and kindness, because lately I have been helping to believe in miracles and to do good for many people around the world! 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ♥, Pine

I was wondering what happened with this project, so I looked up the website and saw this. I feel that such an unhappy turn of events for what was an admirable project deserves more attention, maybe the users of /r/bitcoin can get the word out to data/key retrieval experts or anyone else that could assist? I haven't seen this posted here before.

I’ve heard of Lightning Network (LN), which I find an interesting concept of solving the unending debate of buying a cup of coffee for BTC and has accelerated transactions too. I’m lured into trying this tech but my concerns are, should I put all my head into it when we all know most merchants haven’t embraced it yet?

The price at that time for a bitcoin was around $13 each. We had more than 2000 coins came through the website that Christmas. We talked about holding them, but then bills and running a business got in the way. Today those 2000 coins would be worth $22 Million dollars. If only we had held on.

“Global stocks drift as Sino-US tensions weighed on optimism generated by Wall St's tech-driven rally. Asia chip stocks lower after #US announced new set of curbs on Huawei access to US technology. Bonds gain w/US 10y yields at 0.68%. Gold at $1993, Bitcoin stays &gt;$12k at $12,254.”
 
Since April, Bitcoin has seen notable correlation with the S&amp;P 500. Due to the plunge of all asset classes at the end of the first quarter of 2020, Bitcoin and stocks climbed upwards in tandem.
 
Buyers Are Propping Bitcoin Up, a Positive Sign
The correlation between the stock market and Bitcoin has been intact in the past week because of BTC’s abrupt surge to $12,400. On August 17, BTC surged from $11,775 to as high as $12,486 on Coinbase, recording a 3.2% gain.
 
Researchers at market analysis firm CryptoCompare said that buyers were proactively pushing Bitcoin upwards in the last 48 hours. They said:
 
“The percentage of Bitcoin bought vs sold surged before the first move up past 12k, suggesting buyers were propping the price up. Similarly, the second rally also saw the percentage of bought vs sold BTC rise before the price, again suggesting buyers were proactively pushing the price up.”
 
The U.S. stock market has risen in the past two days due to optimism towards the performance of “Big Tech.”
 
The stocks of Tesla, Alphabet, and Amazon increased by 11.2%, 0.77%, and 1.09%, respectively, buoying tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq.
 
Pre-market data show the U.S. stock market awaits a slight gain at market open, with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq both set up for 54-point and 37-point gains.
 
The sentiment is positive, but will there be a pullback in September?
The price of Bitcoin is continuing to go up in tandem with the stock market, but some analysts are cautious about September. Historical data shows that September is typically the worst-performing month for Bitcoin.
 
If both the U.S. stock market and Bitcoin retrace, like gold, #cryptocurrency analyst Edward Morra suggested that market turbulence might emerge. He wrote:
 
“If BTC and SPX will resolve like Gold did - then decent correction for BTC is in September, for SPX - November. For BTC - September is usually the worst months histrionically, for SPX - elections in November so might cause some turbulence.”
 
For now, the confluence of a simultaneous rally between Bitcoin and stocks and the noticeable increase in buying demand is buoying the sentiment around Bitcoin.",1597883633,5,1

However berkshire hathaway never did it so the price goes on for 6 figures per share. As we now there is no splitting of btc can we use the same logic for 50k or above price.

Crypto.com allows you to ""stake"" your coins in order to get additional returns on top of the market fluctuations. For example, currently I have my ethereum staked for 5.5% returns and CRO coin got 16% returns. Those are GUARANTEED. They also offer an incredible debit card that gives you up to 5% cash back. PLUS, purchasing fees are waived through their site through September!

To the point - by staking your coins you're unable to withdraw them for a certain period of time (1-6 months of your choosing), and so therefore I'm not able to withdraw my money and don't really care that the crypto market is down today. Usually I'd probably freak out and cash out at a loss then be pissed tomorrow when it's back up. Plus, I'm still getting my returns anyways 😎

icstg1,MaudeWoolum,I’m testing Bitcoin indicators from the top 0.02% analysts,"Hey everyone, here’s my story. I’m in crypto since 2017, I hold a few Bitcoins and some alts, and I’m using a part of my salary to do a dollar-cost-averaging strategy for Bitcoin because I believe that longterm crypto will become a huge market. The only problem I have is that between these massive bull-runs (basically the end of 2017, the first half of 2019 and now), there is too much time passing in simple holding. So I’m itching to have some trades, and I’ve participated in several signals group without any positive result.

&amp;#x200B;

And then I’ve found the company researching Bitcoin (it’s not advertising so I won’t share the name of this company unless you ask). For a few years, they’re collecting price predictions for BTC from 100,000 analysts from different countries competing for financial prizes. The company claims they have gathered a massive amount of data, so they started offering predictions of the top 10 analysts out of 100,000. I found this exciting and subscribed. I’ve joined last week and had a +10% profit (I’m using 20x leverage, so it’s +200% to my account) the previous week using a base strategy they shared.

if12py,PrimitiveEarthling,Is this correct regarding the bid/ask spread?,"Hey fellas,

Trying to understand. When looking at the bid-ask spread, is all of this correct?: 

* The bid price represents the highest amount buyers are currently willing to buy for.
* The ask price is the lowest sellers are currently willing to sell for. 
* If a buyer places a market order, they will pay the ask price. (they are a taker)
* If a seller places a market order, they will get the bid price. (they are a taker)
* If a buyer places a limit order, if it's fulfilled, they will pay the bid price they set. (they are a maker)
* If a seller places a limit order, if it's fulfilled, they will get the ask price they set. (they are a maker)
* So the spread essentially reflects the limit orders on the books. 

I read somewhere that exchanges make money off of the spread — the difference between the ask and bid price. How does this work??

When looking at the value of BTC, you usually just see a *ticker* price. Does this more closely resemble the current ask price, or the current bid price, or somewhere in between? Why?",1598179121,8,1

iey1kx,Natalie_Wells,We found Satoshi Nakamoto,"Hello everyone,

My name is Natalie and my husband and I discovered the identity of the man who utilized the alias ""Satoshi Nakamoto""; the founder of Bitcoin and whose involvement with the creation of the Blockchain has changed the world for better. I'm here to ask the community two simple questions:

1. Can my family and I benefit, financially, from releasing this information?
2. If we decide to release the information regarding the actuality of his identity, what would be the consequences of doing so in regards of the man himself and/or his work?

I'd like to sum up the reason why my husband and I are asking these questions: My husband and I decided to seek 'Satoshi's' identity in the hopes of contacting him and in exchange for handing over our gathered information, his collective footprint(s), and network of data in which assisted with the conclusion of his identity, he'd assist us with my family's financial burden(s) regarding my daughter's medical expenses and consequential livelihood expenditures.

My daughter is a toddler and suffers from trigeminal neuralgia; she needs a microvascular decompression procedure and we cannot afford it due to the loss of our health insurance, my husband's occupation due to the covid-epidemic, and we have utilized nearly all of our financial leverage already on related medical expenditures.

To be clear, we are not using this as a platform for charity. We'll share no contact information openly, there will be no ""donate to our wallet"" nonsense, and this isn't my real name and my husband's identity will not be shared either. We have this information, in which we've successfully verified, and we intended on having dialog with ""Satoshi"" but have since been unsuccessful with. The only response was a denial - any and all follow-up communication(s) have been ignored. We feel like our backs are against the wall and would appreciate any and all input concerning where to go from here.

This venture my husband and I decided to task ourselves with lasted eight (8) days before the suspected identity had far too much correlative data with ""Satoshi"" that any additional gathered information would have been unnecessary. We're both professionally adapted with informational gathering and the legalities of discovery so it's important to note that all information gathered on the suspect's identity and his correlation with the alias ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" was obtained through legal, open sourced means of free tools and techniques available to every one. We were not intrusive nor did we pry into any unethical means of research. The closest advocates of research we utilized within our conclusive portion of our document was sharing third-party correlative data with an ""Torrent-invite"" hack from 2013 in which we found publicly available.

The man who owned the alias of ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" is younger than suspect. He is of Asian decent (Chinese, not Japanese)  and a United Kingdom citizen. He went to a U.K. university and took photographs for his university's paper/year-end book(s). He plays the piano, likes cats, worked and briefly lived on the West Coast of the United States of America, is still heavily involved in decentralization and FOSS projects. He is, also, unquestionably remarkable and intelligent for hiding in plain-sight and for his past and current projects.

We admire him sincerely - which is why it's important that you all answer as honestly as possible concerning the consequences of releasing this information. We are not malevolent people nor can we allow this information to negatively impact the man in any sense of the imagination. We haven't found any warrants or bounties, Government agencies, corporations or organizations (etc), wanting to know his current whereabouts for negative reasons. But, if we are wrong, please let us know by means of messaging here or simply posting on his posting because we will not release any information to anyone whatsoever if the slightest harm or negative inquiry is caused on the man. We can deal with the inconvenience of exposure (we are near bankruptcy and our daughter means everything to us) as a consequence of our information being released, but nothing else.

Any and all information concerning the inquiry of our gathered information can and will be shared by private means of communication. If there aren't sincere liabilities concerning his welfare as a result of our research being released and if someone and/or an organization that would like to help us out in exchange for said information, then we'd love to do so as formally as possible, whether through an escrow exchange to insure the buyer of the information is satisfied with our finding(s), or through any other private means of exchange.

We are not interested in any media interviews, random questions, publicity or any self-indulgence through the exposure of the man's identity. We'll remain anonymous and would love for every one to respect our plea for anonymity.

Feel free to private message us for further information. Thank you.

I finally bought a bit of bitcoin. Heck, I even bought a few shitcoins. But I learnt my lesson - bitcoin is gold. Again it drifted away from my mind as other pressing issues came up. The recent surge in price has brought me back again. However, I am not going to experiment with defi - I am not smart enough for it. 

I mean to hodl from now on and keep converting fiat to Bitcoin. But, for now I have to liquidate whatever bitcoin I hodl as I have to take care of a few essential payments. So I am selling my gold which is Bitcoin.

ieniqq,spark-404,"""Tax law written in code"""," Is it possible to create a decentralised government? Most definitely – it is. When the right people who understand the idea are in power, then everything is possible. When a certain process in a tax system begins, a society will understand how much they have been robbed by those in power. 

The system I am writing about will be created from scratch and updated by programmers worldwide, while government officials will be able to enter data into it. It will be necessary to implement a new digital currency with which the new tax system will be linked. Digital and national money will coexist and complement each other. I want programmers to have real impact on a national economy by optimising the tax system. 

I am aware of the consequences of this act, as it boils down to programmers writing the tax law. All you have to do is to give them room for action. Politicians have repeatedly proved that they are inept in creating tax law and that they are untrustworthy.  

My doubts would be whether or not to give them total power over the system, where all changes, by the way of most programmers, are immediately implemented without consulting the authorities. 

In fact, we do not need geniuses with academic titles before their names in power, but people who can tell good from bad, truth from lies, grain from chaff.  

I think this is a direction worth taking, and I hope that there will be people interested in creating such a system, whether or not your efforts ever see the light of day.

I want to spend the dust to do my part in helping UTXO bloat. I could see where if you spent the dust, that might give a slight indicator as to what wallet software you're using, e.g. whether its a wallet with good UTXO control, but other than that it seems that dusting attacks are pointless.

Thinking about mass adoption, it will be likely that a few percentage of users will run a LN always on full node with a remote mobile connection. The majority will simply run a mobile wallet that connects to someone else node. 

In this situation, a customer may open a 100k sats channel with his favorite shop, but once the founds starts flowing from customer to merchant it will be hard for the merchant to use them. The reason being that it will be very unlikely to have the mobile client online and open for routing a transaction when the merchant wants to use its founds. 

What I think is that merchants will likely close customers connections to cash the sats on-chain. 

Because of this, a merchant may prefer only channels with well connected hub to have a better availability for it’s founds.

Bitcoin is also loosely translated as ""bitgold.""

For the first time since January 2018, the average number of daily active addresses for bitcoin exceeded 1 million.

The number of daily active addresses is the number of active addresses that count the transaction sender or receiver in the Bitcoin network.

Public sentiment in the cryptocurrency market is growing, especially as investors seek to hedge against high inflation by investing in alternative assets such as Bitcoin and gold.

2. Practical: There is no need for bitcoin options to accumulate experience in simulated trading. Users can learn and test their trading strategies in actual combat.

Continuous trading: The bitcoin option contract can be continuously traded for 7\*24 hours. Besides, the daily price of Bitcoin fluctuates greatly, so there are more arbitrage opportunities and it is more practical.

What are the advantages?

ia2wjl,Dockin,Running My Own Tor Bitcoin Lightning Node,"I've been using my own bitcoin lightning/full node for about a month now and would like to share my findings as well as ask a few questions to the community.

For those that might be curious as to my setup, I am using a Lenovo M900 ThinkCentre with a 1 TB Samsung SSD and 32GB of ram. I'm actually running several VM's on it, for different reasons. One of which is the full Bitcoin/lightning node using Ubuntu Desktop in which I dedicate 8 GB to (more than enough) and most of my disk space to. I wanted a power efficient setup so that I could keep it running 24/7 and this is about as good as it gets short of a Raspberry Pi. When I only have my Bitcoin VM running, I'm consuming \~10 Watts. With everything else running it's \~30 Watts. I bought all of the equipment used (apart from the ram) so it was very cost effective.

**What I've learned in my experience:**

* You CAN setup a full Bitcoin (contributing node) and Lightning node to both run over the Tor network WHILE still being able to connect to it remotely from a mobile device on a different network. I've accomplished this using Orbot (Tor) for Android and Zeus - Bitcoin/Lightning Wallet for Android. Connected using lndconnect QR code.
* Your node can go offline momentarily or even for days even while you have channels open, and you won't run into issues when you boot it back up from what I've tried. I'll note that I only have 4 channels open at the moment, so don't take this as solid evidence.
* Zap desktop wallet is amazing for Linux. I haven't been able to use it on Android with Orbot though.. so I went with Zeus for this reason. It's also very good on mobile.
* Payments are easy to make once everything is setup. I've purchased some goods, donated to Johoe's Bitcoin Mempool (I use that site all the time. Big help), and bought some eGift cards annonomously.

**Questions:**

* Is it possible to close a channel (while the peer is online and the channel is online, not force closing) with a custom fee set? All of the channels I opened so far were opened using 1 sat per byte (lncli openchannel &lt;pubkey&gt; amount --sat\_per\_byte 1). This usually takes more than a day to open, but only costs about $0.02 to open. When I try to close a channel in a similar fasion (lncli closechannel --sat\_per\_byte 1 &lt;funding\_txid&gt; &lt;output\_index&gt;) it ignores the --sat\_per\_byte 1 parameter and sets the fee amount to an arbitrary number, not even related to the channel 'Commit Fee' or any set amount. Is the close channel fee just automatically chosen by network congestion? If so, this would really discourage me from opening many more channels.
* How dangerous is it to go offline for longer periods of time (say a week or month) with open channels? If I was to go back online after, is it possible that I might unintentionally broadcast an old channel state causing a loss of funds on my part?
* Is there a method of determining a connected peer nodes uptime history before opening a channel with them to prevent having to force close a channel due to their node going offline for a long period of time, thus having to pay high fees (Commit Fee) to force close?
* Is there a way to show transaction fees for lightning payments BEFORE they are paid? I had to pay over 100 satoshis once to send a lightning payment and there was no way of checking the transaction fee before the payment was sent out. Is there anything stopping people from charging say, 100000 satoshis to route a payment through their node without the user knowing beforehand?

Any info would be appreciated. If anybody has any question that they would like to ask me, feel free to ask!",1597474682,25,1

ia14p9,Ravi_Mishra,Investing in Bitcoin for the first time! Any tips highly appreciated 🙏,"Hello Bitcoiners,

I have been in crypto space for a while but have never invested. This is the first time I am going to invest in BTC. I also have some questions. Any answers or tips for me will be highly appreciated. You guys are very friendly and helpful, I am sure I will get the answers to my questions.

What I am going to do is, buy 10$ worth of bitcoin every week. Although, this is Lewis's but this is better than nothing and I also can't afford to invest more. As far as i know, this is smth called DCA (but I don't know what it is).

1) I am not going to buy bitcoin because I have a job and I get my payment in ETH. But, I will need to convert those Ethereum to bitcoin. Which exchange do you prefer? I mean is, if I exchange it on Binance, they will take half of the money ($5) as withdrawal fees which is very much. Other thing is, coinbase pro doesn't accept my ID so that i can complete my KYC there. So, where should I exchange it? Are there any other similar websites like coinbase Pro where there is no need of verification? 

2) Which day of the week is better for buying? I meant, on which day of the week should I schedule my bitcoin buying process? Or, everyday is good?

3) Is it worth investing in bitcoin right now? What I wanted to tell is, bitcoin is already at 12k and it is not pumping from there. Ethereum has just doubled in a month whereas bitcoin rose up only by 20%. I am getting a bit FOMO'ed in eth and therefore confused whether I should invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum?

Amy other tips will be highly appreciated from me! I am completely new to investment and doing some researches on it. But, want your opinions on these things.
Thank you.",1597465536,27,1

I imagine the price would include an external HDD that can be later used for other purposes + a marginal cost for the data. The data would be not pruned is course, so that the user can verify its integrity and authenticity. Or alternatively, the user can ship them a HDD and they ship it back filled with data for a much lower cost.

I tried searching the web for something like this, but I only found either unreasonably expensive stuff, or simply preinstalled full nodes with software included which complicates matters and is not exactly what I'm looking for.

What sites allow you to purchase bitcoin and send it to a wallet instantly, or within hours? Specifically an all in one site; where i can purchase my coin, and transfer to my wallet right away as waiting 7 days is just ridiculous.

I’ve stumbled on Bitwala, however i’m in California and not sure if i can use this as it’s broken down into euros. Please if any of you know of any sites that can let me buy the bitcoin and send it to my onion wallet in a day or hours, let me know! Thanks!",1597445108,39,1

i9vd9r,underhuggare,Lightning for noobs?,"I recently heard for the first time about the Lightning Network (LN). Whilst I find the concept very interesting,I still have some concerns. It seems like a massive risk and headache to run my own software and learn how to use Lightning and at the end of the day not a lot of merchants actually accept it anyways. I’m keen to test LN but I’m not a tech-y person and I fail to see how I can use this thing in the real world or do anything useful with it.

As far as my understanding goes, The Lighting Network solves the problem of the Bitcoin network taking too long to process transactions. This might be the technological breakthrough that Bitcoin was waiting for. I find the idea of transacting with Bitcoin immediately, without having to anxiously wait for my transactions to be confirmed on the Bitcoin blockchain thrilling. Maybe we will finally be able to use Bitcoin in our day-to-day lives? I’m sure that Bitcoin will become mainstream when people start using it in the real world and merchants start accepting it.

All that is great, but my main concern is, can we really use Lightning to pay for things in real life? Can I send Bitcoin over Lightning to my friends and family without them needing to understand how to use this thing? How the hell do I get started with Lightning without spending 2 days of technical deep-dive? I’ve heard of a few people trying to use the technology, but haven’t personally heard of anyone actually using it for anything meaningful. At most, I’ve met some people using the technology to make transactions between other lightning “power” users. But that’s all. 

I’ve heard of a few solutions that claim to make it “easy” and “useful” such as  “[Bluewallet](https://bluewallet.io/)”, “[Lastbit](https://lastbit.io/)”, and “[Fold](https://foldapp.com/)” but I’m unsure if they are worth my time at all.

I recently participated on the Bitcoin givaway that someone offered ($100 in Bitcoin, to whoever needs it most), and I was dismayed when the person who was supposed to be giving the Bitcoin away never responded, and it seemed like he ran away with the awards and karma.  
I have got in touch with this person, and here's the story so you know he's *not* a scammer/karma/award farmer:
He was supposed to arrive at his destination (camping) at 9PM, so he could announce the winner (he had already picked them and messaged them). When he arrived, service was very spotty (sometimes I have no service at all, when I'm camping), so he couldn't respond to the post. When he came back from the trip (or got service), he was banned from the subreddit by u/Bashco and couldn't make a followup post. The person who he contacted never responded. u/Bashco also never responded.

If he *was* a scammer, I don't think he would have ever bothered to answer my questions about his post, because there's no real point.

iffzns,satsthestandard,Bitcoin made me feel depressed.,"Learning more about why bitcoin was invented what it aims to solve made me feel depressed. Okay maybe not depressed, just very upset. Like knowing the reality of the current system, that were all slaves of it.

Tfw you wanna like start a revolution or something, like wtf. It's very eye openning it feels like much of my life questions is answered , and that the ""bitcoin fixes this"" idea is making more sense day by day. 

I am tho happy that bitcoin exists, but also fear it's possibility of failure. That the bad guys could prevail eventually. A full totalitarian government controlling societies, where individual's thinking is centrally planned. 

I think it's more depressing cause I dont have someone I know personally that shares my views. Most of em worships the government overlords. Thinking that more governments are the solution to everything. 

Not sure what to do next really, I do stack regularly but other than that idk. I got into the deep dark depressing part of the rabbit whole. I hope bitcoin succeeds..",1598233801,46,1

I mean like it was too much for me handle, this lockdown periods gave me more time to learn about this stuffs, every single day I realize more how broken the current world we live in. It's very depressing. Maybe not depressed really just upset.

The feeling when you finally learned that most problems society faces today stems from the fact we don't have sound money and that it is the governments that are the real enemy, it's like you wanna start a revolution or something. But then again most people still believed that what money is for the governments to decide.

At this point I feel like I need to do something for bitcoin to succeed, to atleast contribute to its success. You know that feeling where you wanna tell everyone how cool it is and how it solves pretty much everything. 

I've tried it before and none of em cared or probably misunderstood it maybe its also because on my end not being able to explain it properly, idk I was pretty new to bitcoin that time and overly enthusiastic about it. 

I feels like it's just all conspiracy to them. That were the ones that are brainwashed. Idk what to do next at this point. I do buy bitcoin regularly already, not sure if that's enough.. It sucks I don't have much free time to devote into contributing to bitcoin.",1598232684,0,1

I just got scammed the way I never even thought is possible ( some of you might heard about this but I never heard until today).

Decided to cash some money out thru Coinbase, logged-in and copied BTC wallet address thru built-in Copy function as it shows on the screenshot below.

Logged in Binance to sent the BTC to Coinbase and just pasted the address from the buffer without second thought. Pushed the transaction. 1hour later I realized that its different address and only first 4 symbols are same. Somehow my copy-paste buffer changed the address from right one to wrong one.

Money lost. No way to recover it. Please dont repeat my mistake do not blindly trust to copy-paste buffer , your computer could be infected with malware that swaps addresses and it will be too late when you realize that.

P.S:

Since Coinbase not showing whole address and first 4 symbols were the same it was very easy to overlook

igmwnk,NetgearX6S4000,My college essay on Bitcoin and computers. First Draft. Thought you all might like this.,"I always thought computers were simple. At their fundamental level, they are just 1s and 0s. An invisible dance of yes’s and no’s running through a sheet of silicon at billions of times per second. Computers are amazing and unique machines that will forever be apart of our lives. Our sheer dependence on computers motivated me to research the topic? As my understanding of this concept grew, so did my curiosity. I started researching computers as much as I could. I would spend hours a day browsing Youtube and reading articles just to satisfy my interest. That’s why when my dad first brought up the topic of bitcoin during my freshman year, I wasn’t surprised to hear his enthusiasm. I had learned much about this currency over my couple years of research, but I knew very little about how to actually make money off it. He had been tracking the price for a few months and was considering buying a few, just to see what would happen. Little did either of us know; the price of this virtual coin would multiply nearly 30 times in just a few short months.

A few weeks passed and eventually he brought up the topic of buying bitcoin again. His initial interest inspired me to look more into currency and how it worked. I told my dad there was another way to make money off of bitcoins: Bitcoin miners. These impressive and powerful computers are precisely optimized to earn these coins, and I knew I could make one. I explained how this was my once in a lifetime opportunity, like how he explained to me that he missed out on investing in Apple in the 80s. “It could be a money-printing machine,” I joked. With our excitement peaked, we decided to split the $2,000 investment 50/50, and I started the buying process.

I started the process by buying the parts of the machine. I had learned that like Legos, a computer consists of simple components to make the whole. However, unlike an ordinary everyday computer, ours would have a concentrated task. Mining bitcoin is not a complicated process for a computer to do. In essence, by completing simple math problems as quickly as possible, a computer process’  bitcoin transactions from around the world and is rewarded in a tiny fraction of a coin. As more and more transactions take place, the higher the demand for processing, and the higher the reward.  

I was lucky enough to know how to build the computer. However, what I was not prepared for was the constant troubleshooting and maintenance I would have to give to this project. Sometimes the computer would simply turn off randomly, sometimes a part was not detected, and other times it merely just ran at half its optimized rate. I learned how to fix issues where there was no logical reason for the problem. Like a calculator, I always thought a computer could never mess up. My hundreds of hours of troubleshooting and blind hope quickly changed my view. I put a vast amount of free time into the project, knowing that potential it had. After lots of hard work, long nights, and determination, I had finally completed my dream project.

I was proud of what I had created. The computer was placed in my room and was like a pet. The loud but rhythmic fans helped me fall asleep, and the heat kept me warm during the winter. From school, I would monitor the machine, and if it had run into an error, I would simply restart it from my phone. My plan was working, and in a little over half a year, our investment should turn into profit. In only a few months, we were already halfway to making our money back. We were lucky because the price of bitcoin itself had doubled since we started, going from nearly $10,000 to $20,000 in a few short months, but as I looked at my account, I had no bitcoin. A few days earlier, hackers had stolen $64 million dollars from the company I mined with.

I felt like a victim. I had done everything right. I built the computer perfectly, I managed everything, I put the time in, and I put the effort in. I was robbed, and I was discouraged. Forced with no other option, we restarted our operation. Bitcoin was still increasing in price, we thought, so there was no reason to stop now. Our operation had restarted and was going well, but for the first time since we started, the price of bitcoin was not doing so well. The bubble was about to burst. It began with my hack, which made national news and hurt the price. Although the price recovered in a few weeks, it was going down again, fast. Believing it would improve, my dad and I decided to hold and not sell. A month later, Bitcoin was back to $8,000 per coin. The fad was over, and we couldn’t even make a profit over our cost of electricity. Again, I was robbed. I did nothing wrong and still lost almost everything. I decided to put the computer in a box and wait a few months; however, the wait was worthless. The coin plateaued at about $10,000, and it simply was not sustainable to continue mining. A year later, we sold the computers for parts and managed to make back about half our initial investment. It was over.

I had lost over $1,000 and months of time and effort. However, as I moved on and started to reflect on the experience, I was the winner. I learned so much about computers and how they operate. In the end, I had learned many skills, from patience and compassion to planning and researching. I had learned not only to build a computer but to manage systems and multitask. I learned countless lessons and gained essential and unique skills that I hope will carry me throughout life. This unique experience has taught me to always keep trying at what I believe in. There’s always an award for doing whatever I think is right. I hope to bring these beliefs and lessons with me throughout life, as I learn and grow from what I was taught. Whenever people ask me what computers are, I always laugh and explain how a computer is just a bunch of simple lego bricks working together to do complicated tasks. However, inside I still have trouble answering this simple question. It is merely just parts working together, but a computer is so much more complicated and beautiful than that.

If any other currency is able to do so, wouldn't miners and any currency that doesn't adapt become more obsolete? From my understanding, mining is power and hardware intensive so if a currency was able to verify without needing to mine, wouldn't it force btc to adapt or become obsolete?

I read over the terms and I still don't know what term I violated. The chat representative wouldn't tell me either, which I find odd since I feel like my character was/is being disparaged. I understand it's a private business, but if I were to walk into a store and was told to leave for no apparent reason, I feel like I might have a case to take legal action since the only thing that I'm bring judged on is my appearance. 

It seems pretty brainless considering I've never used any of their services before and have no track record of being denied by any other crypto related businesses.

1. Diversification
2. Self-Sufficient asset(no action needed in case you've got your dividend &amp; etcetera)
3. Buying something you wouldn't be able otherwise(such as Chinesse / Japanesse stocks)

And where there is always indirect ownership of the stock as well as stocks in ETFs too, we just castrate Bitcoins biggest advantage on the market, you can not trade stocks and own them directly, so there is brokerage service, but putting Bitcoin on that field means willingly castrate BTC. 

Bottom line here is:

1. Indirect ownership, all the advantage erased
2. You simply can not rebalance bitcoin's share inside particular portfolio with ETF
3. You are paying fees to the fund and the exchange market although unlike with shares there is no changes in depository because in bitcoin's case it is - blockchain

While doing some research about you know who, strangely enough not Satoshi, I found this interesting paper [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3065723] published by a Nancy Nakamoto.

Why is this interesting?

Well it's ""Nancy Nakamoto"" the female pseudonymous entity equivalent to Satoshi.  Say what???

And because it's talking about ""centralising"" Bitcoin and also specifically mentioning that will not be SegWit or Bitcoin Cash and then goes on to talk about relational data models.   I find this interesting as this sounds suspiciously like Craig Wright as his current diatribe for Bitcoin.  Note the British English spelling of ""centralised"".  Then there's that savings of ""99.9999999947853%"" :P

""Nancy"" kindly supplies her email address and I have a feeling that the replies received from this address might be somewhat incredulous.

I could of course be wrong about the Craig Wright connection.

Thoughts please.",1598522906,2,1

ihho7l,fahim_mashraf,The Value of Bitcoin,"Hey All,

A lot of the times us Bitcoin enthusiasts are always questioned about where does Bitcoin gain its value from and why it should be worth what is now or what we expect it to be i.e. around hundreds of thousands.

I have tried to touch on this, relating it to our current financial system which is doomed to collapse. Some of the other things I have discussed:
1. How Bitcoin Works?
2. Why Bitcoin is one of the most undervalued asset of our time?
3. How to trade Bitcoin?
4. The Blockchain concept and Halving Concept

I would appreciate if you guys could give it a read here in my
[Blog](http://www.fahimahmadi.com/making-money-with-bitcoin/) and give me your feedback. Please do share it forward if you think it is worth it. Would be a great help! 😊

iirw79,jk_14r,"Ceterum censeo: In some yet undefined future - the halving must be removed. The question is not: if, but when (and how)","Bitcoin's mining ecosystem is saturated. Period.

The ASIC race has weakened as it has moved closer to the technological limits - achieving some kind of fragile balance. The best proof of this is Bitmain's search for new areas (vide: AI research)

After more than a decade, we are smarter than Satoshi at least in one area - we have the knowledge acquired over these more than ten years ...

**""Bitcoin should have had a 0.1% or 1% monetary inflation tax to pay for security.""** (Peter Todd):
https://www.google.com/search?q=peter+todd+inflation

If someone cannot accept the inevitability of this event right now - let him think if he would change his mind while he sees the consecutive halvings - after which the network hashrate drops half by half - and does not return to the previous level, ever. I suppose we can see that process in 4 years already...

And the trigger should be like this (of course adopted by general consensus):

If on X (e.g. 2016) blocks before the incoming halving the network difficulty is lower than 212016 blocks backward - the next halving should be removed - as a strictly destructive event now for the Bitcoin network (or greater X for smooth hardfork)

It would be an ""organoleptic"" determination of the optimal rate of inflation for the Bitcoin network - and there is simply no better way to determine it. Just don't belive such simplification, when is hard to find an optimum for something - the ultimate solution is zero. It's not.

Remember, that Bitcoin is not an entity detached from the reality. There are various limitations, e.g. nanometer-based technological processes limitations, there is a finite amount of cheap energy that can be obtained on a global scale, etc.) Bitcoin functions in certain realities - whether we like it or not.

Sooner or later the situation described above will get us. It is worth to prepare mentally for it - and not to start another war, but rather discuss it calmly. If, for example, 90% of the community considers that something is necessary for the development of bitcoin - such a change will take place.

For example, the theoretical exchange of ECDSA due to the threat of quantum computers - acceptance would take place at an express rate. It will be similar in this matter. Just it shouldn't be too late for corrective action.

The small inflation rate, decreasing continuosly and slowly, and last but not least: determined by reality - seems to be the most proper measure in this case.

Transcript: https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-08-19-socratic-seminar-signet/  

Intro:  

&gt; This is a Socratic Seminar organized by London BitDevs. We have a few in the past. We had a couple on [BIP-Schnorr](https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-06-16-socratic-seminar-bip-schnorr/) and [BIP-Taproot](https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-07-21-socratic-seminar-bip-taproot/) that were really good with Pieter Wuille, Russell O’Connor and various other people joined those. Videos and transcripts for that are up. For those who haven’t attended a Socratic Seminar before this isn’t a presentation. Kalle (All) is on the call which is great but this isn’t a presentation from Kalle this is a discussion. We have got a [reading list](https://pastebin.com/rAcXX9Tn) up that I have shared in various places on Twitter and on the YouTube. We’ll be going through those links and that will be the structure of the discussion. We will start off from basics. Early on is a great time for people who don’t know too much about Signet to participate. It will get more technical and we will go into the implementation details later. [...] As I said Kalle is here which is great. He knows more about Signet than probably anybody else on the planet.",1598695477,0,1

I had made a similar thread [100 days ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/glkadi/in_the_last_100_days_the_number_of_bitcoins_in/).

The following is a simple table showing the number of bitcoins in the GBTC as seen on its page [here](https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-trust/) on the given days.

|Date|Number of btc in GBTC|
|:-|:-|
|31 Dec 2017|170,000|
|31 Dec 2018|204,390|
|26 July 2019|239,513|
|26 Oct 2019|257798|
|7 Feb 2020 (100 days ago)|283,192|
|27 Apr 2020|312886|
|1 May 2020|323262|
|17 May 2020 |343954|
|3 July 2020 |386658|
|27 Aug 2020 (latest today)|422308| 

Number of bitcoins acquired in last ~100 days: 422308 - 343954=   78354

The rate of acquiring bitcoin in gbtc had accelerated after the start of April 2020, as you can see above in the table. At the rate of about **800 bitcoins per day** that GBTC has bought every day for last 100 days, the GBTC is buying Bitcoins equal to about 85% ( 783/900) of all supply of newly minted Bitcoin.

And GBTC is just one of the many ETF's that people who don't want to fiddle with private keys etc, can use to acquire Bitcoin, albeit the largest one.

In this period, the MNC Microstrategy has bought a fruther 22k Bitcoin. IMO, that was the buy that took the price from 9200 to 11k+ now.",1598691953,28,1

iif7cl,KingMe6,Finite Supply of Bitcoin,"So we keep hearing from pundits and hardcore bitcoiners that because the supply is finite, its a scarce asset and that is one of the principles of sound money. But the fact that you need to custody your coins, the fact that over time, some btc will be lost due to many reasons.....can we really think that bitcoin will become a currency? for example, if i have 4 kids and i give them my btc equally and they each have 3 kids who get their shares equally, there is a chance that 1/12 of those eventual inheriters will forget their seed phrase, and end up losing their btc into the ether. 

\- even with fiat, the fed recycles old dollars (good luck finding the old $20 bills anymore)

\-besides the QE and unlimited printing, the FED also literally puts fresh notes into circulation

\-if i lose or bury my notes or gold somewhere, someone will eventually find it, so its not really lost. the some cannot be said about bitcoin....if you forget your seed, that btc is gone. 

I want to get some thoughts for the distant future and how do you see bitcoin functioning as a currency if ultimately it will keep losing supply?",1598647663,17,1

iiec4v,parakite,Why I am still Bullish on Bitcoin After Hodling it for more than 4 years,"I started buying btc ( which I never sold afterwards) in 2016, and have been holding *only* btc since then. I continue to hold it, and even buy it, even though today my so called btc stash is 20x its original price.

Here is my opinion about btc's expected price action in next 2-3 years

* first point, there will be no parabola like late 2017, where btc price went 4x in about 4 months. 4x price action in such short range, will not happen, Because there are many exchanges like bakkt and cme, which allow shorting of btc. Which means that price action will not be drastic.
* the upward movement in price will continue for next 2-3 yeras, and beyond. Overall, I expect it to be at 18k at EOY, and at about 25k-40k at end of 2021.
* The price rise is happening due to demand from gbtc ( normal 401-k holders), and demand from recent buyer like Microstrategy , which is a mnc that bought staggering 22k btc. That 22k btc, btw, took price from 9k to 11k. So here you can see demand directly taking price higher. I keep a tight watch on gbtc, and its accumulating btc at a drastic pace, spurred by demand from normal fellows mostly who are buying it for their 401-k. On top of that, get this, gbtc has **no redemption program**. Which means it only buys btc, ( and sells it only for fees if any).
* And now Fidelity is coming with its own Bitcoin Fund ( and only Bitcoin). That shows the demand for Bitcoin from the investors at large.
* Governments have already realized they cannot stop btc. Trump had told Mnuchin in 2018 to ""go after btc'. But mnuchin could not do anything, because there is not much he can do. So on that front, bitcoin has proven ( to the extent) its strength as decentralized network which can't be brought down easily be governments. That's why microstrategy bought it too - they aren't fools to put so much money in something Mnuchin could bring down overnight by a decree. So there will be no such decree. At some point, govt's will likely enforce control ( using tax as reason, for example), and it will reduce Bitcoin's attractiveness, but its hard to look that far into future, because as of now, that is not what's happening. 
* Another bullish point is ABSOLUTE lack of any alternative to btc. The top 10, apart from btc, is a shitshow. XRP is an out and out scam. and even others are totally no shots and scams. So Bitcoin is the only thing in this market.
* I think anyone who buys btc today, and holds for next 10 years, can get returns of about 10x-15x. And the thing is, the risk is very low, so I strongly recommend people to buy at least 10-20% of their portfolio in btc. This is for EVERYONE. I myself am about 80% into btc.
* Finally, don't buy btc if you can't stand falls as much as 75% ( in few months), and **more**. This is speculative asset. The base price is defined by long term holders, but the daily market price is defined by traders, who will sell all btc they hold ( even as people like me will not do that). So the price can flucuate, and I recommend you only buy if you can hold it for minimum 4 years.",1598644896,61,1

&gt; This is a game changer: Nasdaq listed company with $250M bitcoin (25% of assets, 15% of market cap) is basically a bitcoin ETF!
&gt; 
&gt; Shareholders have 15% BTC exposure and 85% tech. No capital charges (like banks &amp; pension funds), no SEC approval needed (like ETF)

&gt; Yes, if you buy a share, you have a share of that 21,500 BTC (0.1% of all bitcoins that will ever exist!). And if that 21,500 BTC will rise in value, say if BTC goes from current $11K to $100K or $288K ..

Alexander Vilganov, CEO of ToGETher and Marketing Officer of Crypto A marketing agency, shared his opinion on the nature of cryptocurrencies and fiat.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Bitcoin is one of the largest financial bubbles of our time. Opponents of the cryptocurrency market often operate with this statement, believing that such a (dubious) fact is quite enough to put forward a vote of no confidence against BTC.

The adherents of the old school, accustomed to the fact that only something material can serve as a means of preserving and expressing value - these people are simply not able to give up their own beliefs and therefore, they continue to come up with various fables, just to support their point of view, no matter how much nor was it a weighty argument.

It is not customary to talk about this, but are cryptocurrencies so different from fiat, as bitcoin opponents present to us? Both BTC and the dollar are means of expression of value. But what is “value” and where does it come from?

Let's turn to world history. Many of you, since school, have heard about how financial transactions were carried out in the days before the first minted coins. Right. People resorted to barter, or used various materials and products, the function of which was to express value. For example, in ancient Russia, before the appearance of the first money, cowrie shells or precious items served as exchange currency. But if everything is more or less clear with jewelry, then how could shellfish shells become a medium of exchange?

It's all about trust, which was based on a generally accepted fact in society - shells can be exchanged for goods. Such an agreement forced people to “trust” this “currency”, which ultimately shaped its value.

So, the key factor in shaping the value of a currency is the presence of public trust. Some of you may tell me that the value of money comes from a country's gold reserves or debt obligations, but no. This is not entirely true. Gold and treaties are only needed to bolster public confidence in the currency. To create the illusion that the purchasing power of our money is protected. By themselves, they have no value. We ourselves attach great importance to these things and believe in it. In other words, if thousands of years ago it had occurred to someone that glass is much more expensive than gold, then today our attitude towards these materials would be completely different.

Later, when the practice of producing minted money spread throughout the world, each major city could have its own currency. And the value of this currency was based on the trust placed in the ruling family. Any high-profile scandal associated with the issuer of banknotes, the difficult financial situation of people in power, or a change in the amount of precious metal in the composition of the coin could lead to a loss of confidence on the part of the population. Loss of confidence and subsequent death of the currency.

Hopefully, in the example above, you can see similarities to what is happening with tokens and weak cryptocurrencies these days. Their value is also highly dependent on the trust placed in them by the community. And in order to earn this very trust, cryptocurrency issuing teams are spent on expensive listings and new partnerships.

The power and value of any money is primarily based on our trust in it. Whether it's fiat money or cryptocurrencies, the value of both types of money depends only on people's attitudes. And any other security is nothing more than a deliberate invention. You and I are forced to believe that paper money has value backed by gold or securities. But in reality, the ruble, dollar, euro or any other traditional currency is a bubble that has existed for many years and lives only because its existence is artificially supported. And if BTC is a bubble, how is it different from paper money? Due to its autonomy from governments? Limited emission?

Any money is a material expression of value. But progress does not stand still. With the advent of the Internet, our lives have changed. Study, business, relationships - our whole world is moving into digital space, and it is more than foolish to expect that such an ""evolution"" will not affect the world of finance.

Yesterday we created payment systems, proving to ourselves that value does not have to be materially transferred. Today bitcoin was born. He appeared and reminded us that money does not need intermediaries and fake collateral. Only human trust.

Cryptocurrencies are a new form of money. Therefore, they must be purchased and used. We are at the origins of the modernization of the financial system. Modernization, which can no longer be stopped.

E.g. the latest 3 questions have incentives for 550k sats, 131k sats, 100k sats at this time. If you answer has the most votes and stays like that for 3 days then the money is yours.

The way it works is anyone can add anonymous incentives to any question. The site tracks which answer has the most votes and how long it’s been in that position. After 3 days the author of a signed answer can claim the funds via a lighting invoice. Folks also need to pay sats to vote or post: 1 sat equals 1 vote. Posts cost 2 sats. The money paid for votes and post on the website goes to the operator (me) to stack and support hosting expenses. Yet 100% the money put into incentives goes back to the customers.

I encourage everyone to try using the site and earn some sats, yet if you don’t feel like doing that now then here video of how it looks from the customers perspective: https://twitter.com/alevchuk/status/1288532085762711553

You can stop reading now, yet if interested here is my story and how this website was built:

I started this project about 1.5 years ago by forking a much older project that has been around for 10 years: biostarts.org (forum focusing on bioinformatics) - I made contributions to biostarts.org back in 2011 and in good standing with the original author. Lastly, the biostars.org is still a very active Q&amp;A at about 9k unique visitors per day.

I remove all use of cookies. Replaced Google Sign Sign-On with Lightning payments backend powered by multiple nodes that I run. Removed a lot of other things and added the Incentives feature. The plan is to continue to improve privacy by removing all JavaScript and opening an Tor address to the site. Also have some wild ideas about how to make this website distributed so that other operators can participate in hosting it. Yet, that’s for another post.

ijaa6e,Spartan3123,Please donate to Coinswap development,"[https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/9144bd57a91c194e332fb5ca371d0964](https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/9144bd57a91c194e332fb5ca371d0964) 

Coinswaps will be key to increasing on chain fungibility for bitcoin.  Because they give users privacy without allowing their transactions to get flagged. 

Products like KYT are becoming increasing common, and from the screenshots you can see users can get flagged for trivial things like being linked to 'mixing' or even using a 'p2p exchange' 

 [https://www.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-kyt/](https://www.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-kyt/)   


The human rights foundation granted Chris Belcher 50K USD to work on this protocol, however i think it would be lame if the only donation came from a charitable organization. At least some of the funding should come from the community. If feel he deserves to be paid more than a minimum wage for working on this full time. 

There's a donation link on the github - which i won't link, but currently there are no donations to the address.

**Remember if you are sending a donation you can make a transaction with the fee set of 1/sat per byte. Because its ok for the transaction to be in the mempool untill it confirms** 

mods: is it ok to link to the donation page or is this against the rules?",1598780971,12,1

i followed their instructions and submitted all documentations required.  


it have been **28** days since my 2fa reset and not only i cant withdraw any of my assets, the team only replies to my email 3-4 days after each email. this is so frustrating!  


in fact, this is the first time i've submitted so much information! i've reset my 2fa in binance, bittrex and coinbase and all of my issues were solved within 3 days.  


does anybody knows anyone in bitfinex that can help me? or have anyone met with the same situation and how long it took before it is solved?

I'm going to explain how to do this setup on a Raspberry Pi, but note that this should work on a VM as well. You can also set up and run the node headless this way, but I will be explaining how to set up the node using a monitor that you can then later disconnect and access remotely once everything is setup.

    
**Hardware:** 

\-Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB RAM minimum) preferably 4GB RAM   
\-Raspberry Pi 4 Heatsinks   
\-Raspberry Pi 4 case -Micro HDMI cable   
\-USB-C power cable and wall adapter   
\-Monitor -Keyboard and mouse   
\-Ethernet cable (Optional)   
\-16GB or larger microSD card   
\-500GB or larger external hard drive (SSD or portable)  

  
**Node Requirements:**   
\-50 KBps upload internet speeds (Most people should have this)   
\-Unlimited or high data cap internet download/upload service   
\-6 hours or longer per day dedicated run time  

  
Okay, once you have the hardware its time to get started!  

The first thing you'll need to do is [install the Raspberry Pi imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/), this is how we're going to install Ubuntu onto our Raspberry Pi. After your download and install finishes, open the imager.  

1) Click the ""choose OS"" box and from the list select Ubuntu, then select Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (Raspberry Pi 2/3/4).    
2)  Insert your microSD card to your computer directly or via a USB converter. Click ""choose SD card"" and select your inserted microSD card.     
3) Click ""Write"" and wait for the imager to finish flashing the OS onto your card  
When it is done, remove the SD card and reinsert it to access the files installed. You can choose the overclock the Raspberry Pi by editing the config file.  To connect to the Raspberry Pi remotely, you'll need to create an SSH file. If you're on windows this is pretty easy. In the File Explorer, highlight the address bar at the top, erase the text and type ***cmd***, press enter and the Command Prompt will pop up. Type the following:   
`echo\ssh`  
This will create an SSH file in your SD directory so that you can remote access the Rasberry Pi later. Now you can go ahead and eject the SD card from your computer. 

  
**Now we can set up the Raspberry Pi**

Go ahead and connect all your peripherals to your Raspberry Pi, insert the microSD, and connect it to power to turn it on.  
Give it a moment to boot up, then when prompted enter ""ubuntu"" for the password. It will make you change the password. Afterward, it will print a bunch of information to the screen, write down the IPv4  address, this is the IP address you'll use to remote access the Raspberry Pi.  *Now, at any time you can remote access your Raspberry Pi by entering a terminal on another PC in your network and typing:*  
`ssh ubuntu@(your IP address)`   
The next step is to install a desktop. There are plenty to choose from so feel free to use a different one than what I use, you can also choose to ignore this and to just work from in the terminal from this point forward.   

You need to update all the repositories so type: *(Note you'll either have to be connected by ethernet or* [*have edited the network-config file*](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#3-wifi-or-ethernet) *to setup your wifi in advance)* 

`sudo apt-get update` 

Once it's done updating type the following to upgrade your system: 

`sudo apt-get upgrade`

 Now that you're up-to-date, you can install the desktop using the command: 

`sudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop` 

This will take a while to download and install so just sit back and let it do its thing.    
Once it's done downloading, restart your Raspberry Pi and log in with the password you changed earlier.     
Your first boot may take a while so just be patient, don't freak out if you see a single purple square in the center of the screen while it's loading. You should now have the Ubuntu desktop ready to go and now it's on to installing Bitcoin Core! 

   
**Installing Bitcoin Core 0.20.0** 

Since we're running Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS, it should come preinstalled with the Snap Store. This makes installing apps very easy and works similar to pip install in Python.   
Simply open your terminal and type: 

`sudo snap install bitcoin-core`

This will install Bitcoin Core into your Snap folder and will add the application to your system. Unfortunately, there are still a few steps left before we can begin downloading the blockchain. By default, Bitcoin Core doesn't have the removable-media Plug connected to the Socket. You can view this by typing: 

`snap connections bitcoin-core`  
This means when you try installing everything onto your external hard drive, Bitcoin Core won't be able to identify it or write to it even when passed the directory path.     
To fix this first locate your Snap folder, make a copy of the bitcoin-core folder inside, and paste it into your external drive.  

***NOTE: You must make a copy, you can't just move the snap file to the external drive.***

  
Now, you can connect the removable-media Plug to the Socket by typing: 

`sudo snap connect bitcoin-core:removable-media :removable-media`

  
This gives you the read/write permissions necessary to access the /media path.    
Finally, you can now launch Bitcoin Core and select ""use a custom directory path"" when prompted. Highlight the current directory path and replace it with the path to your external hard drive, it should look something like this: 

`/media/(external drive)/bitcoin-core/common/.bitcoin`

  
This is why we had to make a copy of the bitcoin-core folder to the external drive earlier, the Bitcoin Core application will create the new data directory through "".bitcoin"".    
Hit ""Okay"" and the application will begin synchronizing with the network! Once the synchronization is finished your very own node will be up and running!",1596264354,15,1

i1n097,brianddk,[Testnet] Lightning Network Ping Pong Challenge. Post invoice to play tBTC-LN ping-pong.,"I'd like to see more people learn Lightning, so perhaps a game of tBTC-LN ping-pong.  Here are the basic rules:

1. Install and launch a LN wallet on Testnet (Electrum, Eclair)
2. Open a testnet LN channel to a [LN testnet node](https://1ml.com/testnet/node?order=channelcount)
3. Spend 10% of the channel at [starblocks](https://starblocks.acinq.co/), or by requesting invoice on this thread
4. Request people to top off your channel by pasting an invoice on this thread
5. Try swapping tBTC-LN and tBTC using [Boltz Testnet](https://testnet.boltz.exchange/) swap exchange

Ask how to do any of these steps on thread and we'll help you get it set up.  You can also look at my last [Ping-Pong Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/hohv3j/psa_electrum_and_eclair_both_support_testnetln_to/) since some of your questions are probably already answered there.",1596259704,34,1

Yesterday my phone service stopped working (said the sim was not provisioned). At first I didn't think much of it. I have connection problems often, anyway. Today I woke up and it was still not working. I also couldn't access my email. I contacted my phone provider and apparently someone went into a store and told them they needed a new SIM. They switched my SIM off when the new one was activated. They used it to access my email using the 2fa account recovery. They logged into coinbase, which was luckily empty. They tried to use my linked credit card and Bank account to purchase $25,000 worth of Bitcoin through coinbase, but luckily it was rejected. 

I also luckily have different passwords for everything I do online. It seems like 2fa actually made my account more susceptible to attack in this case. As far as I can tell no other accounts were compromised, but I'm changing everything anyway, just in case.

## CEX will lock your account up without stating any reason whatsoever and they will not allow you access to pull your funds from the platform - despite the spin the ""social network manager"" is going to put on it.

The Bloody Details:  


I passed CEX's ""enhanced verification"" - yet after making over $30K in deposits over a couple of months, suddenly and inexplicably my account has been ""frozen"" and a request was made that I submit a selfie with my passport and a handwritten note, plus bank statements and taxes. I submitted the corresponding bank statements, and provided them with my business taxes. They got their 2nd selfie -- and I still have no resolution to this issue in over two weeks. Now they want a video selfie and a hand written note. I'd bake them cookies if it would make a difference -- When I asked if I could simply withdraw my BTC and leave their exchange, they responded with a request for a selfie with a VIDEO and a handwritten note before they would allow me to access my funds. It takes multiple days to get a ""response"" which is going to be just another request for more personal information. This has been going on for weeks. If they don't want to do business with me, that's fine -- but withholding my funds without any stated cause is beyond the pale.",1596545996,7,1

So today on Tinder(don’t judge me) I was talking with someone who asked me if I wanted to make some money on Venmo. He asked me this because I have my Venmo name in my bio(It works sometimes and men will randomly send me money). I said I was open to ideas and he went on to explain that he has a lot of bitcoin and uses Venmo and cash app to exchange it for cash. He gave me a card number, expiration date, CVV and zip code. He then told me to add this to my payment methods and send a friend I trust $680. I do not have my bank account information on my Venmo, only a debit card that doesn’t have access to an account with money in it so I figured it was worth a shot. When I attempted to send my friend the money it declined. He explained to me that he reached his limit for the day and we would have to wait until tomorrow to do the transaction. He said something about using cash app as well and then we would split the money 50/50. Does any of this sound legitimate or am I about to be scammed? I would like to think I am not a naive enough person to fall for a scam but I also like to take risks and if this will get me a few hundred dollars it might be worth it.",1596537962,21,1

I'm currently downloading the blockchain to run my own Lightning node. I'm at the ""download blockchain"" step of [this guide](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-lightning-network-how-to-install-and-hopefully-make-money-6e3058e3fa7c), but I skipped the VPS to use my own private Ubuntu 20.04 server because I'm not paying $80 a month.

What I would like to know is this:

* What happens if I go offline for a day or two, say if I'm moving house? Would it result in all my channels being closed?
* When channels are closed, I heard that it's possible that the other party can post an earlier snapshot in order to try and claim more funds than they are entitled to, but that rebutting this would result in a penalty of the other party's entire share being forfeit. Is the rebuttal done automatically, say if I'm knocked offline for a day and then come back online to see that the channel was closed by the other party?
* What's a reasonable routing fee to charge?",1596782173,4,1

i5823v,bluejade11,Hear me out. If I dont reply in comments in 24 hrs Im prolly ded,"So my biggest question I could never conclude is how can something digital become an asset that you can buy  with fiat currency ? As far as I know about history. gold retains its commodity for 5000 years because of the physcal work that was put in to acquiring ,mining. Bloodshed, war, slavery, transporting, its history all adds up to the value it holds today that nobody can take away as for Bitcoin it got me dig deeper. So in my honest opinion its another loophole for the government to combat fiat currency inflation. I think the idea here when bitcoin was created. it was not the intention of a stored value today nor at its peak. Now what really made its trendy was the technology that it served those very first ppl who got into cryptocurrency. Transfering money securely, untraceable, and doesnt need verification n also without having too much risk because u know it doesnt have that much value. today a lot of cryptos created we can use to disperse its real purpose . My theory is this guy *nakamoti satosh* are the group of guys who decides how much billions of dollars they will print every month. Of course they sort of made it really complicated mathematical/scientifically so the average person wont mind bothering getting to know more about crypto it doesnt make any difference than online banking.  a lot of people are buying bitcoins without even understanding what it really is.  all they know  someone told them its gonna be 100k-1mil. Just hodl.  satoshi has the control of majority of bitcoin so whenever he attracts its target crowd, reach its target value. He will now  start moving/selling it’s own bitcoin whether its a million accounts or a centralized marketplace he controls could be banks too. That makes the lured uneducated crowds go wild and panic and sell their so called asset at a lower price of what they paid for and  basically he takes millions of dollar mostly from average ppl who worked hard for it and that pattern repeats in a scalable way  . I want to go deeper but if this doesn’t give you a new point of view then educate me with your own perspective of money if your trying to invest in bitcoin. What we really need is a crypto that is backed by something like gold,silver, or any sort of physical asset that has value not by a monopoly money. It shows why other big economies banned bitcoin. But this my opinion dont take it personally Ask me question I will try to answer best of my knowledge. I want to have a discussion about this because we are in the brink of world rebalancing and nobody knows about it and I believe cryptoworld play a role in it.",1596777912,8,1

So, I have ZERO experience in bitcoin wallets and all this stuff, so please be patient with me. 

Context: in 2017 I bought whatever was worth 1k of bitcoin, I was recommended to download Mycelium as my wallet (that’s a far as my experience goes with bitcoin). 

Fast forward 2020 I remembered I had this “money” or whatever in there, I downloaded the app again entered the key words (that I had written down back then) and was able to enter my wallet but it shows my balance is $0. (For what I read something happens when you delete the app and re install it with the keys or whatever) 

I’m under the impression that you can recover your bitcoin with your “private key”, but I don’t know how. 

• I have all the key words
• I have written down a bunch of numbers and letters (totaling 32 characters) in the following format: 12ab-12ab..... (with dashes) 
• I also have a bunch of numbers and letters written down (over 32 characters) and no dashes

Are any of those random characters my private key? 
If so, where do I enter it in Mycelium? Should I enter also the dashes? Is it where it says “cold storage”

Or is my money gone forever?

Been looking to send approx 0.01BTC and the wallet I have gives me a range of fee choices to send, these range from something like $18 to be in the next block down to something like 15c which comes with a warning that the transaction at best will take a long time but at worst could get stuck.

To complete this transaction in a reasonable time (circa 1hr?) seems like it’s going to cost me something like $6 / ~5% which is in stark contrast to the headlines I see about people moving multiple millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin for a few dollars in fees. 

I’ve checked the memepool and on average people are currently paying about $3, does this mean on average people are waiting 6hrs or so for confirmation the transaction is going through or am I on a different/worse set up with my wallet provider than a bunch of other people?

#Bitcoin (BTC) saw fresh gains on Aug. 6 as bulls refused to rest and the price steamed toward $12,000.
 
BTC price recovers $1,200 crash losses
Data from Coin360 and Cointelegraph Markets showed #BTC/USD tackling $11,900 on Thursday, with 24-hour gains at 2.2%.
 
With barely any let-up, Bitcoin has recovered almost all its lost ground over the course of this week, just four days after it shed $1,200 in minutes after initially passing the $12,000 mark.
 
With its latest move, the largest cryptocurrency thus beat out resistance earmarked by analysts as the next hurdle for bulls.
 
“Essentially new resistance hit here after breaking $11,300-11,400,” Michaël van de Poppe reported on Twitter earlier on Thursday.
 
“Let's see how it goes from here.”
 
All eyes will be on the ability for bulls to flip the precarious $12,000 level into solid support, something which nonetheless came easily for $11,000 once resistance at $10,500 was broken.
 
Bitcoin realized correlation with gold hits all-time high
Bitcoin “copying” gold to hit surprise price highs now has factual evidence as the realized correlation between the two assets reaches all-time highs.
 
Data from on-chain monitoring resource Skew confirmed the trend this week, with one-month realized correlation between gold and Bitcoin now at 67.1%.
 
The transformation has been impressive — just three weeks ago on July 20, a local low saw realized correlation hit -0.1%.
 
The intervening period has been marked by Bitcoin’s rapid gains in USD terms, following in gold’s footsteps several months after the precious metal began its own conspicuous climb.
 
At press time on Thursday, XAU/USD was at $2,065, its highest ever against the dollar, passing $2,000 despite analysts predicting the likelihood of such an event being just 30% this year.
 
Meanwhile, doubts are surfacing over Bitcoin’s continued correlation with stock markets. BTC was 95% correlated with the S&amp;P 500, for example, but on Thursday, one analyst declared the relationship to be over.",1596752872,1,1

i4z2ga,harbelblarbel,Wasabi self send for privacy?,"Ok maybe a dumb/noob question, but out of curiosity, if Wasabi does everything over Tor, and every transaction uses a new/different peer, the wouldn't I privatize my outgoing coins simply by first chopping up some portion of my coins in wallet acct1 into two or more new wallets (lets say acct2, 3, 4), then sending some portion of those coins into another wallet, acct5, such that the amounts are all non-round and less than the the total in each wallet, with acct5 ending up with something slightly more than what I want to spend? It seems that there's plausible deniability with each transaction having different IP addresses, and the outgoing amount from wallet acct5 completely untraceable to acct1, since none of the amounts directly add up to amount originally deposited in the first wallet, and none of the IP addresses matching one another.  To me, it seems I could easily say that after the coins left the first wallet, all of the other wallets are simply ""someone else"", especially the last wallet.

I don't want to talk ethics or ""why try to hide what you're doing"". There are any number of ethical reasons someone would want privacy through bitcoin transactions, and the whole btc &gt; xmr &gt; btc thing just seems way more of a pain that moving coins around in my own wallets; not to mention it seems every day coin mixing sites and exchanges popup with sites from yesterday being declared untrustworthy.

i5vmil,Ethanyew,WARNING: BITFINEX FREEZING ASSETS FOR A MONTH NOW WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION.,"BITFINEX has frozen my assets and withdrawals on my account worth approximately $800,000 since JUL 5. 

Today, they decided to “CLOSE THIS MATTER” without giving me any explanation to why my assets are frozen. **\[Read their email response from the timeline I provided below\]**

This incident started off with me transferring my assets to BITFINEX to do FUNDING as I just gotten back my BTC from a loan I provided. My friend told me to transfer assets here so can earn the interest while I put my BTC to use.

UNFORTUNATELY, I lost my phone on the same day and thus losing my 2fa\[newly setup 2fa\], and after verifying my identity, I was told there is a 5 days withdrawal hold.

After which here comes a super lengthy process of verification with me providing personal documents like Identification, Income tax statements, transaction records from various exchanges and withdrawal records from other exchanges. 

The “compliance” department then took their own sweet time in verifying my documentation and only replies every other 4-8 days. This is obvious that they are not sincere in rectifying my issues and either they are purposely delaying my withdrawals, or they simply don’t care. 

This freezing of assets is simply unacceptable as I need my funds for liquidity to pay for my housing and expenses. This issue have been causing so much duress and stress to my daily life and freezing my assets without explanation is simply unacceptable and OUTRAGOUS. 

I googled online and found out this is not the first time it happens and it’s so unfortunate I fall victim to this.

Bitfinex SHOULD NEVER deem the funds their own!

Below is a detailed timeline of how they are slowly replying and using the convenience of KYC to delay my withdrawal. 

**\[JUL 6\]** Reset my 2fa, 5 days withdrawal hold.  

**\[JUL 10\]** After 5 days, here come their tricks. I received this email to provide KYC information.

*As it is our mission and commitment to provide better and reliable services for all Bitfinex users, we require our users to update and/or provide Know-Your-Customer information from time to time in order to maintain the level of integrity and compliance required by international anti-money laundering as well as counter terrorist financing policies.*  
 

*Accordingly, please provide us the following information/documentation:*  
   
 

· *Reasons for transfers from and to your Bitfinex account;*

· *A clear and detailed explanation of your account activity and objectives;*

· *A detailed explanation of the sources of all funds deposited to Bitfinex; provide details on how and where you acquired the funds that were deposited to your account. Make sure to include TXids and addresses that describe the source of the funds deposited to your Bitfinex account;*

· *Proof of source of funds confirming how the deposited funds were originally acquired;*

· *Detailed descriptions of the destination you have and/or will sent/send your funds to from your Bitfinex account;*

· *Confirmation of whether you have ever opened and used any other account(s) on Bitfinex? If so, please provide the user name(s) and email address(es) of any account ever opened. Please explain why you operated more than one account, if applicable.*

**\[JUL 22\]** After a series of back and forth email with me providing my Identification, Income tax statements, transaction records from various exchanges and also withdrawal records from other exchanges, I finally receive a reply from the team. 

*We apologize for the delay. We have escalated the matter to the verification team. We hope to resolve this matter as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.*

**\[JUL 22\] sent them a follow up email, no replies.** 

**\[JUL 24\] sent them a follow up email, no replies.** 

**\[JUL 28\] sent them a follow up email, no replies.** 

**\[JUL30\]** **Finally a reply after 8 DAYS without any information provided.**

*Thank you for your patience and understanding. We apologize for the length of this process, we are working on resolving this matter. You will receive a status update shortly.*

**\[AUG3\] sent them a follow up email, no replies.**

**\[AUG6\] Opened another support ticket with regards to my issue and received a response within HOURS from SUPPORT TEAM.** 

**\[AUG7\] finally a reply from the team.** 

*Please be advised that we are working on finalising the review of your account.*  
 *We will communicate our findings to you during the next 24 hours.*  
 *Thank you in advance for your understanding and patience in this matter.*

**\[AUG8\] Email informing me that my funds are still stuck WITHOUT ANY EXPLAINATION AND THEY DEEM THE MATTER IS CLOSED.**

What are real world uses for Joe Public to promote wider adoption. 
Considering previously you may use at some shops, now some are refusing because of high transaction fees. 
My friend tried last week, the Cafe said they used to accept BTC but fee too expensive cheaper and quicker to use XRP or other ALTcoin.

Is this the case is it really no longer viable for real world transactions especially if only 10 or 20USD?

Is BTC still usable / viable option for day to day local transactions if there is just a wallet to wallet transfer say using BRD to another wallet?

Are small businesses gravitating to altcoins because of this? 

What are is the % fee/ expense ratio in general both wallet and network, is it becoming more cost/time restrictive as the value grows? 

How is community trying to mitigate this, is it not really deemed a wider concern?

i5u826,hmgEqualWeather,Is it possible for government to ban bitcoin apps similar to banning TikTok and WeChat?,"We've seen the US government ban TikTok and WeChat because they are Chinese. I hold an Asian tech ETF which went down in value. I know many Westerners who hold this ETF, which shows that this move can easily hurt Westerners. Likewise I know many Chinese multimillionaires who hold vast quantities of American stocks and ETFs, and their wealth has barely been affected, so this move makes no sense at all.

Nevertheless, it is what it is, but it makes me wonder about how immune bitcoin is from government interference. What if the government is anti-crypto and banned bitcoin apps eg Coinbase, Coinomi, Wallet of Satoshi etc. Wouldn't this practically end bitcoin use?",1596867029,22,1

i5sgb4,pio_11,Whats the point? (Wallets),"Hi there, just deciding of moving over my coin over to a wallet from an online exchange to something more secure.

Iv mainly contemplated two options as they seem equally secure if used the way ill explain bellow.

The Ledger and other competitors, but keep coming back to using something like Electrum simply for the fact that as long as I setup a laptop running a ""safe"" OS like BSD/Linux (with encrypted drives) and only connect it to the internet for transaction and only use it as my dedicated Coin PC and nothing else.

The only weakness I see is the Seed recovery, with both Ledger or Electrum if I lose or have it stolen someone will gain access to my coin or ill potentially get locked out for ever.

Would I be correct in saying both options would be equally secure? Please correct my thinking if I'm wrong, much appreciated.",1596858583,17,1

But the recent price rises, whilst welcome, have made me think..if bitcoin does become what we hoped in 2009/10 then the world's economy will be in pretty bad shape. Bitcoin becoming a major hedge against dollars, euros, pounds likely means their value has take a hit. So bitcoin is worth more because cost is worth s lot less. These days bitcoin has become my insurance plan instead of a revolutionary tech idea that was new and exciting. It's a double edged sword, but also of the fiat systems collapse that is not the fault of bitcoin, that's the fault of the fiat systems. So I don't feel like we are harming the world economies we are just keeping them at arm's length..

Live with my dad, always  have, never could move out, my career never took off. I do odd jobs and  gig economy and my income is about $1000/month. $500 of which I have to  give my dad for rent and food, but fair enough. I can't afford a real  apartment. The rest I save and spend as I please.

I  will add, my dad watches my bank account. He does it to make sure I'm  saving money for a car and an apartment. I am 100% owner of my account,  my dad can't access the money, but we have it set up so he receives a  copy of the statements every month.

Anyway  I had invested into cryptocurrency a long time ago, back when it was  cheap. And my dad knows about it. Well recently I sold part of my  cryptocurrency and received $30,000. I have another $40,000 worth of  cryptocurrency that I'm holding on to, haven't sold yet.

So  in total I won $70,000, of which $30,000 is a realized gain. That  $30,000 was deposited into the account, and dad saw the transaction.

He  is now demanding that I set aside $10,000 for myself ""because that is  all I need"", set aside enough to pay capital gains tax, and give him the  rest of the US Dollars and Cryptocurrency.

i45yq8,RalphAnderson_,Crypto,"Why $11.5K Is the ‘Most Important’ Level for Bitcoin, Traders Explain
 
The price of #Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering at $11,300 and is nearing a pivotal technical level, which some traders are arguing makes $11,500 “the most important” level to confirm a new bull cycle for BTC.
 
If Bitcoin stays above $11,500 by Aug. 10, it would be the highest weekly close for #BTC price since mid-2019. The weekly candle in August 2019 closed slightly above $11,500. In other words, a close above this level would print the best weekly candle since the 2017 bull run.
 
A closure above $11,500 would break Bitcoin market structure
Meanwhile, traders are closely observing the upcoming weekly candle closure because many believe it could decide whether the bull market continues. Until BTC cleanly breaks out of $11,500, technically, there is strong overhead resistance. One pseudonymous trader said:
 
“11.5k is the most important level on Bitcoin.”
 
When the price of Bitcoin hit $12,000 on Aug. 2, some investors argued that BTC already broke its market structure. If so, BTC theoretically has room to surge to higher resistance levels at $14,000 and $17,000.
 
Sven Henrich, a trader at NorthmanTrader, believes Bitcoin could head toward $17,000. For the technical case for a prolonged rally to be intact, Henrich said BTC has to remain above $10,500.
 
As long as the price of Bitcoin stabilizes above $10,500, Henrich said a rally to $17,000 is possible, even if BTC then retraces. He said:
 
“Firstly note that a breakout is bullish if it can be successfully defended, meaning as long as $BTC can remain above the breakout trend line it has significant technical room higher… But note that inside the larger wedge consolidation a potentially much more bullish pattern has emerged, that of a potential inverse which would point to near 17,000.”
 
Variables for both bull and bear cases
In the near-term, analysts point toward various macro factors that could boost the sentiment around Bitcoin. Most notably, the value of the United States dollar is depreciating.
 
Overall, trading volumes across various markets, including retail and institutional, are increasing. For example, the open interest of the CME Bitcoin futures market has just hit a record high. Despite mass liquidations on Aug. 2, BTC has remained relatively stable above the key technical support level at $10,500.
 
While more factors seemingly buoy the bull case for Bitcoin, there are two risks BTC faces in the short term. First, until $12,000 clearly breaks, the risk of overhead resistance remains. Second, several technical metrics, including funding rates and greed index (currently at 75% or “greed”), hint at an overheated rally.
 
However, it is uncertain whether positive on-chain metrics, such as the number of “HODLers” reaching an all-time high, can offset potential risks. For now, until BTC’s weekly candle closes above $11,500, the market remains cautiously optimistic as attention shifts to the U.S. dollar and stocks.",1596636418,5,1

I was over-charged by Prime Trust LLC for purchases I made on the Binance US platform, on July 30, 2020,

my bank account, which is linked with my Binance US account sent back the request from Prime Trust LLC,

,there is a penalty fee for charge-backs of $25 for my bank account in effect,

then I received an email from Binance US that my account would be suspended if I didn't pay the unreasonable charge I have not made, the unreasonable charge is not indicated on my Binance US account's buy/sell history as I completed all recent underlying purchases through ACH and all correlating charges have been paid for/withdrawn from my bank account by Prime Trust LLC. 

All purchases I made on my Binance US has been paid for. 

The unreasonable charge is not indicated on any one of my accounts. The only email claiming that I owe money for charges I did not make coming from the one email I received by Binance US.

I've posted 2 posts on r/binance which I posted pictures below and was both indicated as deleted, by   moderators of r/binance

Update(s):

[I have erased the name of staff and my email address on the screenshot above for privacy.](https://preview.redd.it/e11j1j0lz5f51.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3bd62c875310f396c444a2a6a41fa4816a4c60e)

(To [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) Team) My apologies if I may have worded things confusingly as there was no actual withdraw of $300 from my bank account, which shouldn't have been requested in the first place, and because my bank sent back the order of $300, binance sent me an email, seen below, that my account would be suspended in 7 days if I do not deposit $300 for Biance US to have.

&amp;#x200B;

My concerns:

Being charged $25 for an erroneous charge by Binance US from my bank,

My account being suspended with my funds for error which is not my fault or doing as provided on my transaction history of all my accounts, and not ever receiving an email confirmation purchase or of any sort of the erroneous fee I am charged, 

In less than one day as deducted through the message I received by Binance US below, my account would be suspended if I do not deposit the money I supposedly owe:

&amp;#x200B;

Other concerns:

Unable to withdraw funds I've already paid for and indicated as available for withdraw, yet when I try to withdraw any amount of my funds, how some or large, I get a message with ""**withdraw suspended due to risk management"".** 

Reason for my postings:

Waiting 7 days for reaching a resolution after my original ticket submission. 

My post being deleted even before reaching a resolution of erroneous charges.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To all those who've responded and engaged including Binance modulators, to my second post, thank you for your support, engagement and advice as I strongly believe, though my issues remain at large which is not fault of anyone here, my process of resolving the current issue has been sped up because of it! It was my first time getting up votes and I was honestly quite happy when I saw it after I awoke from my long nap hence my delay in response.

Response to comment (1):

\*\*I'll consider to message the binance modulators next next time, but I do apologize for the delay in response.                                                                                                                

\*\*What stopped me from directly commenting was my response was for the surprisingly deleted post, and my inability to being able to respond at the time to the binance modulator's comment as indicated when I tried to, my post deleted. 

\*\*I wanted to wait a while ( waited at least 5 hours until I get a response from the CS team, after which I have learned my post was deleted and I then posted on reddit. 

\*\*I wanted to disclose what has happened and can happen and I've learned to message the modulators in case of similar occurrences in the future, before my post is deleted. Which I was not aware about until the response for my second post, but I am aware of now. And I could have responded earlier as the misshaping was due to miscommunication between binance modulator and staff. 

\*\*The reason that I have responded by post to the specific Binance modulator was that I wanted to get a chance to explain myself in the similar scale/audience as the modulator had when commenting with a question to my post.

Response to comment (2):

\*\*Thank you for your response, I believe the issue I am facing is a very important matter that should be kept on reddit for future references. 

\*\*My motive is to have my issues resolved, I am not sure what ulterior motive I might have and I want to clarify it wasn't my intention to make you think so or there is ulterior motive at work. If I may ask please fill me in, maybe I can help clarify.

This online software will allow you to encrypt any text data in a QR Code.  
For example, this is for me the BEST way to store your recovery seed for a Ledger.  
This is also the best way to store your Seed for electrum wallet...  
But for me, the best way to use it is to create a Multisig 2-3 with electrum, encrypt 3 seeds and you can store 1 seed encrypted on QR code in cloud, and you can give the encrypted QR Code to different friends and members of your family.

I see that Incognito have some rather cool function that we may have interest:

1. They are mobile app (on IOS and Android) - I don't see web version, wonder if they have or intend to develop)

2. It seem have a user friendly interface (actually I am not a technical guy, so others cryptos wallet somehow rather difficult for a new one to get accustom to)

3. Inside the app they have multiple function:

	\- A wallet provide privacy for all our transaction (fee currently = 0, transaction process quite fast, I try some demo transactions and feel that) 

	\- A trading platform they call pDEX so that we can trade some Crypto coins and again, it's private

	\- Invest function: by providing liquidity for the community to exchange cryptos and earn interest (I see currently PRV coin upto 37% annually - which is @@ really high, don't know when they make this lowers again, may be they are in launching version)

	\- Stake: they offer to run some NODE to power the privacy and earn crypto too (any one here have the NODE from Incognito and set up successfully yet? Do you have any result from the NODE yet? I appreciate if you can share)

4. I see they support quite a lot of coin (Bitcoin, Ethereum, ERC-20 Tokens, etc) =&gt; could be simple if we can manage all of cryptos in 1 place.

Anyone curious can explore in this link: [https://incognito.org/](http://incognito.org/?utm_source=referral&amp;utm_medium=reddit)

I am really stoned and fascinated by macroeconomics. I believe the US will try to commit to Universal Basic Income in the form of a centralized electronic currency in the near to mid future.

Apparently the Turkish Lira has just imploded. BTC is at an ATH in comparison to their own currency and the gov't  deliberately blew up short sellers by raising rates to over 1,000%

 Combined with a physical dollar and coin shortage as we speak in the U.S. When will complete economic collapse and social unrest  occur??? I am more than disappointed and saddened by this to happen and most importantly why are the American citizens watching blindly while their currency dissolves in front of their eyes

When are we leaving the twighlight  zone? **Does anyone else feel this is happening faster than the average person expects?** **Within the next year or two we will have ramped up QE in such a tremendous amount throughout the entire pandemic and either have an economic downturn, what we need or QE infinity where we are stuck in a faster/ larger cycle of necessary stimulus keeping ""everything smooth""** while devaluing our currency further in a snowball down-the-hill fashion. 

Have been stacking  large amounts of precious metals these past few months as well as BTC and I am considering leaving the stock market and going all in BTC, gold, and silver in order of holding percentage instead of the mere 10% BTC I currently hold.

i76bg6,Radiant-Ad-5076,Where I currently stand,"So I have been thinking that bitcoin needs to have a correction to 10.x. I think this would need to be in the high 10s to support an actual charge up to 15 or so. That being said I did put an limit order for 11,758. That was executed in the flash crash that happened in the past few hours that went down to 11,492. This flash crash was definitely lower than what I expected. I will likely sell my position at 12,058-12,158 and have placed a buy for 11,558.

People want to go to the moon and all that. These are great dreams and I think bitcoin will go to a crazy high of 100k or w.e. However before that happens there needs to be a lot more stabilization. Said stabilization I believe will start to occur when we see previous large falls such as the covid scare be bought instead of sold. For that reason I do believe Im the near term we will see a drop to 10.x I’m also thinking the near term high is somewhere around 13

I additionally do not hold the view that other crypto are shit coin. Mainly my reason for this is because there is no limit to wealth. We have over 6,000 crypto’s out there. You can’t sit here as a trader or investor and say bitcoin is going to go to the moon and nothing else is going to.

The Bitcoin miner maker Canaan Creative (NASDAQ: CAN) lately announced that five members of their board are leaving. As told, the terms of office of two directors, namely Jianping Kong and Qifeng Sun, expired on July 31, and three of its independent directors, namely Hong Zhang, Xiaohu Yang and Mei Luo, expired on August 1. 

It is noteworthy that all the departing directors are not allowed to seek appointments nor participate in the elections of the board of directors after the expiration of their terms of office.

On July 9, Canaan Creative’s Hangzhou headquarter underwent business registration record modification. Former directors Kong, Sun and Li Jiaxuan, as well as supervisor Tu Songhua withdrew from the board, and Meng Lu was added as the new supervisor. ""The corporate contact person also changed from Zhang Jing to Zhang Ning.

According to the news, recently, the founder Zhang Nangeng had come with some Canaan Creative executives from Beijing to Hangzhou, dismissed a number of managers of Hangzhou headquarter, took away the official seal and business license of the company, later that day, some employees called the police.

&amp;#x200B;

The same as Bitmain, the first NASDAQ listed Bitcoin miner maker Canaan Creative also built the VIE structure, the main body of the company set up in the Cayman Islands. According to some sources, there has been a power struggle in Canaan Creative, between Zhang’s Beijing office and Kong’s Hangzhou office.

In response to what happened in Hangzhou, Canaan Creative said that, ""after the registration modification, the company is running normally, and all subsidiaries in China are headed by Zhang as the company's executive director, general manager and legal representative”.

The power struggle in Canaan is not a single case. As the former industry dominant, BitMain technologies, who has released IPO prospectus in 2018 but with no progress, stuck in a Cayman Islands lawsuit between two founders. Its business is also badly affected.

While another rising star MicroBT’s founder suffered from the disaster behind bars. December 12, 2019, Shenzhen Nanshan Court announced that the criminal suspect Yang Zhenxing was arrested by the crime of official encroachment. Outpost OnChain confirmed the news with MicroBT at the first moment.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/88i23cbab5g51.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e289df3ce4c2d9ca2de959c0ce2847c2cfe9dbf

Dr. Yang was graduated from Tsinghua University, had been the former miner chip design supervisor in BitMain and worked for the mysterious miner maker ‘FriedCat’. He had designed so-called BE300 chip using a ""full custom methodology"", the chip failed to go into mass production with the disappearance of FriedCat.

Yang disclosed the ""Full Custom Methodology” to the founder of BitMain, Zhan Ketuan, which can significantly reduce the cost and power consumption of the chip. Yang worked part-time to help design the S7 miner (1385 chip) and the S9 miner (1385 chip) that made BitMain's mining dominance possible. 

In 2016, Yang left BitMain and built up Shenzhen MicroBT Electronic Technology Company. Subsequently, MicroBT released a number of high-performance crypto mining products, quickly squeezed into the market, which had shaken the market dominance of BitMain. Later on, BitMain launched a patent ownership and infringement dispute lawsuit against MicroBT.

However, a source said that there are some hidden facts behind Yang's arrest. As the source acknowledged, during the end of 2019, the lawsuit between BitMain and MicroBT made significant progress, law enforcement officers from Beijing has come to Shenzhen to handle the case. Right at this point, as the chairman, general manager and the actual beneficiary of MicroBT, Yang arrested by a 100 thousands RMB worth embezzlement case. The case between BitMain suspended after that. The timeliness of the embezzlement case and the identity of the informer are worthy of considering.

Satoshi Nakamoto may not have imagined the emergence of ASIC chips when he published the Bitcoin white paper. The mining machine, a money-printing artifact, has created wealth for mining giants such as BitMain, MicroBT and Canaan Creative in just a few years. While the rapid accumulation of wealth, pathetic stories have also been staged, from the vanish of the FriedCat to the BitMain’s official seal wresting case. The road less traveled may not be the right path for everyone.",1597052441,2,1

i70dhz,paulcheung1990,Who is forking Filecoin?," **Forking Filecoin is a $500 million to $1 billion business?**

On July 17, cryptocurrency analyst Bitfool mentioned via Weibo: “Recently, people who forked Filecoin in the market have been undercurrents; as far as I know, there are 4-5 teams. From a strategic point of view, the project Teams, investors, and miners get two of the three to successfully fork; one of the three can steal 5-10% of the market value. Therefore, Filecoin's fork is a $500 million to $1 billion Business.""

""It's even more awesome, full of courage, and ready to build a team to fork Fliecoin. Well done, famous in the world, poor done, and scorned by thousands of people.""

Sun Ming, a partner of Fenbushi Capital, mentioned in an interview: ""Miners who have invested a lot of hardware resources are promoting the fork of Filecoin.

Hu Feng, operating partner of the FILPool mining pool, said: ""Currently, big miners have ideas, but it will only be possible after the mainnet is online.

**Filecoin economic model is not friendly to miners**

 At the beginning of the establishment of the Filecoin economic model, a pledge and reward and punishment mechanism was proposed, which has undergone many adjustments. The last three adjustments have made the mechanism increasingly stringent.

In April of this year, the Filecoin project team introduced their thinking on the economic model and refined the reward and punishment mechanism. Miners who complete file storage can get corresponding block rewards, and fail to store files within the promised period will be punished. This fine is imposed on the Filecoin collateral pool (locked funds) provided by each storage miner. Locked funds include a small amount of early FIL tokens and token rewards obtained from miners.

Miners need to mortgage a certain amount of tokens in the early stage. If the amount of mortgage is too large, it will cause a shortage of FIL tokens in the early stage. The improvement made by the economic model is to transfer some of the early-stage costs to future block rewards.

The severe punishment mechanism made some miners dissatisfied, and some miners commented that the mechanism was too ""crude"".

 In May, Filecoin made major adjustments to its economic model. This adjustment raises the threshold for miners to leave. Filecoin continues to strengthen the miner's mortgage mechanism, and part of the rewards mined by the miners will be locked. The penalty mechanism has also been changed accordingly. Only when the task of file hosting is completed can the mining reward be unlocked. If miners want to profit, they need to have strong computing power and be able to provide stable storage services for a long time.

If this is acceptable to miners, the recent ""pre-mortgage"" mechanism has left miners at a loss.

""Pre-mortgage"" is proposed in the latest Calibration version of Filecoin, which means that every sector encapsulated requires a certain amount of FIL to be pledged in advance, and the pledged token needs to be locked for 180 days and then released in 180 days.

The consequence of ""pre-mortgage"" is that FIL token has worse liquidity in the early stage.

 A large number of FIL mortgages are required in the early stage, which will force miners to find the official to buy coins, and the long lock-up period causes most miners to choose to sell coins instead of encapsulation. ""The miners have put their money in the hardware, where can they go out and buy coins?""

Since there is not enough funds to buy coins as collateral, it loses the qualification for mining. Even if the mortgage funds are saved, it is almost impossible to pay back with the small amount of currency in the early period.

Sun Ming said: ""The mining output is too small, making it difficult for early miners to maintain operations.""

The adjustment of the economic model continues to compress the income of early miners, and the voice of miners proposing to fork Filecoin is also getting louder.

 Sun Ming believes: ""On the one hand, it is the protest of the miners against ProtocolLabs (requesting it to modify the economic model), and on the other hand, it is also the desperate fight of the miners forced to do nothing.""

Li Bai posted a circle of friends to express his attitude. As shown below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4l65p7ynn4g51.jpg?width=676&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cce16ab61e230d1af443f9f49c8ffdfcebfdb8d3

 Another very important point is that, according to the current reward mechanism, Filecoin competition in China is tantamount to ""college entrance examination"".

Take the Filecoin big miner test competition as an example, miners can only be rewarded if they are ranked in the top 50 in their area or in the top 100 among all miners. Looking at the situation of Chinese miners, 9 of the top 10 nodes in the world are from China. According to people familiar with the matter, about 80% of Filecoin miners are concentrated in China. The fierce competition can be imagined.

Wang Qingshui expressed his concern: more than 90% of miners may not make money. Many miners saw that they couldn't make money, and they had the idea of opening up Filecoin ""other tracks"". Therefore, the call for a Filecoin fork is the strongest in China.

 **Unaffordable mining costs and thresholds**

In addition to Filecoin's economic model, another point that miners complain about is Filecoin's threshold and cost.

The cost of Filecoin mining input and the technical threshold of operation are beyond the reach of many miners and mines.

Filecoin has a severe punishment mechanism, which can ensure the safety of the data party, but at the same time it will bring a high threshold for mining professionalism and operation and maintenance stability.

In order to ensure uninterrupted power and no disconnection, it must be hosted in a high-level IDC computer room. In order to ensure mining efficiency, the network, computing power, and storage hardware must not be poor. Therefore, miners need to use a large sum of money to purchase high-end hardware equipment.

 Instant window-POST verification and submission requires high algorithms and error repair capabilities, and requires professional algorithms and operation and maintenance teams.

In addition, the threshold for Filecoin mining may be above 10TB or even higher.

Entry mining has a threshold for storage and technical maintenance, and a lot of money is needed to purchase hardware equipment.

Earlier, a blogger did a cost calculation. With 30 mining machines as a cluster calculation, the expenditure for purchasing mining machines alone was as high as 6 million. Coupled with the cost of computer room construction, operation and maintenance, Filecoin mining costs may be more than 10 million yuan.

Wang Qingshui also mentioned the flaws: “Many ordinary miners and even servers cannot participate, which is contrary to the original intention of the project.”

Some people in the community expressed their concerns: ""I have invested so much. What if something goes wrong after Filecoin goes online? Wouldn't it be a loss?""

 So some miners are thinking, can they lower the threshold of mining while ensuring safety?

Some miners pointed out that not all mining machines need to be hosted in the IDC computer room, which is costly and prone to waste of resources. If it can be hosted in different computer rooms according to the performance of each type of mining machine, it can not only ensure safety, but also reduce costs.

Judging from the interview, many industry insiders are on the sidelines of the Filecoin fork.

Li Bai said: ""There are many people who have ideas, but few people can put them into action.""

Wang Qingshui believes that any popular big project will be forked. Are BTC and ETH forked less? But how many forks can surpass the original version?

 Some miners think that the fork is just talking: ""Someone will follow the official game."", ""Who wrote the code for you after the fork? Do you dare to use the code you wrote?""

The Filecoin fork is ""undercurrent"". As the Filecoin mainnet approaches, miners' actions will become more frequent, and we will continue to report.

If this application is successful, Ethereum Trust will become the second platform to achieve the status of a digital currency investment vehicle reporting to the SEC after Grayscale Bitcoin Trust earlier in January. Grayscale hopes to attract more institutional investors into the crypto space with this filing as most of these investors are wary of making investments in instruments that are not registered with the commission. Grayscale said that over one-third of U.S investors have now shown interest in investing in Bitcoin and other crypto assets and this might be a wakeup call for financial advisors to catch up on crypto assets and facilitate the transition of new adopters in the crypto market.",1597043605,0,1

https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/1292890068663898113

This tweet highlights the main issue many people have with Ethereum and unfortunately also shows the intellectual dishonesty of Andreas Antonopoulos.

Let me explain:

Ethereum indeed was never designed to be money. As anyone who paid any attention knew since forever, Ethereum was always about smart contracts and 'blockchain everything'. ETH was just the necessary evil to make it work.

Bitcoin is the exact opposite. It was always about BTC and the blockchain is the necessary evil or even [toxic waste](https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1087142827346354177) we have to deal with in order to keep it running.

Nowadays many people and especially ethereans claim that blockchaining all the things will safe the planet and whatnot and that's all good and well (even if a bit naive), but they can't suddenly go ahead and claim ETH is designed to be money or even a global store of value just because they realized number only goes up if they change the narrative (again). This constant change of narrative is very dishonest and actually quite scammy and explains why bitcoiners keep calling them out.

Ethereum was conceived **and marketed** as the oil that powers the economy of it's smart contract platform. That's why it is called gas. If people would stick to the facts and stop claiming that ETH is a better money or even store of value than BTC in order to pump their bags, all this drama and infighting wouldn't be necessary and everyone could happily coexist.

This is where we come to Andreas intellectual dishonesty. His whole long tweet storm explaining the complications of Ethereum and why the supply can't be pinned down is moot. The only important part is the fact that it's not money and therefor the supply doesn't matter.

But admitting this right away and prominently instead of hiding it deep down in some subtweet would jeopardize his new potential career as an Ethereum evangelist.

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate most of his work and even send him 10 million sats or so, when Roger was shitting on him for not being a millionaire. I actually wish him well and best of luck with his ventures into Ethereum land, but he should be honest and tell the things as they are. 

As Samson [said it best](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/1292948441249636353):

i7saw9,peercents,Coinmama Experience,"Poor rates aside, I had a pretty bad experience with Coinmama that I thought I'd share.

I tried to purchase about $USD 5,000 on their platform using a bank transfer. I had previously purchased a few amounts of $500 - 3000 using this method and it went through okay. When I transferred the $USD 5,000, it took a long time for the transaction to credit my account. Usually, it was 1 -3 business days. This time it had been over a week. I was quite disappointed as the BTC price had shot up at that time and they only lock in the rate when they see the funds in their account.

Eventually, customer support finally reverted back to me saying there had been an error and they had **not noticed** the funds in their account. They said it was a bank error that they had not been notified. They said they couldn't give me the previous rate of when the funds arrived and had to credit my account with fewer BTC due to the new rate now that they noticed the funds. I was pretty miffed but agreed as I needed quite an amount of BTC and would have to buy more down the line anyway.

A few more days passed and they still hadn't credited my wallet. They again contacted me saying there was some mysterious error and they had to return the money. I reluctantly agreed. I needed to once again give them my bank account information for them to wire my money back less of transfer fees.

They offered me a coupon (which barely covered my transfer fees, let alone lost value in the delay of my purchase) for my troubles to be used with my next transaction on their platform. I tried to redeem it this time using the credit card method which I presumed would be faster, I was only redeeming the coupon amount so I didn't think the effect of the fees was too bad. That request is still in processing.

The silver lining is that it pushed me to find someone locally who I was able to buy much more BTC at a less egregious rate. These initial transactions were just a test of the platform on whether it would be okay for me to purchase a larger amount in which case I would have been incredibly burned by their poor rates.

Its the first platform I've ever tried to purchase crypto on and I'd say overall it was a very disappointing experience. I wouldn't have purchased had I not had the need for large amounts of crypto for a few poker tournaments going on this summer online since COVID has moved the bulk of the WSOP online.

I don't know if this is the standard service for fiat gateway platforms but it was pretty bad and probably a bit of a blight on adoption and the overall price rising.",1597154306,2,1

ias9t5,RalphAnderson_,Hmmm🤔🤔,"Bitcoin ‘Whale Clusters’ Show $14K as Pivotal for BTC Price Bull Run
 
David Puell, an on-chain analyst, laid out several key data points on Aug. 16 based on the past 4-year cycle of #Bitcoin (BTC). Data show that the $14,000 level is a crucial price point for Bitcoin due to whale clusters.
 
According to Puell, whale clusters show many large buyers bought in the $9,000 to $12,000 range. Whales that bought at $9,000 are seeing relatively high profits, and those that bought the top are at a breakeven point.
 
The clusters could result in a volatile price action where buyers and sellers aggressively try to break out from the $12,000 to $14,000 price range.
 
So is a correction more likely or continuation of the Bitcoin rally?
The data support arguments for both a pullback and a continuation. If whales bought at $9,000 and $12,000, they have a compelling reason to take profit in the $12,000 to $14,000 range. They have seen some profits and/or are at breakeven after months of stagnation.
 
On the flip side, if the whales are in profit and are at breakeven, they might want to see the rally continue. Puell said that he expects an accumulation phase to occur in the $10,000 region following #BTC’s move to $12,000 or $14,000. He said:
 
“Finally, unspent whale clusters confirm a great battle taking place. Two actors at play: top buyers at 12k-14k reaching their breakeven price, and current buyers active after the first higher high in over a year. If we get a correction, it will most likely result in another major cluster of re-accumulation at the 10k area (as expected from the volume profile before); if we breakout, well... enjoy the ride.”
 
The current landscape of the Bitcoin market is unique when compared with previous cycles. Puell said that due to macro factors, including the pandemic, Bitcoin saw unprecedented price movements.
 
For instance, on March 13, the price of Bitcoin dropped to as low as $3,596 on BitMEX in a 50% drop overnight. The unusual price movements Bitcoin saw throughout 2020 as a result of unexpected external variables increase the chances of an uncommon price cycle. Puell explained:
 
“Looking only a year and a half back, we had some of the most interesting market structures in any Bitcoin cycle. During several attempts at a ‘typical’ bullish trend with a strong halving narrative, two swans hit price discovery one after the other: PlusToken and COVID-19.”
 
Some variables to consider
In the short to medium-term, there are several variables that could have an impact on the price trend of Bitcoin.
 
In recent months, Bitcoin saw some correlation with gold, possibly due to the uncertainty in global markets causing investors to consider alternative stores of value. The low-interest rate policies by central banks across the world and the rapidly growing money supply will likely have a positive effect on Bitcoin price as well, many analysts believe.",1597584231,5,1

Aegis是可扩展的DeFi网络，可为现有DeFi借贷业务中的超抵押提供解决方案。 为了向用户提供更加多样化的贷款服务和基于贷款的衍生产品发行，Aegis将与合作伙伴合作建立Aegis生态系统，包括：  
 

\- 基于POS的区块链：以太坊，COSMOS，Polkadot，TRON  
 \- 传统的金融服务提供商：支付宝，Visa，万事达卡，美国运通卡  
 \- 敏捷与市场：Uniswap，Balancer, 1inch, Mesa

\- Oracle和协议：Chainlink，Augur，Band协议，Aeternity  
 \- 加密钱包：Enjin，Imtoken，Kcash，Trust Wallet，MetaMask 

同时，Aegis将为其用户群开发一套资产管理产品，使他们能够参与Aegie平台内的DeFi投资和资产交易:-

一.贷款，抵押借款和无抵押借款  
 

除提供贷款和抵押借款外，“宙斯盾”还提供“无抵押借款”。 Aegis使用专有的AI驱动的信用评分算法，根据提供的数据评估用户的信誉，并为每个用户分配“ Aegis得分”，这与传统的风险状况评估类似。 “宙斯盾得分”确定允许用户从流动资金池中提取的最大信用额度。  
 

二. 衍生品发行和交易协议  
 

在借贷层上，Aegis Network允许用户使用其本机衍生产品发行和交易协议直接交易各种加密资产和传统金融市场工具。  
 

三. 信用违约掉期作为无抵押借款的保险  
 

Aegis Network在风险管理方面持坚定立场，以确保网络中的贷方在发生任何违约时得到足够的保护和追索权。  
 

四. AUSD —稳定性和权益证明  
 

Aegis Network将发行本地稳定币-AUSD，以提供Aegis生态系统的价值稳定性以及其贷款服务的权益证明。  
 

五. 资产管理平台  
 

通过用户友好的投资组合管理仪表板，Aegis用户进行问卷调查以确定他们的风险/回报承受能力，随后通过Aegis Network为其分配各自的风险承受能力概况。  
 

六. 菲亚特到DeFi价值链的一站式解决方案  
 

通过以上三个核心组件，Aegis Network能够为用户提供一站式的DeFi借贷，交易和资产管理解决方案，从而捕获端到端交易和财务管理价值链。

代币经济学  
 

当实用程序代币为Aegis网络提供动力时，AEGIS代币通过以下用例来驱动生态系统价值：  
 

一. 汽油费和交易费  
 

借贷，借贷，交易和资产管理活动可能会向Aegis Network收取天然气和交易费。如果用户选择以AEGIS代币支付，则可以享受这些费用的折扣。  
 

二. 抵押和网络验证奖励  
 

Aegis Network验证者必须抵押一定数量的AEGIS代币作为抵押品，以参与链上交易的验证以及用户的信用额度和无抵押贷款配额的验证。  
 

三. 抵押品  
 

AEGIS代币可用作抵押品，以从Aegis流动性池中借入资金，并受技术设计中提供的抵押品模型的约束。  
 

IV. 网络治理  
 

社区中的AEGIS代币持有者保留提出提案并对这些提案进行投票的权利。提案可能包括更改权益奖励或在区块链上更新，并且要遵守网络提案的多数表决要求和最低法定要求。提案创建者和投票者必须抵押AEGIS代币。  
 

V. 通缩代币燃烧  
 

Aegis网络中产生的一部分天然气和交易费用将用于从公开市场上回购和燃烧AEGIS代币，从而形成通缩机制，减少AEGIS代币的供应。  
 

AEGIS代币应充当宙斯盾生态系统中的交易，价值存储和激励机制的媒介。代币持有者可以选择参与治理或验证者网络以获取奖励并为整个生态系统做出贡献。",1597574296,0,1

Typically, for Bitcoin (BTC), weekends are marked by reduced trading volume as day traders take a break and the CME Bitcoin markets are closed.
 
Experienced traders will also know that exchange order books thin out during the weekend, providing opportune moments for clever Bitcoin whales to exploit these gaps and sway the price through whipsaw volatility.
 
This Saturday things are different as the scenarios mentioned above are not deterring traders from a renewed push to the $12K mark.
 
If the current move to the key level fails, it would be the second time in a week and for some analysts multiple rejections at a key resistance level can be a bearish signal.
 
On the other hand, there are also an equal number of traders who will argue that multiple retests of a key resistance level heighten the chance that it will be breached on future attempts.
 
A few positives for Bitcoin price are: the daily chart continues to show a pattern of higher lows, the RSI is in bullish territory at 66, and traders show strong interest in buying into each dip, as shown by the rising purchasing volume on the daily timeframe.
 
In the event that traders can manage a 4-hour close above $12,000, Bitcoin will need to pursue a daily higher high above $12,068 and $12,123 then things will get quite interesting.
 
For the time being, we can see that the price is simply compressing into a tighter range within the pennant and drop the lower trendline should be supported by the high volume VPVR node extending from $11,730 to $11,500.
 
Typically a drop from such a pennant would warrant some concern but given buyer’s demonstrated interest in buying since July 28th and further back to March 12, it seems bulls will eventually have their way by flipping $12K to support in the short-term. 
 
As Bitcoin fought to retake the $12K level, the performance from altcoins has been a bit of a mixed bag.
 
#Chainlink (LINK) continues to lead the market, rallying 12% to reach a new all-time high at $19.80. #Ether (ETH) appears to be losing steam as it pulled back 2.2% and struggles to reclaim the $340 level.
 
Meanwhile, EOS finally managed to break above a key resistance to rally more than 18% and currently trades for $3.75  
 
According to CoinMarketCap, the overall #cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $373.4 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance index is currently at 58.8%.",1597573548,1,1

iaosqv,facepalm5000,"hodlmon.sh: a UTXO monitoring methodology and script for true connoisseurs of security, paranoia and BTC maximalism","Submitting this to help strengthen the community, and for review:

hodlmon.sh: a UTXO monitoring methodology and script for true connoisseurs of security, paranoia and BTC maximalism  


Monitor canary UTXOs for early detection of compromised private keys BEFORE funds are lost, using your own full node for maximum privacy and trustlessness. Note that you will need to implement your own notification strategy (email, push, sms, etc). This script is intended to run on your full node, but can be run from any machine with RPC access to your full node.  


hodlmon.sh is designed to check if a given UTXO (i.e. a specific output of a specific btc transaction) has been spent or not. This can be used for early and proactive detection if a seed phrase or private key has been compromised, so you have time to move your btc before full compromise happens.  In order for this to work, a small amount of btc should be sent to an address controlled only by a given seedphrase, with that seedphrase being part of a multisig wallet or a seedphrase+passphrase wallet, and the majority of your funds controlled in the seedphrase+passphrase or multisig wallet. The idea is to leave the small amount of btc (the canary utxo) in the address, so that it never moves unless the seedphrase that controls it has been compromised and all funds in the wallet swept. In this way, you use those compromised sats to buy information about the current security status of your wallet(s).  


Example usage:  
Set up a cron job to run hodlmon.sh every 30 min to check if transaction output at index ""0"" for transaction with id ""123"" has been spent already. Use ""my\_utxo\_nickname"" as a friendly name for the UTXO (to differentiate between multiple wallets)  


\*/30 \* \* \* \* /path/to/hodlmon.sh 123 0 my\_utxo\_nickname &gt; /tmp/hodlmon\_log 2&gt; /tmp/hodlmon\_err\_log  


Usage scenario #1: Seedphrase (A) + passphrase (A')  
Majority of funds are held in a wallet controlled by both the seedphrase and passphrase, A and A'. A token amount of btc is controlled only by seedphrase A.

A + A': majority of funds  
A: canary UTXO

hodlmon.sh is used to monitor the canary funds locked by A, so that if it is discovered that A has been compromised, the funds locked by A and A' can be moved to a new wallet before the passphrase A' can be cracked and all your funds exfiltrated.  


Usage scenario #2: multisig e.g. 2 of 3, with seed phrases A, B and C  
Majority of funds held in a multisig wallet controlled by 3 seedphrases A, B, and C.  3 small canary UTXOs are held in wallets each controlled by A, B or C, respectively.

A + B + C: majority of funds  
A: canary UTXO 1  
B: canary UTXO 2  
C: canary UTXO 3

One benefit of multisig (e.g. 2 of 3) is that even if 1 key is compromised, your funds are safe, since at least 2 keys are needed to release funds. But how do you that none of the keys has yet been compromised? If you create separate wallets controlled each by only 1 of the individual keys, and use hodlmon.sh to monitor whether those UTXOs have been exfiltrated, then you can detect partial compromise of your setup before a full exfiltration event takes place, so you can move your funds to a new multisig wallet with freshly generated and uncompromised keys.

Example of 3 cronjobs to monitor all 3 canary UTXOs:  
\*/30 \* \* \* \* /path/to/hodlmon.sh 123 0 key1 &gt; /tmp/hodlmon\_log\_1 2&gt; /tmp/hodlmon\_err\_log\_1  
\*/30 \* \* \* \* /path/to/hodlmon.sh 456 0 key2 &gt; /tmp/hodlmon\_log\_2 2&gt; /tmp/hodlmon\_err\_log\_2  
\*/30 \* \* \* \* /path/to/hodlmon.sh 789 0 key3 &gt; /tmp/hodlmon\_log\_3 2&gt; /tmp/hodlmon\_err\_log\_3

Now if you listened to [the podcast](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/bitcoin-vs-ethereum-with-samson-mow-vitalik-buterin), Ethereum isn't really that decentralised, even the founder doesn't run a full node or know how to reach a consensus on the exact current supply, he doesn't seem to strive for a trustless, decentralised, distributed blockchain.

He thinks that If there's something wrong surely someone will figure it out and tell us, we don't need to verify by ourselves, we can trust/hope there is at least one honest person who is doing the verification out of every 200 people

ibjxoo,FinancialDiplomat,"Do you need to remember the wallet you used to store btc, or is it irrelevant when knowing the seed?","Have been wondering about this for a long time.

If someone else knew your seed, without knowing which wallet you used to store your btc, could he get your btc or not?

If a create a seed on wallet A, B, or C, but in the future I delete my hard drive, or delete the wallet AND forgot which wallet I used, but the seed is saved somewhere else, how could I get back those BTC?

What's the relationship with the pass phrase and the wallet? To what extend does it matter to know the wallet you once used? Even though it is said that the seed is only the key to the coins on the blockchain, 

I have also heard that in some cases you need to use the same wallet because it does not work to use the pass phrase of wallet A on wallet B.",1597689274,9,1
ibju0c,gluegunfun,Been out the game for over 2 years. Buying my first bitcoin ($500) today or tomorrow. Ready to hold and not trade myself to zero.,"I rode the wave to 20k and made great profits.  I then amassed a nice extra profit through trading.  Then I cut it in half through margin trading.  As things started to head the other way I had to jump ship and sell for some health problems (turned out I would have lost it o. The way to 3k).

I’m really happy to buy and hold again as life has settled and my business is doing fine.  I’m gonna  buy $500 - 1k a month and see where this thing goes.  I would love to buy that Altcoin that moons but the market is so saturated that it seems impossible.  I swore off trading.  I’ve sworn off many things before time and time again.

Personally i did not want to bother with large dish antennas and lnb, and my budget could not justify several hundred dollars for a dvb receiver dongle. But now both issues seem to be conquered with suitable SDR dongles selling for 25 dollars and flat panel antennas with integrated lnb making it that much cheaper and convenient. Instead of almost 500 dollars the cost is down to under 200.

But there are so many caveats and details that are not entirely clear. For instance for the Ku Low band reception the guide recommends E4000 but it is a discontinued product that costs at least 2x compared to the R820T2. If the issue is only signal strength, this seems like it can be ignored.

Then we come to second issue: to use flat panel antennas with SDR you are forced to keep it in low band mode as 22khz signal is missing in these cheap SDR. This means the antenna is not working optimally, so again missing signal strength from optimal. What is the combined effect of these inefficiencies?",1597687135,2,1

Say I buy 100 coins of ""ZZZ"" at $8.00 each. The price rises, and now each coin is $12.00 each, a 50% increase. I've heard advice to ""take profits, then when there is a dip buy more to accumulate more"". Does this make sense if the coin never goes back down to a price below $8.00? Because if I take profits and then buy back in on a small dip but a price above $8.00 -- say for instance $10 -- then I've just increased my average price. How is that a good thing? Or should I think of it as ""extra coins"" at a $10 price that I never would have had since I am using profits to make the purchase? I can't seem to get my head around this. I just want to understand the theory behind it and proceed in the most profitable way.

ibgzti,Gold-Standard100,Lockdown and Recession-Proof Side Hustle,"**Lockdown and Recession Proof Side Hustle**

Some people call it ‘Global Gold Rush 2020’ as more than 2000 people across the world daily, are rushing to join this extraordinary online money-making system. It has already produced several millionaires in different parts of the world, in less than 6 months.

Needless to say, that the Lockdown has adversely impacted several businesses across the globe, resulting in job losses overnight, companies closing, and the poorest of the poor ‘hanging on for dear life to survive’.

Eskom has won its bid against NERSA (National Energy Regulator of South Africa) to increase the price of electricity by 15%, effective 2021. Just recently, the price of petrol increased by 5 cents per litre, and diesel by a whopping 45 cents per litre! When the price of fuel increases, so does the price of food. We all find ourselves in a position, where we simply cannot deal with price escalations of any sort.

With job losses on the increase, and very few companies hiring during the lockdown, where do we move to from here? Is there another way to generate an income that will not only sustain our current lifestyles, but improve our financial status significantly? Studies have shown that more millionaires were made during the Lockdown globally, than any other period. Fact or Fiction? Feel free to google this one.

It seems there may be ‘light at the end of this dark tunnel’

A good friend of mine, has been making quite a bit of ‘noise’ on the internet by using, what he calls a ‘system of success’ (S.O.S.)  and raking in large amounts of cash daily. He is 36 years old and became South Africa’s first millionaire on this income generating platform. He made an astronomical 4.5 million rand in less than 90 days! I would not have believed it, if I did not see it for myself. Just recently, he moved into his new home, with his wife and two kids. It cost him well over 2 million rand, and he bought it cash!

When I asked him, how he did it, he said “Please note, that this is not a job (just over broke), it is an opportunity to change your life for the better” He continued by saying “ You do not need a skill or a university degree, you need a willingness to learn, you need to be teachable”

The highlight of what he said, still sticks with me. He said “I worked this system really hard and was fortunate to become the first millionaire in South Africa in 90 days, using this income generating platform. It may not happen for you in 3 months, but if you can achieve a level of income that can possibly render you debt-free, that will allow you to buy a typical family-sized home, in the area of your choice, and perhaps a decent 5 year old vehicle…in 90 days, would that work for you? I said YES! out loud, before he completed the question. He continued…”For that, you will need dedication and determination” In conclusion he said, “If you would like to create generational wealth, for you, and your family, are you willing to learn from me, and work this system for the next 6-12 months? My answer was a resounding “Yes!”

He ended off by saying…” To start your journey of success with me, you will need”:

\*A reliable internet connection / wi-fi

\*A smartphone / laptop / computer

\*An open mind to accept change and be different (definition of insanity: ‘doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result?’

\*An affordable investment to secure your future (remember this is not a JOB!)

Being a natural born skeptic, I said the same thing that so many of us say, when we are presented with a life-changing opportunity…

”It sounds all good, but I do not have the minimum investment to get started” or…

“Let’s see how it works for you. If I see that you are making money, then I will join” or…

“It sounds too good to be true, how can any person make so much money, in such a short space of time?”

And the list goes on…

Truthfully, there are several scams out there…and many of us have fallen prey to these. At the same time, there are genuine life-changing opportunities, with the potential to transform peoples lives from abject poverty to financial prosperity. I have been ‘sitting on the fence’ for too long, and watching golden opportunities pass. My close friend and mentor, now millionaire, finally convinced me to G.O.M.A (get off my ass) and create my path to financial freedom. He agreed to mentor me. I started about 2 months ago with a meagre investment, only to see positive gains. If he could generate 4.5 million rand in 90 days, I will be happy to make that amount in a year!

If you are curious enough to learn more…please reply, I will connect you directly with this millionaire.",1597680470,0,1

So I see clearly that on the long term (not short term) the value of bitcoin will explode, some even say to 60 000 , with the current stimulus plans, I think it is realistic that bitcoin will move up quite high

So I am also thinking to invest in bitcoin, but on the long term (3 or 5 years or more).

However, how do you invest in bitcoin in a safe way?

I know official companies where I can buy the bitcoins and I also understand you need a wallet.

What is the best way to buy bitcoins and how to save it:

locally or online with a wallet?

Locally sounds safe, but then you need to have multiple backups in case something happens and

we have heard  stories where people lost their bitcoins on their computer

Online is easy but who can guarantee that I will have access after a couple of years

i8tfm1,uncapslock,PSA: You're currently accustomed to a bear market and you WILL try to sell too early,"Imagine you're an astronaut going into space for the first time.  You've studied for many years and know to expect zero-gravity.  Perhaps you've even trained on simulators and gotten an estimation of how it might feel.

First-time astronauts invariably have the same feedback:

&gt;""Nothing could've prepared me for space.  There's absolutely **nothing like it.**""

Embarking on your first bull run is much like going into space.

You may have read about it, done some paper trading, maybe even simulated going through 2016-2017, but nothing can prepare you for the gut-wrenching, schizophrenic ride of ecstasy of having real money on the line.

Your intuition will fail you.  You've grown all your life in regular gravity and have developed visual-spatial senses that work well on Earth. 

**When you throw an orange, you expect it to fall.  When you see Bitcoin go up 15%, you expect it to flag then come back down to support.**

What's most insidious is that your instincts you've developed run subconsciously directing you to make mistakes.  Much like an astronaut spends a day getting acclimated to space, **give yourself time and patience** to get used to the new normal.

You will sell too early, thinking that on Earth, oranges don't normally travel that far.  I'm here to tell you when **you're going to the moon, oranges keep on going, much further than you'd expect.**

The reason why veterans tell you to hodl is because it's the **most effective advice helping you learn that you are weightless in space.** Once Bitcoin goes on a run, the fatal mistake is pulling the ripcord too quickly.  This causes you to get stuck in fiat watching day after day of losing value denominated in BTC.  This is the primary cause for people fomo'ing back in higher only to get rekt when Bitcoin comes down from its local top.

**If you're hodling Bitcoin, no one can tell you to get off the rocket ship. Ride it all the way to the moon with us.  10M by 2030 is my best estimation.**

&gt;  
&gt;While U.S. consumer prices in July generally rose more than economists expected, the news was somewhat worse for people over 62.  
&gt;  
&gt;A separate Bureau of Labor Statistics index that tracks prices associated with older consumers climbed 1.3% last month from a year earlier, compared with 1% for the consumer price index overall in Wednesday’s inflation report. The agency this month made the data available on its website; previously it was provided only on request.  
&gt;  
&gt;The index shows inflation for decades has been rising at a faster clip for seniors than for the general public. That’s because it assigns higher weights to items -- including medical services and housing -- based on their relative importance to older people.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 1987, Congress directed the BLS to begin calculating a consumer price index for the elderly. The BLS developed the series and reconstructed it back to the early 1980s.

icpzbf,RalphAnderson_,Never say never,"Kim Dotcom Predicted #Bitcoin’s Rise Two Years Ago
 
Internet entrepreneur and digital rights activist, #KimDotcom, congratulated Twitter followers who bought Bitcoin based on his advice in 2018.
 
According to a tweet published on August 17, the founder of the now-defunct file-sharing website, Megaupload, also praised followers that managed to capitalize on gold’s rising prices.
 
In August 2018, Dotcom told his followers that they should buy Bitcoin and gold. He said that the U.S. dollar “will become worthless” and that he believed that a “U.S. economic collapse” was imminent. He felt that this would take all “old money currencies” down, explaining:
 
""Times will get tough. But you’ll be fine if you hedge some of your assets in preparation for the crash. The big crash is coming 100%.""
 
One user refuted Dotcom’s tweet, claiming that followers who took his advice made nothing but “more useless paper.” Dotcom replied that the user “must be new” here.
 
As of press time, Bitcoin is currently trading above $12,000, while Gold has rallied above $2,000 in recent weeks.
 
Dotcom’s interest in #crypto is well known. On October 22, the #cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex announced that its Initial Exchange Offering, or IEO, platform would offer a digital content monetization token called K.im in partnership with Kim Dotcom.
 
However, the company abruptly canceled the token sale on November 5, citing the changing face of regulatory scrutiny over such tokens.",1597851472,4,1

icpui5,RalphAnderson_,What do you think?,"Donald Trump: ‘I’ll Start Looking at’ Pardoning Edward Snowden

Edward Snowden may be able to return to the United States if #DonaldTrump chooses to grant the whistleblower a presidential pardon.

According to an Aug. 15 report from Reuters, Trump said he was “going to start looking at” a possible pardon for the whistleblower, who has been living in asylum in Russia since he left the U.S. in 2013. The comments came shortly after Trump told The Post “a lot of people” think that Snowden “is not being treated fairly.”

In a Twitter response to Trump’s comments, Snowden said:

“The last time we heard a White House considering a pardon was 2016, when the very same Attorney General who once charged me conceded that, on balance, my work in exposing the NSA's unconstitutional system of mass surveillance had been ‘a public service.’”

Under Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, a sitting president has the power to grant reprieves and pardons “for offenses against the United States.” Snowden still faces federal charges for violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property.

Should the U.S. president invoke this authority, it would make the former National Security Agency contractor the 26th person Trump has pardoned since taking office in January 2017.

Snowden still outspoken on crypto
From exile in Russia, Snowden has often expressed his opinions on #Bitcoin (BTC), even voicing concerns over its blockchain as “devastatingly public.”

The servers Snowden used back in 2013 to leak thousands of documents to journalists were reportedly paid for using Bitcoin. In addition, the whistleblower said he “felt like buying Bitcoin” during the March downturn when the price of the coin dropped to $3,782.

In 2019, Snowden had hinted he might turn to crypto in order to circumvent the U.S. government‘s attempt to restrict his access to profits from the publication of his book, Permanent Record. On Aug. 7, a U.S. Magistrate Judge ruled to impose sanctions on the whistleblower over his book sales, stating that he had ""unequivocally acted in bad faith.""",1597851069,1,1

icodc2,Racchh_xx,Has Anyone Bought Btc Using Vouchers,"Hi I have still been just able to use bittylicious as still haven't got updated photo ID, to be able to buy elsewhere. Even places that people had suggested before, have wanted id for first transaction at least. Been paying slightly more, not having id. But nothing to major. A few weeks ago the fees charged soared then went back down. I heard that crypto vouchers might be a better alternative, but looked into it &amp; have seen mixed reviews. Crypto. io was one recommended. And when contacted them, they told me that to cover fees I should buy €2 - 3 euro extra, plus up to 4%. Which sounds a lot, but working it out its not bad considering the other options. That once bought voucher, a code will be emailed &amp; I redeem that code &amp; have the btc sent to my wallet, minus the fees. But reviews are so mixed. I'm wondering if 1, any crypto voucher is a good option &amp; 2, if yes if they are the right choice or elsewhere would be better. Any advice welcome. Thanks",1597846335,3,1

icnibd,Morocotacoin,Bitcoin Más del 70% de los encuestados no venderían sus bitcoins aunque su precio cayera a $0,"&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0h1pahaomyh51.png?width=626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2682ce7cd39028059b3474d8bf670e3e3993d86)

Una encuesta reciente realizada por el inversor **Plan B** mostró que la gran mayoría de los tenedores de bitcoins no los vendería aunque su [precio](https://www.morocotacoin.com/2020/08/el-bitcoin-se-ubico-este-martes-en-los-12-249-dolares-mientras-que-chainlink-y-eos-amanecieron-en-negativo/) llegase a $0.

El sondeo se llevó a cabo el domingo pasado a través de la red social Twitter, en la que los seguidores de la cuenta [**@100trillionsUSD**](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD) respondieron a la siguiente pregunta:  
«¿Qué pasa si el precio de BTC no aumenta drásticamente los próximos años? ¿Cuándo venderás?».

El resultado arrojó que un 72,1% de los 22.635 participantes no venderían sus bitcoins aún si este perdiera la totalidad de su valor.

En contraste solo un 16% afirmó estar dispuesto a vender sus BTC si su precio cayera por debajo de los $6.000. Un 5,9% lo haría con un precio bajo los $3.000 y un 5,8% vendería si el bitcoin cayera en menos de $1.000. 

El precio de la principal criptomoneda se encuentra actualmente en una [carrera alcista](https://www.morocotacoin.com/2020/08/bitcoin-sobre-los-12-000-seguira-la-carrera-alcista/) que la mantiene muy lejos de estos escenarios, cotizando al cierre de esta redacción (11:00 am hora de Venezuela) en $12.066, según datos de [**CoinMarketCap**](https://coinmarketcap.com/). 

**Plan B** afirmó que los resultados de la encuesta podrían ayudar a entender la «visión, convicción y paciencia» que existe entre los tenedores de bitcoin, basándose en sus 124,4 mil seguidores.

Actualmente el sentimiento en el mercado de bitcoins mantiene una posición de codicia extrema desde hace varios días, según el índice de miedo y avaricia medido por [**Alternative**](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/). 

## ¿Quién es Plan B?

Según señala su propia [**página web**](https://100trillionusd.github.io/#main), Plan B es un inversor institucional holandés con experiencia en finanzas legales y cuantitativas.

Además es el creador del modelo Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow (S2F), que cuantifica el valor del bitcoin considerando su escasez. El modelo S2F no solo es aplicable a bitcoin sino también al oro, la plata y otros activos.

Actualmente trabaja como administrador de inversiones en un equipo que maneja un balance de varios miles de millones de dólares.

El portal web revela que el nombre «Plan B» se refiere a un «plan alternativo de flexibilización cuantitativa, tipos de interés negativos y degradación de la moneda en general».

Su nombre de usuario en Twitter, u/100trillionsUSD (100 trillones de dólares) es una referencia al billete de 100 billones de dólares de Zimbabwe durante la hiperinflación de 2008.",1597843249,1,1

Brooks said that this is the time when people depend on the banking system a lot more than before and they “need to get to a place where payments can be transmitted virtually instantaneously, where errors can be eliminated.” The solution is blockchain and other such networks.

ickus0,TheGreatMuffin,Collection of fee estimating tools (for saving on fees when sending a bitcoin transaction),"Here are some resources that can help you estimate fees when sending a bitcoin transaction, so you don't end up overpaying unnecessarily. Keep in mind that in order to take advantage of this, you need a proper bitcoin wallet which allows for custom fee setting. A selection of such wallets you can find [here](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html) or [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet).  

The order here is roughly from advanced to easy.  

1) https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,24h  

Here you can see a visualization of how many unconfirmed transactions are currently on the network, as well as how many were there in the past. Each coloured layer represents a different fee amount. F.ex the deep blue (lowest layer) are the 1sat/byte transactions, slightly brighter level above are the 2sat/byte transactions and so on.  

The most interesting graph is the third one, which shows you the size of the current mempool in MB and the amount of transactions with different fee levels, which would compete with your transaction if you were to send it right now. This should help you estimating how high you need to set the fee (in sat/byte) in order to have it confirmed ""soon"". But this also should help you to see that even the 1sat/byte transactions get confirmed very regularly, especially on weekends and in the night periods, and that the spikes in the mempool are always temporary. For that you can switch to higher timeframes in the upper right corner, f.ex here is a 30 days view: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,30d. You clearly can see that the mempool is cyclical and you can set a very low fee if you are not in hurry.  

2) https://mempool.space  

This is also an overview of the current mempool status, although less visual than the previous one. It shows you some important stats, like the mempool size, some basic stats of the recent blocks (tx fees, size etc). Most importantly, it makes a projection of how large you need to set your fees in sat/byte if you want your transaction to be included in the next block, or within the next two/three/four blocks. You can see this projection in the left upper corner (the blocks coloured in brown).  

3) https://whatthefee.io  

This is a simple estimate tool. It shows you the likelihood (in %) of a particular fee size (in sat/byte) to be confirmed within a particular timeframe (measured in hours). It is very simple to use, but the disadvantage is that it shows you estimates only for the next 24 hours. You probably will still overpay by this method, if your transaction is less time sensitive than that.  

4) https://twitter.com/CoreFeeHelper  

This is a very simple bot that tweets out fees projections every hour or so. It tells you how you need to set the fees in order to be confirmed within 1hour/6hours/12hours/1day/3days/1week. Very simple to use.  

Hopefully one of these tools will help you save fees for your next bitcoin transaction. Or at least help you understand that even with a very low fee setting your transaction will be confirmed sooner or later. Furthermore, I hope it makes you understand how important it is to use a wallet that allows you to set your own fees.",1597831563,13,1

I have a dedicated 2011 MacBook Pro running High Sierra that I’d like to use in support of Bitcoin. So far, I have installed and verified GPG Suite and Bitcoin Core following instructions from bitcoin.orf. It is now synced, and I hope to add block explorer, a lightning node, and an electrum server. Once complete, I’d like to create some tutorials and guides to help others who have old Macs, since there is already a lot of good info for Windows and Linux.

I found this guide on Medium talking about Power Node Launcher, but it’s doesn’t have the same emphasis on security as the other tools I’ve setup. Before taking next steps, I’d like input from the community on the order of steps and trusted sources for installing the aforementioned programs.

If there is anything else I can do with my computer and bandwidth to help Bitcoin, please let me know. Specifically, if I am able to setup a lightning node, would it help if I stored some bitcoin on it to support transactions? Should I setup a slow simple mining program or run an older ASIC miner that is not part of a pool just to help diversify the network? Should I setup a satellite connection as Andreas suggested in one of his older videos? Thanks for your input.",1597820831,12,1

idh5uh,freebit,"Worst Case Scenario, Bitcoin Really Does Go To The Moon, and Beyond. Let's Discuss","This is an entirely hypothetical scenario where the price of btc really does go to the moon, or even beyond in a manner similar to PlanB's stock to flow model.

Phase 1, bitcoin continues to rise in price from its current level of about $12,000. Some in the investing industry take notice and move into btc as a reserve asset, but so far bitcoin continues to remain an asset few are thinking about and fewer are investing in.

Phase 2, the price of bitcoin has risen to $50,000 and what was once one or two corporations investing is now a handful. Bitcoin is now in the news fairly regularly and CNBC now displays a ticker. A few more corporations are investing and the Robin Hood crowd is starting to really take notice. The DXY has dropped from the low 90's to the high 80's. Congress finally passed another round of stimulus and even more people are beginning to seriously discuss UBI as both parties want to do whatever it takes to get into office.

Phase 3, a modest UBI was finally passed subject to yearly congressional renewal. At first, everyone is extremely happy and the economy begins to boom. Stocks are making all time highs again. Covid restrictions begin to greatly ease and the economy is on the mend. Inflation is modest when using the official statistics and nobody is too worried. Perhaps the fans of MMT were right all along.

Phase 4, bitcoin continues to rise. Countries quietly and sometimes not so quietly grumble about both the level of debt the US has, the falling strength of the dollar, and the US's ability to control sovereign nations via the use of the dollar and sanctions. North Korea announces it is going to start mining and accruing bitcoin. The world laughs. 

Phase 5, more companies are beginning to move into bitcoin and and price moves about $100,000. The market cap is now 2 trillion and about a thrid of the market cap of gold. Several additional small countries make public that they are mining bitcoin and strategically accruing it at a national level. The DXY begins to inch closer to 80.

Phase 6, the DXY drops below 80. Several small countries announce they are going to being to lower their holdings of dollar denominated treasuries in an effort to diversify risk. Several fortune 500 companies announce they are going to diversify into bitcoin as well. The price of bitcoin quickly rises to $200,000.

Phase 7, China announces that it will no longer hold US treasuries. At first, this seems of no consequence because they had been lowering their holdings for years. The Bank of Japan announces it will continue to buy US treasuries. Many see this as a means of Japan to assure its national safety and the protection of the US. The DXY continues to slowly fall and is now in the high 70's.

Phase 8, several countries now announce that they will allow the use of bitcoin for international trade as it is a perfect medium of exchange between countries. Additionally, many countries are now accruing bitcoin and gold for their national reserves. Bitcoin passes $750,000. 

Phase 9, the DXY falls below 75. Countries where the population was holding dollars now see that it has lost a quarter of its value. In a panic they all rush to the only obvious alternative which is bitcoin. The ability to use the lightning network makes it very inexpensive to buy and sell.

Phase 10, the cost of all imports have doubled in the recent months. Everyone is blaming everyone else. Rioting has continued to be a nightly occurrence and has moved into the suburbs as there is little left in the cities to take. 

Phase 11, the US blames China for the fall of the dollar and claims they committed an act of war. The US begins to quietly strategically mine bitcoin and to purchase bitcoin as a reserve asset. Talk abounds about another confiscation like FDR did in the 30's.

Phase 12, hundreds of bitcoin millionaires leave the US and acquire passports in other nations. Many are willing to provide a passport if you are willing to maintain a deposit with them of 0.5 btc in one of the local banks. 

Phase 13, the US announces that all citizens must trade in 1/2 of their bitcoin holdings in exchange for the current market price of US dollars. People with money on the exchanges and in custodial banks have it taken automatically. Talk circulates about going after people that have their bitcoin in hardware wallets. 

Phase 14, the US dollar continues to fall and loses a half of its value again with respect to btc in the last month. Bitcoin now flees the exchanges and banks in an effort to prevent another possibility of a confiscation.

Phase 15, the US has a bank holiday and announces both a digital currency and a peg to bitcoin at a rate of 10 satoshies to 1 dollar. Severe austerity is announced.

I sent this TX:

Worked a week ago for the Last year to date.,So I have been constantly for the past year using kraken as my exhange. Today my bank operator gave automated message about a risky transfer of funds. and is now blocking transfers to kraken completely. I had to give a kyc even before for the bank where my funds are going and it was ok for many months. Now just everything is being rejected. Hope its only me lol.,1597949859,7,1

idg20b,Goodgui23,A question about fees.,"Fees are attached to all BTC transactions right? Do the miner take in these fees in addition to the block rewards? If they do, a higher fee will entice the miner to add a transaction to his block I would assume. So are transactions with low fees added to blocks slower than higher fees?",1597948705,9,1
idg07j,brianddk,"Node operators, please set the minrelaytxfee to zero as suggested in the docs.","Since to 0.14.0 release, the `minrelaytxfee` still defaults to 1000 sat/vkB, but it is [recommend in the relnotes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.0.md#minimum-fee-rate-policies) that this limit be completely unset.

&gt; Since the changes in 0.12 to automatically limit the size of the mempool and improve the performance of block creation in mining code it has not been important for relay nodes or miners to set -minrelaytxfee.

&gt; The -minrelaytxfee option continues to exist but is recommended to be left unset.

source: [0.14.0 relnotes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.0.md#minimum-fee-rate-policies)

Unsetting this option (`-minrelaytxfee=0`) will allow lower fee TXNs to make it to the miners.  Miners will then have a larger selection of TXNs to choose from.  For users concerned about mempool bloat, just set `maxmempool` below it's default of 300 MB (`-maxmempool=200`).  Or you could set `minrelaytxfee` to 11 sat/vkB (`-minrelaytxfee=0.00000011`)

Ultimately, I would think that changing the default in bitcoin-core from 1000 sat/vkB to 100 sat/vkB might be a good move.  The mempool has already run dry [6 days this month](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/i4u5el/psa_low_fee_txns_still_clear_every_day_from_4am/).  No reason not to let the miners continue to mine some super low-fee TXNs if they want to.  They control this with `blockmintxfee`

What I would suggest adding to `bitcoin.conf`

```
minrelaytxfee=0
blockmintxfee=0
maxmempool=300
```

For those wanting to be more conservative:

```
minrelaytxfee=0.00000011
blockmintxfee=0.00000011
maxmempool=200
```

Really anything below 1000 sat/vkB would be better.

Since assets can’t be at ATH all the time, it seems reasonable to expect a large dump on stock markets when the aid programs of FED and ECB are over. 

Given that many institutional investors entered the market + CME futures, when the stock is down, traders will sell risk assets such as BTC.

idcf71,primalfabric,A Friend of mine recently bought his First Bitcoin and asked for some tips on how to keep it safe... Thought I'd share them here as well!,"Here are a few things you can do to keep your Bitcoin safe:

\#1 **Use Hardware Wallet:** Hardware Wallets are considered one the safest solution to store your bitcoin. Your private Keys stay offline so chances of a hacker stealing your bitcoin are relatively low. 

Wallets like [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) and [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) are two of the most popular wallets currently in the market. 

\#2 **Never Store your Bitcoin on Exchanges:** Most of the major Bitcoin hacks have always taken place at an exchange. Such platforms are always the high target for cybercriminals thus storing your bitcoin/crypto there is not a good idea. 

Always withdraw your assets once the trade is made and store them in your personal wallet(s). 

\#3 **Use separate wallets for daily use and savings:** It is always wise to keep your daily use bitcoin and savings in separate wallets. 

If you are using bitcoin for daily transaction your wallet will spend a much higher time online, which increases its risk of getting hacked. Only keep a small amount in such wallets. 

Keeping your extra bitcoin separate protects it at such events. 

\#4 **Keep Backup:** If anything to your device or wallet, the only to recover your funds is through a backup so make sure you have one. 

\#5 **Store your Private Keys/Wallet Seed Offline and** ***Never*** **Share them:**  Make sure that your private keys are securely stored **offline.** This is the most secure way to protect your wallet from hackers. 

The same goes for your Wallet Seed. Never store your wallet seed online, in case of a cyber-attack you risk exposing your seed to the hacker if they are stored online. 

\#6 **Never click links or send your bitcoin to unsolicited schemes:** If the recent Twitter hack has taught us anything its that we should never send bitcoin to 'quick-rich' or similar sensational schemes no matter the source.

Always verify the source and get more information before sending your bitcoin.

What seems interesting is the ability of this to reduce fees compared to traditional atomic swaps where if you perform 100 atomic swaps you would be subject to 100 different network fees. Supposedly with lightning swaps, you open a lightning channel and pay the network fee for that one lightning channel.

**BtcTurk Supports Women's and Men's National Teams: #SonuKupaOlsun (#LetThisBeTheRoadToCup)!**

**BtcTurk's CEO, Özgür Güneri** commented: ""As BtcTurk, we continue to move forward on our path with the mission of being a pioneer brand in the world. We take great pride in being one of the ""Main"" supporters of our National Teams at the UEFA European Championship, which will be held in 2021 — the first time the games will be held in an odd-numbered year. Last year, we supported Yeni Malatyaspor, one of the successful clubs in TFF's Super League, as their name and jersey sponsor. This year, we continue to contribute to the Turkish sports and football community, and we are very pleased to support our Women's and Men's National Teams. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Mr. Nihat Özdemir, President of TFF and to all members of the board. With this agreement to be valid for 28 months, BtcTurk undertakes to be the main sponsor of our Women's and Men's National Teams. This way, we aim to support the successful representation of Turkish sports in the world and to contribute to saving resources for future generations. Our agreement with TFF will further strengthen our National Teams, which make us proud at all times, prior to finals of European Football Championship. With the stability to be achieved thanks to this partnership, we firmly believe that our National Teams will realize their great ambitions in the future tournaments and fill the people of our country with great joy. As BtcTurk, we wish our Women's and Men's National Teams success and say #SonuKupaOlsun (#LetThisBeTheRoadToCup)""

**TFF President Nihat Özdemir** commented; ""Today we launch a very significant partnership with BtcTurk, the leading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange platform in Turkey and a pioneer in its field. Football is a team sport and nowadays sponsors are among the most important players of this team. We are stronger and more successful with our sponsors. As Turkish Football Federation, we have always joined forces with prominent brands. BtcTurk, the newest member of our sponsor family, is a young and very significant value for our country. I express my sincere thanks to them for the support they provide to our Women's and Men's National Teams. With this agreement, I hope that our National Teams will write stories of success that lead to trophies. Thanks to the support of BtcTurk, I believe that both our Men's and Women's National Teams will gain many achievements to put a smile on the faces of Turkish people. Our National Team jumped from 41st place to 29th in the FIFA ranking and hopefully will take firm steps to rank among the top 10 countries in the world. Our Women's National Teams will also make their mark in Europe in the future period.""

**Necla Güngör Kıragası, Head Coach of Women's National Team noted**; ""For me, it is very valuable to be here as the guest of our federation and our new sponsor BtcTurk in a manner that appreciates the presence of women in football and demonstrates the value attached to our Women's National Teams. For that matter, I would like to express my gratitude to our President Mr. Nihat Özdemir, to all members of the board, and to our sponsor BtcTurk on behalf of all women in the football community. Recently, women's involvement in football is highlighted more with the support of new organizational changes within women's football. We work very hard to be worthy of this trust and take responsibility in infrastructure projects to help women's football find a wider audience. Our target is to make Turkey one of the leading countries in women football in the near future. With the support of our new sponsor BtcTurk, I believe that we can achieve our target and I would like to convey my best wishes on the agreement both for our football community and our country.""",1597924440,8,1

OP noticed that his Trezor wouldn't connect to his Electrum wallet when entering a different passphrase than he used when creating the wallet. Thus, OP (likely) assumed that the wallet stored the private key, as it somehow knew that a different private key was now used.

Here is my original answer (with some modifications):

**IMPORTANT: I'm assuming here that you connected your Trezor by choosing the ""hardware wallet"" option in Electrum, rather than giving Electrum your 12/24 seed words.**

*TL;DR: No, your coins are safe :)*

I'm assuming by [passphrase](https://wiki.trezor.io/Multi-passphrase_encryption_(hidden_wallets))   you mean the 25th (or 13th) word. When you have this feature enabled, a private key gets generated every time you enter a passphrase. When you enter the same passphrase you used to create the wallet, the wallet with your funds shows up.  
Whenever you enter something different, a different private key is generated on your Trezor. This allows you to have multiple different wallets for example, by choosing the passphrases ""First Wallet"", ""Second Wallet"", ""Third Wallet"", or a secret wallet   with a secret passphrase.

So whenever you enter a new passphrase when connecting your Trezor to Electrum, the Trezor will send a new *public* key to Electrum. Electrum will then derive addresses from this public key and check those for balances. It won't find any, as you used a new passphrase.  
EDIT: I just realized that you said your wallet doesn't *connect* to Electrum when you use a different passphrase. This is simply because Electrum doesn't receive the correct public key from the Trezor and  therefore Electrum thinks it's a different wallet (which it is).

When you enter the passphrase you used during creation of your wallet, the Trezor will send your actual public key to Electrum, which will then find addresses with balances, which it will show to you. EDIT (to clarify): Connecting your Trezor after creating the wallet is only necessary to send funds or verify addresses, as the public key is already stored in the wallet.dat.  
The only thing Electrum actually stores is the public key, which can only be used to look at your  Bitcoin, not to move them. You might want to keep this public key a secret as well though, since it links all your funds to you. This is what Electrum stores in the wallet.dat file, which you can just encrypt by choosing a password for it.

Well done using a passphrase by the way! Should someone get their hands on your Trezor, a sophisticated attacker can get the secret key off the device [in 15 minutes](https://blog.kraken.com/post/3662/kraken-identifies-critical-flaw-in-trezor-hardware-wallets/). Using a passphrase makes this attack almost useless, as the both secret key AND the passphrase are needed to move your funds, and the passphrase is not stored on the device. A passphrase also allows you to hide funds from potential robbers that force you to unlock your wallet.  
You can do this by activating the passphrase feature and sending your funds to a wallet with a secret passphrase (**do NOT lose this**, as losing your passphrase renders your funds inaccessible).  Afterwards, you can safely deactivate the passphrase feature, so the device doesn't even ask for one should you get robbed.

EDIT: Should you be worried that you might forget your passphrase, you should look into [multisig](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature) wallets. Depending on how you set this up,  you can make it more secure against theft *and* less likely for you to lose access to your funds.  
Say for example you get four wallets: two hardware wallets, a well-protected (airgapped) laptop with Electrum, and a secure mobile wallet that allows for multisig (like [Fully Noded](https://fullynoded.app/)).  
You can then create a 2-of-4 multisig wallet that requires you to sign transactions with any two of these four wallets.  
The increase in security comes from the fact that an attacker now needs full access to two of your devices (or their stored private keys) at once.  
At the same time, the fact that you yourself now also need access to only half of your devices means that in the event of a total loss of one (or even two) of them, you can still move your funds to a new wallet.  
As long as you do regular checks (e.g. first day of each month), ensuring that you still have access to all your devices' stored private keys, you can always catch a loss of keys and fix this without losing funds (by creating a new multisig wallet and sending the funds there).  
This allows you to use a passphrase on your wallets without storing it *anywhere* physically or digitally. This would usually be very risky, as forgetting the passphrase would lead to a loss of funds, but this risk is now close to eliminated.

*(The following part was not in the original answer)*

Some **IMPORTANT** general secruity tips:

1. Consider running your own full node and [Electrum server](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx) ([also check the alternatives](https://blockstream.com/2020/06/16/en-esplora-and-other-alternatives-to-electrumx/)), which you connect your Electrum wallet to. This ensures that you don't send your public key to anyone else. If someone knows your public key, they know how much BTC you own, making you a potential target.
2. Always encrypt your wallet.dat (or whatever you called your wallet file), even if it's a watch-only wallet. This protects your public key (see 1. for why you want that).
3. Create watch-only wallets: Use an [airgapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_(networking)) device to create a wallet with Electrum (make sure to back up the seed phrase) and [export the public key](https://support.node40.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010314848-Exporting-your-Electrum-Master-Public-Key-). Then [create a new watch-only wallet](https://bitcoinelectrum.com/creating-a-watch-only-wallet/) on another device (like your everyday laptop) with that public key to be able to check your funds. (To create the initial wallet, you can also use any other hard- or software wallet that allows you to export the master public key.)
4. Keep some funds on your hardware wallets. If an attackers sees funds on the wallets, they might not force you to enter a passphrase or ask if you have any multisig wallets (lying under pressure is hard).
5. Hide all your wallets in different places. If someone sees that you have multiple wallets lying around, they might realize you have a multisig wallet.
6. Don't risk a robber getting (for example) two keys to your 2-of-4 multisig wallet and then racing him to move your funds with the other two keys when they leave. They're gonna come back and be pissed. If it comes to this, you need protection until the robber is caught. *STAY SAFE!*
7. The easiest way to solve a problem is to never have it. Don't make yourself a target. If nobody even *suspects* you have a multisig (or any wallet at all), they're not gonna look for it.

*Please correct any mistakes you find and I will edit my post. I will also gladly add more tips to the list. I will of course credit anyone who helps.*

Anyways, I still don't understand it all fully. I investigated a bit and found out that I should create a wallet on an offline computer and all that stuff. So my understanding is that I get a public key (a wallet code that I use to send money to it?) and a private key (used to access the wallet?). I understand that I can send the money to the wallet via public key (I guess), but how would I send the money from that paper wallet if I ever need it? How are the fees and confirmations going to work? Is it a MUST to use BIP39 standard or can I use any words (from my own language)? If I can use any words, where do I enter them and what software do I use for it? Should I maybe write down the private key instead of using a seed phrase? Is [bitaddress.org](https://bitaddress.org) suitable for using seed phrase that I want?

i9mrre,pilot131313,advice,"Hello everyone, 

I was wondering if anyone can give some advice for something im trying to set up.  
I have a portfolio with bitstamp that consists btc,eth,xrp at different weights.  
It is approaching now 100% profit...  
I am happy to take profits and sell 50% of each crypto above when the total portfolio hits 100% profit.  
i.e. take my initial investment out and leave just the profits in the account.  
I am happy with that.  
But i'm thinking i don't want to miss out on any further profits so trying to work out how to use trailing stop option.  
As cryptos are volatile i'm thinking about a 10% spread.  
So sell at the price of 100% or sell when it drops 10% above the 100% whichever comes first.  
How do i set that up in bitstamp so it will execute automatically please?

  
Hypothetical example :

  
Initial investment : $1000   
Weights: 60% btc, 20% eth, 20% xrp  
Target sale: $2000 or when the price drops 10% above target using trailing stop

I’m in the process of helping a friend set up a Bitcoin wallet. Both of us are under 18, and my friend has parents who don’t approve of him signing up for really, well, anything. So, I thought the best way for my friend to store his Bitcoin would be in a brain wallet with a strong memorable passphrase, and his secret email that his parents don’t know about as a salt. WarpWallet or MemWallet seem like the best candidates. From here though, how can my friend see his balance online? Are there any online wallets that allow you to input your private key (similar to myetherwallet but for Bitcoin)?

Basically like a BitTorrent client. The miners make the file (the block that goes into the blockchain) and then the nodes download the ""torrent file"" and then seed it (spread it) to the rest of the network.

But I've been reading that nodes not only copy and spread the blockchain, they also ""validate"" transactions. Isn't that the job of a miner? What does it mean that a node validates a transaction?",1597391568,31,1

1) So I'm confused is Coinbase custodial or non-custodial?  I have the coinbase wallet and only received $400 or so to it so far, but when I created it I never enter any personal information, I literally just created it and have like a 12 word password thing....  
2) I'm confused what KYC is and all the fuss of articles I'm reading about it in regards to bitcoin and the IRS  
3) I understand if you have like a Coinbase an exchange where. you bought bitcoin and then sold it they would have your information of how much bitcoin you have.... but if you own just a wallet that was created without any personal information, how does IRS even know how much you have in your wallet...? aka does the IRS know or does coinbase report to the IRS what is in wallets or just exchanges... I'm confused where coinbase would send a 1099 form to in regards to a wallet if the wallet was created without personal information

if5y7p,MaleficentChoice3,BTC address so far beyond the wallet gap limit,"Every wallet scans a sequence of btc addresses in order to retrieve the total balance. For example, the default scan value in Electrum is 20, but this can be manually increased.

Now let's suppose we have a gap limit set only to **5**:  
3|0|0|2|0|0|0|0|0***|0|7***

What is the consequence of this?  
The addresses in bold are not counted if the gap limit is 5.  
Because the wallet only shows **5 (3+2)** instead of ***12(3+2+7)***. We can simply overcome this by manually increasing the gap limit, in this case 20 is enough.

Now, let us suppose we receive a payment to a btc address which is **very very far** from the latest one counted. Let's say for example someone sends to the 99999999-th indexed btc address (this is deterministically generated by the XPUB and it is correct) some coins.  
Honestly, I do not know the outcome of this, but in the best outcome we should wait a crazy amount of time to see the total balance, or the network may interpret this as a DDOS attack and we can be blocked.

Giving this situation, if I know the btc address am I able to spend those coins instead of scanning the entire sequence of addresses?",1598199427,7,1

1. It's a Ponzi scheme.

2. Tangibility argument - ""But I can't hold it in my hand. I can hold gold in my hand.""

3. Bitcoin could go to zero. 

4. Volatility scary.

5. I'm too lazy to read about Bitcoin. It's too complex. I'm not interested. 

Counterarguments:

1. Ponzi schemes have no underlying asset. Bitcoin's asset is the highest money security ever invented. If you can call Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme, you can call any market traded asset a Ponzi scheme. 

2. Tangibility - The money in every banking and brokerage account isn't tangible either. But it spends just fine. You can hold gold in your hand, but you need a $15,000 machine to know if it's real or not. Bitcoin requires as little as a smartphone, which 3.5 billion people own currently. 

3. Bitcoin to zero? Absurd. Bitcoin's upside potential is literally infinite against every fiat currency. Money printing always ensures Bitcoin's success. Stock to flow indicates that Bitcoin is more likely to go to infinity than to zero. 

4. Volatility is actually a plus with the right strategy. Buy the dips. DCA. Never sell. Short term volatility is acceptable when you plan on holding for years or generations. In 10 years, your kids won't care about a 50% dip that only lasted for 2 months.

igg1ca,admin_default,My experience in DeFi with Bitcoin,"Up until this summer, I could safely ignore DeFi as yet another fad by the perpetual crypto trend chasers. But then wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) became a collateral asset on Compound and Maker and tens of thousands of Bitcoin worth hundreds of millions flooded into the market. I wanted to know more so I dabbled in the Ethereum-base Compound platform using some of my Bitcoin.

You can think of wBTC like GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust), it's held by a trust called Bitgo, and it carries similar risks and advantages. Just as Grayscale enables Bitcoin to operate within traditional finance (traded on stock exchanges, held in 401k/IRA accounts), wBTC enables Bitcoin to operate in Ethereum-base DeFi applications. While holding Bitcoin in a centralized trust is not ideal, it is a short term solution to an immediate demand - just like GBTC. This is helping to boost demand for Bitcoin and that's good for all Bitcoiners, whether they like DeFi or not.

The tremendous advantage I found with DeFi is the easy and relatively safe access to leverage backed and settled in real Bitcoin. I used wBTC as collateral to borrow dollar-backed cryptos like USDC, Tether, or Dai. With the dollars I borrowed, I bought more Bitcoin. Since liquidation is a risk to over-leveraged users, I decided to play it safe- borrowing at rate of just 20% of my currently Bitcoin holdings. Compound and other DeFi apps reward you with their tokens for your participation in the network. You can then turn around and sell these tokens to buy more Bitcoin.

If you're like me, you're skeptical and you want to know if it's safe. The answer for me was that the benefits outweigh the risks. And even better, it's good for Bitcoin. Those Bitcoiners who participate in DeFi by buying more Bitcoin help redirect value from Ethereum back to Bitcoin, and the market is currently rewarding them handsomely for doing it.",1598374421,14,1

igc3yq,DesignerAccount,PSA: Possible deanonymization/dusting/coin corruption attack under way,"I've noticed some odd transactions recently with very large numbers of outputs each, i.e. more than 500. One recent example is [29b20f658b4aec5b330581505f51c2e37a675f2755748148e5f988f00391fecb](https://blockstream.info/tx/29b20f658b4aec5b330581505f51c2e37a675f2755748148e5f988f00391fecb), with 608 outputs. Another one is (0b9c2a3dbfb854faf2f659df958142e074597792de829321eb0cbe92ca048e02)[https://blockstream.info/tx/0b9c2a3dbfb854faf2f659df958142e074597792de829321eb0cbe92ca048e02], this one with 449 outputs. 

All the outputs, with the exception of the last one are for 547sats. This suggests dusting, but it's not enough. But there's more dodgy stuff. If you look at the first 7 outputs for the two txs above, they are:

| Address | Bitcoin amt | 
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 1Lets1xxxx1use1xxxxxxxxxxxy2EaMkJ | 0.00000547 |
| 1fuLL1xxxx1power1xxxxxxxxxxzatvCK  | 0.00000547 | 
| 1of1xxxxx1anonymity1xxxxxxxz9JzFN  | 0.00000547 |
| 1See1xxxx1memo1xxxxxxxxxxxxxBuhPF | 0.00000547 |
| 1dot1xxxxx1sv1xxxxxxxxxxxxxwYqEEt | 0.00000547 |
| 1topic1xxx1hmwyda1xxxxxxxxxvo8wMn | 0.00000547 |
| 1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxy1kmdGr | 0.00000547 |

These are clearly burn/unspendable addresses... and they contain a message:

```Lets use fuLL power of anonymity See memo dot sv topic hmwyda```: 

The attacker points us to memo dot sv - Which is eerily familiar. Memo dot cash is a bcash fanboy **CeNsOrShiP rEsIsTaNt BlOgGiNg PlAtFoRm - ThEyMoS aNd BaScO bAd!!!**, which suggests this may be the same kind of idiocy, just built on bcash's bastard and even more insignificant fork. (In case it's not clear, this is bcash shittoshi vision.)

If you go to the offending URL the suspicion is confirmed. Clicking on top bar for `Topics`, and then, whaddyaknow, you can indeed find the topic `hmwyda: how much would you donate anonymously`. 

The topic has 11 posts, some are in Russian, some appear to discuss the creation of burn addresses, but no other clue, at least not to me.

&amp;nbsp;

The above two transactions are not the only ones. If you take one of the addresses above and look at how many transaction they've been used in, it's 295 as of this writing, likely to increase:

One example: [1Lets1xxxx1use1xxxxxxxxxxxy2EaMkJ](https://blockstream.info/address/1Lets1xxxx1use1xxxxxxxxxxxy2EaMkJ), and the latest transaction has 3 confirmations. This means the attack is under way NOW.

&amp;nbsp;

--------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

### WHAT TO DO

You should check your wallet and see if there's an unexplained transaction for 547sats in your recent history, say up to two weeks. (The first post at the URL above is dated 10 days ago.) If you DO find it, **FREEZE THOSE COINS**. Not all wallets allow you to do that, so you may have to use something like Electrum that does.

Point is, **DO NOT SPEND THOSE COINS**. Make sure they do not get mixed in with some other coins, as you may end up with a bad experience and a frozen account.

&amp;nbsp;

-------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

**Would be great if others could chime in on this.**

Does anyone have chain analytics software available? Would be interesting to see if the dusting is linked to dark markets etc. This attack could be a way to cause chaos for people when they try to cash in on their coins, and hope that it becomes a widespread problem, with price collapse and so forth.",1598361826,30,1

igadr9,thedowcast,Major Cryptocurrency initiative," As of January 2020, Facebook Inc announced its cryptocurrency initiative called Libra, which would be a ""stablecoin"" backed by various legal tender currencies, which mitigates the wild price fluctuation that currently afflict regular bitcoin/cryptocurrency. This announcement garnered a great deal of opposition from the global financial community because it could undermine/disrupt the current global financial system. Many countries have openly stated that Libra would be outlawed from being used in their country. Other countries have proposed to directly fight the Libra by starting their own government backed stablecoin.  (Whats ironic is that Ares(Aries) is the polar opposite to Libra on the astrological wheel in position and definition.)    The Ares cryptocurrency would follow that old base model, which centered around the private community. An Ares Crypto Coin/Blockchain -- backed by a working model that supports the belief that the planets influence human nature -- could be used within communities of people who have the position of Mars in their birthchart outwardly indicated in some way.",1598355314,0,1

ig9p6o,Unhappy-Blacksmith-3,The Lightning Network will Fail,"There are two types of delusions propagated regarding bitcoin. The first one is the notion that bitcoin will fail because it can’t scale. Propagated by bitcoin bears who are usually shilling their bags of shitcoins.

The second delusion is pro btc peeps, even btc maxis is that bitcoin will somehow magically scale from second layer solutions.

BITCOIN IS DIGITAL GOLD. It will NEVER scale, it doesn’t need to. It can have high transaction fees, it has always had high fees relative to shitcoins and it keeps keeping on. I have ZERO intention of buying coffee or anything else with my bitcoin.

Gold has high fees to send and store, like really fucking high fees you need to put the dam thing on a plane and it still has a 10 trillion market cap and goes on a tear when yields start to go to dogshit city.

You think it takes a long time to send bitcoin? Guess what!? It will take 24-48 hours to send that bitcoin, and the price will continue to go up and up and up.

And when the transaction fee is $50 I will just keep the bitcoins on coinbase a little longer until I have accumulated enough before I transfer it to my hard wallet.

iiahbj,bm_bkly,A whole new kind of lightning &amp; fiat interface through debit cards? Announcing lastbit,"Soon after Satoshi made his big announcement more than a decade ago, a lot of concerns emerged pointing towards a crucial problem on his solution: scalability.  Particularly since Mt. Gox, a lot started to change for Bitcoin. Out in the open, a multitude of crypto exchanges started popping up making Bitcoin and other coins easily accessible to pretty much anyone. Nevertheless, the original concerns on Satoshi’s proposal remained. In parallel and away from the spotlight, a group of passionate developers started crafting the solution to Bitcoin’s scalability problem. Today the solution is here and it’s name is the Lightning Network.

Currently, users can access for free a wide range of Bitcoin Lightning wallets. Nevertheless, instant Bitcoin payments are still far from mainstream. Most of these wallets are extremely hard to use and as such are only catered to the most experienced of users. Despite that, the future of Lightning looks bright. As of today, there are over 11K Lightning nodes out there and this number is steadily growing. Lightning’s case of becoming the solution to Bitcoin’s woes looks strong.

Holding that as a North star, we started building a solution to combine hardware level security with Lightning to enable instant Bitcoin to fiat transactions on hardware at a POS through debit card emulation.This project was overly ambitious and we quickly realized not enough people cared enough about hardware level security for payments. But the ground we covered was not in vain. During the process of building our hardware solution and talking to our beta users we came across a powerful discovery: enabling small and instant Bitcoin payments with zero fees to mainstream users via Lightning could be the way to finally make Bitcoin a widely and globally used means of payment. 

During the last few years, we’ve seen titans, such as Coinbase and Binance, emerge. Undeniably, these projects have helped Bitcoin tremendously by raising awareness and making onboarding to the cryptocurrency easy and intuitive globally. Nevertheless, an equivalent figure to position Bitcoin as a globally usable currency via Lightning is yet to come.

With this in mind, we built an interoperable payments layer between Bitcoin (Lightning &amp; On-Chain) and Euros (to start with), using payment instruments familiar to mainstream consumers, namely IBAN’s and debit cards. This means, users can move between Bitcoin and Euros in either direction, with a single interface. 

This will allow users to:

\-(i) Send and receive Bitcoin payments both form and to Lightning wallets and Bitcoin on-chain wallets;

\-(ii) Send and receive Euro payments both from and to IBAN’s and debit cards;

\-(iii) Make Bitcoin payments, both Lightning and on-chain, directly from Euro denominated IBAN’s and/or a debit cards; and

\-(iv)Top-up Euro denominated debit cards directly with Bitcoin. 

All of this was carefully built in response to what we heard from the community and as we mention[ throughout our story](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/aeeipa/). We’ve dedicated the last few years of our lives and the foreseeable future to make this happen and we simply want to[ make it possible for more people to do things with Bitcoin.](https://lastbit.io/) 

**TLDR**:[ Lastbit](https://lastbit.io/) is putting out a beta application that contains a single interface to Bitcoin, Lightning, Euros and debit cards. This app will allow users to move between these payment instruments in any direction they like. Get paid in Euros from a Lightning invoice? Sure. Pay Euros to a Lightning invoice? Sure. Swipe a debit card and pay for your purchase with a Lightning invoice? Sure. And more.",1598632767,50,1

ihgbnt,gorroneeeb,The most profitable ASICs in 2020,"https://preview.redd.it/wate354jthj51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5884ffabf8b81042aa98a71cffcebaead9585f1

Considering the situation with halving, the choice of ASIC which will generate income stably and at the same time be easy to operate, is a pretty relevant task. This article contains the main points to pay attention to when choosing new devices, so that mining on them will be profitable today in 2020.

1. The efficiency of ASIC

The cost of energy and the hashrate that you can reach on a specific ASIC directly affect the profit and the speed of the payback of the device. Therefore, when choosing an ASIC, you should carefully go through the “combinations” of overclocking profiles and power consumption. It is recommended to choose the most profitable model in this regard.

Also, after buying a new ASIC, improve it with custom [firmware](https://hiveos.farm/asic/) (this is almost a mandatory step, because today it is very difficult to mine profitably without the firmware). Using it, you can achieve one of the following “scenarios”:

* Increasing the hashrate (while the power consumption remains at the current level)
* Maximum increase in hashrate (while energy consumption also increases)
* Reducing the current level of power consumption (while the hashrate does not change).

An example with Antminer T17 will explain the efficiency and profitability of the firmware more clearly. So, the stock firmware of this ASIC allows you to achieve a hashrate of 40 Th/s, while the device consumes 2200 W. With the Hiveon ASIC firmware, the Antminer T17 consumes 1816 W (at the same hashrate), and the maximum possible hashrate is 56 Th/s (with a standard power supply unit). Moreover, the firmware allows you to extend the service life of the ASIC.

1. Ease of operation

The easier it is for you to manage an ASIC, the more attention you can pay to the mining process. The [Hive OS](https://hiveos.farm/) monitoring and management system can greatly simplify this task — with its help, you can control ASICs remotely, monitor their performance, and so on. Therefore, when choosing a new device, pay attention to those ASIC models that are compatible with it. A complete list of supported models can be found [here](https://github.com/minershive/hiveos-asic/blob/master/README.md).

1. Availability of spare parts

When choosing an ASIC, find out if you can buy spare parts in your city or country. And if yes, what is their cost? Choose those ASICs for which you can get spare parts as soon as possible. In this way you will avoid serious pauses in the mining process and loss of income.

In addition, the following two factors should be considered:

* ASICs have practically no interchangeable parts. However, fans are an exception, but it all depends on their size. For example, Bitmain's ASICs have fans of the same size, while the Innosilicon's fans are larger. The control boards of Bitmain ASICs of the 17 series are also interchangeable.
* The most popular manufacturer is Bitmain.

1. The cost of ASIC

If you are going to purchase a large number of devices, their price may be the most influential factor.

Be sure to compare prices of different suppliers. Some of them may increase price on purpose, so that you may overpay. But by checking the offers of other suppliers, you will avoid this situation.

Also, do not purchase new ASICs immediately after their release. Wait a little — over time, their price will drop slightly, and you will also have the opportunity to read reviews and decide if these devices are worth your investment.

It is also worth finding out how much electricity ASIC consumes per terahash. For example, some devices require 1.6 kW of power, while others consume 6 kW. In the end, an ASIC which consumes 6 kW of energy will cost much more, because you will spend a substantial part of your profit on paying electricity bills.

1. The device’s warranty

Warranty terms are another factor worth paying attention to:

* What is the warranty period of your potential ASIC? Obviously, the longer the warranty is valid, the better and easier it is for you.
* Is there a warranty service center nearby (in your city or at least country)? If it is missing, look for a post-warranty center — sometimes it's easier to choose this one, even if the device is still under warranty. Why? The fact is that sometimes warranty repairs can take a very long time, which means loss of profit for you.
* What specific cases does the warranty NOT cover?

ihg1za,bitcoingolem,We should join political parties and influence from inside,"If we're about to see another hype cycle, Bitcoin will start having macro-economic effects. Other economic sectors will be hurt (as if COVID19 wasn't enough), and they might send their lobbyists to influence politicians and start a smear campaign against the Bitcoin community.

If you live in a democratic country, the best way to tackle this is to join one of the big established political parties. The politicians must know that if they yield to the anti-Bitcoin lobbyists, they will lose votes both in the general elections AND in internal votings inside the party.

I know you may feel disgusted to join a political party that you disagree with so many of its actions, but you don't even have to vote for it in the general elections. Just have your voice inside. Creating new political parties is mostly pointless - nobody will vote for a Bitcoin party any time soon...

Most people here probably lean towards right wing parties, but I can see why some people will want to join left parties for other reasons (what's the point of a setting a minimum wage if the money itself is being debased? Also, the Cantillon Effect and inflation are the least progressive taxes).

When some politicians will start to go after Bitcoin, sitting at home and writing angry reddit posts won't be enough. If Bitcoin grows, it will become a political issue, and we have to be ready.",1598509991,4,1

These were three transactions that were each worth at least $50 or $100 each, so I really couldn’t see why they had to be more than about a couple of hours at most for each transaction.

Today I’m having the same problem trying to withdraw my bitcoin. It’s still saying the transaction’s in the mempool queue, however for more than three hours there isn’t a single confirmation.

Tried ViaBTC but my transaction doesn’t meet the “0.0001 BTC/KB” requirement :( .

I also tried BitAccelerate via https://bitaccelerate.com . (Did I just shoot myself in the foot and compromise my security? They didn’t ask for any information or anything.) That did... a whole lot of nothing. Sure my tx is way higher in the mempool queue now but it’s taking a loooonnngg time still.

Is it just a really bad time for the network and we can expect it to get really constipated this time of year?

Idk if the banks permissioning to store it statement holds any truth, but if it's true, then the government must assume btc is somewhat safe to have, own(?) by citizens &amp; therefore it must/is actually not pumped by Tether?

I run a store online that accepts Bitcoin. My provider requires a BIP44 compliant wallet to generate new addresses for each order. My problem is I receive so many inputs from orders that my sending fees when liquidating bitcoin are so high that I'm forced to send with very low fees, 1-10sat/byte. This results in taking up to 5 days usually to receive and I end up floating way more bitcoin than I'm comfortable with. I know that Electrum has a feature where you can send from an individual input, which would allow me to send my larger amounts with normal fees and then send all my smaller orders together at low fees. This would drastically cut down on how much I'm floating at a time, but I know that Electrum is not BIP44 supported. I've looked around a ton online and haven't found anything with both these features.

Soon they will start some kind of usd or euro coin and people will buy it because they need to pay taxes or bills or get salary. The government will never let us do this with bitcoin. They will get full control about everything we buy or earn and people are happy with it.

Specifically, the fact that seemingly useless coins have what seems to me an unreasonable market cap that I can't explain. I doubt that it's because of utility - who uses HuobiToken (randomly chosen, sorry if it's actually useful), is this real demand from real users?

The fact that all these, at least to my mind, not so useful coins has so much market cap (millions or even billions!), makes me doubt: does Bitcoin's market cap reflects real utility? Is it even a useful metric or I'm giving it more attention than I should? Or perhaps these altcoins are in fact more useful than I think?

In other words, my gut feeling tells me that altcoins' market caps are somehow inflated. Assuming this is true (it may very well be not, let me know), what tells me that Bitcoin's market cap also isn't?

They do this because they trade in tax-differed retirement accounts, using the symbol GBTC, at roughly a 1 to 1,000 value ($10,000 BTC = $10 GBTC, of Bitcoin value - note: the actual math is like $10,000 BTC = $9.5 GBTC of value).

But typically GBTC trades well above this rate, around 30%. Today it's at about 20%, and a few months ago it was at 7%. This is easy for anyone to track.

For GBTC 'investors' they buy Bitcoin at a price, say $10,000, and then sell it as GBTC for $13,000 (30% premium), after holding 1 year. This makes it a relatively low-risk arbitrage, unless the premium goes away and BTC price plummets.

Once this Bitcoin is purchased and added to GBTC, it basically stays there forever, probably for the next 20 years. Their current Bitcoin asset valuation is about $4 Bil, and they are expected to add $4 Bil more this coming year, if investors keep pouring in.

The best indicator of this is the premium. As the premium grows, the risk to new investors decreases, and currently it trades at $13.2 vs asset value of $11 = 20% premium.

So it's something I watch for, and I suspect GBTC will buy $4 Bil of Bitcoin this year, alone with lots and lots of other crypto assets - which is about the entirety of this year's mining rewards (if the price stays near $10,000).",1596476660,29,1

Hoping to pose a question to the community. Full disclosure, I do not currently own any bitcoin but have become increasingly interested in the tech and currency. 

My question is, what do you think the long term usage of bitcoin will be? Will it be used as a store of value always measured against fiat, and held as an appreciative asset? Or will it become a universally accepted currency?

Obviously the answers are largely opinions at this point as no one really knows. But I’m trying to get a sense of how this community sees the asset. For all of you currently holding, what is your planned endgame?  Are you holding for a price point to “cash out” or are you holding for the point in the future where you can use it for daily spend as a primary currency? Or some combination of the two?",1596337545,8,1

ibf32o,lukypunchy,Observations &amp; Realizations of a Crypto newbie:,"Just started wading into the crypto market this past March and have learned a couple of things, mostly from reading this reddit:

Never share your recovery key words with anyone, EVER. It doesn’t matter how legit they appear to be, if they are asking for your 26 words, they are going to empty your wallet. Giving your words are worse than giving a mustache twirling stranger your debit card and bank pin. If you get your checking account emptied, you can call the police to report the theft and plead with the bank to get your funds returned. That is not really an option with crypto, you are just shit out of luck.

Keep your key list someplace safe. Do not rely on anything on-line or on your computer. Your keys need to be written on paper, carved in stone or stamped on steel - don’t care which so long as it is physical not digital. Once you have your hard copy you need to double check, then triple check, the words themselves and the order of. You have your keys? Now put them in some place secure like your fire resistant file box, parents lock box or someplace that is understood to be depositor of things you really don’t want to lose. For fucks sake don’t use a screen capture you saved to Google Photo as your backup.

All the Youtube videos, Coinwhatever articles and Crypto forecasts are all pretty much useless. The worst of them are trying influence the market with hype for their own gains or exist to collect the revenue for media content. Some of these may be legitimate but are only useful for people with wallets big enough that a 5% wobble in price and some good timing would outpace the fees for a profit that’s worth the effort. But those people already know what they are doing and don’t need a parrot to confirm. The Crypto environment is jam packed with hypers, and dreamers. Disregard half of everything you hear, see or read about Crypto and be very suspicious of the rest.

Chances are that the browser plug-in or application you are using is, or will be, compromised.

If you are using your phone for retail purchases or trading, only have enough funds to do what you need accessible from that device. At some point that phone is going to either die or get stollen. It’s a lot easier getting over $20 than $20k.

The mechanics joke about “Good, Fast or Cheap - pick 2” holds true for the Crypto Trading platforms.

Never leave coins that you are not currently trading with in a wallet supplied by what ever market you are using. Move anything you plan on holding to a wallet that you have the keys to.

Don’t sit and watch the market do its thing, especially if you are holding. Ignore the market until you have a few dollars to put in, wait for a dip that strikes your fancy and buy, then go back to ignoring it. If you sit and stare, you start getting ideas &amp; those usually don’t work out as planned for most of us.

ibcnsv,almkglor,"Taproot, CoinJoins, and Cross-Input Signature Aggregation","It is a very common misconception that the upcoming Taproot upgrade helps CoinJoin.

TLDR: ***The upcoming Taproot upgrade does not help equal-valued CoinJoin at all***, though it potentially increases the privacy of other protocols, such as the Lightning Network, and escrow contract schemes.

If you want to learn more, read on!

## Equal-valued CoinJoins

Let's start with equal-valued CoinJoins, the type JoinMarket and Wasabi use.  What happens is that some number of participants agree on some common value all of them use.  With JoinMarket the taker defines this value and pays the makers to agree to it, with Wasabi the server defines a value approximately 0.1 BTC.

Then, each participant provides inputs that they unilaterally control, totaling equal or greater than the common value.  Typically since each input is unilaterally controlled, each input just requires a singlesig.  Each participant also provides up to two addresses they control: one of these will be paid with the common value, while the other will be used for any extra value in the inputs they provided (i.e. the change output).

The participants then make a single transaction that spends all the provided inputs and pays out to the appropriate outputs.  The inputs and outputs are shuffled in some secure manner.  Then the unsigned transaction is distributed back to all participants.

Finally, each participant checks that the transaction spends the inputs it provided (and more importantly does *not* spend any other coins it might own that it did *not* provide for this CoinJoin!) and that the transaction pays out to the appropriate address(es) it controls.  Once they have validated the transaction, they ratify it by signing for each of the inputs it provided.

Once every participant has provided signatures for all inputs it registered, the transaction is now completely signed and the CoinJoin transaction is now validly confirmable.

CoinJoin is a very simple and direct privacy boost, it requires no SCRIPTs, needs only singlesig, etc.

### Privacy

Let's say we have two participants who have agreed on a common amount of 0.1 BTC.  One provides a 0.105 coin as input, the other provides a 0.114 coin as input.  This results in a CoinJoin with a 0.105 coin and a 0.114 coin as input, and outputs with 0.1, 0.005, 0.014, and 0.1 BTC.

Now obviously the 0.005 output came from the 0.105 input, and the 0.014 output came from the 0.114 input.

But the two 0.1 BTC outputs cannot be correlated with either input!  There is no correlating information, since either output could have come from either input.  That is how common CoinJoin implementations like Wasabi and JoinMarket gain privacy.

### Banning CoinJoins

Unfortunately, large-scale CoinJoins like that made by Wasabi and JoinMarket are very obvious.

All you have to do is look for a transactions where, say, more than 3 outputs are the same equal value, and the number of inputs is equal or larger than the number of equal-valued outputs.  Thus, it is trivial to identify equal-valued CoinJoins made by Wasabi and JoinMarket. You can even trivially differentiate them: Wasabi equal-valued CoinJoins are going to have a hundred or more inputs, with outputs that are in units of approximately 0.1 BTC, while JoinMarket CoinJoins have equal-valued outputs of less than a dozen (between 4 to 6 usually) and with the common value varying wildly from as low as 0.001 BTC to as high as a dozen BTC or more.

This has led to a number of anti-privacy exchanges to refuse to credit custodially-held accounts if the incoming deposit is within a few hops of an equal-valued CoinJoin, usually citing concerns about regulations.  Crucially, the exchange continues to hold private keys for those ""banned"" deposits, and can still spend them, thus this is effectively a theft.  If your exchange does this to you, you **should** report that exchange as stealing money from its customers.  Not your keys not your coins.

Thus, CoinJoins represent a privacy tradeoff:

* It's very hard for everyone else to determine which output belongs to which input.
* It's obvious to everyone else that the output was involved in a mixing operation.

## Taproot

Let's now briefly discuss that nice new shiny thing called Taproot.

Taproot includes two components:

* The use of Schnorr-based signature scheme, with multisignature support.  Spending from a Schnorr pubkey is called a ""keypath spend"".
* The ability to secretly commit to a set of scripts, one of which can be revealed later and its inputs provided correctly in order to spend the coin.  Spending via a hidden script is called a ""scriptpath spend"".

This has some nice properties:

* Direct multisignature support means all multisignature uses look the same. In current Bitcoin, a 2-of-2 ""multisignature"" is really a script which demands that two signatures be provided, from 2 different pre-specified public keys.  To a cryptographer, the strict definition of multisignature is that this is a ***single*** signature that is cooperatively created by multiple parties.
  * A typical minimal ""multisig"" setup would be a 2-of-3, because that lets you lose one signing device while still being able to keep access to your money, and still providing an increase in security relative to a singlesig, since a 2-of-3 requires that potential thieves abscond with at least two signing devices.  In current Bitcoin, a 2-of-3 is a SCRIPT containing 3 public keys, requiring that two signatures from those three public keys be provided.
  * But a Lightning Network channel has exactly two participants.  Thus, it uses a 2-of-2, and is a SCRIPT containing 2 public keys, requiring that two signatures from those public keys be provided.  If you look for 2-of-2 spends on the blockchain after Lightning became cool, the chances are very good that a random 2-of-2 spend is a Lightning Network channel being closed, because there are hardly ever any other uses of 2-of-2.
  * Just from there, you can easily differentiate the most common HODLer multisig of 2-of-3 (SCRIPT contains 3 pubkeys) from the Lightning channel 2-of-2 (SCRIPT contains 2 pubkeys).
  * Fortunately, with Taproot, 2-of-3 and 2-of-2 (and any arbitrary k-of-n) can look exactly the same, because Schnorr allows for the cryptographer's strict definition of ""multisignature"": a ***single*** signature cooperatively created by multiple parties.
* Complex SCRIPTs, like HTLCs, can be hidden in a Taproot output.
  * For example, the output can have a keyspend branch that is a n-of-n of all participants, with hidden SCRIPTs that encode the conditions under which the output can be spent
  * The hidden SCRIPTs ensure that the protocol is followed.  If one of the participants drops from the protocol, the rest can reveal the hidden SCRIPTs and follow their conditions.
  * If everyone follows the protocol correctly, and agrees to the result, they can all cooperatively sign with the keyspend n-of-n.  They can just all agree on what the result of the SCRIPTs would be, and sign a transaction that performs that, without revealing any SCRIPTs.  Since all of them agreed on the result, nobody should complain (if one of them believes the result is not correct, they can just refuse to sign and force everyone else to publish the SCRIPTs onchain).
  * If everyone agrees, they get privacy: none of the SCRIPTs they were following ever get published onchain, and it looks like every other multisignature spend.

## Taproot DOES NOT HELP CoinJoin

So let's review!

CoinJoin:

* CoinJoin inputs are singlesig
* There are no SCRIPTs involved in CoinJoin.

Taproot:

* Improves multisig privacy.
* Improves SCRIPT privacy.

There is absolutely no overlap.  Taproot helps things that CoinJoin ***does not use***.  CoinJoin uses things that Taproot ***does not improve***.

## B-but They Said!!

A lot of early reporting on Taproot claimed that Taproot benefits  CoinJoin.

What they are confusing is that earlier drafts of Taproot included a feature called ***cross-input signature aggregation***.

In current Bitcoin, every input, to be spent, has to be signed individually.   With cross-input signature aggregation, all inputs that support this feature are signed with a single signature that covers all those inputs.  So for example if you would spend two inputs, current Bitcoin requires a signature for each input, but with cross-input signature aggregation you can sign both of them with a single signature.  This works even if the inputs have different public keys: two inputs with cross-input signature aggregation effectively define a 2-of-2 public key, and you can only sign for that input if you know the private keys for both inputs, or if you are cooperatively signing with somebody who knows the private key of the other input.

This helps CoinJoin costs.  Since CoinJoins will have lots of inputs (each participant will provide at least one, and probably will provide more, and larger participant sets are better for more privacy in CoinJoin), if all of them enabled cross-input signature aggregation, such large CoinJoins can have only a single signature.

This complicates the signing process for CoinJoins (the signers now have to sign cooperatively) but it can be well worth it for the reduced signature size and onchain cost.

But note that the while cross-input signature aggregation improves the **cost** of CoinJoins, it does not improve the privacy!  Equal-valued CoinJoins are still obvious and still readily bannable by privacy-hating exchanges.  It does not improve the privacy of CoinJoin.  Instead, see https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/gqb3ur/design_for_a_coinswap_implementation_for/

### Why isn't cross-input signature aggregation in?

There's some fairly complex technical reasons why cross-input signature aggregation isn't in right now in the current Taproot proposal.

The primary reason was to reduce the technical complexity of Taproot, in the hope that it would be easier to convince users to activate (while support for Taproot is quite high, developers have become wary of being hopeful that new proposals will ever activate, given the previous difficulties with SegWit).

The main technical complexity here is that it interacts with future ways to extend Bitcoin.

The rest of this writeup assumes you already know about how Bitcoin SCRIPT works.  If you don't understand how Bitcoin SCRIPT works at the low-level, then the TLDR is that cross-input signature aggregation complicates how to extend Bitcoin in the future, so it was deferred to let the develoeprs think more about it.

(this is how I understand it; perhaps /u/pwuille or /u/ajtowns can give a better summary.)

In detail, Taproot also introduces `OP_SUCCESS` opcodes.  If you know about the `OP_NOP` opcodes already defined in current Bitcoin, well, `OP_SUCCESS` is basically ""`OP_NOP` done right"".

Now, `OP_NOP` is a do-nothing operation.  It can be replaced in future versions of Bitcoin by having that operation check some condition, and then fail if the condition is not satisfied.  For example, both `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` and `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` were previously `OP_NOP` opcodes.  Older nodes will see an `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` and think it does nothing, but newer nodes will check if the `nLockTime` field has a correct specified value, and fail if the condition is not satisfied.  Since most of the nodes on the network are using much newer versions of the node software, older nodes are protected from miners who try to misspend any `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`/`OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`, and those older nodes will still remain capable of synching with the rest of the network: a dedication to strict backward-compatibility necessary for a consensus system.

Softforks basically mean that a script that passes in the latest version must also be passing in all older versions.  A script cannot be passing in newer versions but failing in older versions, because that would kick older nodes off the network (i.e. it would be a hardfork).

But `OP_NOP` is a very restricted way of adding opcodes.  Opcodes that replace `OP_NOP` can only do one thing: check if some condition is true.  They can't push new data on the stack, they can't pop items off the stack.  For example, suppose instead of `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`, we had added a `OP_GETBLOCKHEIGHT` opcode.  This opcode would push the height of the blockchain on the stack.  If this command replaced an older `OP_NOP` opcode, then a script like `OP_GETBLOCKHEIGHT 650000 OP_EQUAL` might pass in some future Bitcoin version, but older versions would see `OP_NOP 650000 OP_EQUAL`, which would fail because `OP_EQUAL` expects two items on the stack.  So older versions will fail a SCRIPT that newer versions will pass, which is a hardfork and thus a backwards incompatibility.

`OP_SUCCESS` is different.  Instead, old nodes, when *parsing* the SCRIPT, will see `OP_SUCCESS`, and, *without executing* the body, will consider the SCRIPT as passing.  So, the `OP_GETBLOCKHEIGHT 650000 OP_EQUAL` example will now work: a future version of Bitcoin might pass it, and existing nodes that don't understand `OP_GETBLOCKHEIGHT` will se `OP_SUCCESS 650000 OP_EQUAL`, and will not execute the SCRIPT at all, instead passing it immediately.  So a SCRIPT that might pass in newer versions will pass for older versions, which keeps the back-compatibility consensus that a softfork needs.

So how does `OP_SUCCESS` make things difficult for cross-input signatur aggregation?  Well, one of the ways to ask for a signature to be verified is via the opcodes `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY`.  With cross-input signature aggregation, if a public key indicates it can be used for cross-input signature aggregation, instead of `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY` actually requiring the signature on the stack, the stack will contain a dummy `0` value for the signature, and the public key is instead added to a ""sum"" public key (i.e. an n-of-n that is dynamically extended by one more pubkey for each `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY` operation that executes) for the single signature that is verified later by the cross-input signature aggregation validation algorithm00.

The important part here is that the `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY` **has to** execute, in order to add its public key to the set of public keys to be checked in the single signature.

But remember that an `OP_SUCCESS` prevents execution!  As soon as the SCRIPT is parsed, if any opcode is `OP_SUCCESS`, that is considered as passing, without actually executing the SCRIPT, because the `OP_SUCCESS` could mean something completely different in newer versions and current versions should assume nothing about what it means.  If the SCRIPT contains some `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY` command *in addition to* an `OP_SUCCESS`, that command is **not** executed by current versions, and thus they cannot add any public keys given by `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY`.  Future versions also have to accept that: if they parsed an `OP_SUCCESS` command that has a new meaning in the future, and then execute an `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY` in that SCRIPT, they cannot add the public key into the same ""sum"" public key that older nodes use, because older nodes cannot see them.  This means that you might need more than one signature in the future, in the presence of an opcode that replaces some `OP_SUCCESS`.

Thus, because of the complexity of making cross-input signature aggregation work compatibly with future extensions to the protocol, cross-input signature aggregation was deferred.",1597665072,29,1
