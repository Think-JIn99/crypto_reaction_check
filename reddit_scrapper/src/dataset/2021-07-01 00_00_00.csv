After setting up the device I realized very quickly that it wasn’t going to work for my half a dozen or so cryptos because of the app limitations, three apps, and 100’s of coins supported, I thought “should work, I don’t really need any apps anyway, I only want to store my coin$!” Yeah, no. Lol anyway the ledger nano s is also not compatible with iOS, so I had to do everything with my MacBook which is fine, whatever.

It is measured on a few facts:

U.S. has 17,436 crypto ATMs – nearly 16,000 more than the second-ranked country in the category, Canada.

The amount of ATMs for the whole population works out to be a crypto ATM for every 19,023 people. Even though the amount of crypto ATMs sounds like a lot, there's 470,000 regular ATMs in the USA, so you can imagine how long is left to go. 


By all these facts, the United States ranked first, with a crypto-ready score of 7.13 out of 10.

Q1: All I know is that bitcoin system asks miners to find sha256 hashes that begin with some specific number of zero bits. And whoever succeed, get paid some amount of bitcoin. Why ? What does the bitcoin system/owner get from getting such an info ? Is it to crack the sha256 algorithm ? And why ? To hack other systems ?

Q2: does everyone (miner) get the dame question ? And how do they know if someone already figured the solution to the question they are working on so they move on to a new question ?

Hey guys, in addition to the stock2flow (s2f) and hash2reward (h2r) model, I played around with a very simple exponential model ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x09sZg9wVo)): BTC ≈ exp(0.1 \* days \^ 0.6 - 2.92)

Of course, such a simplified model does not achieve the prediction metrics like the hash2reward model, which is a bit better than the stock to flow ([h2r vs. s2f](https://youtu.be/5TLDWxft5G0)), but I find this kind of helpful to capture the big picture.

An important reason for Bitcoin's popularity is that it has withstood the test of time. No digital currency has experienced so many ups and downs like it. It has been discussed many times around the world, and  tenacity of its vitality also proves its value from the side.
Moreover, Bitcoin is the most widely-consensus digital cryptocurrency, and it has a strong international circulation. The total amount of Bitcoin is constant at 21 million, and it is halved about every four years. It is scarce. In addition, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer transaction transmission, free from the intervention of various institutions, and can circulate around the world. You can send your Bitcoin to any corner of the world. Coupled with the fact that Bitcoin has higher returns than gold. Digital currency or encrypted assets represented by Bitcoin is the general direction of the development of the entire financial industry.
The great investor's enthusiasm over Bitcoin is based on its overall progress during last decade, it is proven only crypto asset that surpasses the expectation of investors and breaks the previous record highs.

ocyl7v,gomboloid,Idea: Egress Bandwidth Marketplace Built on Lightning Network,"Hi Everyone,
 Here's an idea that i don't have time to build (young kids, aging parents, full time job) but i would if i could:

A bandwidth marketplace on top of lightning network. Anyone can offer up their own bandwidth for sale via something running on their lightning node. People would quote their location and the amount of bandwidth they are willing to sell, maybe in 30 minute chunks.  

When someone decides to purchase this bandwidth, both parties make a note that the transaction is about to start, maybe via some small transaction via lightning. At the end of the transaction, each party could rate the other in the transaction.

This simple market place could then lead to a record of 'reputable node operators' as well: anyone could look at a record of previous successful transactions like this, when deciding whether to engage in future transactions.

One obvious use case here could be like a cheap, wildly distributed VPN that's almost impossible to distinguish from a commercial VPN. 

It's not too hard to imagine an ecosystem of little services like this, powered by reputation.  Bandwidth seems like a simple, obvious first step: then, compute and (possibly last, once people had really long-lasting reputations), storage.",1625320799,1,1
ocyk4s,Brunnervac,The easiest and cheapest way how to handle multiple transactions - send to many (batch payments),"I am looking for some common sense and simple advice how to send multiple payments from BTC wallet to many people (for example 20 people with 20 different amounts). The goal is to have a low transaction fee. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some wallets support send to many:   
\- BlueWallet (seems easy enough and I tried it)  
\- Bitcon Core wallet - didn't try it, but I have node running (not sure if there is any advantage)  


Another thing what seems important is the number of incoming transactions into the wallet. I have many small amounts coming from different pools (mining proceeds). Now I am thinking to change payouts to higher amount so the payouts do not come every day, but for example once a week. The assumption is that I get 1 input instead of 7 inputs. 

Would the above make the biggest impact ? 

&amp;#x200B;

For sending I plan to use BlueWallet.. send to multiple. Multiple receivers/transactions in one.. and then just one transaction fee. 

&amp;#x200B;

How much should I worry about change output i.e. spending the whole amount in the wallet including the transaction fee.  I read somewhere that the change output is 32 vbytes. So it doesn't seem like a huge amount. 

Can someone confirm if there are any holes in this? Or if it makes sense?",1625320692,0,1

ocwn51,dopey_certification,"Things of investing (again, I'm an idiot)...","So, I guess I have a longer story than some with bitcoin, even though I've only lost money from it (yeah, stupidly.)  


So I think it was 2013 (possibly 2014), I didn't know much about wallets or how it works but I thought 'you know, this could be something and maybe I could find a painless way to get in on the game' so what I landed on was downloading an app and investing just $5 a week into Bitcoin. I did this for a while, and that $5 added up - I didn't really look at the rates (but they were obviously WAY lower than they are now) and I ended up eventually losing interest and actually losing access what I'd brought figuring 'Eh, probably wrong...money doesn't happen that easily.'   


Fast forward to 2017 when the surge happened, and clearly I was kicking myself. I was never in it to be rich, I'm still not. Just to play around and whatever happens happens - but I could have made some money at least...But, i figured 2017 was my shot and I'd let it slip and lost interest again - life remained the same, and I was pretty okay with that.  


Then we had another surge, more recently and I definitely listened. And now I've looked up some stuff and seen people speculating about more massive surges over the next few years.  


Again, I want to do this in a pretty painless way if I do do it, so I'll probably do $5 a week from my pay again - MAYBE $10 since I earn more these days.  


So I guess some questions I have are:  
1. Am I being stupid, did I miss my chance? Like is it probably too late?  
2. From speculation I've read I've formulated the plan to keep buying so long as it's below a certain threshold (which may change, but let's say $150,000) and sell no questions asked if and when Bitcoin reaches my threshold?  
3. Any recommendations for a wallet that trades in Australia? I mean, maybe I'd be smarter if I did something using my email as a log in this time. :/",1625313244,3,1

Try to only Make 2% of your money every day only. You might think that this is a very slow growth. Well, if you do the math, it really isn't! Lets take an example of a 200$ investment. 2% of 200$ today is 204$, 2% of 204$ tomorrow is 208.08$.

If the FATF guidelines become adopted across the world, and the Bitcoin universe becomes split into compliant VASPs and non-compliant entities, and VASPs are expected to manage “risk” of the Bitcoin they handle, won’t that create an incentive for some chain analysis company to give risk scores to every UTXO based on its transaction history, which can be combined to give an overall risk score to the holder of the coins, or a particular Lightning Node?

Doesn’t this seem inevitable? Could it even already be happening to some degree? Does Lightning Network hamper these efforts at all? Could that be a big reason for the lack of adoption (to-date) of LN by exchanges and institutions (i.e. the KYC risks)?",1625590755,1,1

oexhb5,SlothsForLife,Is my girlfriend a Bitcoin millionaire or a compulsive liar?,"Tldr: How can I verify my girlfriend's claim of owning at least one-million dollars of bitcoin without seeming too nosey about her finances? 

I’ve been with my girlfriend from Spain for almost two months now and we had a conversation about finances last night. Despite working and living like a broke graduate student, she claimed that she has a lot of money in Spain. I asked if it was inherited money but I told her she didn’t have to answer if she didn’t feel comfortable saying. She then responded by saying it was money she had saved up while working for a large company based in Barcelona and subsequently the bar she and her mother owned and operated. 

I then asked if she was investing with her money and then she told me she had been investing in Bitcoin since she was 15 years old (so circa 2010) and that she started to seriously invest about 5 years ago. This was when my mind went wild since a few invested dollars could be worth thousands, maybe even millions. I asked her how much she had initially invested and if she had sold anything. She then said that she hadn’t sold anything and her portfolio would be worth more than enough to buy the house my grandparents had just bought (worth $1.4 million). 

Our conversation ended at that point but this naturally left me with lots of questions and doubts. 

What surprises me is that she claims to be living off of the money she is currently making by working, hasn’t spent any of her bitcoin, and is living well below her financial means. I first met her and her mother in Spain back in 2017, which would be before Bitcoin completely went to the moon, and they lived in a rather humble apartment in an average neighborhood. My girlfriend lived with her mom there until she came to the States in 2020. Her entire story seems plausible and I want to trust her, but I feel like I need to verify if it’s true.

oex8bq,DashingSir,Attacking large block shitcoin ?¿?¿?,"I have heard many times that larger blocks --&gt; centralization --&gt; compromised blockchain.

But I don't quite understand how that works! Help me figure it out.

1. Don't SPV wallets allow users to perform Merkle proofs on their transactions, checking that the transaction was included in a block and how many confirmations have occured since? What does a full node add to that security model?

2. No matter how many malicious spammy nodes signal the wrong information, wallet clients (both SPV and full nodes) still follow the longest chain rule, so as long as the right info reaches your client once, you are golden, no? Is this the objective of running a full node, making the right info reach everyone at least once, even in a sea of DoS?

3. So in conclusion, what is the attack vector that becomes possible in a blockchain with fewer full nodes, but isn't possible in a blockchain with more full nodes, all else being equal? What is your educated guess about the minimum/ideal number of nodes and why?

oh5eji,eneskaraboga,How to Detect BTC Top and Why Everybody Should be Aware of the Data,"Hey guys,  


I had another thread for TA and Wyckoff and there were many people who think TA or any kind of analysis is BS because crypto market acts different. I strongly disagree. If people are involved, it will act like any market and fluctuate between fear and greed cycles. While professionals take advantage of data and make good decisions, most people will act buy high, sell low because of emotions.   


The more you are in the market and study hard, you start to get an edge over people who buy/sell randomly. 

Let's see how it translate to data.   


[In a previous Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/o5onmt/a_wyckoff_accumulation_here_is_a_little_hopium/), I talked about accumulation structure and called $29k a spring, and so far it seems I was right (no one is right all the time and anything can happen of course). I explained why I think it was accumulation. 

In this post, I'll show how we could detect the top. You can't of course know the exact time to enter or exit, but you can increase your chances even if you are DCAing or buying as you have money. No matter what, you can get cheaper coins with a little research.   


Here it goes  


https://preview.redd.it/jdsk8bsa89a71.png?width=1860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8a4965b5d0812c4f6914950bb4773a70ec886d6

Okay, it may seem complex at first, but it is quite easy. Charts from top to the bottom  


1) BTC Price

2) BTC addresses having 0.1 BTC or more (around $6,000+ at the top)

3) BTC addresses having 1 BTC or more (around $60,000+ at the top)

4) BTC addresses having 10 BTC or more (around $600,000+ at the top)

5) BTC addresses having 100 BTC or more (around $6,000,000+ at the top)

6) BTC addresses having 1,000 BTC or more (around $60,000,000+ at the top)  


\--

Let's see how they react. Number of addresses over 0.1 BTC kept buying while price was going sideways (look at the red boxes). That means retail kept buying. In the meantime, Number of addresses having 1-1,000 BTC, was selling aggressively.   


Look at how addresses over 1,000 BTC increased until very top and how sharply they declined. This started ""BEFORE"" China FUD. So, those whales probably knew what was gonna happen and distributed their coins before the crash while retail kept buying until very end.  


Then look into purple box. Where I think is accumulation. Look how retail dumped in the middle of accumulation (most people considering we'll see $20k (maybe we will, but unlikely)). In the meantime, bigger accounts stopped selling. The biggest BTC addresses started to increase again (it is not very visible in the image as it is streched.)  


Here is a bigger image of balances with over 10 BTC (mid-tier, traders probably). Look how they are accumulating. 

https://preview.redd.it/gmzdd3gy99a71.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e14491a18b49f783095334c984ddfd76577b2be

So, at the top, while price was going sideways, price action was showing a possibility of 2 things: Accumulation or Distribution. It was luck to decide which one was that. However, if you couple it with on-chain analysis, it showed it was more likely that it was distribution because of the buyer's or seller's profile.   


\--

I really love on-chain data with Bitcoin. Think about it, you can literally see where money is flowing. Which address is doing what, how many BTC is moving. It is impossible with the stock market. Banks, institutions, hedge funds move their money without any one of us noticing. They can just dump anytime they feel like and we can't know. However, when money moves in the blockchain, anybody with a $39 Glassnode account (or using free public information with a little creativity) can detect it and take positions.

So, long story short,  


While price was moving sideways at the top: Big addresses sold, small ones bought. That was an indication of a distribution schematic. Now big ones seem to be going sideways/a little up, suggesting an accumulation structure. 

Any structure can be broken and price can go anywhere. But hey, you can use this data to time your buying even if you are a lifetime sat accumulator!

How will transaction fees not cost as much as a car if worldwide adoption?","With the bandwidth only able to guarantee 1 or less transactions on chain per person born, it means the average human can only afford 1 if any transaction on average in their whole lifetime. And the rich/corporations would have many more than 1, so the median may even be zero.

Basic supply and demand would mean that this would push transaction fees up sufficiently high that only rich developed world people could afford even a single transaction in their lives, to so much as even open up their own lightning channel once.

So for worldwide adoption, it would be logically necessary to have 2- or 3- or X- deep nested layers of sub-chains, at the regional or even municipal level.

Given that, what would even be the benefit of a blockchain or ""decentralization"" anymore? If I can't afford to make my own channel, even, on the main chain, and thus MUST sign up to my local nested sublayer pool, then I'm not gaining any benefit from any global blockchain, rather I'm stuck in a localized cartel, which can then manipulate things exactly like government did originally with fiat.

I don’t have any friends into Bitcoin (as hard as I try) so thought I could ask on here as I enjoy this forum a lot and I’m a bit torn with what to do.

Long story short, I invested some money into bitcoin and some altcoins last year. I have since been down the rabbit hole (and still going), learnt a huge amount and have decided that I’m better off with just bitcoin, the actual real money, that works. 

All my altcoin investments are down from the crash but I am wondering if I should cut my losses and convert them all into btc while the btc price is lovely and low. If I wait for this to happen the problem will be Bitcoin will not be as ‘on sale’ as it is now and risk not being able to get as much. 

1. I wait to regain my altcoin losses then sell for btc
2. I sell all altcoins now for btc 
3. I wait for altcoin profit - convert to stablecoin - Then buy btc when it drops again (whenever this maybe... if it’s not ‘the last cycle’)

So I stumble on a   reddit thread where someone explained that the major weakness of BTC is   that mining BTC will offer diminishing profits as time pass.

If   I understand well each halving events, mined blocks will reward less   and less BTC. If the price increase, it might still be profitable in the   next two halving, but unless BTC price goes to the moon I don't think   as many people will compete for 1,5 BTC only each block (2028\~).

Do   you think the price of one coin could increase so much it could keep   being profitable for as many mining facility as we have nowadays ?

Miners   also benefit from transaction fees, but, BTC seems to be more and more   considered as a store of value due to transaction time and expensive   fees. From my understanding most payements would go through second   layers systems, and miners wouldn't profit from these transactions.

Mining   power being the security of the network, if mining is less and less   profitable, will the BTC slowly collapse until someone manage to run a   51% attack or something ?

Curious to hear your opinion about this matter.",1625853710,29,1

ogyh48,cascading_disruption,I calculated the carbon emissions related to the Bitcoin network assuming you HODL 1 BTC following Gemini's methodology and the result is scary as hell!," I know that this is an unpopular opinion in this subreddit but as a BTC HOLDer I do care about this so I hope you guys keep an open mind and see that this is indeed an issue and people were right addressing this. I kept my eyes shut while reading the articles but if you do some back of the envelop calculations they are right to raise this as problematic.

 Source : [https://www.gemini.com/blog/introducing-gemini-green-offsetting-bitcoin-carbon-emissions](https://www.gemini.com/blog/introducing-gemini-green-offsetting-bitcoin-carbon-emissions)

*I assume you HODL 1 BTC and I assume you're your own custodian = HODLer.*

following their methodology

* *we  define our “usage” of the Bitcoin Network as the portion of the  mining  process that we benefit from, or rather, the amount of energy  consumed  by miners to secure the bitcoin that Gemini custodies. We  believe that  this custody-based approach more accurately reflects  Gemini’s usage of  the Bitcoin Network as opposed to a transaction-based  approach, which  ignores the fact that bitcoin at rest are secured by the  mining  process.*
* *As  a result, we calculated the amount of bitcoin  we custody as a  percentage of the circulating supply of bitcoin to  determine our usage  of the Bitcoin Network and then applied this  percentage to the Bitcoin  Network’s total energy consumption to estimate  the energy consumption  related to our usage. We then offset the energy  consumption related to  our usage that we estimate to involve  non-renewable mining.*

and sources:

* [https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption) (1)
* [https://cbeci.org/](https://cbeci.org/) (2)
* [https://blockchair.com/bitcoin](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin) (3)

From (3) you can see that total # of BTC in circulation right now =  18751865 BTC at the time of writing

Assuming  the values from (1) you can see that "" Annualized carbon footprint of  the Bitcoin Network"" gives 64.18 Mt CO2 ( comparable to the carbon  footprint of **Serbia &amp; Montenegro). M = million = 10\^6**

***Quick calculation:***

**Annualized  carbon footprint of the Bitcoin Network / BTC in circulation = 64.18 Mt  CO2 /  18751865 BTC = 3.41 t CO2 / BTC also written as 3.41 mT CO2 /  BTC (mt = metric tons and not milli ton :))  That's 3.4 tons of CO2 per  year if you HODL BTC**

***LONG calculation:***

**Step 1**: Calculate usage of the Bitcoin Network assuming you HODL 1 BTC

*   Your bitcoin balance / Average daily bitcoin in circulation (3)  = your usage of the Bitcoin Network

1 BTC / 18751865 BTC =  0.000000053328

**Step 2**: Calculate the energy consumed by miners related to your’s usage of the Bitcoin Network/year

* your  usage of the Bitcoin Network x the Bitcoin Network’s average annualized  energy consumption (2) = energy consumed by miners related to your  usage of the Bitcoin Network

0.000000053328 \*  **67.2 TWh** =   0.00000358364 **TWh**

**Step 3**:  Calculate the carbon intensity of the energy  used by the Bitcoin  Network. “Carbon intensity” is defined as the  amount of carbon emitted  per unit of energy consumed.

* Annualized  carbon footprint of the Bitcoin Network (1) / Projected annual energy  usage of Bitcoin network = carbon intensity of the energy used by the  Bitcoin Network (1)

**64.18 Mt CO2** /  **135.12 TWh** =  474985.1 **t CO2 / TWh (t = tons) or** 474985.1 **mt CO2 / TWh (metric tons)**

**Step 4**: Calculate the carbon emissions related to your usage of the Bitcoin Network.

*  (Energy  consumed by miners related to your usage of the Bitcoin Network x  carbon intensity of the Bitcoin Network) per year =  Carbon emissions  related to your usage of the Bitcoin Network

0.00000358364 **TWh** \* 474985.1 **t CO2 / TWh per year =**  !!!! **1.70** **t CO2 per year !!!!!**

**Step 5**: Calculate the cost to offset the carbon emissions related to your usage of the Bitcoin Network.

*  Carbon  emissions related to your usage of the Bitcoin Network x cost  per  permit to emit 1 mT CO2 = cost to offset the carbon emissions related to  your usage of the Bitcoin Network

**1.70** **t CO2 \***  $11.79 per permit / 1 t CO2 = 20$ !

Google search gives me this: "" **The  average carbon footprint for a person  in the United States is 16 tons,  one of the highest rates in the world.  Globally, the average is closer  to 4 tons.** To have the best chance of  avoiding a 2℃ rise in global temperatures, the average global **carbon footprint per** year needs to drop under 2 tons by 2050.""

Tl;DR:  Hodling 1 BTC and using Bitcoin network and its PoW is kinda bad for  the planet and as a bitcoin HODLER I'm pretty shocked by this knowing  that the global average carbon footprint (per year) is approx. 4 tons of  CO2 / person / year...

oj2zgi,Ymyol,Tether. A trillion dollar question?,"Hi all,

Been taking an avid interest since the start of the year in the space and stumbled upon the Tether question through the Coffeezilla video. This is far and away the biggest short term threat that I can see to the space and don't believe it's being talked about nearly enough. What would be the fall out from Tether collapsing and is this in any way currently priced in?

The headline issue is that it's now clear that Tether is unbacked, with USDT in effect being printed out of thin air and added to the circulation (I accept this is no different to what central banks do however at least the bonds sold are backed by the government!). Upon minting this is then being used to buy i.e. bitcoin (or lambos and whatever else the Tether owners might fancy). 


Key evidence for concern:

- Tether is 3% backed by cash

- Tether has never been audit (sacked their auditor for asking too many questions...)

- Tether is supposedly one of the biggest users of commercial paper but those in the market have barely heard of them

- Run by dishonest owners who have a shared history of fraud


Why this matters:

- Tether is the most popular stablecoin (designed to be 1:1 USD). Stablecoins are the ‘oil’ of the crypto sphere, providing the liquidity on which crypto coins are traded.

- There is &gt;$60bn of Tether in circulation.

- Responsible for circa 50% of bitcoin trading volume.

- Used extensively as collateral in the space.


To my mind then the question is when rather than if this will blow up. Given these issues have been fairly apparent since 2017 it seems difficult to know whether we are talking months or years. Given this, if you’d exited the market back then you’d have missed the incredible gains seen over the last few years. However, how much this has been driven by the minting of Tether is unclear to me.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on what the fallout from this is likely to be and what timescale we are likely looking at. I’d imagine that the chain of events could look like: a) fear spreads that Tether can’t be redeemed for USD and therefore people stop accepting it as 1:1 and it loses its peg, b) this has a knock on effect that drives its price down significantly, c) this drop in liquidity and collateral causes a sell off of bitcoin and a drop in the price.

I’ve listened to the Coin Bureau ‘rebuttal’ and whilst I am mostly a big fan of his videos I don’t find he directly confronts many of the issues raised by Bennett. PS, I’m not a financial advisor.

This news release constitutes a “designated news release” for the purposes of the Company’s prospectus supplement dated February 2, 2021 to its short form base shelf prospectus dated January 27, 2021. 


Vancouver, Canada – HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. (TSX.V:HIVE) (Nasdaq:HVBT) (FSE:HBF) (the “Company” or “HIVE”) is excited to announce the purchase and immediate hashing of 3,019 MicroBT WhatsMiner M30S dedicated mining computers, or “miners”.

These new machines have an aggregate hash power of 264 Petahash per second (PH/s).  The integration of these miners into HIVE’s systems will be immediate upon closing and will increase HIVE’s overall Bitcoin operating hashrate by approximately 46%.

Next Generation Miner Expansion

With the addition of these 3,019 MicroBT M30S miners, HIVE’s aggregate operating hash rate increases from approximately 566 PH/s to 830 PH/s.  At the current difficulty and Bitcoin price these purchased miners will generate an additional US$80,000 in daily income.  Bitcoin continues to have a daily volatility of plus or minus 6% and investors need to be aware of this volatility.

The miners to be acquired in the transaction are already located onsite at HIVE’s facilities in Lachute, Quebec and Grand Falls, New Brunswick.  The miners are being purchased from Foundry Digital LLC (“Foundry”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group (DCG) focussed on digital assets’ mining and staking.  As part of the partnership, HIVE will contribute its Bitcoin hashpower to Foundry USA Pool going forward, whose other major customers include Blockcap, Hut8, Bitfarms and Foundry itself, among others.

Frank Holmes, Executive Chairman of HIVE stated “We are pleased to be executing on a transaction that dramatically increases our mining capacity without any logistics delays.  Our entry into a North American mining pool furthers our goal of increased transparency and accountability with our partners.  Mining power is shifting from east to West, and we’re excited to be involved.”

Mike Colyer, CEO of Foundry said, “We are excited to have HIVE as a partner for the Foundry USA Pool as we continue playing our part in securing the global bitcoin mining network.”

As consideration for the sale of the miners, Foundry will be issued cash and 1.5 million warrants of the Company, subject to regulatory approval. Each full warrant will entitle the holder to acquire one common share for C$3.11 for a period of 2 years.  Mr. Holmes said “Foundry is one of the most well-respected firms in the mining space, and we’re pleased to have them as investors in HIVE, the only publicly traded pure 100% green, low-cost energy miner.”

HODL Strategy

This new production will quickly accelerate building up our Bitcoin reserves.  Presently we hold 605 Bitcoin in cold wallets.  Our goal to get to one Exahash of Bitcoin mining by the end of August is now much closer with this addition of 3,019 high performance machines.

New Mining Pool

We will be joining Foundry’s mining pool which we believe is the best option for our investors.  Foundry USA Pool is based in the US, where we should see better transparency, accountability and competitive costs. 
 
A mining pool is a collective that allows Bitcoin miners to combine their hashing power, and achieve a steadier stream of coins.

Nasdaq Bell

The team of HIVE is pleased that we are in New York City today to ring the closing bell for HIVE’s new listing on the Nasdaq.

HIVE owns state-of-the-art, green energy-powered data centre facilities in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland, where we source only green energy to mine on the cloud and HODL both Ethereum and Bitcoin. Since the beginning of 2021, HIVE has held in secure storage the majority of its ETH and BTC coin mining rewards.  Our shares provide investors with exposure to the operating margins of digital currency mining, as well as a portfolio of cryptocurrencies such as ETH and BTC.  Because HIVE also owns hard assets such as data centers and advanced multi-use servers, we believe our shares offer investors an attractive way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency space.  HIVE traded over 2 billion shares in 2020.

I loved the idea of cryptocurrency and freedom, but I didn’t really know why at the time. A few years later I’d see how powerful and dishonest the banking system was. That ended up keeping me buying since then. 

The first time I bought bitcoin I wired someone from local bitcoins and they made me go through western union or whatever it is. It was my first wife. He made me take a picture of my face and the check lol.

If we were talking about something disposable then it would not bother so much to think about this ... but we are talking about the hardest asset that man has known in thousands of years of state robbery, and the only salvation we have from this globalist and communist agenda that does not want us to have nothing and be happy while they are debasing the currency and impoverishing and stealing freedoms from hopeless people.

Please, many people have already been left out due to ignorance or lack of means that allow them to access to know Bitcoin in depth. Buy as many Sats as you can, inform your family or friends and if they don't want to know anything about it, at least stack more Sats thinking of your loved ones. Bitcoin is not an investment for Fiat, Bitcoin may have the ability to save lives in the future. THINK ABOUT THIS:

oiy24i,_afox_,Lost wallet [I know],"I’m aware it’s a major llong shot, I’m trying to help out one of my moms friends but if the immediate feedback is it’s a lost cause then I’ll delete the post. If something helpful comes along I’ll leave it up for visibility.

Anyhoo, my moms friend had a broker friend post on Facebook about 8 years “EVERYONE SHOULD BUY BITCOIN RIGHT NOW!” And then he posted a link to some site you could purchase from. Apparently she trusted him and went for it and purchased a little over $40,000 in BTC which is likely worth many millions today. Now here comes the fun part, she of course doesn’t remember how she stored the Bitcoin or the site she purchased it from just that she had it in a wallet.

So far my suggestions were as follows;

-	Have her search her email she used to purchase the Bitcoin for: Bitcoin, crypto, recovery, phrase, transfer, wallet
-	Reach out to either or both of these companies and walk them through the little info you have to see if they can help;
-	https://keychainx.com/
-	https://www.walletrecoveryservices.com

There’s an obvious one missing which would be to ask the guy what site he posted, but of course he didn’t buy any himself and shortly after deleted the post cause the company he worked for caught wind and didn’t like it. So there’s no way to go back through his feed to find it and he doesn’t remember.

Well that’s it, really not much to go off of I know but it’s where we are. If anyone can suggest any websites that would be popular at the time that this layman would have know of that she could search her email for or if anyone has *any* other suggestions…literally anything, it would be greatly appreciated.

Of course if your advice/help leads to the recovery, no matter how “small” your help/advice is, we would love to compensate you for your help.",1626116798,20,1

That’s about 15,000 tons of standard coal. Overall, mining machines globally consume about as much power as all of Bangladesh, a country of more than 160 million people.

While some of that power is green, the majority of the world’s electricity still comes from burning fossil fuels. Earlier this year, Elon Musk said Tesla Inc. would no longer accept purchases in Bitcoin because of its carbon footprint. An alliance of companies launched the Crypto Climate Accord earlier this year to address criticisms and vowed to help the industry shift to 100% renewable power consumption.",1626396680,1,1

ol5n2h,the48dots,Serious question: Would you use bitcoin to swap homes?,"Hey everyone! I run a home swapping club that groups people with similar interests together to exchange homes. For example, I have a group of women over 50 with second homes and they swap homes instead of paying for accommodations when they travel. Currently, groups like this pay $150 per swap to my company.

I'm thinking of forming a bitcoin home swapping group. Typically, individuals are grouped together based on similar lifestyles for equitable swapping. We meet all members before we group them. I do realize that bitcoin, in it's own right, isn't a lifestyle choice that would assume equitable exchanges of homes, but I am wondering if it's a bonding enough element to form a group. And yes, members of this group would make home swaps in bitcoin instead of dollars.

The whole CBDC project only makes sense if they are all interoperable otherwise there is no point.

So the only way CBDCs would have any use or efficiency gains over a visa card is if they all live on either ethereum as erc20 tokens or they are all interoperable with the lightning network and lightning invoices.

Heres the thing, in either scenario that would mean lightning bitcoin or wrapped btc would be able to be sent to any wallet that uses CBDCs and spent anywhere that accepts CBDCs.

CBDCs will massively boost the use and functionality of bitcoin itself. It might take time for the masses to abandon central bank monetary policy and adopt bitcoin monetary policy but being able to spend bitcoin anywhere in the meantime would be huge.",1626395072,3,1

The CEA set new guidelines for retail investors (people like you and me) to trade crypto with margin. For individuals or retail investors, to be eligible to trade crypto with margin, you must be certified as an Eligible Contract Participant (ECP). A retail investor must have $10 million in assets to be certified as an ECP.

So what does this mean for regular US citizens like you and me? For starters, it means that US citizens can no longer short sell bitcoin. You might ask, ""Can't we just short bitcoin without leverage?"" well no, you can't! It is impossible to short any assets without leverage since the nature of shorting involves borrowing a security, then selling it on the open market. We are once again being suppressed by the government. The US government saw that normal people were getting rich, bringing themselves out of poverty, and they decided to stop it. I have been leverage trading bitcoin for about 5 years now and I have made a good life for myself. I was able to pay off my student loans and pay off my car leveraging bitcoin in my spare time and I have always paid Uncle Sam my fair share of taxes when I profit. 

Look, I am all for government regulation in crypto. I think that in order for Bitcoin to get mainstream adoption, there needs to be more government regulation. However, with this new definition of an ECP the US government is only looking after corporate America and all of their wealthy friends, not its citizens. So now if I want to short bitcoin or trade with leverage, I have to renounce my citizenship and move to another country. And obviously, I know that I can use a VPN, but the prison system in America is one of the worst in the world, and it's not worth the risk if you ask me.

&amp;#x200B;

.... I think it is kind of funny that the US government is always saying that Bitcoin is only used by criminals and for money laundering. Well now by leverage trading any digital asset you are now considered a criminal... unless you are filthy rich, then you're fine.",1626392347,184,1

""The account blockings makes sense especially regarding preventing sensorship if a government wanted to take control over the money of their citizens. As for inflation, Cryptos lose their value...go up and down. Bitcoin dropped by 50%...so if someone had put in 100K in bitcoin, their funds would have lost 50% of its value where's inflation does not do that, irrespective of the possibility that bitcoin ""might"" go up.

Typically sanctions and embargoes are against nations which prevent trade and so on; so El Salvador for example has made Bitcoin their legal tender, how exactly would that benefit them if for example They were sanctioned and embargoed?

CBDC's would be pegged to their respective currencies along with whatever other features that they give them using the blockchain technology and unlike regular paper money they would not have technological advantages that Cryptos have making them more than just ""regular fiat"", No?""

ol1z1r,tradecheap,Considering using Lightning Network; New Questions,"**TLDR**

Long time buyer, holder, and user of Bitcoin (since 2015). Absolutely zero experience with Lightning Network. I've read some entry-level tutorials but still have basic conceptual questions regarding funding, capacity, revocations, etc.

**Hypothetical Situation**

Let's say I run a gambling site. All business is conducted in BTC. More and more customers are asking that Lightning Network be made available to facilitate quick and cheap deposit and withdrawal of funds.

**Where do I connect for maximum reach?**

The tutorials always seem show to show two parties, Bob and Alice. They open a ""channel"" using a funding transaction. The example then typically adds in a third party (e.g. Festus) and says something along the lines of ""and look, Bob can pay Festus through Alice."" 

The implication seems to be that the network size could become enormous, to the point where anyone can pay anyone because hey, every Bitcoin user is inevitably connected by only a few degrees of separation on the network.

But this doesn't really answer the question of to whom I, as a brand new user, should connect? I could connect to you, I guess. But maybe you're a new user too and have zero other connections. Do I connect to some sort of hub? Guess that would work but doesn't that make things overly centralized?

As a site owner (see hypothetical above), is it best for me to act as a hub and open a channel with each of my users, which means I'd have thousands of channels open? Or is it better to make a single connection to one really popular, well-connected dude? Seems like the latter, but which dude? How do I find him?

**Do I always have to be online looking for cheats?**

Ok, so I get that my LN peer can try to cheat me by broadcasting a settlement transaction of a prior balance state that's more advantageous to him. And I also know that his cheat TX settlement won't clear for twenty-four hours, giving me time to broadcast a ""revocation"" TX that settles everything in my favor instead. This is what dissuades my peer from cheating.

But this also implies that my Lightning node needs to be up 24/7, or at least never offline for more than 24 hours and, furthermore, I have to be ever vigilant to make sure no one is cheating, and execute revocations if they are. Are these assumptions correct? Does the Lightning software automate the cheat-detection process for me?

**How do I Add Funds to an existing channel?**

It's still not clear how to add funds to a preexisting channel. I've seen some material online indicating that a third party service needs to be paid for this? I can't imagine that's correct is it? That doesn't seem compatible with the whole ethos of LN.

Using my hypothetical example. Let's say a client opens a channel with me and sends me 1 BTC. He bets on an upcoming UFC fight (Ronda Rousey vs. Oprah Winfrey). A successful bet on Winfrey pays 15x. That means in the unlikely even that he wins, I need to have at least 15 BTC available *on that channel* to pay him out.

How do I add funds to the channel if he wins? Or does that 15 BTC have to be placed in the channel via the initial funding transaction?

Now, if I'm servicing all users over a single channel, that's fine. But if each user has his own channel, I'd have to fund each one with an enormous amount of BTC -- despite the fact that 99.99% of my users will never even bet on that particular event at all. That would be an inefficient use of funds. I assume there's a way to add funds to a channel after initial funding, but how?

**Wallet Recommendations**

I'm running on Win 2019 Server and need to be able to create channels, send funds, be notified of incoming funds, etc. using an API. Which wallet should I use for this?

With Bitcoin's first layer, I have the option of either running a full blown node or leveraging a centralized service like Electrum? Does LN have an analogous situation with two different styles of wallet?",1626383198,8,1

1.- I got the crypto from a centralized exchange like Coinbase, so there is a record of what I purchased.
2.- I moved the crypto to my cold wallet.

My question is  if I use my cold wallet to pay for the VPN it is still tracking back that it is me?.

Quite a week ago, some third-party invididuals has recently logged into my [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) account and have also stolen ALL my funds. They've basically cleared all my wallets up to $0.

They were able to bypass all the security risk's on blockchain — PIN code, 2FA, e-mail... None of them has worked. And I never got notified as well, when somebody has logged into my account.

However. Now's everything gone. **My question is: Does** [**blockchain.com**](https://blockchain.com) **refund all the stolen funds, so the unrecognized transactions, which were NOT attempted by me?**

And also: I've NEVER shared my accounts to anyone! Some of my account data were found in a databreach. Never expected, that all additional security activities were bypassed. — Honestly!

omzo2n,Argentino_Feliz,Take a proper care of your mental health. It’s far more valuable than anything else," 

I know, another post about the mental health but hear me out, please.

As most of you already know, we’re living in a society that values money. We will do many things for it and sometimes it may result in sacrificing our mental health. This can be a subversive process that is hard to catch in the moment. The absolute paradox of value and money is that the very thing you chase can be the thing that destroys you. Unfortunately, I have chased money on several occasions and in parallel sacrificed relationships, time and most importantly, my mental health. I've lost sleep, jeopardized relationships and undermined my own ethics far too many times to count. Although my relationship with money has evolved, in my early days I was specifically obsessed about these 3 things:

1. Not having enough
2. My friends doing better than me
3. Others doing better than me

I also started asking these questions:

1. Do I lose sleep over my crypto positions? (Yes)
2. Can I go a day without checking the market? (No)
3. How do I feel when I lose? (Like shit, of course, what did you expect)

I realized I have a big problem. My investing habits were destroying my life. After weeks of thinking I came up with these points to get me back on track:

1. Staying away from social media or at least reducing it by a wide margin
2. Not reading news in the evenings before bed
3. Leaving my phone in another room when I went to sleep.
4. Taking at least 1 full day per week totally away from all screens, phone, laptop, desktop and otherwise and hitting the mountains
5. Trading far less. When I trade less and look at the screen less, I tend to make more money.

Right now, I’m doing way better and I’m really thankful for that. I hope some of you might find it useful. Success has nothing to do with how much money you have, it's about the relationship you have with money, people and yourself. If you become paranoid and build a shelter based on fear and obsession - even if you get rich financially you will be the most depressed person alive.

Good luck out there!",1626643254,22,1

As a beginner switching over decentralized finance can be exaggerated but Research is the primary tool that will be your savior. Just don’t follow anyone blindly or under the influence of other influencers. 

Even though they have more access to resources, billionaire investors are not immune to the risk of decentralized finance or Defi. Some in the crypto community first assumed that this was the consequence of a rogue pull, a kind of scam when engineers abandon a project and flee with the investor's money. 

These accusations were refuted by Iron Finance. 

The project indicated in a blog post that a ""bank run"" or a panic sale and the token algorithmic code were responsible for the disaster.

Even though they have more access to resources, billionaire investors are not immune to the risk of decentralized finance or Defi. Some in the crypto community first assumed that this was the consequence of a rogue pull, a kind of scam when engineers abandon a project and flee with the investor's money. 

These accusations were refuted by Iron Finance. 

The project indicated in a blog post that a ""bank run"" or a panic sale and the token algorithmic code were responsible for the disaster.

I feel that Musk’s statement at the meeting may have a consequence that needs to be paid attention to. He took Tesla and spacex’s corporate funds and personal assets to allocate a large amount of BTC and did not complete the sell-off at a high level. (Except for the part in the previous announcement), and the cost is about the same as it is now, and Musk said that he will not sell it now, and he may buy it if it continues to fall. This statement may cause the capital market to suspect that these companies and individuals of Musk may cause systemic risks due to the continued decline in BTC prices.

Full story: [https://imgur.com/a/zYjdjdC](https://imgur.com/a/zYjdjdC)  


**Summary:** The scammer is impersonating ""The Bitcoin Rabbi"" but replaces the ""i"" in Rabbi with a ""j."" He supposedly can give you 10x on your investment in 5 days if you join his trading/investment company. I used the ""inspect element"" tool in the browser to create fake screenshots of ""my bitcoin wallet"" to make him believe that I had several bitcoin. I then used the same technique to create a fake conversation between me and another ""investment"" company. I got him to believe this other company offered a ""token gift"" to new investors as a sign of trust. I eventually get the scammer to compete with this other fake company and send me a $27 ""token gift.""

The scammers twitter handle is one letter off from the real Bitcoin Rabbi. The scammer replaced the ""i"" with a ""j"" so after receiving the token gift, I began replacing all ""i' with ""j"" until he figured out what was going. Since he is a Rabbi I also question him about the 7th commandment, ""Thou shall not steal.""",1626924954,19,1

As you can gather from the title, I just turned 18 and have accumulated a decent sum of money throughout my years of summer jobs and birthdays. I've been interested in crypto, more specifically Bitcoin, for a few years now. 

I have the fundamental knowledge of crypto but am looking to learn more. My question was concerning what recommendations you all had on how to invest $1000 into various cryptocurrencies? I was thinking about investing half into Bitcoin and the rest into a few other currencies.  I'm not sure how far $1000 can get you in the realm of crypto, but for the moment I believe this is a good starting point. ( Or not?) I am willing to invest more money after I  have a better understanding of crypto. 

Before I close off, what would you guys say is the best crypto exchange for beginner use?

Also, I apologize if this was the wrong place to ask these questions.

op29xn,regretfulfor,Shower thought I had about a potential source of energy for Bitcoin mining.,"So basically my idea will combine things I watched in 2 separate videos. 

You may want to watch them as well, so you can get what I'm talking about here. It's about 6 minutes of watch time.

English isn't my first language so I may not be able to explain my ideas as clearly as I would like to.

Anyways:

First, I watched this video.

Billions In Change Official Film
https://youtu.be/aqxlWeoa53s

Watch from 14:10 - 18:49


Then I watched this video

The Deepest Hole in the World, And What We've Learned From It

Watch from 2:25 - 2:51


So to summarize. The first video talks about sending Graphene cables down into the earth to be able to extract heat from below  the Earth's surface.

The second video talks about the deepest hole on Earth that goes down 12 km and it gets so hot that they couldn't dig any further because the rocks began to ""act like plastic"".

So there may not even be a need to dig a new hole for energy when one already exists. 

I think Mining companies and Bitcoin billionaires have enough money and resources to explore this idea. 

Manufacturing 12km long graphene cables might be costly but it's a one time expense.

 I think if it can successfully mine Bitcoin profitably over the long term then it does give them the incentive to try it.

I don't have a science or engineering background so this may just be a pipe dream and I'm sure someone more knowledgeable will totally debunk this idea.",1626911932,10,1

What are the reasons of this sell-off? They treat Bitcoin like risky stocks, get rich quick scheme or worst, they don’t understand how basic economy works They have no idea that Bitcoin changes everything and will transform our entire society for the better.

As a result, I wanted to emphasize once again why our world needs Bitcoin and reassure everyone that its value is scheduled to go to infinity on the long term.

# 1) We will always want to have more than our neighbors

Since the early ages, humans have always lived in societies to survive and evolve. Social mechanisms have bring the dominance question into the equation: in order to establish our status among our society, we want to have more money than others to show dominance.

Not so long ago, some guys found a new way to distinguish themselves from the masses even more. Their idea was to privately own businesses and make people work for them so they can keep all the profits. It is called capitalism and is still considered the best system nowadays.

# 2) Inflation makes rich richer, while making poor poorer

An interesting lever for our elites to keep earning more is infinite growth. One way to do it is to let banks print new money which will be injected into the economy. Businesses will produce more, people will have more money, making owners wealthier.

However, the more money is printed to support growth, the bigger the money supply gets, and the more prices of goods and services go up. This is inflation. As wages don’t increase at the same level, employees get less buying power over time, making them poorer.

# 3) Deflation system will never be voted by elites

Remember, governments and business owners will always want to save their privileged status. Stopping money printing, would result in deflation, which means that prices would go down and people stop buying. Why buying something today when it will be cheaper tomorrow?

At that point, companies would go bankrupt, and shareholders would lose their wealth. You know understand how this is important for them to keep inflation running. Quite easy to do : banks simply have to lower loans APR to encourage people to take credits and buy stuffs.

# 4) Inflationary system has plenty of other negative effects

Inflation is also an endless nightmare. Banks or countries borrows money from central banks but their debts will never be paid back. Instead, they take new debts to reimburse part of the old debts. Money printer will never stop. This is actually getting worst over time.

Last but not least, inflation is not a sustainable system for our finite planet. Always-increasing mass consumerism consumes always more energy and resources that are not abundant. Global warming and climate change will never slow down by itself in an inflationist economy.

# 5) Be your own bank with Bitcoin and change the system

To make things clear from the start, Bitcoin is our only hope to change the system. You don’t know who to vote for at the next elections because you don’t trust them to bring a working solution? Just buy Bitcoin and hold it. This will be your best vote to have a real impact.

Here are the 5 main reasons why Bitcoin is the only viable solution :

a) Bitcoin is decentralized: it is not governed by anyone and has been designed to follow the exact same principles and will continue to deliver as promised forever. Algorithms embraces certainty. It is the opposite of human-based government that can change rules every now and then to please their own bank account.

b) Bitcoin has a 21M max supply: this is the first time in history we are dealing with an asset that will always be absolutely finite (not even gold), and cannot be replicated. Less and less coin will be produced until 2140, making it the perfect deflationary asset, without mentioning coins that will be lost forever. It is the opposite of central banks which are printing infinite FIAT currencies.

c) Bitcoin is the most secured asset: billions of successful transactions to date and millions of wallets without a single hack to date. The more people join, the more the network is strong and secured. Bitcoin is your secured property as opposed at current systems where banks are hacked every day and could collapse or take your gold in absolute necessity.

d) Bitcoin is the most liquid asset: you are always 1 click away to send any amount to anyone, at any time, and anywhere in the world. Everyone can be its own bank without any government intervention or third party censorship.

e) Bitcoin is the perfect ledger: blockchain technology keeps perfect track of every transaction that has ever happened. You would rather buy your drugs with cash than buying them with Bitcoin. Same principle with corrupted governments in a lot of third countries.

# 6) Bitcoin is a store of value asset above all

As you have probably noticed, and despite what is written on the Bitcoin white paper, I want you to treat Bitcoin like an store of value asset first. The currency/cash feature is just the cherry on top the cake that Satoshi offered to us.

However, as each Bitcoin transaction is considered  a taxable event in many countries, this does not advocate for a currency usage. The high transaction fees are also a challenge that will need to be adressed. There are layer-2 solutions like lightning network that will help in that matter.

# 7) Bitcoin is incentiving holders to think long term

Bitcoin being deflationary, it encourages people to hold their sats on the long term. Nobody wants to sell their bitcoins into a weaker currency that is losing more value over time. Never compare the price of 1 BTC to USD, this is pointless as USD price will go to infinity because of infinite money printing. This is why 1 BTC will always be equal to 1 BTC.

To judge Bitcoin’s value, think instead on its USD market capitalization and compare it to other scarce asset market caps. Bitcoin still has room to grow 10x its current price to have the same value of gold. 100x to have the same of real estate. If you consider that Bitcoin is scarcer, more secured, and more liquid than these 2 assets, I let you imagine how early we still are.

I hope this summary will help people to realize how important Bitcoin is for our future. It is our escape gate to a fair, inclusive and sustainable world. Buy, hold and spread the word around you!

And that’s all I have to say about that.",1626908495,45,1

or7pqk,Bureaugewas,Why the token economy might be ruining Ehtereum and why Bitcoin is different.,"I've dabbled in the Ethereum smart-contracts and DeFi space for quite some time over the past four years. As someone who works a nine-to-five job, trying to understand the cacophony of tokens, DEX'es, wrapped coins and swap tokens seemed almost like an insurmountable task. In a space where rug-pulls are not uncommon and where tokens can inexplicably dump never to be seen again, a lack of clarity and stability is a big hurdle to innovation.

In Ethereum, innovation is spread thin. Because of the way tokens work, projects and developers get funding by creating their own token and build a use-case for it. The problem, however, is that in most cases when a token lacks right marketing team and fails to grow, interest is lost and with it all the potential innovation. Furthermore, every token carves out a very specific niche and works on that, resulting in many projects kind-of doing similar things (e.g. Pancake, Sushi, Uni, Shiba).

With Bitcoin there's a different philosophy, whereby the effort of all participants is focussed on improving one and only one network: Bitcoin. As the rising tide lifts all boats, innovations by incredibly smart people like René Pickhardt, creates value for all holders. With the advent of Bitcoin smart-contracts, I feel like there's important lessons to be taken from what Ethereum has done.

He was saying this to explain that Bitcoin has a store of value and it will keep going up in price because more and more people will want it. Not because it has any real practical value or purpose to it. If you wanted practicality, you’d buy altcoins. But Bitcoin can maintain its value for just being what it is because it has that brand recognition around the world.

As a person who’s from a middle class family, I’ve never considered owning something for the sake of owning like art collection or some ridiculously expensive stuff that rich people buy to amuse themselves.

Everything I owned had to serve a purpose whether it is a book, a car, clothes, toothbrush, etc. But to buy something just to own it and paying for the price that’s obviously overpriced for the sake of it being highly valued by the society was something that I could not understand.

Why do rich people buy expensive art pieces or own a thousand square mile land but not use it for any practical purpose at all aside from renting it out or giving it to their grand children? It’s just a super rich concept that I didn’t understand.

Do you think that bitcoin will keep rising in price perhaps infinitely to 10 millions or 100 million dollars in the future? Just because rich people want this scarce coin of value?",1627178368,35,1

My only regret about investing in Bitcoin was that I had started buying on Robinhood, so not my keys not my crypto and all that, but I trust that they will eventually allow withdrawal to a private wallet like they said they would. I also have $500 worth of Bitcoin on Coinbase, which I just bought in the last couple weeks. Now that I have 1/10th on Robinhood, I’ll probably start buying on Coinbase instead, if I decide to keep buying. Maybe my next goal will be 1/10th on Coinbase as well. 

I’m feeling good about having held and averaged down all this time, and I’m hoping to continue holding until I’m ready to buy land with it.",1627474767,29,1

Today I have the 4hr time frame pulled up after a pretty  wild day yesterday... The bulls took us to a higher high. But will that  be enough? Lets get this party started...

Okay  so we all know Bitcoin did well yesterday. But after Amazon announced  they were NOT accepting Bitcoin we saw a pull back. Which is to be  expected. Fud is common in this market and yesterday was no exception.  The resistance that was broken yesterday was fantastic. But I think the  bulls still have some ground to retake before I am full bull... Another  reason for the pull back is the 4hr RSI is overbought. Which resulted in  a pull back which happens often in an overbought market. Especially  when FUD is on the table.

We are still in  decent shape this morning. You see we broke the trend yesterday and had a  nice surge. Now the top of that trend is support. Classic TA.  Resistance becomes support and vice versa. The daily looks okay. We beat  the cloud (bottom border) and the daily 50 MA. The 100 EMA was under us  for a bit but the FUD yesterday pushed us back below the resistance.  Hopefully this drop is just a retest of support before the bulls push us  out of the daily cloud. Then Im full bull.

If  you want to take a shot at a long set a stop loss. I'm certainly more  optimistic than I was last week but I am still cautious. Cmon Bulls!  WTFDIK??

TLDR: Bullish Monday. Still in good shape today. Set a stop loss.

The draconian lockdown actions of governments related to COVID has me concerned that they'll try some nefarious shit to ban/criminalize owning Bitcoin in due course.

Not a problem, up steps decentralized exchanges such as Bisq to allow global peer to peer exchange over Tor. All great in principle, but here's the problem...

Bisq works by the seller sending their coins into third party escrow whilst the buyer makes a bank transfer to the seller. Once the seller receives the funds via bank transfer, the seller confirms to escrow and the coins are released to the buyer.

In the above scenario \*how does one know that the seller is NOT an agency of government/law enforcement\*?! What is to stop governments, agencies and law enforcement from impersonating a normie, selling the coins, then tracking the bank transfer to identify the buyer? If we can't do this, are decentralized exchanges really decentralized?

Write down half the public key and half the private key and keep them at home. Write the other half of the public key and the private key and put them in a safe deposit box at the bank, in an account in your name only.

This way your relatives at home cannot know how many bitcoins you have nor can they give a damn. And if the safe in the bank is broken into with only half the code, they can't do anything.

But if you die, everything you have in the bank passes to the heirs who will then have access to your bitcoins.

From what I gathered, let's say I start DCAing into Bitcoin and send 1 Bitcoin per week to my address. After one year, I will have 52 transactions adding up to 52 Bitcoins. If I decide to send 50 bitcoins to another address, all 52 transactions will be used as an input (to prove that I have enough BTC) and there will be 2 outputs: 1 for the receiver of the transaction and 1 for me containing the remainder of the transaction (in this case 2, since I only sent 50) that will serve as an input for my next transaction. The used inputs are then erased (?), leaving me with one single input for my next transaction: the second output of my last transaction, which says that I currently have 2 BTC. 

 If I understand correctly then, the next transaction fee I will have to pay gets bigger and bigger the more and more I receive transactions, since my amount of inputs increase, and resets once I do a transaction since all the inputs get converted into one output showing how much I have left after the transaction.  

My questions is first, am I right? And second, how are the used inputs ""erased""? And how do validators validate that my inputs are correct? Do they simply verify the entire blockchain?

I have heard advice to never reuse the same wallet, but how would I ever move funds to and from my main wallet without creating a direct and public link between them? Even so, it sounds both cumbersome and expensive to move funds to/from a new wallet for every single transaction.

Honestly, if there isn't a fantastic solution to this, it leaves me quite worried for the adoption of BTC. I can imagine higher level solutions could interface this to abstract away the technicalities, but I haven't done much reading about them yet.",1627458926,8,1

ot2530,thefanum,Elizabeth Warren is smart enough to know Bitcoin complaints are 80% BS. She's chosen her side. Rich people like her. Vote accordingly,"Bitcoin is a technological inevitability, who's negatives (mainly energy use) are being addressed adequately, or were a non issue in the first place. I'll start with energy consumption: 

Bitcoin's energy consumption is worrisome, if you don't compare it to it's competition, and only have the facts the banking industry (Bitcoin's competition) want you to have:

""A recent report from Galaxy Digital found that the Bitcoin network consumes less than half the energy consumed by the banking or gold industries. ... It found that Bitcoin consumes 113.89 terawatt hours (TWh) per year, while the banking industry consumes 263.72 TWh per""

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/research%3A-bitcoin-consumes-less-than-half-the-energy-of-the-banking-or-gold-industries

The Pearl clutchers, who love to mention how much energy Bitcoin uses (because they fear the financial reorganization that is happening, which they have no control over for the first time), love to omit the fact that Bitcoin is already powered by 74% renewable energy. And that's before the scare monitoring. Between new algorithms, and completely revamping the way in which cryptocurrencies store value and measure it (Google ""Ethereum POS"" to find out about Ethereum 2.0's solution, which I think will be the norm moving forward), this is a non issue. Or an issue that's already being addressed adequate. There's always growing pains when a new technology becomes dominant. Do pop-ups mean the internet is a failure? No. AND we mostly did away with them. As we will with the shortcomings of cryptocurrencies, over time. 

""Over 74% of Bitcoin Mining is Powered by Renewable Energy""

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/study-over-74-bitcoin-mining-180300738.html

Let's move on to the other concerns that were non issue from the get-go: 

illegal uses: Now I'm not sure where this particular piece of misinformation started, but everyone who doesn't understand Bitcoin (and quite a few people who do) seems to be under the impression that it's anonymous. Bitcoin has never been anonymous. It's actually the opposite, it's a public ledger. Which means anyone can track where any Bitcoin goes. Not ideal for crime. That's not to say that there aren't people trying to use it for crime, I'm just saying they are stupid criminals who will inevitably be caught. 

Not to mention, crime's go-to currency is the US dollar. Does that mean we should abolish the dollar? Obviously not. 

""Messari conducted a research, which showed that US dollars have been used 800 times more than Bitcoin to launder money""

https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/us-dollar-used-in-money-laundering-800-times-more-than-bitcoin-201907292200

And the most laughable claim ""Bitcoin harms financial industries""

You're God damn right it does! And while it may not be the point (it also might be), it is a wonderful side effect. The institutions that have victimized us, and even more frequently people of color, since our grandparents days, are losing their power over people. When you, individually, can be your own bank, can hold your own wealth, the banking system becomes obsolete. It is a revolution long in the making, which technology has finally made possible. If anything, it will save us bloodshed. Because taking our power back from bankers and the predatory institutions that have kept the poor poor, for generations, could have gone a lot worse. 

""Oh no, not my bank that charges me $35 every time I get too poor""

Is digital money the future? How could it not be? What part of our life is not transitioning to digital? Or at the very least, becoming dependent on something digital? The question is, are we going to let the same people who have abused us for centuries find a way to twist this to do the same. I recommend everyone buy cryptocurrencies. It will be the largest wealth transfer in our lifetimes. And this is our chance to be on the winning side of it, for the first time in our existence (individually).",1627444095,0,1

ov89po,davbelsz,Update to my nightmare with blockchain.com,"1)  On July 9, I sent 2 wires to my blockchain wallet ($5,000 and $8,000). I did not put the reference number per the instructions - I put my name instead. This was my error. Chat support said the wires were received and then rejected. It is now 22 days since I sent the wires and blockchain.com has not responded to my request for a refund. This is the easiest fix - every wire has a federal reserve reference number and the funds can easily be returned via the reference number. In fact, if a wire is actually rejected, this is an automated process and the funds are usually back in the sender's account within 24 hours. It's now 22 days since a ticket was opened! I was asked to provide a copy of a bank statement which I did. All I have received since are automated emails. The emails ask me to click on a link and check for updates. There are no updates - not a word. The emails also state that if I don't respond within a few days, the ticket will be closed. I respond every time, then nothing, then another automated email that has no update. 22 days to do nothing - they don't need a copy of my bank statement, they don't need anything at all. They have the federal reserve reference number which is all they need to return the money to the bank account where it came from.  


2)  I sent the 2 wires because I needed to send BTC urgently for my business. I knew there was a delay because of the missing blockchain.com reference #, so I sent in another wire on July 12 for $25,000. The $25k was credited to my account and I bought BTC. I tried to send $12k of BTC value on July 12 and my account was put on a hold. My activity shows deposit $25k and BTC purchase and my balance now is $42. The activity report does not show what happened to the missing $24,958? Again, a ticket was opened on July 12th and there has been absolutely no action or response, except for automated responses referring me to a link, and stating that if I don't respond within a few days they will close the ticket. Of course there is absolutely no update to the ticket every time!  


Blockchain.com does not deserve to have any customers. I have not just had poor service - I've had NO service after more than 3 weeks.    


Funny thing, while I was writing this review, I just received another meaningless automated email from blockchain.com",1627742234,12,1
ov81dp,Serious-Employer7945,Stoner Thought - The Road to Global Currency,"The biggest argument people have against bitcoin becoming a currency is ‘volatility’.
Now what if we’re just looking at it wrong? What defines our understanding of currency in the world we live in today? a medium to exchange goods and services right? So hang on hear me out.

We as a global society have become so use to a fixed amount to pay for services. A coffee will be $3 and hence for us to replace that with x amount of sats would be impossible with the current volatility and so we usually ‘always’ need to ‘peg’ the value of purchase back to fiat to buy coffee. I know your argument would be “oh but 1 day we wont need to…etc” yea okay im with you. But lets talk about the road to that one day. 

The world today right now is in the middle of a big change. Global internet is literally months away with companies like starlink shooting dildos in the sky. Buying a low-end android phone is cheaper than a full tank of gas on Christmas. 

Chainlink, wolfram, etc oracles are changing the way information is being shared. AMMs, defi networks, faster TPS etc. all that jazz you get me.

NOW lets put this altogether.
What if we dont need to peg the dollar every single time? What if we develop a financial platform where you set the price of a coffee on your new POS machine to be $3 equal to the number of sats at the time and just let chainlink fluctuate the  sats thats pegged to the dollar. So if btc is 50,000 today youl have alot more sats to pay but tomorrow itl be lets say 40,000 and you pay less sats but your scanning QR code would stay the same.

That way the mass population wouldn’t be wasting time on converting it as itl just like be like tap and go BUT THE MENTALITY AND PERCEPTION would change to accept sats as a currency! By attacking the way we think would fast forward our road map to being accepted as a currency. 

Ofcourse in reality we would still be pegged to the dollar i know, but if successfully implemented by making a standard of transfer when merchants start accepting bitcoin (or any other crypto). We would add sats in the average humans vocabulary and so when we DO have our ‘moving from the fiat to crypto or digital currency’ moment, itl just be a formality because we’re already using it for a long time.

Just thought, id share it. Sorry for the long talk and im not sure if it made sense. I had more to spill but lets leave it this for now.

Fast forward to Jan 2020. I open a business account. Feb 2020 Covid hits,  April 2020 I go to work in the Covid ICU as a nurse. My business account goes negative 40 dollars due to monthly fee. That account auto closes well I was living at a hotel due to working in the Covid unit.  

I call the bank and pay the 40 buck. They re-open the account, and then corporate promptly closes it three days later. I go back in and they re-open the account again and then close the account three days later. 

This happens at 3 different banks. I finally get a copy of my “Early Warning” Fintech report. It shows the business bank account closed due to being -$40. It also shows coin base ran my information multiple times. 

I paid back the bank the $40. Could all three of these institutions be refusing to thank me because of my coin base history?

I have no criminal history. I do have a Ch13. Could that be it?

ov7m5b,satormeowserver,Just some questions I had about Bitcoin (curious),"Greetings, 

I was just wondering what the community thinks about the following points and if there are a few developments in bitcoin I have missed out on. Please keep in mind, I'm not attacking anything, just genuinely curious. I have also stepped back from the community over the last couple years instead hodling my bitcoin holdings since 2016 (thank god I did). 

For background, I used to work as a developer at this blockchain startup called Quoine which grew to a 1 billion USD valuation in 3 years before sputtering out due to the regulatory challenges and unkept promises. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. How will bitcoin overcome the problem that it's extensively used by criminals? I know people say that this is disputed, but i've seen first had how it's still prevalent on a widespread level (don't ask me how pls). This way governments will never truly allow bitcoin to prosper as tender, instead creating their own versions ie. Digital Yuan. 
2. Is bitcoin ""digital real estate"", ie. simply a store of value, or is it a currency . I can't really find any true use cases for bitcoin, even with the lightning network , that provides meaningful benefits besides privacy and anonymity. I feel most people don't care for ""taking control"" of their money and would prefer the convenience a traditional bank offers. I mean, it's quite hard for most people to keep track of private keys, and if they were storing it on an exchange it would defeat the purpose?
3. I sincerely believe blockchain will help this world deal with trust based systems, yet bitcoin itself seems to have morphed into this gambling instrument where millions of teens are suddenly blockchain experts and crypto visionary's. Essentially, will bitcoin eventually resign to its role as a another store of value, or will an entire payments ecosystem be built on top of bitcoin allowing for a new decentralized internet. As Jack Dorsey claims, ""the currency of the internet"" (unlikely as every government wants control over online payments).
4. Is bitcoin truly the decentralized if a few major exchanges, mines and billionaires control most of its supply. As a capitalist, I understand that people will profit handsomely off of new technologies, but if such technology is supposed to be the currency system of the people, and help facilitate a large number of internet payments surely its not right that rich people in western countries have the greatest access, while those in developing nations who need bitcoin the most, have a hard time purchasing and adopting it.

It was gambling. Starting at green candles and freaking out at reds.

now several sources I've encountered state that anyone who held BTC at the time of the fork came into possession of bitcash  'as if from an airdrop' (quote).

now I may be wrong here but that does not sound like BTC holders at the time of the fork had to choose between keeping their BTC holding and receiving equivalent holding in bitcash. rather, it sounds like BTC holders at the time received bitcash holdings on top of their BTC holding at no addition cost. is that what happent? and if so, was it a one time thing which people had to apply for or can anyone who held BTC at the time of the fork still claim some bitcash?

I also have an additional question regarding the bull/bear cycle. Due to the halvening occurring in 2020, are we now expecting a bear run into the later stages of 2021, or is this bear run expected to start in 2022?

obujg6,brucehuy,Due Diligence on BTC Trading Bot," 

I started trading Bitcoin a month ago I came across a ""trading bot"" ([authenticbot.com](https://authenticbot.com)) that seemed to have promising results so I decided to give it a try. The results since then have been…remarkable. I'm not an employee, just a fan so here's my write up.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS A TRADING BOT AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

Crypto markets are open all the time and don't close. AuthenticBot is a fully automated bot, that trades on your behalf 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week. It was created by a couple of clever developers in Germany. They've been working on it for a year, and finally made it publicly available in Feb 2021.

AB uses a set of indicators to look for likely points of Bitcoin price reversals. It will determine trade bias, trade amount, entry point and exit point. It will then long/short BTC futures using small amounts and dollar cost average until the exit point is reached. The bot will never leverage more then 10% of your account, and most of the time only bets 1%.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT EXCHANGE DOES IT USE?

The bot uses the ByBit exchange that allows you to trade futures contracts on BTC. ByBit does NOT support all countries, and will filter out IP addresses coming those countries. For instance, the US is one of the handful of countries NOT supported, but most other countries (ex: Canada) are supported. Beyond an IP check, they don't check for anything else…**so some people will use VPNs to fund their bybit account.**

There's a lots of videos on what bybit is and how to trade on it, here are a couple:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2mbihq5gvn871.png?width=627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e91543f3a258cc8bc9f9e637b2f330cbef8992fd

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

ARE MY FUNDS SAFE?

The first question is if the funds are safe from the bot owners? As an account owner, you would grant the bot API permissions to ONLY perform trades on your behalf. The bot would NOT have permissions to do withdrawals, only do trades.

The next question is are the funds safe on ByBit exchange? Any hot wallet is less safe then a cold wallet, and ByBit is likely no exception. ByBit is also not FDIC insured. So if you're accustomed to trading traditional securities on Etrade, this may not be for you. The bot needs access to your BTC to make trades with it, so having funds in a hot wallet is a risk if you want to trade BTC. There's lots of articles on ByBit exchange platform security, so I would recommend doing your own DD here. AB is definitely aimed for folks who are already trading crypto on exchanges like Coinbase, etc.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

SO…HOW HAS THE BOT PERFORMED?

When you setup the bot, they will create twitch stream where you can monitor your bots trades. The initial bot account ([https://www.twitch.tv/authenticbot44](https://www.twitch.tv/authenticbot44)) was created in Feb 2021 and seeded with 0.30393405 BTC ($10k USD at the time). As of today, it has 0.79744405 BTC ($26.2k USD)…for an increase of +162% BTC over 5 months!!

When I first looked at this, I thought it couldn't be true. So I looked at the trades since beginning of May 2021 when BTC was near 60k (it has crashed 40% in that time frame). Over that last 40 days, the bot has made 177 trades.

Keep in mind, 20% increase in BTC does NOT mean your account increased by 20% in USD. If BTC drops by an amount greater then 20% per month, a 20% increase in BTC likely means your account is close to break even. However if BTC can remain stable or increases, then your USD value will increase with the BTC growth.

As a day trader, I only make profits M-F. What I like about AuthenticBot is that it's trading for my 24/7. When I wake up, it's usually made a profit…sometimes small, sometimes big.

\- 165 trades were profitable (93%) vs 12 trades for losses (7%)

\- Average trade size was only 1.47% of the account

\- Average profit per trade was 0.00539 BTC (or $180 at $36k BTC/USD)

\- Average loss per trade was 0.0001183 (or $3.60 at $36k BTC/USD)

\- Average win:loss dollar ratio is almost 50:1.

\- **Average ROI over this 40d period was +0.69% BTC per day, or +20.7% per month (net of bot fees)**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW MUCH DO THEY CHARGE?

AB owners charge a fee based on monthly profits, so if you make BTC then they make BTC. They charge 30% of the profits they earned on your behalf. Yes it's a chunk, but you're not paying anything out of pocket. If they only earn a little, you pay a little. If they earn you a lot, then you pay more. **However, if you don't make any profits for the month, then they don't you charge anything and it's FREE.** So if they break even or lose BTC, then they worked for free for a month and you pay nothing. It's a shared risk model. They also have a minimum balance to start a new account. When they first started it was $10k USD, it's now $20k USD.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW DO I LEARN MORE?

They have a website ([authenticbot.com](https://authenticbot.com/)) but they primarily engage with users and interested folks via a discord server and operate mostly on word of mouth. If you're interested and are ok with the account minimum balance/fees, contact them via [authenticbot.com](https://authenticbot.com/) and they'll send you the discord link. You can join the discord server, ask questions and do your own due diligence. Again, costs absolutely nothing unless they make you a profit.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

TLDR

\- Fully automated bot that trades on your behalf 24/7, created by some guys in Germany

\- Bot trades on bybit exchange, buying/selling BTC futures contracts leveraging up to 10% of account

\- Over past 40 day period, it has averaged 0.69% per day or 20.7% per month (net profit)

\- Initial bot account seeded with $10k USD (in February 2021) with no additional funding now at $27k USD

\- Bot charges 30% of net profit - so you're only charged if it makes you a profit, $20k USD account minimum",1625171544,0,1

obsiq2,Linda_Clore,Tips for new crypto investors,"1. Ignore the “noise”

Many naysayers in the media and financial sectors may preach that cryptocurrency is simply a fad, over-hyped speculation, or even a pyramid scheme. On the other hand, a growing population increasingly embraces the financial prospects and practical applications of cryptocurrency assets. Both sides have loud voices and like to make a lot of noise.

This noise level is only expected to increase, as Satis Group predicted; To be a successful investor in this space, it is best to just buy and hold what you believe in (see tip 4!) while ignoring all the noise around you.

2. Expect the unexpected

However, significant volatility does exist in cryptocurrency markets which cannot be ignored. Experienced cryptocurrency investors are accustomed to huge price swings that you often don’t find in traditional markets. By mentally preparing for these unfavorable, and occasionally terrifying, investment performances, the intelligent crypto investor will be able to act rationally instead of emotionally in times of unexpected price drops.

3. Avoid a bad trade or investment strategy

A common mistake for beginner cryptocurrency investors is joining what is known as a “pump and dump group” Certain social media communities or ‘gurus’ may even promise investment tips regarding a particular coin. You should avoid these types of places at all costs; when travelers go down these roads, they don’t often come back.

The problem is that since derivatives trading is a zero-sum game, there is always a winner, but more importantly a loser. Unless a solid trading or investment strategy is in place, heedlessly following such advice is the fast track to losing your money to modern-day snake oil salesmen.

4. Perform your due diligence

In this modern digital age, there is even wifi on the path to crypto investing enlightenment, hence there is no excuse to make an investment with little to no understanding of the underlying asset. Almost every single coin has easily accessible whitepapers online. And just like having maps in the car, the savvy traveler must be prepared.

From the heavily traded to the most niche, resources such as the All Crypto Whitepapers will help any individual brush up their knowledge on potential future investments. If it is impossible to tell how the coin operates and more importantly, makes money, then it would be wise to seek another investment opportunity. From the biggest initial coin offerings (ICOs) to the most niche altcoins, this site will have you covered.

5. Don’t place all your crypto-coins in one basket

Common investment wisdom prevails when it comes to cryptocurrency investment: diversification is key. Just as financial advisors recommend taking positions in multiple types of stocks and other investments, diversification is also essential for any healthy cryptocurrency portfolio.

You’ve done your research, so now seize the opportunity to invest in multiple coins. As one example, you can invest across different sectors which serve different use cases. Just like it’s always safer to travel as a group then as a single person when you’re in unfamiliar territory, establishing a diversified portfolio will help you along your path toward realizing potential future cryptocurrency gains.

6. Opt for an alternative personal email

Using a regular email account places an investor at an unnecessary risk of exposure for a data breach. To overcome this risk, it is recommended to create a unique account just for trading, especially with added two-factor authentication password security. No matter what, ensure that two-factor authentication is utilized for every service that offers it (for example both your email account and your exchange account should require two-factor authorization to access). Likewise, make sure to use a dedicated two-factor application (such as Google authenticator, or Authy) as opposed to using text messages for two-factor authorization (these are susceptible to social engineering hacks).

Additionally, when setting up your accounts, be sure to select a unique username and password that has no personally identifiable information that would-be hackers could trace back to you.

7. Understand the uses for both cold and hot wallets

Cryptocurrency can be stored via an offline “cold” wallet or an online “hot” wallet. Ease of access makes hot wallets a more desirable option for the beginner investor. However, as convenient as hot wallets are, they are susceptible to being hacked, whereas cold wallets are not able to be hacked (if prepared properly). Ideally, it’s best to store cryptocurrency you plan on saving for a long time in a cold wallet, and keep only a small amount that you might use on a daily basis in a hot wallet.

Additionally, one common mistake made by many new investors is mistaking exchanges for wallets. Although it might seem convenient keeping everything online at an exchange, a common mantra you might hear others chanting goes like ‘if you don’t own your keys, then you don’t own your bitcoin’. And when you keep your digital assets on exchanges, you don’t own the keys. This can become important when exchanges go down, get hacked. Take the time to research different wallet providers. There are lots of great options available today.

8. Remain careful around mobile wallets

Trading or storing large sums of any cryptocurrency via mobile phone is simply too great a risk. Mobile phones are more prone to being compromised electronically or physically. Although convenient, convenience should not surpass the security concerns that abound with executing trades or storing assets on mobile devices.

Hopefully, these eight tips will help give you solid footing on the road toward crypto-investing. Looking for more tips.",1625165692,0,1

2nd Take: In last 10 years, Whenever June close with red candle , July gave jump of of 18%-24%. So if July 2021 follow same , we will see target of near $42k as per average 20% growth.

3rd Take: In 2021,month jump is opposite of last 10 years trend. Examples are:
-Out of 10 times, March give 2 green and 8 red months in last 10 years. But in 2021 March gave 30% jump that was opposite of Trend.
-Same April and May month have bullish cycles in last 10 years, but both month was red in 2021. As per this August and September can be bullish month for bitcoin in 2021.",1625164835,6,1

&amp;#x200B;

CME can't work with blockchain. LedgerX and coinbase built the full financial stack. Traditional finance does not do this. Trad fi uses common clearing exchanges, prime brokers etc. It's economically unfeasible and untenable to expect every crypto service to build a full stack.  

&amp;#x200B;

 The obsession crypto people have with the SEC is misplaced. Bitcoin is a commodity. There has to be common backends that allow systemic risk monitoring and public data. That's how tradfi works, and US gov won't allow any other way. This is nonnegotiable for having a domestic market that institutions use. Right now all major institutions do significant derivative related things offshore. 

&amp;#x200B;

This can't and wont last based on what the DoJ wants. You may not like the direction things are going, but this is necessary to mainstream adoption. Crypto is overwhelmed with fraud as it is. It's a net detriment to long term adoption.  

&amp;#x200B;

Re the mods-- You should not censor traders and legal researchers because you disagree with the government and hate futures. 

The mods here need to realize that being adversarial to regulatory talk is a zero sum affair. If you don't advocate for changes that allow modern institutions to participate we will not get mainstream hyperbitcoinization.  Shadow banks and hedgefunds trading on bitmex does not count, it \*is\* the problem. ***It's why congress is pissed.***

ocvpm6,serhr792,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Records Largest Drop in History,"
The Bitcoin blockchain has undergone its biggest ever drop in mining difficulty, as the network’s automatic stabilizing mechanism kicked in following a strict crackdown by China on the country’s cryptocurrency industry. 
 
Bitcoin’s mining difficulty plunged by nearly 28% at block 689,471 at 6:25 UTC. 
 
The adjustment marks the third straight decline in mining difficulty, the first time such a trend has happened since December 2018. On May 29 and June 13, the mining difficulty dropped by 16% and 5%, respectively, according to mining service provider BTC.com. 
 
What is Bitcoin mining difficulty? 
Bitcoin’s difficulty is measured using an internal score that began at 1 (when Satoshi started mining at the easiest level). It is programmed to increase or decrease incrementally depending on how many miners are competing on the network. It is currently scored at 14,363,025,673,659, down from 19,932,791,027,262. 
 
Blocks are added to the Bitcoin blockchain at a regular and predictable rate: 1 block every 10 minutes or so. Block time measures how long it takes to create a new block, but that pace can vary, depending on the number of miners on the network and the speed of their computers. When there are more miners competing to “find” the next block, and earn the 6.125 BTC reward, then those blocks tend to be solved more quickly. However, when miners drop off the network, leaving fewer miners to compete, block times can slow down.",1625309038,4,1

ocsix1,serhr792,The real reason why China banned Bitcoin.,"I hope to analyze the reasons for China’s Bitcoin-related policies to eliminate FUD against China.

Recently, FUD about China is often discussed in forums. China has successively issued a number of policies to prohibit the use of Bitcoin in China, including banning mining and banning bank card transactions in Bitcoin. Many people think that the reason why China is doing this is the decentralization of Bitcoin that is difficult to regulate, but this is only a small reason.

The biggest reason for China's ban on Bitcoin is carbon neutrality. China’s carbon strategy roadmap is to achieve carbon peaks before 2030, achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, and even initially achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. According to the Bitcoin Mining Council report on July 1, 2021, 56% of the energy consumed by Bitcoin mining is renewable energy. But in the past in China, although the specific proportion was not announced, the proportion of renewable energy such as hydroelectric power generation must be far smaller than this figure. This is not conducive to China's goal of achieving carbon neutrality. In order to achieve this goal, all industries need to make way for it.

Another important reason is the unprecedented chaos in China's cryptocurrency industry. I believe that if the Chinese people just invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum, the Chinese government will never prohibit the transaction of Bitcoin. Unlike the United States or Australia, many Chinese who invest in cryptocurrency don’t know what decentralization is, just blindly follow the trend to buy some unknown coins. Chinese investors lack the most basic understanding of the cryptocurrency industry, most people end up in bankruptcy. Only by restricting mining and restricting bank card transactions can China prevent these ordinary people who have been deceived by become parvenu from joining cryptocurrencies. The reason for the Chinese government to create FUD is not to suppress the price of Bitcoin, but to prevent ignorant people from losing money in the cryptocurrency field.

Finally, China's current development focus is still in the manufacturing or infrastructure fields. In China, finance or economy is still a very abstract word for most people. China's overall strength in the financial field lags far behind the developed world. Therefore, the current strategy of the Chinese government is to stabilize the economic foundation first, and after improving the people's knowledge and living standards, it will begin to develop at the financial level. Before that, it is necessary to ensure that China's overall capital flows to the real economy rather than various financial field. 

There are some misunderstandings about China on this forum. I do not comment on the policies of any sovereign country, but in ten years, we may see a China that actively embraces Bitcoin. Although China may still issue policies that have a negative impact on Bitcoin now.",1625293483,7,1

odtybg,Nasty_slutX,Bitcoin mining difficulty just fell by a record 28% — but will this help prices recover?,"Bitcoin has recorded its biggest mining difficulty drop of nearly 28%, but one model suggests prices will not bottom until October.

The drop is in response to the ongoing miner migration out of China and the subsequent loss of hash rate — and this could deliver a profit boost for the miners still at work.

Bitcoin has now closed its third red monthly candle in a row, meaning BTC/USD is now the furthest away from its stock-to-flow model estimates in more than two years. Data shows the world’s biggest cryptocurrency fell 40.36% in Q2… the biggest quarterly plunge in over three years.

Plan B said the next six months will be “make or break” for the stock-to-flow model, adding: “Even for me it is always a bit uneasy when Bitcoin price is at the lower bound of the stock-to-flow model.”",1625435788,14,1

Congratulations, dear ones, the future will remember you as the pioneers of the digital world. This is what I want to tell you is a personal opinion. 
In my opinion, Bitcoin is still the first way and like all other technologies, it is opposed first and finally matures with the acceptance of the general public.
I guess the higher the price of bitcoin, the less the price fluctuates, and this is the best tool for storing values.It comes to a standstill and solves the challenges that lie ahead.
I hope that the best inheritance we can give our children is bitcoin.Maybe then bitcoin will be a collectible like the coins of ancient Greece.But I can say with all my might that bitcoin never loses its value.

odtcya,VeronZ76,In the early days of Bitcoin ...,"
... how many coins could be mined in a day on a standard home PC?

I saw a guy being interviewed on a news channel the other day about Bitcoin.  Assuming he's telling the truth, he said he stumbled across Bitcoin in the very early days when it could easily be mined with a basic computer.  He said he was easily mining up to 50 coins a day but, given these were very early days for crypto, he didn't really know what he was mining (as in what they could be used for, potential value etc) so he placed no importance on it whatsoever.  So much so, he didn't retain the keys for many of his earlier coins Sad

He said he got back into it a few years back and is now a lot more careful about the crypto he has.  The guy could very likely have been a multi-millionaire by now.  Not sure if he's mining these days (doubt it) or buying/trading.

I find it surreal in a way that you can be sitting today deciding 'do I buy 1 coin for $50k?' whilst only a decade ago you could have been mining dozens of them, essentially for free, on your home PC!  Yeah I know that's all with the benefit of hindsight, however it makes me smile nevertheless.

I wish I'd stumbled across it 10 years ago",1625433775,5,1

oeuyon,notadviceatall,Thought Experiment: What is the maximum potential of Bitcoin in terms of Price?,"# Spoiler alert: $60 Million...

Here's the roadmap, or at least what I believe *might* be the roadmap:

1) The first goal is to hijack the market cap of Gold and reach **$350 000.**

2) Then we'll take on The U.S. Dollar, and reach **roughly $1 000 000 per Bitcoin.**

3) The next step is to grab the bond market, which is valued at roughly $100 Trillion. This would sky-rocket the price of Bitcoin to about  **$4 750 000** 

4) If Bitcoin swallows all the money in the world, including real estate, the stock market, the forex market, and the futures market it will reach somewhere in the **$30 to $60 million range.**

In other words:

**The absolute maximum potential of Bitcoin, in terms of price, is 60 000 000 USD.**

I wrote a blog post about this, which goes into the details of how and when this might happen. Read it here:

2nd BIG EVENT FOR THIS season on 21st JULY 
That is Elon musk and Jack Dorsey Bitcoin meeting which can result in some bullish news for BITCOIN resulting in price to go up from there .

So for me we might see BTC price to go down with this final release of Grayscale GBTC and it will be followed with expected positive event for BITCOIN ! 

Right now market is in control with bears so GBTC release can have good impact to lower the BTC price and to hit our low targets and then we might hear 2-3 or even more positive news in market that is what i am expecting and can have good bullish month of AUGUST .",1625574917,5,1

og0l7w,King_Bum420,I believe Bitcoin will have a market cap of $50 trillion or more one day. Here’s why…,"Bitcoin will one day have a market cap of $50 trillion. I believe this due to old money dying (baby boomers who love buying and holding gold) and the fact that roughly $70 TRILLION dollars will be passed down to heirs from rich mother fuckers to their spoiled cocaine induced rich brats…I’m sorry they prefer the term “privileged”…I apologize.

1. There’s estimated (per WSB) that $70 trillion dollars that will be passed down to heirs in the coming years.

2. Gold has a market cap of 11.458 trillion.

3. Bitcoin’s current market cap at the time of this writing is 638.59 billion. 
Current price is $33,331.40 

I believe that 30 years from now when the baby boomers eventually die, that no one will buy as much GOLD as they do now…and that the “new money” will purchase bitcoin, and put at least 5% of their total wealth in Bitcoin. 

Think of it like this…my best friend is extremely rich. Well…his grandfather is. Private jet. New cars. Trust fund. All that good shit. I believe that him, and rich kids like him will not buy gold. PLAIN AND FUCKING SIMPLE. 

New money will buy Bitcoin instead. Meaning that our current valuations are a gift if your bullish like me on bitcoin. So…like I said, there’s $70 TRILLION DOLLARS just sitting in a bunch of dusty old lady’s bank accounts. 

So I believe that gold will slowly wither away and the “new money” will be investing in real estate (rental properties, business, etc) and bitcoin as serious lifetime investments with their wealth. Let’s not forget about retail buying up and holding bitcoin as well, and the possibility of other countries adopting it as a currency…the possibilities are endless for bitcoin.",1625721330,64,1

When evaluating all of the properties of gold vs BTC, it is clear that gold was “grandfathered” into society today in terms of relevance. Have faith that over enough time, and it may take years, the global population as a whole will evolve to choose the most efficient store of value available given today’s technology. WE DO NOT NEED TO CONQUER FIAT - all that is required is that humans evolve to make the rational decision given the superior properties of BTC to not choose gold. The battle vs fiat is secondary. Have faith in weathering these storms that humanity will figure this out - if you really think about how we as a species have evolved over time, this is far from the least intellectually complex obstacle to overcome.",1625706675,3,1

I am not suggesting it would cause the entire crypto space at the time to suddenly crash and burn, but I would imagine there would be a significant impact to the very core of crypto.

Perhaps I am wrong, and I am not naive to think that Bitcoin can't lose it's position down the road, but I am certainly interested in understanding the impact it would have if it sort of ""disappeared"" like an AOL or MySpace.",1625697993,13,1

Just buying BTC:

Capital gains of $965,000 taxed at 20% long term capital gains =&gt; $807,000 spendable.

GBTC:

2% expense ratio compounded over 30 years reduces gains to 1/1.02\^30 = 55% of the actual gain of BTC. Meaning you're essentially being taxed at a 45% rate, even in an IRA, just in the form of the expense ratio rather than a capital gains tax.

I have some doubts, or maybe misconceptions.

In bitcoin I know that the cost of mining is increasing as you reach the limit of total coins.

I understand that mining is the validation of transactions. Therefore it would be correct to say that assuming an equal number of nodes (equal number of processing power of the entire network), the time per transaction would be increasing day by day.

And if so, then if suddenly many miners would stop mining, bitcoin would collapse, since it would lose a lot of processing power of the network but would still maintain the difficulty making transactions much slower making in practice very difficult to operate with bitcoins.

ohriau,primalfabric,7 Reasons why the Bitcoin Lightning Network is Growing,"**#1 Instantaneous Transactions**

Currently, bitcoin blockchain transactions take about an average of 10 minutes to confirm since that is the time every new block gets added to the blockchain by the miners. Depending on the fees, the confirmation time on average can range between 10 mins - 2 hours.

Through Lightning Network the transactions would confirm in a **matter of seconds** making them almost instantaneous.

**#2 Low Fees**

The bitcoin blockchain fees varies according to the market but usually lie in the range of $0.2 — $4 to get the transaction confirmed in the next block. This is not always the case, as we saw during the December 2017 price rally where the fees reached as high as $38. As adoption increases so do the load on the blocks and the fees usually go up.

With Lightning Network the [fees](https://1ml.com/statistics) range between 1–10 satoshi ($0.00008 — $0.0008) making them ideal for quick daily transactions.

##### #3 Less congestion on Bitcoin Network

Since the Lightning Network runs on ‘second layer’ without interacting with the main bitcoin blockchain, the bitcoin network would remain less congested making it more scalable for adoption.

##### #4 Cross-chain Atomic Swaps

Atomic Swaps links payment channels across different blockchains (cross-chain) allowing users to ‘swap’ their cryptocurrency into another without using third-party custodian services.

Cross-chain atomic swaps can occur in Lightning Network off-chain as long as both chains share the same cryptographic hash function. The transactions are 100% trustless, instant with negligible fees.

**#5 Security First**

The team behind Lightning Network takes security very seriously. There are protocols within the Lightning Network that are deployed to make sure payments are secure and not vulnerable to attacks.

Lighting Network uses Onion Routing to safely route HTLC’s (Hash-Time-Locked-Contracts, basically a conditional payment) within the network. Similar technology is used by Tor.

**#6 Active Development**

Developments within Lightning Network are very active. New features and upgrades to the software happen regularly and the team is committed to making Lightning Network into a secure, stable solution to scale bitcoin.

**#7 User-friendly Design**

The Lightning Network User Interface is designed to provide a seamless user experience. *Tankred Hase*, lead app developer at lightning, in an official [announcement](https://blog.lightning.engineering/announcement/2019/06/19/mobile-app.html) mentions:

&gt;*We’ve designed the mobile app to be approachable for a wide range of users. That’s why we began with a clean user interface and a goal to hide complexity and make the app more accessible to new users.*

Lightning Network may sound complicated if you deep-dive into the underlying technology and how it works but to an average user who wants to simply send transactions such information is not really of interest as long as they can send transactions easily and securely.

And governments are keeping it under wraps until last minute?

It's fairly obvious that with the proliferation of Bitcoin and crypto that banks have kicked up the R&amp;D on CBDCs, but some things still leaves me a bit curious.

Will they be based on any of the cryptos we currently use today? Will all currencies be worth the same? I'm aware that the Digital Yuan is already a common place in China through the Wechat app. Are we going to see a system like that? Seems a bit intrusive. And which leads me, will it be on a public or private blockchain? Today you'll be able to cash out your crypto and be given the amount it's worth in fiat and buy crypto with your fiat, but what would be the plan if they deny transactions with this new system?

Us westerners see Bitcoin as a luxury and mostly a store of value now, but it's highly possible that in a few decades we might see our need to switch to Bitcoin as a medium of exchange for goods and services similar to El Salvador, because the way things are heading and some of the decisions being made by a handful of governments (Looking at you UK for that Binance stunt), they'll all potentially become a third world countries if they don't embrace it.

Without getting to much into things or desires song everyone with my life history, I’m no longer willing to watch the world go by and work 24/7 for little to nothing except into an early grave.

I’m 27 and at the moment I have around £1500 in savings, but some of this must go toward something that happened recently, which leaves me around £980.

I’m going to take this and buy my first bit of Bitcoin, followed by buying £10 a month from here on.

I know this sounds like a little, but it’s all I can afford and that’s why I am doing it. I hope that It can either help me afford more later and be able to work less so as not to leave my family to early, or to help my children (if it can’t help me) when/if I meet someone to have them with.

I know this won’t make me rich, I understand that I don’t have enough to change my life in a drastic way, but if I can allow myself a few more years and not end my life after working my self to the bone for others to get rich and have nothing to show for it, it will have been worth it.

This week has made me look at life in an entirely new perspective and I know nothing will change for me tomorrow, but if I start small now, maybe, just maybe I won’t leave others with the financial burden of disposing of me, after working for years, for nothing! 

What we have here is a broken world, and financially I know my life can’t and won’t change. But my mindset can! 

I can start a new way of thinking, infect my friends, my family and hopefully make one other person look at life and our system differently.
If I can change one persons view around me, bring them to Bitcoin, then I have been a success because then I can say that I have contributed to the downfall of the corrupt and broken system that leaves so many of us with so little.

Look after your families everyone, stay safe, spend time with those you love, give advice to those your care about and help those around you when you can.

I’m going to join coinbase now and open my first ever Bitcoin account and take the first step in changing the future , if anyone has any good advice for me please let me know and any tips that you wish you had when you took your first step onto Bitcoin.

oirxk0,D4ILYD0SE,21 Million BTC in 50 years?,"So today I wiped my phone completely because I'm selling it.  This was after I transferred my videos, photos, etc to my PC.  It was only after that I remembered my crypto wallet was on my phone.  As of now, I'm not sure I've lost it completely, but it definitely got me thinking... for instance that one dude who had like 7100 BTC on a hard drive that he threw away years ago.  Unless he magically finds a way to locate that, that BTC is lost.  The 21 million BTC is now down 7100.  And I was thinking, what happens in 50 years?

In the next 50 years, any combination of the following is bound to happen.  Phones get wiped.  SSD/HD fail and die.  Phones get dropped into the Ocean/Lake/Abyss and are lost forever.  People straight up die without ever divulging passwords to their crypto.  Fires, floods, tornados...  In 50 years, is it possible BTC actually worthless because the supply has been lost for it to be a viable source of currency? 

I know someone is going to say ""supply and demand curve.""  But this is currency.  Unless the world is okay with trading in the 10\^-6 fractional btc range, I don't see it surviving.  Like... I created a crypto.  And there's only 1.  And I mined it myself.  So I am now the owner of that 1 crypto.  Is that 1 crypto now worth the value of the entire global economy?  Of course not.  Nobody wants it.  So sure, supply may go down supposedly raising the value, but I think that will have a similar effect on its demand as its ability to support itself as a source of currency without the global supply will also go down.

Anyways, thinking aloud.  Thoughts?  Really curious what others have to say on this.",1626098748,18,1

An online community can suffer from having too many rules. An overabundance of rules sends the wrong message to visitors and members.  They show that the community does not consider free speech to be important, and that there is only a limited range of topics that can be discussed or only certain ways of behaving that are tolerated. Especially with the libertarian values Bitcoin was founded upon, this is clearly not ideal.

In essence, the more rules you have, the more activity you restrict within your community. Rules are necessary especially with all the scammers and bots out there, but they should always be clear, concise, and as non-restrictive as possible.",1626098608,5,1

oirfm8,metalzip,Offline node + online node: how to receive and send - Bitcoin Core,"Hi, I have following security model

- only trust Bitcoin Core software
- computer OFF is always offline, it is not allowed to send out any information (besides the ~250 bytes generated from Core when I sendtoaddress from it)
- computer OFF can take in information in form of files (e.g. via read-only USB drive or such)
- I also can use other computer, like computer ON, that can be online, it can run Bitcoin Core too and it will therefore have the entire blocks store on it's disk and can record it to usb disk

How to

a) verify my account ballance on OFF node

b) sendtransaction from OFF node

The method that I know now is following:

- on computer OFF run two instances of Bitcoin Core, call them bitcoin-main and bitcoin-world (isolate them - other user)

- on bitcoin-main do getnewaddress and write it down

(some time later, when received payment)

- let computer ON sync blockchain (prune=0)

- copy blocks directory from .bitcoin on computer ON onto a large pendrive

- connect pendrive into OFF and copy-paste the blocks directory from pendrive into bitcoin-world ~/.bitcoin/ , then start this node

- connect the two localhost nodes, e.g. on bitcoin-main addpeer localhost:9888 to the port of bitcoin-world

- let bitcoin-main sync using data from bitcoin-world. it will fully verify this data, same as data from any peer over internet is verified

- now use getballance, listtransactions and sendtoaddress on bitcoin-main


Can this be simplified, especially skipping the part where you run 2 instances of node? 2 insntances are not so great for old laptops (memory, hdd space, cpu and all).

Ideally I would imagine to have option like

--add-external-blocks-source /mnt/pen/blocks/

that will work by creating a virtual ""peer"" that is added to my node, and this peer sends me all the blocks he loads form the files. Still, this would require to make sure that datafile-loading code is secure against the data being malformed in malicious way (I guess no one does that too much, since we assume it was written by our program anyway?)",1626097145,7,1

oiq0bu,Vairlee,BTC can only become an asset but cannot become a currency. Are there other reasons besides no endorsement of power and no inflation?,"The disadvantage of BTC is that it cannot be inflated, and inflation and deflation play a very important role in economic development. The fiat currency itself has a deflationary design, but it seems that fiat currency has never fully used the tool of deflation, and unlimited money printing seems to have become a consensus.

This is a very complicated issue. The Keynesian economic model itself is to allow inflation to last forever. There are human issues, social psychology issues, and economic and political issues. At the current world academic level, no one can fully answer this question. Inflation and the gap between the rich and the poor in the community, economic development, political choice, and the development of social productive forces are all unclearly related. If there is no inflation in this world, and only one asset can maintain and increase its value, then social classes will not flow, the gap between the rich and the poor will never change, and the productivity of society will always stop moving forward.

So I personally feel that the world needs assets that are always anti-inflationary, as well as a currency that is always inflationary, so that diversification of assets can maintain the orderly operation of society. If this orderly operation is interrupted, then it must be hkqg to welcome this society. If there is only one asset that neither depreciates nor appreciates, and the entire community has no benefits or risks, it can only be achieved by a communist society.

Who wants to clarify these complicated relationships? The next Nobel Prize in Economics and Nobel Peace will be his.",1626091980,33,1

Anyways here's the app : [https://coinhunt.world/](https://coinhunt.world/)

You basically walk around collecting keys and open free crypto vaults containing a minimum of around 284 Satoshis and 4600 Gwei each. Some people on the CoinHuntWorld subreddit report making around 10$-20$ per week in BTC/ETH at spot price depending on the length of their commute. Factor in the potential future USD value of BTC/ETH and if this doesn't give you a raging hardon then I don't know what will.

It's available on GooglePlay and as a TestFlight Beta on IOs (seems like the Beta is full for now from what I'm reading but it should fully launch soonTM).

You can only withdraw your BTC/ETH to an Uphold wallet so I suggest waiting until they clear out the current fiasco or until the devs add another option for withdrawal.

Here's my referral code if you want a free BTC/ETH vault to send you off on your hunt : [https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Wa1g50Eg5R](https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Wa1g50Eg5R?fbclid=IwAR3aakabG2wvldCS-CsEtU4RFy6lSwRv7ln8QYd6q4P5kA2tiWIusGCaILM)

Edit : What's the catch? Well you don't really know what they're doing with your geolocation data but plenty of other apps use that for free (ex : Google Maps) so might as well get something in return. From what I understand some retailers also pay to create traffic around their businesses (ex : McDonald's, Walmart, Target) so the app basically splits this with you. For me it's not really worth going out of my way to hit all the vaults around me but if I can scoop up some BTC/ETH to and from the grocery store sign me the fuck up!

I would also add that from a mathematical perspective, even if the amount you receive is relatively small, if your cost basis is 0 and you're not doing anything different throughout your day, your % returns are technically INFINITE. That shit keeps me up at night.",1626086407,2,1

At the moment, I have 500€ invested in crypto, which means if I want to buy a hardware wallet (\~60€) it would be around 15% of my investment. This seems a lot to me, so, I would like to ask, at what value/percentage do you guys think is it worth it to buy a hardware wallet? Besides, I'm also not sure at which values should I send my crypto from my exchange to the actual wallet, considering all the fees and whatever.

Thank you",1626252575,19,1

ok05c7,ODready,Why Bitcoin adoption would be good for the environment and make a better world.,"Food for thought... Hear me out. I'm sure I'm not the first one thinking about this, but as I see, if Bitcoin was the global reserve currency, one of the effects it would have on our world is that we would have less junk and useless stuff. Less plastic less trash and in general, people would buy less things and those thing would be things that is really needed. 

If people know they money will worth more over time (even if it's just by a little) they will not spend it on useless stuff that they don't really need. That would make entrepreneurers pursue projets and products that are actually useful or at least quality and valuable. 

Meaning that eventually production of stupid and useless junk would stop, and by time, there would be no junk (or at least t much less) that is polluting our oceans and environment.

It's basically the result of deflation instead of inflation. What are your thoughts? Would this be one of the results of adoption?",1626251882,5,1

Webull is a SEC registered, SIPC insured broker (up to $500,000 in securities insurance), known for being the biggest competitor to Robinhood and one of the biggest investing apps in the app store. They have awesome features and a really beautiful app/user interface. I would highly recommend the app to everyone interested in investing. They blow Robinhood out of the water in every single way possible.

They have a limited time promotion going on right now: Register an account with the link below and get 2 stocks worth up to $2300. 

For the first stock, you don't need to do anything. Just create an account using the link. To claim the second stock, you need to deposit $5 into the account. Once funds are settled, you can claim the stock.

If you're not interested in investing, i'd still recommend signing up just for the cash. You don't even have to use their app, you can just sell whatever stocks you get from the promotion when the stock market is open during the week and transfer the money back to your account. And then spend with whatever you want, or transfer the money to your brokerage of choice.

ojzhf1,xcryptogurux,EXPOSED: Tesla lost its carbon credits market in Europe so it's trying to create a renewable credits market by attacking Bitcoin mining,"I'm going to try to explain Elon Musk's seemingly ""big brain"" but actually pretty dumb gambit with regards to Bitcoin mining. Note carefully the dates on each development in the story.

Why did Tesla buy $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin?

Couple of factors - one short-term and one long-term.

**Short-term play** \- Tesla's production was halted due to supply chain effects from the pandemic. This is why there has been a lot of delivery delays this year. This meant that Tesla's shrinking profits from selling carbon credits to other carmakers alone wasn't enough to post a profitable quarter. So Tesla decided to buy Bitcoin and then sell some of it before the end of the quarter to make up for the shortfall.

[Bitcoin purchase ensured profitable Q1 2021 for Tesla](https://preview.redd.it/2cbuwb9xt4b71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f26f8d68c1e3d87def0783972627696905d5368)

**Long-term play** \- The reason for Tesla's revenue from carbon credits sales shrinking is that European carmakers are shifting focus to EV themselves, meaning they no longer need to purchase credits from Tesla to comply with strict emissions regulations in the EU.

[2020 was Tesla's first-ever net-positive year thanks to soaring carbon credits sales](https://preview.redd.it/4xyofb47u4b71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=821d0344237233cc0322cf0daa03bb0c0282e66f)

[But that source of revenue is now shrinking \(May 6\)](https://preview.redd.it/cqcxl5kbu4b71.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4121b24c5321d3530eb4e306d0da98193446a3f)

So Tesla now needs to make up for this potentially permanent revenue loss. What do they do?

**One day before Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin payments due to** ***""rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions""*****, Tesla applied for renewable credits certificate from the EPA.**

[Tesla applied for renewable credits one day before Bitcoin mining FUD \(May 12\)](https://preview.redd.it/bxtcrpigu4b71.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3a8106383a5b92051bde86f2136fdcc5f2932ab)

Unlike carbon credits, the EPA's renewable credits can be sold in the open market to ANY industry. Elon figured he could create a new renewable credits market out of Bitcoin mining.

Too bad for Elon Bitcoin mining uses 4x higher than the average share of renewables in the US (56%)

The dumbest part of all this has to be the use of ""and transactions"" because no incremental energy is used for transactions. This guy frankly has zero understanding of how Bitcoin works.

Personally, I don't think he cares to understand. Notice how he's trying to hijack dog coin and turn it into PayPal.

**Bitcoin does not benefit beneficiaries of the fiat pyramid scheme. Tax-dodging billionaires who get free money from the government making the rest of our money worth less are at the top of the pyramid and they're loving it!** ***(credit iTruth84)***

That right there is an attack vector for someone but not only will it take out the hash power, but it is likely that the media will blame Bitcoin for the outages. They will spew a bunch of bs about it's energy consumption and say that's why we have no air conditioning.  They'll say it's because of those damn greedy bitcoiners.  The public will believe them because they always outsource their thinking to ""experts"" and there will be an outcry.  Our politicians will attack bitcoin with anti bitcoin bills that contain extreme ESG compliance laws that attempt to subvert the bitcoin network by controlling the American miners.  Then if American politicians have a way of controlling all American miners while America holds over 60% of the hash... then that's not good.

&amp;#x200B;

I think all too often we think Bitcoin is invincible.  It's foolish not to think the state has plans to subvert bitcoin.

I'm not gonna share my full story but it's like many of yours. At first I checked all the time to track dips to deploy my funds. But once my money was invested the behavior persisted. I had no intention of how often to check, so it just kind of happened. Dozens of times a day. See green, be happy, see red, heart starts pounding and feel bad. All day every day. Very distracting!

I'll suggest the correct frequency to check the Bitcoin price is once per day. Never checking your money is irresponsible. Checking once a day is reasonable. And there's something magic about once a day. It gives you a small thing to look forward to and something to practice delaying gratification. Will you check first thing in the morning? Probably not, you'll want to push it back until later in the day. 

If you are in Bitcoin, you're going to have to delay gratification. It can take years to make significant returns or even be in the green. So you can wait one day to check. It's good practice.

Here is one reason why it probably won’t, and one you should be familiar with. 

Step 1) start an exchange. 

Step 2) sell fake BTC to anyone sending you real cash, and store it on an exchange based wallet.

Step 3) show the person they are now in possession of some BTC, despite them not having any. 

Rinse and repeat 2 million times.

99% of people storing their crypto will never pull out. Most keep it “safely” stored on your exchange. 

For the 1% that actually do want to cash out, simply use the money the other 99% sent you and purchase the BTC they wish to withdraw. 

To avoid too many people withdrawing at once, place strict withdrawal limits and in a worst case scenario, claim “technical difficulties” until demand dies down or until BTC becomes cheap enough that you can process the withdrawals. 

End result: way more people now think they own BTC than they actually do.
People trade all that fake crypto on the exchanges, and set a price that is mostly determined by all that fake BTC. 

Those that actually possess BTC set their prices based on what they see on these centralized exchanges, and thus, the market price remains heavily manipulated to the downside. 

All these centralized exchanges are essentially one big Ponzi scheme.",1626231423,41,1

Everyone has different risk tolerance levels, you need not model off this. Some of my friends are 80% exposed and 20% stables (aggressive yet safer). You all know me by now, I can’t sell my BTC because I want to generate that 1%/week yield with the strategy I’ve outlined in this post.   
Bearish targets are 24k, 20k and if that doesn’t hold 15k. I’m a buyer at all 3 levels, weights will depend on factors if and when that happens. The major resistances are 39k and of course 59k. Despite slightly trending downwards, volatility has sharply fallen off a cliff, take a look below at Bitcoin’s volatility index. I suspect an increase in volatility will arrive soon from this extended period of consolidation. I’ll go into more of the direction and how I plan to trade it next

&amp;#x200B;

**What trades am I making for Bitcoin?**

Short calls to generate yield is the main strategy. The occasional long put protection or long put spread will be put on during expected volatility (like right now). Additionally, I just started adding size to my August short 50k call position over the last 3 days. I think I will add a little more to it but not much more.   
**Quick Math:** 2 BTC @ 33k each is 66k. Target yield for August is 10k+ USD which is about 17% rounded (10k/66k). I have considerably less BTC on exchanges now and I am also transitioning to a much less management intensive trading style as it is Summer and I haven’t been outside in ages.

Just a thought.

To my understanding, Crypto is the people's money. Its value is that we as a community find it valuable. The more $$$ we put in it, the higher it goes.

The past year, we saw BTC price soar through the roof because everyone and their friends were investing $$$ into it. And then we saw a HUGE crash because everyone started selling it due to panic of FUD, Elon, etc.

Recently (2-4 months), I've been reading that a lot of institutional investors and ""whales"" are buying a HUGE amount of BTC at the $35K-$40K range. If this is the case, why haven't seen the price go up and why is it still leveled at the $35K-$40K range?

If billions of dollars are being invested into BTC by these commercial investors and whales, wouldn't that drive the price up?

okw60t,W944,Instant Gratification vs Long Term Potential,"Hey internet srangers, what would you do in my situation?

I'm not doing great lately; at work steady growing burnout state, I'm completely mentally drained now and can't even focus on and acomplish basic tasks. Went from being the best employee to the worst employee in 3 years. Need to fix this as I'm at a point that I question my job security.

So I took all my vacation days and got 4 weeks off approved. Great! 

But I can't stay home during 4 weeks, as I've been working from home for the last year and need a change of scenary to reset my brain.

Thus I had decided to buy an RV and travel for a month, maybe even work remotely from the RV afterwards until Fall, thinking that this will solve my burnout. 

Found a nice RV, settled on a price, called my bank, and they refused the loan because my expense ratios are too high. I'm spending over 1000$/mo on electricity for mining so because of that I can't qualify for a high amount loan, which is frustrating as loans are dirt cheap now. I can't also just shutdown the miners for a week and reapply as they want to see a few months of consistent low electricity bills.

So now the question is; do I sell half of my crypto stack to buy the RV? We're at a sideways market now and about half of what the top was recently so it feels like it's a bad time to sell anything.

I've convinced myself that I need the RV to travel and properly reset my brain to be able to re-become effective at my day job. If I lose that job, I lose the ability to have the cashflow to pay for my mortgage and electricity bill to continue mining. Can't let that happen.

But if I sell half of my stash to buy the RV today, I'm sure that in a few years that chunk would of bought me 2 RVs, a boat and a house, and that I'd regret having sold :) 

And that's my dilemma. Do I jeopardize potential future crypto gains in exchange of gratification today? Or I keep holding and because of that don't fully take advantage of my 4 weeks off and potentially lose my job because I didn't fix my burnout by the time I need to go back to work in a month.

Feels like I'm stuck here.

The obvious answer would be to do something else for 4 weeks but I don't see anything else that could occupy me outside my house for that period.",1626365900,6,1

I'm not an ""internet guy"", my son showed me Reddit some time ago. I didn't give much attention to it, it's not my kind of thing. Today I opened it again and found out there is a community here about Bitcoin.  


My story is that I ""bought"" it when it was cheap in 2013. I was selling my car to a friend of mine, he didn't have all the money to buy it, just a part of it. He asked me to split the amount in installments. I declined, I don't like installments. Then he asked if he could pay for the rest of the value with his Bitcoins.  


He explained for a long time what it was, and why it worked like money. At first, I didn't like the idea. But I wasn't needing all the money at that time, and he said he could buy it back. So we did it.  


He teached me to use it though I didn't really used it for a long time. It was just sitting there. Of course I heard the news that it was getting value. This same friend told me to buy a physical wallet to hold it. He said it was more safe, and I agree. I also like to have something that is not just in my computer.  


In the last years, I retired earlier. Every month I sell some of my Bitcoins to this same friend. Not any insane amount, just what I need for my family expenses etc. And sometimes some more when I need to buy something new.  


I don't live a live of luxuries. I have a good house, a good car. I pay for my children college and school and we do some family travels together. And I guaranteed they have a house to live. That's enough for me  


That's it, I'm not in any Bitcoin related community or discussion. I don't know how it works. My friend tried to explain me a lot of times. I know enough about it to use all these years. I know how to send, how to receive and I have my pass phrase in a paper well hidden.  


I read about how you guys buy and sell it all the time. I'm not any specialist and I might be wrong. But maybe you just need a little more patience. It took a long time for my Bitcoins to be worth something.  


Excuse me if I don't reply you. As I said, I don't really use Reddit  
Also excuse me if I made any grammatical errors, english is not my first language and I don't live in an english speaking country.",1626363585,95,1

oku5b1,OrganizedCrimeGuy,Litecoin is friend not food," As  we all know Litecoin was disappointing in this bull run so far. It  barely reached, or depending on who you ask because we apparently have  two ATHs lol, didn't reach it. Despite this, Litecoin is still our  favorite little Chikun to hate or love. Here are my reason to love it  starting with the newest information.

# FRIENDS NOT ENEMIES:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i2dur1ku0eb71.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06c0140abca0bceff4269a8044052b2071f89c89

Litecoin  has constantly been marketed as the Silver to Bitcoin's gold. I know a  lot of people hate this marketing, but it's what has stuck around and  will continue to stick around. Litecoin has continued to bea oscillator  of grandpa bitcoin, and their futures will follow the same path.  Litecoin has consistently been disrespected by BTC hodlers for being a  clone of bitcoin. The faster transactions, lower fees, and increased  coin supply isn't what makes litecoin better, it's what makes bitcoin  better. Let me explain. Bitcoin is obviously the og of every crypto  project out there. It's the grandpa of the family, the old man that  commands respect and will be the first one to say his opinion on  something. Litecoin is grandpa's annoying son who helps him pay his  bills online. What I mean here is, Bitcoin's fees and slow transactions  are not a discredit to the project, but a change of use case. The people  looking to spend Bitcoin would be better off making big payment amounts  like buying houses, boats, lambos, and jets. While litecoin is better  suited to SUPPORTING bitcoin hodlers with purchases like bubblegum,  condoms, and meals with your sister's best friend. We are a team guys.  We are the early adopters. If bitcoin succeeds, we all succeed.

# NEW ACTIVITY:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9mfcqf8v0eb71.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65fb12051a45f2747ccdee183a6c43324245d27f

The  fact that we have 4x the amount of ACTIVE addresses than we did 7  months ago, is astounding. 340,000 a day. Does this truly sound like a  dead coin to you? Do this truly show no use case? I'll let you decide.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n3yzgzhw0eb71.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2361504d2c532ed4bc2829f6441ede1f39d1407d

# PUBLICITY:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/di08b0tx0eb71.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5367ea7af504d0ee0607cf2452adbcc05421ad7

Litecoin  continuously makes appearances in places you would never expect. From  Nascar drivers to MMA fighters, litecoin is putting it's name out there.  I'll be the first one to acknowledge that Litecoin doesn't have the  apex predator of marketing teams out there, but it's impressive that  after 10 years of existence, we haven't failed like the thousands of  projects that have.

# GRAYSCALE:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eyifacoy0eb71.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a864e3610b48a20397d64e09ee8d1251b32d1045

If  you've been in the Litecoin Markets sub for more than 1 day, you'll  know this is the most hopium concentrated news that we expect will show a  big bang. Grayscale has continuously loaded up on LTC this whole time.  They bought LTC during it's $400 run, they bought LTC before and after  the spike. Money this big can afford to be wrong in some areas, but not  THIS wrong. I expect big things will happen in the future with  Litecoin's price, and the people that disrespect the Chikun might be a  little salty.

# The Fundamentals:

&amp;#x200B;

[Anatomy of the Chikun](https://preview.redd.it/vnr73dsz0eb71.jpg?width=610&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2749b618a560a0887cbe9e1b0d498189e6a8cec0)

&amp;#x200B;

* 10+ years of existence
* 100% uptime
* Fast Transactions
* Low Fees
* Available on every platform that BTC is on, even paypal.
* Institutions love boring, but working financial projects.
* Mweb, an optional privacy feature coming soon.
* Flare Network integration
* Many more

# THE FUD:

&amp;#x200B;

[Darth Lee meets Emperor Yang](https://preview.redd.it/eow1ui151eb71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb79e767681a2b327499bca1e94a53908dbd4b27)

And  finally to address the titan level fud that will never escape litecoin  until everyone in this generation dies, yes Charlie Lee sold fairly  mined litecoin. Whatever his motive was for doing so, whether you think  he is evil incarnate and scammed everyone or truly wanted to have  decentralized currency, it's up to you. But what we don't see is the  same fud being applied to other projects. Ethereum creator,  Vitalik and  ""managers"" premined over 70 million ethereum and sold becoming a  billionaire. How this isn't worse than selling your fairly mined coins  and tweeting that you were going to, is beyond me. That is not to say  Vitalik was wrong for doing anything! I would be Charlie Lee and Vitalik  in a heartbeat. But despite the reputation stain that hasn't left him,  Charlie has been working on Litecoin ever since. He has never left the  project, and is the main reason Litecoin is accepted on every platform  Bitcoin is. It's apart of the OG listings, and will be the only coin  with paypal that has privacy features.  I think Charlie has more or less  paid for his sins, and the fud will not change Litecoin's fundamentals  in 10 years.

Conclusion:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qs1ylm871eb71.jpg?width=269&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d2bc3ad5bcc360f78bee4da12dc314047100548

Bitcoin  and Litecoin are my biggest holdings in Crypto. I love the communities  surrounding them with every fiber of my being. We are the early  adopters. We are future Lamborghini holders. I really think that  everyone needs to take a step back, and ask yourself if you truly hate  Litecoin or do you just disagree with Charlie Lee, because I truly  believe that Litecoin and Bitcoin will surprise many people in the near  future.",1626359899,2,1

Webull is a SEC registered, SIPC insured broker (up to $500,000 in securities insurance), known for being the biggest competitor to Robinhood and one of the biggest investing apps in the app store. They have awesome features and a really beautiful app/user interface. I would highly recommend this app to everyone interested in investing. They blow Robinhood out of the water in every single way possible.

They have a limited time promotion going on right now: Register an account with the link below and get 2 stocks worth up to $2300.

For the first stock, you don't need to do anything. Just create an account. To claim the second stock, you need to deposit $5 into the account. Once funds are settled, you can claim the stock.

If you're not interested in investing, i'd still recommend signing up just for the cash. You don't even have to use their app, you can just sell whatever stocks you get from the promotion when the stock market is open during the week and transfer the money back to your account. And then spend with whatever you want, or transfer the money to your brokerage of choice.

olzxoj,jinxedit,Wondering about opening wallets across different programs?,"Hi, I am not very tech savvy but I have some Bitcoin. I've had a few different wallets over the years.

Well, I want to finally get organized. I decided to just open everything using my seeds on Wasabi. Most of these were wallets I initially created and used using Electrum. So it looks like I have all my wallets recovered, and they all seem to be zeroed out except one.

That seems right to me, I'm pretty sure I moved everything into the one wallet, but I'm wondering if there's any other steps I should take to make sure I am seeing the right balance. If I just entered the seed correctly and it came up with a wallet, that's correct, right? There's nothing else I need to do?

I want to just stop using all the older wallets and get rid of the seeds connected to them, which I have written on paper copies that are currently just cluttering up my desk. Just wondering if there's anything else I have to do to make sure I am checking my balances accurately before retiring these wallets for good.

I guess, we have 3 ways

1- to make ETH at a stable price not go high too much.

2- to make gas fee fixed price not effected with ETH prices.

3- to make coin for a gas fee, also with a fixed price, not goes up.

because making the gas fee so low and stable, will improve the business.  


this is just my opinion.

Back then the hash rate was around 10 exahash, it now sits above 100 exahash. If the hash rate has increased 10x then the security has also increased 10x which means one confirmation should be as secure as six confirmations used to be.

omy5xr,Argentino_Feliz,I am 100% convinced of $100k BTC this year," 

I have Glassnode subscription. I have been following the on chain metrics since the dip in May. I am comparing both on chain and the charts of the current sideways market to previous long bear markets and consolidation markets aka crab market.

At first in May, there was a lot of negative metrics like miners capitulation, whale and retail capitulation.

But since the middle of June, miners are accumulating, whales are accumulating, only retail is mostly selling but also the number of wallets keeps trending up. In long bear markets, this will not happen.

The current situation looks exactly the same as the middle part of 2013 and 2017. Some boring months and then suddenly the mother of all bull runs out of nowhere.

Remember that BTC was 2.5k around June-July in 2017. You wouldn't have believed it would hit 20k by December back then either. 2013 same story with a lot of sideways during middle of the year.

First it was Elon FUD. Then in the last 3 to 4 weeks, Bitcoin has overcome being banned by the world's most populated country. It only made a slight impact on price. Difficulty adjusted and now miners are relocating and coming back online with renewables.

Remember China also banned Bitcoin in the middle of 2017. These attacks never work on Bitcoin. It always makes Bitcoin stronger, so expect a raging bull run to start soon.

Bitcoin history shows that dip buyers have always won. Dip sellers just end up buying at higher price. So take your opportunity or you will regret later.

In 2013, BTC started in 3 figures and reached 4 figures.

In 2017, BTC started in 4 figures and reached 5 figures.

In 2021, BTC started in 5 figures and will reach 6 figures.

It's like clockwork. A mathematical miracle!

omxq35,rgnet1,"You hear about Lightning all the time, but did you ever use it? Just do it. It proves bitcoin is already able to be the world's payment network.","It's easy to become skeptical of pronouncements about massive new developments that are caveated with ""and the real world applications will get there eventually.""  For example, the Lightning Network as secure off-chain settlement to solve Bitcoin's scaleability. Always sounded reasonable, but many, many years have passed since initial proposals and nothing ever seemed here or stable.

Someone tipped me with lnbot the other day for a comment posted, and I thought as knowledgable as I've been about bitcoin for a long time, I have no idea how to claim something that is legitimately built on the bitcoin network.

So I do a little investigating for a Lightning compatible wallet. Critical for me is:

* open source
* non-custodial

Came across the usual lists of recommended wallets and dug deeper into Muun.  I am blown away.  Not only does it meet those two criteria, it's just simple, fast, and does exactly what I didn't think would be possible with LN - it makes it so you *don't have to think about it*.

I click ""Receive"", I click ""Lightning"" and just like any bitcoin transaction, you get a QR code and I withdrew my sats from the lntipbot. That's cool and all but what's important is how can someone get their on-chain bitcoin onto Lightning, so it's ready for its actual use case of buying coffee and whatnot.  I have to set up a channel right? Or find someone to open a channel with? I have to manage how long the channel's open? Invoices? Eh? Bitcoin's simplicity vanishes... but no!

Muun's whole philosophy is you get **one** balance. So I hit ""Receive"", then ""Bitcoin"", then I send like $10 worth to it. Now suddenly, my Muun wallet has a balance of the tip from before and the btc I just sent, no distinction. I don't know what's on chain, off chain, but **it doesn't matter**! 

I then hit ""Send"", ""Lightning"" and deposit $5 into the Reddit lntipbot. It works! I definitely didn't have $5 of LN balance, but it sends instantly all the same.

*This is how it's meant to be.* The security, distributed protection, and rigid scarcity of Bitcoin, but versatility to handle microtransactions globally. The only reason bitcoin is not every country's default currency is people's ignorance and the intentional or unintentional misinformation spewed by those with power to lose. 

It's worked since 2008. It works even better now. The technology is here. You don't need complex custodial financial constructs like ETFs and derivatives to own it as an investment and you don't need 1,000s of other pointless cryptos to use it for small payments. Try Muun or some other Lightning wallet and start using it. This just feels game changing, and it shouldn't have taken me getting a Reddit tip to figure that out.",1626637268,222,1

Generating 150 megawatts of renewable energy.,"Compass Mining, the world’s first online marketplace for Bitcoin mining hardware and hosting, has announced a 20-year commercial partnership with Oklo Inc., a California-based company that develops renewable energy facilities.

Oklo stated that its advanced fission reactors will be able to start supplying clean energy sometime in the early 2020s. In the first phase of the 20-year collaboration, Oklo intends to provide Compass with at least 150 megawatts of renewable energy.

Oklo is part of a wave of companies developing smaller reactors that they say would be faster and cheaper to build than conventional nuclear plants. Such reactors could be compact and produce a lot of electricity while emitting no hazardous pollutants. Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo said,

“We are proud to blaze new trails on the commercialization of our powerhouses by partnering with Compass in decarbonizing Bitcoin”

Are we ignoring what is right in front of us?,"I've been lurking this sub daily since February when I first became interested in actually investing in BTC long term (I did speculation trading in 2017...sold 3 BTC at below 3k). Anyways, I purchased $800 or so dollars worth the week before the steep price drop began to occur this yeat. I've DCA'd down to average it out but there are many more variables now, it seems, than there were in February that seem to be mentioned but their impacts ignored:

-Chinese ban..this time it looks like for good. They want their own centralized controlled digital currency to coexist and eventually take over the yuan. I have graduate degrees in Chinese Political Economy and there was NO WAY BTC was going to be allowed to thrive there. Mining for a time; Yes. It benefited the central government. When the population gets involved and starts gaining interest in obtaining and using a currency they have (the possibility) of no control over-it's game over for BTC in the PRC. 

-The US issuing it's own coin (USDT if I remember correctly), tied tot he US dollar with very little variation from it. Maybe 0.01 on a bad day. 

-Bukele in El Salvador will simply use the infrastructure of BTC to make their own state-controlled coin, just like the United States and China. I see comments here like ""the IMF got to him,"" or that ""he bowed down to international pressure."" No, he simply 1) will now will have a currency in which is controlled by the central government, which power resides primarily in Bukele. 2) I wonder who is going to own the exchanges and wallets that the coin works through? You all are rooting for a Trump-like populist figure. Many of you want to be long-term thinkers when it comes to the advancement of the abolishment of FIAT but willing to skip the steps necessary for the dream to come true. Look at examples of the 20th century and ""skipping steps"" and you'll notice a trend. It didn't work. 

-So called ""whales"" and accounts that control the most BTC, especially exchanges and now major banks control the most BTC at the moment. Only a finite amount of BTC can ever be mined. There is ALREADY a wealth disparity occurring. You think the BTC millionaires/billionaires who held since 2009/11 are here en-masse posting? I think I read a figure here that the average BTC ""HODLER"" here has about $1000 invested. Those who purchased in 2009-2017 are set. They can sell all their BTC now and make enormous profits. Newcomers, not so much, hence your interest in posting here. You have an interest, a need, for the price to go up in order to reclaim your FIAT investment, disavowing the point of BTC in general.

-Many on this site aren't even necessarily concerned with BTC's current ties to USD. That you believe in the political and financial statement BTC is trying to make. That's good, and honestly I agree with you folks. I so very much that dream would come through. But at the current rate I forecast it's just not happening. 

From my undergraduate and graduate degrees in relevant fields, I will tell you that governments WILL NOT ALLOW A CURRENCY TO BE DECENTRALIZED AND OUT OF THEIR CONTROL. They will shove FUD so far up your sphincter or put regulations in place (that benefit the wealthy and hurt the middle and lower classes) that that it comes out of your mouth. When the price dropped in February and March, all I read was ""HODL, HODL, HODL,"" though I don't quite see that anymore. People get excited if BTC maintains $34k for a day at this point in time. 

-This is all just my opinion and my own speculation that I've noticed and recognized from the past, both in dealing with BTC and in dealing with a major change in currencies. I think some more members of this sub should perhaps think about other sides of the coin and reevaluate your position on BTC, or atleast take a step back and become unattached for a moment to see the possible realities ahhead.
     
- I'm by no means an expert. Hell, I HOPE BTC hits 50, 100k by the end the year or so as I am holding a certain amount in cold storage, but I also am not blind to the realities surrounding it. My belief is BTC will not see a demand that warrants a 100k price point, The FUD I mentioned will be too great. FOX and CNN will deem BTC ""Buying the Crack"" or some stupid shit like that. Just, please, at the moment be smart, only invest in what you can REALLY afford to lose, and look at the variables presented right in front of you. States take action to increase power and wealth, and BTC goes against that, I think the world economy &amp; states involved in that economy are a great deal stronger than a single Cryptocurrency.

This question is purely as a discussion of how Bitcoin can prove to be better than what it is today and that’s it.

I think that if BTC mining process follows a first-seen-first-safe transaction mechanism with 0-conf, the transaction fee and waiting times can be brought down significantly than what it is today. 0-conf alone is dangerous but think if your payment becomes irreversible then you need not rely on confirmation if you make a payment to a merchant and that payment will become instantaneous (which will be confirmed at a later point of time, but due to irreversibility, is a hundred percent reliable payment with negligible chances of double spending).

omu9z9,foxy-agent,Is 10 minutes really that bad?,"I was a member of an online/ app-based bank for 5 years. I loved them! Then they were bought out by a new bank and the old bank accounts were converted over and the old app was EOL’ed. The new (X) bank and their app sucks (IMO), so I decided to switch to a different (Y) bank. I opened up an account with said different (Y) bank at the beginning of the month. A week later I started the transfer. X bank is headquartered in Alabama, and Y bank is HQ’ed in Michigan. I thought transferring my money would be easy, but immediately I had problems. Bank X had a $10,000/day limit to ACH push money to an external bank, but luckily Y bank has no limit to ACH pull money into my account.

On a Friday morning at 10am I tried to initiate a transfer of my funds from X to Y, but I could not select the current Friday to initiate the transfer. I had to choose the following Monday to initiate the transfer! On Monday the funds disappeared from my X bank account and I received confirmation of the funds in my Y bank on the next Thursday. This whole process too a week!

I realize waiting 10, 20, or 30 minutes to get into the next few blocks can be frustrating, and people bemoan their transactions taking so long when we just want to click a button and have instant confirmation. But I just had to wait a full week to move all my checking/savings in US dollar currency from one bank account to another.

I have rolled my sleeves up several times in working to get my head around Bitcoin and crypto in general. It struck me this morning as I was reading that it isn’t just the outpacing of the attackers, but the other security mechanism is the length of the chain in the cooperative nodes.

I am working on trying to create an accurate visual portrait of Bitcoin by breaking it up into its smaller systems. As I read and think through the currency I get a mental image from the various concepts, and I try to capture them while I can see it in my mind’s eye.

omtj03,Odbdb,Is this true? Can it be debunked?,"Saw this in another sub. Would like to hear some truth about it:



Core has rigged the game the same way legacy has.

By instituting a fee market with the blocksize cap they have effectively gamed the network to be a positive feedback loop.

1.	⁠⁠create fee market (institute blocksize cap, had nothing to do with tech capabilities really)
2.	⁠⁠fee market creates competition for transactions thus increasing the price of fees
3.	⁠⁠higher fees ensures hashpower on desired chain
4.	⁠⁠higher hashpower = more security. investors will always choose highest security to store value (hence the store of value narrative and the HODL narrative that decreases liquidity)
5.	⁠⁠more money flows into Core chain and causes fees to scale up with it therefore creating the positive feedback loop of rising fees and investment.

If you follow this logic to its end it will cause Core chain to become so expensive to spend on that only the largest institutions (governments and central banks) capable of using it. Sound familiar right? Then another transactional layer (FEDcoin, LN is a red herring) instituted for plebs to use that will be fully transparent and controllable (if you aren't using your money in an approved manner you are disciplined like Chinas Sesame Credit) by the USG and any other entity that has the access.

Edit: I should also mention that I have a suspicion that the Chinese miners were spamming the network to force legit transaction to carry fees. This would mean the miners are incentivized to not act in the best interest of the network as a whole so all of the Core model is fundamentally broken by the fee market.",1626624678,20,1

omsu0t,Adventurous-Ant-7696,A question I have to ask: Are we witness that Josph Schumpert's idea of “creative destruction” is valid and so blockchain technology makes our traditional banking system obsolete?,"  

A name that should not be missing when we talk about today's finance world is Joseph Schumpert, who was through and through fascist. He shaped many generations of economists, bankers and related investment strategies. One often hears the name Karl Marx or Adam Smith, but for the conservative financial world, Schumpert's main work, which is based on Marx's ideas, ""Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy"" (first published in 1942) laid one of the cornerstones of today's financial world, with the crazy idea of “​​creative destruction” –  a process of industrial mutation that continuously revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. The book is much more than a prognosis of capitalism’s future. It is also an overambitious defense of capitalism on the grounds that capitalism sparks entrepreneurship. It is the third most cited book in the social sciences published before 1950, behind Marx's Capital and The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith. Currently, on google scholar, he is top 4 of cited economic researcher.

Even Schumpert was a crazy bastard in his ideas about how capitalism is and should be organised in our society, he believed that capitalism would be destroyed by its successes, as he starts in his prologue “Can capitalism survive? No. I do not think it can. ""

To come back to the crypto world, my question is: Will and can blockchain technology change our economic system, to a fair spread of wealth in this world, or to fetch and carry capitalism as we have it now?

I'll share a brief story for my readers so that they can learn from it and not make the same mistakes that I almost made, which I feel is the single biggest risk in crypto. I recently got a new phone, and of course, traded my old phone in for 100 bucks or whatever they gave me. What I didn't realize is that my 2-factor authentication was tied to the old phone, so when I went to log into my BlockFi account after having a couple of glasses of wine, I couldn't get into my account. I tried the Google Authenticator with the new phone and my Google account, but Google gave me an error message when I did that. I had to use the recovery key that they gave me when I set up my account. I'm in. No big deal, right? Before it logs me in, something pops up with another recovery key, which I can't really tell if it's the same or not. I take a picture of it to be safe. The next time I log into my account, I realize that the old recovery key did not work and that me taking a picture may have been the only thing that saved me from losing all of my crypto. I withdrew all of my crypto from BlockFi after this and put it in the exchange-traded Grayscale Trust  at a discount to NAV to avoid becoming a statistic.

I don't know for sure whether I would have been able to get my crypto back or not. I've had friends lose hundreds of thousands of dollars of crypto by losing their keys to it. There's a guy in the UK [who accidentally threw out](https://www.thecryptocapital.com) over $250 million in Bitcoin. *The New York Times* [profiled a programmer](https://thecryptocapital.com) in San Francisco who lost over $200 million in Bitcoin as well. In the second case, the guy simply doesn't remember the password. There are two sides to this argument, the first that when other people lose the keys to their currency that it benefits everyone else, and the second is that if it could happen to you it's a ridiculous risk. In the end, maybe the biggest risk of investing in Bitcoin isn't that the price crashes, but that something happens to you or you forget your password and lose all your money into cyberspace. If anyone here has lost Bitcoin and is willing to share, please share your story in the comments, I believe my readers would benefit from your experience!",1626616574,8,1

1). Is there a way our government can just Create a cryptocurrency exchange and just adopt bitcoin as main currency. That way at least we can buy stuff online using bitcoin and they still get their tax as they include it in transaction charges.

2). Is there a way an exchange can be created and run in Zimbabwe but be registered with a foreign bank. That way our government will not have control. For instance, can a Mexican buy crypto and pay for it at an American bank.

op06h0,SatanicSpoon,Was the market crash 3 months ago organic or artificial ?,"I hear so many people saying it was a “natural price correction”. And while it is true that prices were in fact inflated, the price dip went way beyond what a “correction” is supposed to be.

The market did in fact panic, but I hypothesize that the initial shock was artificially created by a bunch of whales dumping coins into the market to benefit from said shock and buy up later at much lower prices (thus explaining the initial dump right before the crash).

I blame whales for many of the problems and flaws in the crypto market. Without them a lot of “price corrections” would go out of control as we currently see along with many other problems that would simply disappear or at least be mitigated.

The only good thing we got out of this market crash is that some companies finally started taking care of the whale wallet problem. Glad to finally see companies the likes of Genesis Pool banning whale wallets in their communities. Maybe other companies will soon follow suit and start putting some pressure on whale wallet action.",1626905061,11,1

oozcdb,itfwg,"Elon misunderstands energy use, block size, and block time for Bitcoin. The B Word response.","Elon, the energy cost from bitcoin mining is proportional to its monetary value. Mining is a competition where each participant is incentivized to spend as much money on equipment and electricity as it is profitable. This market will exist for any truly decentralized cryptocurrency. Other cryptos cost less to mine right now because they are worth less, not because they provide more transactions per block. Bitcoin started with just one computer in 2008, using a CPU to process blocks. It could scale back down to that size one day if people stopped valuing it and discontinued mining. The majority of energy used to mine is not spent on processing and recording transactions, it is spent on “rolling dice” for a chance to be the winner of each block and receive the associated transaction fees and block reward. Elon, your affinity for other cryptos with increased block size and block time may be functional for some nodes who have access to gigabyte Ethernet and abundant hard drive space, but that’s not scalable globally right now. People in many countries cannot afford multiple terabyte hard drives to store the entire blockchain. Currently, Bitcoin requires less than one Terabyte, and that’s after 10 years of use. The risk of such a change, to faster block times and larger block size is that we could see a choke point emerge with cloud hosting becoming the only way to support and participate in a larger blockchain network, as is the case for E, which relies on Amazon Web Services running Infura. E is not decentralized and will become increasingly political with proof of stake, if they are able to make that transition. The point of bitcoin is to overcome human systems that can be influenced by majority stakeholders, lobbyists, or law makers. Bitcoin is a responsive system that scales up and down, seeking out stranded energy, providing a new way to use excess energy globally.

Maybe, we can use some hybrid models in the transition phase to not totally loose control when one system fails.

oo1zxs,Psychtech79,The crypto wars to come…,So this is the problem in a nutshell.  China is coming out with their own crypto currency.  The unified forced submission of 1.5 billion people to that ecosystem will dominate the landscape.  Anyone who has ever played any online games with Chinese teams will tell you they only have one goal.  Chinese domination.  So we have team China in one corner.  In the other corner we have Bitcoin.  (Check yourself here).  Yeah we have the hundreds of alt coins and eth and all the different branches of the crypto tree.  But that’s the problem.  Chinas money will not be divided.  They will put everything they have into making sure their digital asset is on top.  So the whole time we are sitting over here jerking off on each other over what the next shit coin one hit wonder is going to be they are at war.  They are at war with Bitcoin.  It’s in the headlines nonstop.  Wake up!  Ditch all the alts and unify behind one coin.  But that’s never gonna happen.  And that’s why in the end when it’s all said and done we are going to lose.  Divided we fall.  Enjoy the ride.  Your choice.,1626787585,63,1

The millennials, comparatively speaking, have very, very little in savings and are deeper in debt than the baby boomers were at their age. The simple math leads me to strongly believe that there will be ridiculous government programs that will add ungodly amounts to the deficit by the time millennials reach their 60s.

This is in short my experience with the second node I bring to life (first one was decomissioned for personal reasons as I could not attend it properly).... now I have time.

As said in title, we were not preteding to route for a start, but as I'm now having some fun with it there is no excuse to not keep investing some more time on it and share results with those interested. After one month of operations here you have some numbers. I'm not really sure how I got here nor if this pattern is going to continue up or down, but anyway I think is interesting to share the details. You can ask me questions, I'll try to answer them.

You can find info on the node [here](https://1ml.com/node/029b81d1aaf177fa00c1c5796360163bfa98ee4d5d0daa54c6f510d9e237f376e9). Important to note that 2/3rd of the capacity of the node is Inbound atm, and has been like this for the last 2 weeks. All public channels.

So, since the node was born on June 19th, I have routed a total of 144 Tx with a total value of aprox 16Msats, through aprox 55% of the channels opened to the node (inbound and outbound). Most of the activity started to happen like 2 weeks ago, but the node routed it first Tx already on June 20th, so in the first 24h.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u75ks1o7wbc71.png?width=454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cc5d417c33cb51068d869816100f3c428881629

&amp;#x200B;

Most active channels are routing both ways as you can see bellow and they are routing normally mid-size (200k-700ksat) to very small amounts (&lt;10 sats).

&amp;#x200B;

[Here the split of sats routed through the channels](https://preview.redd.it/hvdje99bwbc71.png?width=1707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=729ee5d7ce2c1286960191989c142061099e080c)

&amp;#x200B;

[And here a Chord Graph representation of sats flowing thorugh the channels which is cool to see changing every day.](https://preview.redd.it/d3ppbergwbc71.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47f2e96851fcce2a96e113aac34c19641f7bf81d)

It have been very relevant for us to be very careful with sat spent on fees when opening channels or doing any kind of operation, one of the most important tools I guess for a LN operator is keeping an eye on the mempool to make sure you do any on-chain operation at 1sat/vB. In these days onchain can be even cheaper than some LN tx :P so find the moment for making loops in/out or opening new channels.

The situation may seem bear right now for those in the USA, Europe. But bitcoin is serving its true purpose in countries such as China and Argentina, it is becoming the currency for the people.

Regardless of what China posting how economy is doing well and recovering well. I can tell u food prices are going through the fucking roof in China. China GDP growth reported 20%, guess what prices of food went up by 50-100% for 99% of necessary items. Majority of the banks is banning any account associated with transferring of money into crypto exchanges. Crypto is almost the only reliable way of sending money outside of the country and holding as a steady investment. China built housing for 4billion people, and population is 1.3billion. It is bubble about to burst any time. The government controls the stock market, theres pretty much no way to make money from stock market.

My friend from Argentina say his country inflation is 50% every year the past few years. He buys bitcoin and send it back to his family monthly. It is only thing that is keeping his family afloat and not becoming dead poor. 

Inflation is killing a lot of the currencies outside of USD, euros. Bitcoin is already having its own bulllrun in those countries regardless of the USD price. It is serving its true purpose as currency of the people.

I've had a nightmare today with halifax so that's also Lloyd's and bank of Scotland that are no good for me. 

Long story short, it was held by the fraud team even though I've sent money to the same coinbase account many times. Took 4 hours and 3 phone calls lasting an hour each to sort. I even went into the bank with loads of ID and I couldn't even withdraw cash in person because my accounts were suspended. It's sorted now but I'm taking my money elsewhere asap.

On the other side if Amazon hordes wealth like they already do there will be much less bitcoin in cirrculation. While this may cause the price to spike due to rariety at some point bitcoin may become unusuable for smaller transactions due to limited quanity. If there are only so many coins in exsistance once they hoard so many there would be things that would cost less then the smallest unit and would be a possible death of the coin.,1627162562,46,1

Uniswap founder said ""Today, consistent with actions taken by other DeFi interfaces, we have taken the decision to restrict access to certain tokens through app.uniswap.org."" For those of you who don't know, the Uniswap token's only purpose is to have governance over the protocol. The founders stepping in and overrulling everyone else shows how pointless the UNI token is and how centralized the exchange is.

The top ""Decentralized"" exchange having it's founder step in should be huge news, right? Well, Coindesk did write an article, but it was very soft in tone and it did not make it on the featured page. Well, why would they try to bury this story? Answer: Conflicts of interest. Grayscale last week released a brand new fund called the Defi Coindesk Index (Grayscale and Coindesk are owned by the same person, Barry Silbert, so they really aren't separate entities). In that fund there are 10 protocols, but the Uniswap token makes up 50% of the weighting in that fund.",1627159062,2,1

oqwtzk,KosmosHD,What I learned from a Blockchain VP about Security.,"Background: I am a business consultant that is on a project to help a blockchain startup in Switzerland. Hopefully, this post is a good read for people interested in BTC security.

During lunch yesterday with my project manager, we had the pleasure to meet the VP of engineering Hybrid. I thought I knew all about blockchain before I met her.

I have had a keen interest in blockchain for a long time.  During our lunch, we talked about the security protocols of blockchain and these are some key moments that I remembered from her (not only about blockchain security but also about the normal security protocols that are used by the banks). I will try to keep it simple as possible.

Unlike traditional security (banks), which rely on access control to keep the bad players out of the network. She explained to me how the security principles completely change when it comes to decentralization. The decentralized platform gives 100% of the security responsibility control of the assets to the users because the security of the network now completely depends on POW (in the case of famous cryptocurrencies like BTC). In doing so, they don't require encryption for bitcoin traffic like they do in keeping assets safe in centralized bodies(CB). In CB it is secured encryption end to end.

She gave me this simple scenario. If an open-ended system such as a credit card system is compromised by hackers who have found a weakness around complex software layers (which also makes the system more vulnerable). They can gain complete access to the system and can compromise all transactions and payments(forging and modifying transactions). But also leak and sell customer data which leads to identity theft.

But thanks to the blockchain it is not the case. The transactions cannot be forged or modified. No identity theft and it cannot be used to authorize additional payments. Thanks to the blockchain you can even make crypto transactions through unsecured wifi or Bluetooth connection and you will still have fewer chances of getting hacked than a fully secured encryption centralized platform(CP).

The other point that I found interesting is that the traditional software architecture that you will found today is built upon a concept called RoT, the root of trust. As to protect the CP, the security architecture is traditionally built around RoT, and as time passes, and requires additional layers of security. New layers of security are built, that extend towards the outwards from the center. Now in doing so, these systems become more complex and result in bugs, which make the whole CP more vulnerable to security compromise.

At the bottom she said and I quote ""more you pay for a complex security in CB, the more it becomes vulnerable and harder to be secured.""

Secondly, For the first time in over a month, Bitcoin has broken above the median line of the bollinger bands, which is currently at $32,722. Once we break above the median line and sustain over it, we can see a test of the top level of the bollinger bands which is currently at $35,160 .

Thirdly, on the weekly chart we are in the process of printing a hammer candle which is a very bullish candle. The hammer candle is known to be a trend reversal candle and is generally found at the bottom of a downtrend.

My two best friends are highly intelligent and highly paid software engineers or something along those lines , they always acted supportive to me , yet when I spoke of BTC many years ago they dismissed me , and mocked me , they have no doubt always placed themselves far higher up the intelligence scale and in many ways they are , I concede that , but still now almost a decade down the line they still dismiss bitcoin , at this point I’ve realised it’s not even about btc it’s about them viewing themselves as more intelligent than myself , their egos won’t allow them to admit that I was correct on something in their field and that can’t be right they think as I was stupid a dumb lifeguard ...a clown 🤡, a figure of fun , I’ve had to watch their smug attitudes for years , privately educated at arguably the most prestigious school in the U.K. , they are intelligent there’s no doubt , which is why it’s so painful 😣, the main reason they disagree with it is down to them viewing themselves as superior to myself , which in many ways they are , but not when it comes to seeing the bigger picture .

oqv777,iCryptoDude,Borrowing Against Your Own Bitcoin Using Bitcoin Smart Contracts,"Just as you might borrow against your home or any other property by way of remortgaging or taking out a secured loan you can borrow against your Bitcoin. This doesn't necessarily have to be done with smart contracts but their development will allow the decentralisation of the technology which will in turn make it more competitive and frictionless.

Property is a relatively stable store of value that appreciates against the dollar due to its restricted supply and predictable rate of growth. Aside from inflation, the value of property has an average positive growth against the dollar over time due to population growth outpacing the speed of house building. Fiat currencies which have no such restricted supply or predictable rate of growth or inflation of supply, move in the opposite direction as their value is debased through faster and faster money printing. This is why it is common practice to take out a 10-20% loan against your property. The value of a house should consistently outpace the value of the debt over a given time period meaning that you can borrow against your own property for relatively low rates and will almost always be able to pay off the loan in full at some point in the future through the appreciation of your assets alone.

Bitcoin has the same, if not better store of value properties as real estate. It is limited in supply but is at an advantage when it comes to maintenance costs. It doesn't need tenants or a boiler! Its short term price action is currently considerably more volatile than real estate but when viewed over a minimum 4 year period (the supply halving cycle of Bitcoin) the trend is the same, these assets go up in value compared to the dollar consistently over timeframes greater than 4 years. Any 10-15% loan taken out against collateralised bitcoin in the past 10 years would have been repaid in full within a maximum of 4 years based on its price appreciation alone.

Drawdown needs to be factored in and is much more pronounced in crypto because of the volatility. Drawdowns of up to 80% means that historically collateralised loans amounts higher than 20% would have been at risk if they were made at the peak of any of the last few bull market cycles.

If you took out a loan of $50k against a house worth $100k and the housing market dropped by 50% you might lose your home as the bank would want to sell it before the price dropped any more so they could recover the $50k you borrowed. Luckily, the housing market does not tend to see such dramatic crashes in price very often and most people can borrow safely against their homes for a whole lifetime without being liquidated in this way.

Bitcoin saw an 80% drop after the previous bull market in 2017 so any loan above 20% would have been under threat of liquidation at this level of drawdown. That said, a 10% loan would have never been liquidated in any market since at least 2012. A plan to borrow 10-20% against your crypto assets with a 4 year repayment plan followed by another 10-20% loan against your collateral might be enough to secure financial freedom for yourself and your family within 1 or 2 decades. It’s pretty incredible.",1627150494,47,1

oqrcv3,_kr_saurabh,Bitcoin Is Not a Fiat Currency Competitor but Rather a Revolution in Your Very Relationship With Money,"The Bitcoin revolution continues to progress. Block after block, Bitcoin continues to move forward while staying true to its fundamentals. It cannot be otherwise, because Bitcoin's monetary policy is programmatic. There is no room for chance or human arbitrariness with Bitcoin.

That's why Bitcoin is so special. It gives incredible guarantees to its users.

In a world as uncertain as ours, this is priceless. More and more people are realizing this. As a result, people are coming to buy Bitcoin to take advantage of its monetary revolution.

### Bitcoin is not a competitor to the U.S. dollar or the euro

As the success of Bitcoin intensifies month after month, economists, central bankers, and journalists begin to denigrate Bitcoin in every way possible. As always, these opponents of Bitcoin use fallacious arguments that have already been proven time and time again.

Rather than attacking Bitcoin out of fear of this major technological disruption, these people should start studying how Bitcoin works. If they took the time to do that, then they would realize that Bitcoin is not a competitor to fiat currencies.

You read well. Bitcoin is not a competitor to the U.S. dollar or the euro.

Rather, the digital currency invented by Satoshi Nakamoto is a revolution in our very relationship with money. It is a major paradigm shift that will change your life forever if you choose to take advantage of the freedom this system offers.

### In the current system, your money is not available at all times

With the current monetary and financial system, you are forced to trust others to secure the fruits of your labour. You earn money that is in the bank. Banks do not even own all the money of their depositors at any given time.

If you want to know more about this, I encourage you to look at what the reserve requirement rate is.

It represents the financial reserves that banks and other financial institutions are required to deposit with the central bank. The reserve requirement rate allows commercial banks to save a portion of their income. It is therefore a safety net.

In the United States, it is the Fed that sets this reserve requirement rate.

At the end of March 2020, to better face the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed decided to set this reserve requirement rate at zero allowing banks to use more liquidity to lend money to individuals and businesses.

### Bankers and governments can censor you for arbitrary reasons

With a zero reserve requirement rate, if all depositors wanted their money back at the same time, the banks would be unable to meet these demands. They would go bankrupt.

This is a major problem for individuals who cannot have their money available when they want it. In addition to this problem of the availability of the fruits of your labour, banks, and governments also have the power to control and censor your transactions in the current banking system.

A government can decide at any time to freeze your assets for totally arbitrary reasons.

The problems do not stop there. The ability of central banks to print as much fiat money out of thin air as they deem necessary is problematic for the majority of the world's inhabitants. It keeps devaluing the money already in circulation, which deprives you of your right to save the fruits of your labour.

If you save money in the current system, you mechanically lose money because of the decisions of a minority of people who are not representative of the people.

### Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin to change people's relationship to money

These edifying facts led Satoshi Nakamoto to create a different system that belongs to the people:

 *“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.”* 

 Bitcoin was created to change the very relationship of its users to money.

Rather than being subject to the decisions of a minority of people, **Bitcoin puts each individual back in the** **centre** **of the game**. Bitcoin works for you and all its users.

With Bitcoin, you can save your money without fear. **Bitcoin's maximum supply is 21 million units, and that will never change**. No one has any interest in it. This gives you an incredible guarantee: 1 BTC of today will always equal 1 BTC of 21 million in 10, 20, or 50 years.

### Bitcoin is the truth of the people verifiable at any time

Bitcoin's programmatic monetary policy lets you know exactly what will happen in the coming months and years to the supply of Bitcoin. You won't get a nasty surprise when you wake up one morning. That's why more and more people are coming to buy Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a transparent system that allows all its users to audit their accounts at any time. All you have to do is run your node. **While fiat money is the truth of government, Bitcoin is THE truth**. This may sound presumptuous, but it is since anyone can check it at any time.

So there is nothing hidden with Bitcoin. All users have the right to check that the system is following the rules that were originally defined by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Bitcoin will probably never completely replace the current monetary and financial system. Many people will remain attached to this system that reassures them by leaving them in a comfortable lie. For the others, those who want to discover the unpleasant but liberating truth, Bitcoin will be there.

### Final Thoughts

Bitcoin will become the money of the Internet used by all those who have discovered the truth about the current system and want to take real care of their money future.

The hardest money in the world that gives citizens around the world power over their money. **Once you have the power over your money back**, **you will be able to live your life on your terms**. This is priceless in my eyes.

It's up to you whether you want to discover the inconvenient truth that will allow you to regain control over your money, or stay in a comfortable lie that will leave you under the thumb of a flawed system that will eventually collapse.

os4n5n,JustABrokeInvestor,"Things that have NEVER happened before, happen all the time","This is a quote that I read in the book “psychology of money” and I thought it might be valuable to share here, as I think some of its concepts can be applied to this sub and in crypto in general

The author calls it the “historians as profits” fallacy. Basically pointing towards times in history where something happened or didn’t happen and then applying it to the present in order to try to predict the future.

I’ve seen this in many forms from: “blah blah something something deathcross therefore we are now undoubtedly in a 3 year bear market” to “BTC has never had 5 green days in a row during a bear market therefore the bull run cannot be over!”.

These statements subsequently mean nothing other than maybe being able to make a better guesstimate at future short term outlook. Just because crypto in the past has followed a strict 3 year cycle doesn’t mean it won’t break out of that someday. Just because all cryptos price value are dependant Bitcoin now doesn’t mean one day it won’t change.

The short term price is determined by a lot of things; investors feelings, whales, FUD, catalysts, etc. All of these things are impossible to measure or predict. In fact the very nature of crypto itself is UNpredictable.

My advice is to be prepared for any and everything. Because things that have never happened before happen all the time

TLDR; don’t think that because of a death Cross or equally useless metric that Bitcoin/crypto must do xyz just because it’s been that way in the past. The past does not accurately predict the future so be weary of the “Bitcoin has never done this or that in a bear or bull market therefore….” Posts and comments

Lots of exchanges, such as Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase accept Yubikeys (and other hardware security keys). You can also use your YubiKey for many password managers, such as LastPass and KeePass.

If you go the route of a hardware security key then it’s a good idea to be aware of the downside: losing your physical YubiKey means losing access to your account, so it’s a good idea to get a 2nd backup key.

os1x53,GoingDeezNuts,$36 million PER DAY?!,"Let's use $40,000 per bitcoin to keep the math simple.  There are 900 newly minted bitcoins each day.  900 multiplied by $40,000 is $36 million.

So if a flat $36 million inflow of cold hard fiat is used to purchase bitcoin each DAY the price will do what?

Did you guess it?

That's right.   It will break even.  

So when bitcoin breaks even in price for the day at $40k that means the market cap is actually growing and the network security is strengthening by $36 million that day.   All while the price breaks even.


To put that in perspective If a company in the S&amp;P 500 were to announce that it was about to issue $36 million worth of equity (stock) everyday for the next ~20 years, what do you think would happen to its price?



Now last train of thought. In 2024 there are only 450 new bitcoins produced each day.   If a mere $36 million of inflows absorb that supply what will the new price of bitcoin be?

That's right. It would double to $80,000 per coin.  

So if we have already reached practically a terminal growth rate.   And only a mere $36 million of flat daily inflows continue for the next 3 years.  You will double your money by 2024.   

And thats if you never invested another dime along the way to $80k.  

Now ask yourself when we will reach $80k.  

I got Nov 30th, 2021.

If I'm wrong and it takes you 3.5 years to double your money instead of 3.5 months well that would be a travesty.",1627315733,30,1

Where we need to get to philosophically is that it’s not going to eventually become dollars, it’s just going to be bitcoin.”

“The mainstream sentiment is that bitcoin is about making money...and sure that that does happen, but really, what is at the heart of bitcoin is an ethos and a philosophy around decentralizing our ability to connect with one another in various ways, exchange value, and be owners and have more sovereignty in the world’s wealth, taking it out of the hands of the gatekeepers and the centralized banks.”

“Everything that we do has an environmental cost. There are externalities to absolutely everything. And just because something has an externality does not mean that it’s a net detriment. I think that bitcoin has a net benefit.”

So why aren’t more people doing this? Especially when Gray Scale is going to make this an ETF in the future.",1627312225,19,1

Don't do it.**                  

I can think of three BTC hardforks that have been successfully 51% attacked, and one altcoin that is ""superior technology"" falling victim to a month-long spam attack. When has this ever happened to BTC?              

The energy costs associated with bitcoin mining are the same costs that keep the network secure. And to the ""big blocker"" crowd, running a full bitcoin node with big blocks is prohibitively expensive in developing countries. On bitcoin you can run a full node on a raspberry pi and external HDD for 40 USD.                  

**How are you endangering other people by telling them to buy your altcoins?** Simply put, if your altcoin was made to do payments, nothing has outperformed bitcoin in the way of store of value or savings vehicle. So while saying, ""Buy my coin, it's better than bitcoin."" to newbies, you are telling them to literally lose money over the long run. Even more so because there are no financial institutions besides centralized exchanges that would be interested in buying or selling your altcoins. **Not a single altcoin that was created for payments has out-done bitcoin to this point in time, or managed to stay above its own price peak in terms of since 2017.**",1627440818,54,1

osx1yc,BalladOfARumbler,Is it possible to place buy-orders of altcoins that are correlated to Bitcoin's price?,"As many of you know, Bitcoin's price is often correlated to altcoins. If Bitcoin goes down, altcoins go down (of course, there are exceptions). If you are interested in buying Bitcoins, you can just set a (stop-limit) buy order at a support level and go on with your day and your order will be filled automatically. But for altcoins, it is more complicated. Altcoins often decline when bitcoin declines as mentioned, but not always the same percentage-wise.

So take this example; You believe the price of Bitcoin has reached a local top and will dip down to a support level soon. You want to take advantage of this dip and want to buy LINK at a discounted price when Bitcoin reaches the support level. This support level is a 15% decline from the market price of bitcoin today, but LINK will most likely not decline 15% as well, it will most likely decline much more. The problem is that you do not know how much a 15% decline of Bitcoin will affect the price of LINK, so you do not know before the dip what the price of LINK will be when Bitcoin reaches its support level, therefore, making it hard to predict/place a stop-limit order of LINK beforehand.

I have sometimes compared Bitcoins' price at the support level of interest in the past with the price of altcoins at the same timeframe to see if the price is somewhat correlated so you can get a hint of stop-limit order areas. This sometimes works, but often the same altcoin has different prices at different timeframes, compared to the past, even though bitcoin has the same price (are at the same support level but at different times) so it is not accurate enough.

Today I set alerts when bitcoin reaches a certain price (support levels) and then I place orders of altcoins in my interest at their respective market price. This is time-consuming and the apps are not as accurate to predict the price change and they fluctuate in time of the alert and the actual price of the exchanges. Sometimes I'm not at my phone or computer at that given moment the price drops to the support level which makes it hard to trade those levels.

My question is, is there an exchange, setting, a script, or something that allows you to place a planned and automatical order of altcoins in a manner of something like this:

***""When Bitcoin hits X price (support level); Buy Y coin at its current market price""***

Maybe someone has tips or other ways to simplify to do this? Maybe I have overlooked some settings on Binance, but I can not seem to find something like this. Or it may well be that I'm a retard and this is a simple and basic way to place an order.

Sorry for a long and maybe confusing question., I just wanted to show my train of thought of this peculiar question. Thanks if you read it all and hopefully I posted it in the correct subreddit.",1627425732,1,1

osvswj,ChrimsonChin988,Gradually then suddenly. I don't know the year but this is how it will happen.,"I'm just going to put this prediction out here 'cus why the hell not.

The year in which Bitcoin will triumph is the year governments/banks from large countries with 'respected' fiat currency (DLR/EUR) will start buying a small but serious amount of BTC. And it will start with 1 country/large bank triggering a crypto frenzy.

Why you might ask? It's basically a game of chicken. Fiat currency has infinite supply, BTC doesn't. At some point one 'esteemed' country, let's say Germany is going to hold 1% of its reserves in BTC. This will make a green dildo in BTC graph. Even more important, France for example, which uses the same fiat is going to FOMO. Their reasoning will be something like 'O shit, they are using their (and our since they use EUR as well) worthless fiat currency to buy BTC. Since the price has now gone up we can buy less. And they are going to be forced to also buy BTC for their reserves because they cannot afford to buy in at a later date and a much higher price, because compared to Germany they will be much poorer. It will be too risky for one party to NOT buy (Who would have thought the turntables..) This will 'cause a domino effect having all countries buying BTC. 

The dominoes start falling and fiat money will start losing its value extremely rapidly because at one point the German government basically signaled 'our currency is worthless'. This is why before this happens (which it inevitably will) governments will first do everything in their power to NOT buy any BTC because they know when they do, their control over the financial system ends. It will be a glorious day when all this happens.",1627421744,13,1

ou4wvx,CryptoIsMyMoney,Premiere! We have published our song about bitcoin and crypto for the first time! Why is the song like that?,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi guys!

**And so we kept our promise!**

We've been preparing a surprise for the crypto community... a long time ago. Here we promised that we would soon give everyone a gift!:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ocv4md/we\_are\_preparing\_something\_unusual\_soon\_just/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ocv4md/we_are_preparing_something_unusual_soon_just/)

 :) **Thanks to all those who believed in us.**

It was not easy for us.

I wrote the lyrics for this song in August 2020 .. but over the course of a year, I've been refining the lyrics.

And in July 2021 we recorded this song in the studio. I recorded a song with the one I love .. but ... but .. now we're friends. She thinks so)

But let's not talk about it...

&amp;#x200B;

I wrote about cryptocurrencies because I am sure that they are a new form of assets and money.

I wrote about the fact that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies give freedom from tyranny and protect against inflation.

&amp;#x200B;

The song lists many good coins, but ... it says clearly that we don't need to know all of them. It is important for us to know that Bitcoin is our digital gold. Sometimes in a serious and sometimes in a humorous way, I tried to show how cryptocurrency can be interesting and useful.

Famous phrases in songs ... famous companies in songs ... and most importantly - in songs - people who want to be free.

Thanks for the support! Thanks for the likes and reposts! Thanks for posting on twitter and facebook!

You can't even imagine how difficult it was for me to do it ... Somehow, if there is success .. I will tell you .. and show ...

 God bless you!

In the meantime, support this post with likes. And .. better listen to the song .. and .. write your review in the comments below. Thanks to!!!

Good day! Best regards, - Den

I receive income of anywhere from $20 - $100 USD fiat from each of several relatives annually at holidays and my birthday.   Being in a large family has its perks, as this alone totals roughly $700 fiat into the coffers each year, and I have amassed a whopping $4,206.90 in just 3 years because of an abnormally high contribution during my high school graduation year.

Given my risk tolerance, I have decided to invest in Bitcoin, but mother always said I was a crafty one, and I like to try to shift the odds in my favor if possible. My question, therefore, is this:  Is it insider trading if I buy roughly $4k in BTC the same day I submit several Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) that would tend to drive the price up?  For example, proposing to accelerate the pace of halvening events or even moving to a “thirdening” or “quarteringning” model.  I’ve also contemplated a reverse coin split in which the market cap remains the same, but each coin doubles in price while scarcity is algorithmically enhanced.  Admittedly there are details to work out, but even the speculation that might occur should the media catch wind ahead of a vote on such BIP could be a game changer. 

Of course, I thought it only prudent to first seek legal counsel here before moving forward with this potentially life-altering decision.  Thanks you for your support,
and please support these future BIPs and “get out the vote” should they come to fruition.  Not having a g/f is fine for now, but turning $4k into $8k or more “would be no lambo”, but might get me a car and a shot at getting laid by a 6 or 7.

ou2jbu,Kaizen_Kintsgui,A Bitcoin world is an inevitability.,"I've been here for a long time. This sub is where I first discovered BTC back in 2011.

It immediately peaked my interest because, at the time, I recognized it as something new, we've never been able to do what bitcoin does. I did a bit of research and discovered what settlement networks are and how they are the plumbing of the global financial system.

The world runs on a few simple rules. One of them, is that people seek out things that are faster and cheaper. By all accounts, bitcoin fits this bill, and beats the legacy financial system's settlement times and price.

We now have the lightning network that is offering faster and cheaper payments globally 24/7.

Despite this, I see this sub explode when a politician makes a negative comment about bitcoin.

It does't matter what politicians do. They are along for the ride and will succumb to their own hubris. Central banks have lost their monopoly on monetary policy and money creation. The banks have lost their monopoly on payment networks. Bitcoin averages 80% year over year. They have no hope they have simply become redundant because they are slower and more expensive. People will simply abandon them because bitcoin will be the more superior solution for global commerce. The war was over before it even begun so to speak.

With that, comes the collapse of the governments. We all see what inflation is doing at over 5% a month. The RRP market is pushing over a trillion dollars, which to me, looks like the system is on the verge of collapse.

When you see the disaster coming and you know what the solution is, you have a responsibility to the ones that don't. You have to drag them into the future kicking and screaming. You need to build a better world than the one we have. 

You won't be able run off into the woods to avoid the churn. We have to work together to build something that works fairly for everyone.",1627581196,10,1

This post is not to prove anything. It's to share my experience.

Most of my friends and colleagues are much above average income. A decent amount amount are decently wealthy. Most range from $150k-$250k/income year, average age of 35-42. Net worth including retirement is generally 250k, 800k-1mm, and a few around 2-3 mill.

So what is the opinion of most on btc?

Ranges from ""way to make money"" to ""going to 10k"" but most is ""tulips"" or do not care.

Why? As their income rises, they feel safe. For those that own assets, their rising house prices provide them comfort. I have noticed an increase in behavior based on a wealth effect-building pools, considering buying 2-3 mill dollar homes, expensive trips, designer clothes, etc. I do not hate on them-I did the same nonsense just a year ago, and heavily 2-3 years ago.

Some do not flex but I would put in the more ""I think I will be fine category"". I know people with hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash just sitting there.

What is going on in the normal economy reminds me very much of the summer of 2007...it's becoming absurd that there are no recessions, but I believe the downside of allowing it forces the governments/cbs to continue the support aka nonsense and printing.

So if it is the summer of 2007, where do I want to be? I want to be in the opposite place of where the majority is. This opposite place was gold in 2007. It is now, in my humble opinion, bitcoin today. The major difference is that the network of gold is so well established-the network of bitcoin is in it's growth stages.",1627580356,6,1

ou10er,RandomTask100,My slightly-modified DCA method," 

I believe in simple once-per-week DCA buys with the intent to HODL (because active trading will turn my hair gray and.... I'll probably suck at it). When I started, I was buying $100 BTC and $10 ETH every week on Monday morning at 12:01am. I was very strict. I was also paying 1% trading fees at the time (although the platform paid pretty good interest). Over time, I've loosened up on the way I DCA. Here are some tweeks that make HODL'ing a little more fun:

1. I make a limit order for (what I think will be) this week's low. For example, if the price has been bouncing around 30k all week, make a limit order to buy at $28500. Sometimes the order fills, sometimes it doesn't. If it doesn't fill, I'll change my limit order on Sunday night (to 99.9% of current market price, which usually fills immediately). I'm still DCA'ing because I'm only allowed to buy $100 per week.
2. I found lower fees. There's are platforms that offer .1% taker fees. If anyone is getting lower fees than that, please fill me in!
3. I withdraw some crypto from my trading account and put it in cold storage. I think of it as a way of diversifying. Cold storage is like the banana stand in Arrested Development.
4. I leave up to 1/2 my crypto in the trading account. This is my newest tweek..... and I really don't like it, but the interest is pretty good. I used to move everything to hardware wallet ASAP. Feels so risky to leave it online. Anyway, I missed out on the $60k spike. I really wish I would've sold some and re-bought at $30k. Next time that happens, I'm ready to sell high and buy-it-back low. I currently have limit orders to sell some at $80k and the rest at $100k (pipe dream).

\-Anyone got any tips for me?

\-What are you folks buying beside BTC and ETH? I was thinking of buying whatever #3 is......

\-Should I hold any stablecoin? Besides interest, I haven't seen a reason for me to buy...",1627576608,11,1

ou0bz9,primalfabric,Bitcoin is Real Money...it's actually more money than most fiat currencies that are in the market,"Whenever I get into a discussion about bitcoin and cryptocurrency with ardent fiat supporters the first thing they point out is how bitcoin is not ""real money"".

Given it does have a few limitations but if we look at the characteristics of real money, Bitcoin fairs pretty well, as a matter of fact, better than most fiat currencies.

Here's why:

**Scarcity:** A limited supply of a currency gives it value. Bitcoin’s supply is limited to 21 million while fiat has no cap.

**Divisibility:** Dividing any currency into smaller denominations is important for its economic use. Bitcoin and fiat both possess this quality.

**Transportability:** The ability to easily send and receive money is an important factor in a currency’s practical application. Contrary to fiat currencies, bitcoin can be sent anywhere and to anyone in the world in a matter of minutes *(for a fee)*.

**Durability/Security:** A currency needs to be strong enough to withstand any loss of value. Thankfully bitcoin used blockchain technology to operate which is much stronger than any fiat currency that ever existed.

**Acceptability:** For any currency to be useful it should be accepted by the people. This should not be a problem for bitcoin thanks to its \~100 million and growing users worldwide.

**Uniformity:** Currency needs to stay the same despite where it is used and for what purposes, this increases trust and recognition for the currency. This cannot be more true for bitcoin as it is a digital currency, which means it is the same everywhere no matter who is using it.

I advise everyone to additionally use a so-called [Brainwallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet). You basically store your private keys in your own mind.

I would then be able to double check and avoid a tragedy.

Or if I am sending funds to a vendor and expect their address to have activity on the blockchain, then I would be very suspicious if I got the 2nd warning (not surprised to get the 1st warning). And I could again double check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

ouya9d,polloponzi,Why This Company (Atomic.Finance) Left “The ETH DeFi Jenga Tower” To Build Over Bitcoin,"At the moment, most of the decentralized finance services run over the Ethereum network. In Bitcoin land, DeFi is almost non-existent. However, there’s a case to be made for it. And Atomic.Finance started the conversation with an article about how and why they pivoted from building over Ethereum to the arguably biggest challenge of building over Bitcoin. Since this is not a common case, we have to explore it. 

DeFi has a blind spot. Ethereum is admittedly fairly centralized at the nodes level, and creator Vitalik Buterin seems to be at the center of the project. So, can everything built on top of it really be considered decentralized? And take into account that Ethereum is the most decentralized of the Smart Contract chains. If we, for example, [look at the Binance Smart Chain](https://bitcoinist.com/get-educated-on-binance-smart-chain-decentralized-or-centralized/) the centralization becomes evident and undeniable.

So, is that the reason Atomic.Finance left Ethereum? Or is there more to this story? Let’s explore what they have to say

## Do We Really Need DeFi On Bitcoin?

The [article we’re analyzing is not new](https://atomic.finance/blog/an-atomic-pivot/). **Atomic.Finance** published it “*in the fall of 2020 when we first decided to make our pivot from ETH DeFi to Bitcoin-native finance.*” Their vision is that “*sound money deserves sound financial infrastructure*,” and maybe it does deserve it. But, does it need it? Isn’t Bitcoin alright just the way it is? Not if the aim is for “*Bitcoin holders to be their own banks.*”

&gt;*The reality is, nearly all financial tools and infrastructure for Bitcoin today do not share the same assurances as Bitcoin.* 

Atomic.Finance makes a great point there. If the market demands financial infrastructure and advanced financial tools, they should be on par with the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Furthermore: 

&gt;*If this trend doesn’t change, then we stand at risk of a future for Bitcoin that is dominated by large centralized institutions, and crypto banks. A future where nearly every Bitcoin transaction or financial activity is done on a custodial banking layer – again, without any of the assurances that define Bitcoin.*

## Why Did Atomic.Finance Abandon Ethereum?

At first, the company was developing cross-chain financial tools. That was leading them on a path that wasn’t aligned with their vision. Here’s where they savagely criticize Ethereum and most of the current DeFi projects:

&gt; *It was doing the opposite — taking sound money and slapping unsound financial infrastructure on top, bringing it into the Jenga tower that is ETH DeFi. Continuing to build in the ETH DeFi space would’ve likely forced us to launch our own token in order to compete — and there’s nothing that screams unsound money and unsound financial infrastructure than the rampant printing of money.*

**For the Ethereum die-hards, this will be hard to admit, but they make a good point. Are all of those tokens really necessary? Or are they a way to maximize profit? Or, better yet, are those tokens necessary to compete but not for the project per se?** Then, Atomic.Finance doubles down and throws another rock:

&gt;*The Jenga tower nature of ETH DeFi – attributed to not just a lack of care from developers but also the inherent security risks of developing with Solidity itself — that did not align with our standards for security.*

Is Solidity, the programing language Ethereum developed for smart contracts, a problem in itself? Or, worse yet, a security risk?

Building DeFi Over Bitcoin

So, the company abandoned Ethereum and started an exploration of “*the tools being built on Bitcoin. Would there be a way to build sound financial infrastructure natively on the soundest money known to mankind?*” Since the belief in Altcoin land is that Bitcoin is old tech that isn’t being developed, they thought they weren’t going to find much. They were mistaken. They found:

&gt;*Clear developer excitement for building on Bitcoin. In particular, for Bitcoin-Native and Lightning financial tools (LiFi). What was also clear was that while there are plenty of infrastructure builders in Bitcoin, user-friendly financial products that the average Bitcoiner could actually use were far and few between, outside of centralized and custodial products.*

That last phrase right there at the end, that’s what you call a business opportunity. Make of it what you will.

My intention is to catch black swan events and flash crashes while reducing my chances of buying during a peak.

If a limit order stays unfilled for several weeks, and the current price is over 20% the limit; I cancel it and make a new one using the current price

ouxm57,foxy-agent,It’s not a Ponzi scheme,"I sometimes venture out to other media sources to hear differing opinions on Bitcoin. One that I have heard repeated more than once likens Bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme: that the only way you actually make money at is is by selling it on to a bigger fool for more money, and it will be a game of musical chairs with who gets left holding the bag when the whole thing “comes crashing down.”

When I think of Bernie Madoff perpetrating one of the largest Ponzi schemes, what I take away is that none of his clients actually had anything to show for their investment in the end. They had a balance sheet, a piece of paper, that said they were getting richer, but there was no money to back it up. 

Buying Bitcoin, by contrast, leaves you with Bitcoin. On any given day the value of Bitcoin in your local fiat currency may fluctuate, but you still have the Bitcoin. As long as you hold your own keys, no one can take it away from you.

The power of Bitcoin as a financial tool, as a currency, as a vessel for transference of wealth, as a store of value, comes from widespread acceptance and participation. As the network continues to grow, adding more and various clients and people, the concept of it being a scheme seems more and more far fetched. It’s more like the beginning of a true grassroots, democratic acceptance of a currency, than one forced onto the people.",1627692577,95,1

oux9v7,just1nfraz13r,Look I’ve got a question about ATMs and transfers,"My understanding is it cost to buy bitcoin and then it cost to send the money to somebody else correct? When I’m at the bitcoin wallet and I wanted to send me to walk to my wallet, Why can’t I just enter in somebody else wallet address - the  person I’m doing business with instead of mine and then it’ll go straight to their account that way I don’t have to pay the transfer fees? Wouldn’t that be a smart option? 

The alternative would be sending it to my wallet and then I’ll have to send it to their’s and pay a fee correct? 

Is there any way of getting real time information on what fees are actually paying? Because I’ve heard of $60 fees for a transfer and I just can’t do that so I figured if I go to an ATM put the cash in and when it says what’s your wallet address if I just put in their address instead and then it goes straight to their wallet that would save me the fees wouldn’t it? I mean would it not that seems reasonable to me? 

But all these ATMs reliable is there any chance that the transaction wont go through? Do they all print receipts? The one I’m planning to use is CoinSource a CoinSource ATM. Oh God help me Please

But does that software actually match the software on the device? How would you have any idea? Couldn't they just slip a few lines into that code before shipping them out and not mention those on github? Are there independent reviewers that are somehow able to get a reliable full image and verify it completely?

And do any of the manufacturers publish their electronic schematics? If so do any independent reviewers sit down and test that with voltmeters?

If not verified fully, then I'm concerned that if I get one of these, there's a meaningful chance that it will turn out to have done something like assigning keys based on a known, deterministic RNG progression and that 5 years from now the developers will just crack all the wallets from a resort in Borneo and yoink everything.

Quick low down on my plans:
So I have been working towards this for a while now I got the external HDD and enclosure (3tb Hitachi NAS refurbished drive 7200rpm) last week set up and formatted. Today I ordered a mini pc (4gb ram, 64gb ddr memory, roughly 2ghz atom processor if memory serves correctly) my plan is to set up a node to run for about 16hrs overnight to when I'm at work. I'm also considering partitioning the drive two more times to establish a lightning node and link it to my router to work as a network storage and access to a printer because my router is a little off-hand and doesn't have a USB port. Hoping also to see if I can flash the router to a VPN as well for a little added security. 

So question 1 is does all of this seem feasible? Can I get one unit to run a bitcoin and lightning node safely?

For the more tech savvy is this going to be a gopls errand trying to essentially get this unit to operate as a NAS and a node or two?

Any other thoughts or helpful tipswould be appreciated as well.",1625277726,11,1

Dealers of digital currency all over the world welcomed bitcoin with open arms. But with the passage of time some drawbacks were detected in the currency. 3 major flaws were found in the digital currency which damaged the worth of Bitcoin.

[Bitcoin is supposed to be replaced by other crypto currencies](https://preview.redd.it/k8jdiuivew871.jpg?width=275&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2152a649181bb08049c74b29929f505d27452264)",1625274872,2,1
ocnzhf,simplelifestyle,"SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said a bitcoin ETF is overdue and argued that its prior rejections for such funds is a kind of double standard. The SEC should have approved a bitcoin ETF a long time ago, she said.","https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/bitcoin-etf-should-be-approved-already-sec-regulator-says.html

&gt; Hester Peirce is perplexed.
&gt; 
&gt; For years, the Securities and Exchange Commission, of which Peirce is a member, has denied applications by the nation’s exchanges and financial firms to list securities that track the performance of popular digital currency bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; Earlier — say, 10 years ago — concerns about potential market manipulation and liquidity may have made sense, but things have changed.
&gt; 
&gt; “That is the probably the biggest, the most-often-asked question that I get: When will the SEC approve a bitcoin exchange-traded product?” Commissioner Peirce said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday.
&gt; 
&gt; “I thought that if we had applied our standards as we have applied them to other products, we would already have approved one or more of them,” she said. “With each passing day, the rationale that we have used in the past for not approving seems to grow weaker.”
&gt; 
&gt; The SEC applies a “unique, heightened standard” to filings related to digital assets, she wrote in 2020. And she has argued that the agency is asking exchanges and would-be ETF sponsors for assurances beyond what it asks for traditional, equity-based products.
&gt; 
&gt; “People of a regulatory mindset, when they encounter something new like this, say, ‘Oh, wait a minute: The market for bitcoin looks a bit different than the markets we’re used to,’” Peirce said Thursday.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, she added, the bitcoin market looks more like an established market that has more participation from institutional and mainstream retail investors.
&gt; 
&gt; “So, I think the markets have matured quite a bit,” Peirce said.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite the currency’s volatile price swings, Peirce remains convinced that a bitcoin ETF is overdue.
&gt; 
&gt; It’s not the SEC’s job to approve or reject applications based on the merits of the investment itself, she said Thursday, especially if exchanges are meeting statutory requirements for protecting investors from fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; “Bitcoin now is so decentralized. The number of nodes that are involved in Bitcoin is large, and the number of people who have an interest in keeping that work decentralized is very large,” she said. “People should make their own decisions: If people don’t want to buy bitcoin because they think it’s manipulated, they shouldn’t buy bitcoin.”",1625274806,18,1

Blockchain only needs to be used in a small manner and with great precicion, namely to establish sound money. Because with sound money statism cannot exist and cause the problems it does today. I know it looks like facebook, banks, spotify etc. seem like culprits, but they are responding to incentives. Regulations are shaping their business models and reducing competition.

So instead of forming a permanent resistance movement by using blockchain for everything, just use it in such a way that the source of regulations is eleminated. Then we will have freedom, and then the world can begin to heal. Have a nice day.",1625270809,6,1

I get that less BTC in circulation theoretically makes the remaining BTC more valuable.  But at some point might it erode to the point that there is so little left it would become too rare to become a meaningful currency/store of value.  At some point (if it isn't happening already) there will be more BTC lost than is mined every day.  At that point the math dictates that the supply of BTC will forever trend toward zero.

If BTC becomes adopted by billions of people, that's a lot of opportunity for private keys to be lost/forgotten/taken to the grave every day.

It seems like at some point it would become a problem that has to be addressed.

Why? Imagine you hold USDT and the shit hits the fan, value of USDT starts to decouple from USD. What do you do? Sell BTC? That makes no sense.

As in majority cases there is no fiat ramp, just stable to crypto pairs, most of the 62 billion USDT will be forcefuly converted into the most liquid and widely available crypto - BTC, skyrocketing the price.

ocbe6n,Bitcoin1776,"On the 4th of July Bitcoin's difficulty is to get reset, and will be free of China mining - Oddly fitting.","I don't know if this is deserving as a stand alone post, but what the fuck, no one could have planned it better.

For those that don't know, Bitcoin block rate is currently running 1 per 20 mins, vs 10 mins, and is set for an extreme difficulty adjustment (to speed them up).

This will make miners more profitable, benefiting those who live in more free and equitable societies than China.

As miners become more profitable, they either sell less coin (put them on permanent hodl, as Michael Saylor suggests), or they expand ops. Either way, this generally is expected to lead to greater price stability.

Miners outside of China have been found to be using 56% renewable energy, per the report by Michael Saylor. As most countries favor new green energy alternatives, Bitcoin is set to continue expanding it's lead as the most green energy industry in the world, that's not exclusively focused on green energy.

Can anyone name a single industry that's more than 50% renewable? Outside of solar, wind, and geo farms etc.? I don't think so.

Even Tesla cars are dependent upon grid power, which in most parts of the world is less than 20% renewable, unless they come attached with a $50k solar / battery project (doubling the cost).

So all in all - on July 4th - more Bitcoins will be moved into the freer societies than was done in the past. More Bitcoins will be mined with more sustainable, less pollutant energy, than was done in the past. Bitcoin will excel as one of the greatest stimulants of computer technology and energy efficiency optimization, including expanded use of flair gas and volcano technology, optimizing energy output in remote locations and super energization, to maximize global efficiencies.

&gt; Super energization is a renewable issue, where one needs double the solar production vs coal, as solar must be stored, but coal is naturally 'batteried' and can be turned off / on with demand - all renewables require hyper production, to account for the lack of ability to adjust output with demand - necessitating massive battery production or sustainable storage, which is accomplished with Bitcoin.

So, while the market may be rocky - the start of the next cycle of Bitcoin is tops. Hold strong, and rotate assets from those that are peaking, to those that are robust.

The roots are deep, and Bitcoin is a mighty power.

For several years, I have been maintaining my overall well-being by taking US-made vitamins with the same brand since late 2013. I usually order them both offline and online, either paying it through cash, bank transfer or debit card. Until now, I am still a proud user of it. It really helped managed my anxiety and panic attack symptoms, as well as better sleep quality, extra stamina during the day, better metabolism, etc. 

But I stopped ordering online for 2 years. In order to save me some shipping fees, I have decided to order it from a good friend who is a licensed distributor of the vitamins product. 

One day, I realized that my stocks are almost running out. So I called him to meet me to get my vitamins. My friend already have a Bitcoin wallet, but never really used it. So I asked him if he liked to be paid by Bitcoin this time, and he eventually said yes.

So I just scanned his QR code and paid him the amount (there was zero fee because of using the same wallet). And there you have it, my first Bitcoin peer to peer transaction with my friend for the vitamins.

My good friend is happy, and he doesn’t mind me to use Bitcoin again to transact with him. I don’t mind how long will BTC be massively adopted, at least it’s good to spread awareness and advocacy about it.",1625235297,9,1

oc7zgu,VeronZ76,The fungibility of Bitcoin — Long Term,"
The fungibility of Bitcoin is a serious topic that requires discussion. I hope we all agree that having our transactions publicly announced won't make ours coins fungible. Truth be told, our beloved Bitcoin can't work same like as cash, because cash doesn't leave footprints. A dollar is equal with a dollar no matter who transacted it with who. On the contrary, a block chain analysis may be enough to prove that my inputs have a connection with a criminal activity and be censored for that. Recently, I read that despite the mixing and the coinjoining, there are centralized services that will decline “tainted” bitcoins.

It then comes to my mind that once there will be really less bitcoins left to be mined, like two decades later, the miners will have a better income from the transaction fees instead. Right now, every 10 minutes, 6.25 freshly mined and “whitelisted” bitcoins are brought into circulation. But, after we've mined most of them, we'll use the already mined bitcoins for our transactions.

If that's true, then the system will be filled with “tainted” bitcoins in the long term, as there'll always be criminal activity. Your thoughts.",1625224658,13,1

wanted about 4-5k worth of crypto 4 month ago.  
quickly learn about trading and started to trade very small amount.  
I liked it

2 week fast forward I see my self losing 15k and I try to close my account on Binance.

since there's no self exclusion program it was way to easy to reopen.

4 month down the drain I now see my self lose the total amount of 140k CAD and lost my job.

I could barely sleep and shower over the last 4 month watching btc price from the moment I wake up till just before I sleep. almost dreaming about btc.

no self exclusion program, no limit deposit. I most likely ruined my self in just under 4 month.  
I don't see my V shape recovery any time soon xD.  
Future trading should could with self impose limit deposit. I never thought once in my life I had the power to drop that amount of money on a online site in a 4 month period.

obay8z,randomlyCoding,Pondering on the long term viability of bitcoin,"Let me preface this by saying I'm pro-crypto in general and bitcoin specifically - be warned the rest of this is a bit of a downer.

As I see it there are two *big* issues ahead for bitcoin and one smaller one on the horizon:

0 - smaller one - with the current tendency towards lowering emissions and reducing energy consumption proof of work algorithms are looking less and less favorable. There are alternatives (proof of stake etc.) but I would guess a switch is off the cards due to the consensus vs split issues. The real humdinger with this is what happens when there is *enough* pressure on governments from climate advocates? Tax mining crypto? Crypto mining licenses with quotas? Neither seem reasonable both are well within the realms of what governments might try.

1 - big problem #1 - quantum computers will ruin the world... or so they say. The real issue here to my eye is when does bitcoin move to using something that is quantum secure and how is it agreed - I'm talking about wallets here, not mining. But to look at mining, if it can be done with a quantum computer (and I mean CPU -&gt; GPU -&gt; FPGA -&gt; ASIC... what comes next in this sequence) where does that leave us? The hash rate goes through the roof and there's no coins left to mine a week later (exaggeration but you get my point). I'm no expect but could quantum computers risk a 51%?

2 - big problem #2 - the final coin is minted. This is a ways off (about 120 years?) But as the end looms people will act. Does a limited supply mean a what we think it means. If supply doesn't go up, then price must? I'm not convinced. Once the miners are sitting only on the transaction fees there will be a lot less incentive to mine - roughly 10%? The real question becomes what it's always been with bitcoin - will it be stable? For it to get widespread enough once the mining is on the decline it will need to level off pretty hard - it doesn't really matter if its at $50k or $500k what matters is whether businesses can hold it for 24 hours without worrying about losing 5% of their value. Otherwise it just becomes a placeholder for cash - you buy with bitcoin, I instantly sell the bitcoin for the cash. Why wouldn't I just take card instead? Bitcoin is cool and loved by many - but does it make the cogs of business turn smoothly?

Just a few thought that keep me up at night. It helps to shout them into the deafening storm.",1625101723,12,1

The average family size is 3.15 people
(https://www.statista.com/statistics/183657/average-size-of-a-family-in-the-us/) 

The average savings per family is $49,555.00 
(https://usdebtclock.org) 

With the #'s above, the total savings by US citizens, is $5.23T 

Now do this same analysis for all nations whose citizens have access to trading on the blockchain, and you will get the total (possible) value for BTC, assuming all other variables go unchanged. For example, it assumes people don't change the amount they invest vs spend vs save. Another assumption is that people only view it as a store of value and not an ""investment"" ( which won't be the case until after BTC's price has been fully discovered, until then it will be viewed as an investment. After price discovery then it will become a stable store of value... or savings). And I know all these variables could/will change in the future, but I'm not going to discuss the future anymore, just a snapshot of today's BTC value.

The debate is how much of people's savings would/should be allocated to BTC. I know a lot of people would argue 100%. But I think that's unrealistic, and while it would be ""statistically significant(ly)"" better than USD over the long term, I believe Hard Assets such as Farmland, Potable Water Rights/Access &amp; PM's will play a much bigger part in people's savings portfolios, especially as the younger generations continue researching, learning and challenging the Boomer way of life... I believe this portfolio balance will return, because throughout history, it's always been the case until the 1920/30's when the Great Depression hit, then the USD was removed from the gold standard and became fiat, followed soon thereafter by high risk high reward from investing the fiat in the stock market. People really began to lose sight of what's really important, and what assets you really want to have beneath you when you fall down, or better yet, when a nation or global economy starts falling down... getting back to BTC, I'd say a reasonable assumption is 10-25% of savings is in BTC, putting BTC total value at $523B-1.3T, in the US alone. 

Now I know a lot of people are going to think the best response to this post is to argue my 10-25% savings in BTC comment, but really, it's not worth debating, until someone can come up with the total amount of savings globally...",1625096434,15,1

Only in US and Canada","There is a game that is currently in beta for residents of US/Canada named **Coin Hunt**  that is a geo-location game, like Pokemon Go, except you get paid to  hunt and you are encouraged to grow your community! The founder of this  game is the CEO of a popular cryptocurrency exchange named Bittrex. The  game also gets updates/events frequently, usually every couple weeks.  What I really like about this game is that you aren't really pushed to  leave your house everyday unless you want to overachieve on your  earnings, it is perfectly fine to stay home because there is passive  income in this game! For example, you basically earn about atleast $1 a day for just checking in to your home base in the game. Tens of  thousands of users are currently playing, and the most dedicated people  have earned maybe a thousand a month. I recommend treating it as a  marathon rather than a sprint though!

**Here is a link if you are interested in playing:** [https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT](https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT)

*Note: There is a Canada Day and July 4th event coming up with a free exclusive costume, don't miss it!*

**What do you do in the game?**  Since this is a geo-location based game, you have to go outside and  move around and the app will follow your position on the map. The two  things you'll find on your map is either a blue key or a coloured vault.  The colour of the key/vault represents its rarity, with the order of  common to most rare being blue-green-yellow-red-purple. You can use 10  blue keys to craft a green key, or 10 green keys to craft a yellow key,  so on. Depending on the vault you find out in the world, you'll need the  corresponding coloured key to open it.

Blue keys reward you with $0.10 USD equivalent in BTC  
Green keys reward  you with $1  
Yellow keys reward you with $10  
Red keys reward you with $100  (Event only)  
Purple keys reward you with $1000 (Event only)

The passive income mainly comes from checking in to the game, which as  mentioned before gives $1 a day, or from vaults that you've placed  around the world. So every user can place a total of 10 vaults anywhere,  and when any other player opens your vault you are rewarded 5% of the  resource. This means every 20 people that open your vault, would be the  same as you going out and opening someones vault (or your own). This  means if you place your vaults in spots that have a lot of user traffic,  you will be rewarded well without even having to leave your house. User  vaults can only be placed in areas where there is something  interesting, which includes stores and businesses, just anything that  isn't your house. Other people cannot place their vaults within 100 metres of your vault. This is why it's important to start playing while  the game is in beta!

**There  are also in-game costumes available in the game, with limited  quantities, which you will be able to sell in the future when the game  is out of beta.**

The game  is great, I really recommend starting as soon as you can! When you first  start the game, you start with 8 blue keys and you just need to find 2  blue keys to craft a green key and build your home base, and you will  unlock all of the essential features of the game.

**For Android:**  The game is available on the google play store, just download the game  and then use the link to open the application and complete the signup with freebies.

**For IOS:**   Apple does not approve beta applications on their store quickly, so  you must use TestFlight to download the application instead.

I'd like for someone to change my mind and provide me with information other than ""BTC is the original coin with the best reputation.""

I don't understand the BTC maximalist philosophy, given ETH exists. ETH has been making incredible headway with Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and similar L2 solutions, as well as the prevalence of DAOs, not to mention DeFi and the possible revolution of the financial industry, and LINK/oracle solutions, as well as The Graph as the central nervous system of the project.

BTC has BCH and BSV, both scams with zero use-case, which has come out of the project. I can't help but to see BTC as MySpace, and ETH as Facebook, which constantly develops and adapts.

I'm aware of BTC's lightning network, but hasn't that become a meme at this point? I own BTC, I want to see it succeed, I just don't understand BTC maximalism and why anyone would say it has more potential than ETH. Thank you.",1625086811,11,1

I think ... its something along these lines:

Supply = newly mined bitcoin + (sold or exchanged bitcoin) - bitcoin lost forever

Demand = Determined by market forces, psychology, FUD, greed, whales, etc

Price = Demand / Supply 

Increasing price positively correlates with increasing hashrate

Increasing hashrate positively correlates with increasing difficulty

increasing difficulty drives globalized decentralization to mine areas with cheap electricity

once the difficulty (which is ultimately driven by increasing price (demand / supply) reaches a certain threshold, miners are more inclined to take profits, sell their bitcoin and turn off their machines, thus increasing the supply and dropping the price, dropping the hashrate and finally dropping the difficulty

low difficulty will motivate new miners to turn on their machines and the hashrate will creep up again

odol9v,WatchYourCharts,"Suspicious 'Death' of Mircea Popescu, Large Bitcoin Holder (Fraud?)","Kinda sounds like the suspicious death of QuadrigaCX CEO Gerald Cotten.

Mircea Popescu, a controversial figure in the world of crypto, boasted one of the single-biggest bitcoin  fortunes and his amassed wealth in digital assets may be lost to the ether after his untimely death last month, some speculate.

Here’s what has been reported thus far.

Popescu 'reportedly' died off the coast of Costa Rica. Local news report say he was “swept away by the current and died on the spot,” during a morning swim in Playa Hermosa de Garabito, Puntarenas.

The New York Post reported, citing comments from Twitter, that the Romanian crypto entrepreneur’s death was confirmed by three women who knew him. (probably he paid them to confirm his alleged 'death')

Popescu was viewed as a pioneer in digital assets and one of the earliest adopters. An article in Bitcoin Magazine written by Pete Rizzo said that Popescu was known for starting MPEx, a bitcoin securities exchange, around the same time as Coinbase Global launched.

The Securities and Exchange Commission investigated MPex in 2014, and Popescu famously released a series of brash emails, where he defiantly questioned the authority of the regulator at the time.

Some estimates peg Popescu’s bitcoin holdings at 30,000 and he has made unverified claims that he held much more. At its mid-April peak this year, Popescu’s bitcoin holdings would have been worth nearly $2 billion but if estimates are accurate about his holdings they are worth about $1 billion today.

**What is unclear is how Popescu stored his crypto? Is it in a cold wallet, unconnected by computers, that only he holds the private key to, or is his cache of bitcoin held with a third-party.**

**Some speculate that he had a private key and that no one has access to it, which would mean that his fortune, whatever its size, is lost on the blockchain forever.**

“Access to Mircea Popescu’s reported $2 billion in Bitcoin would only be accessible through his private keys, whether he stored them digitally or in cold storage like a physical Bitcoin wallet,” Voyager Digital CEO Steve Ehrlich told MarketWatch via email.

“It’s unclear if anyone besides Popescu has access to those wallets,” he said. “If there isn’t anyone who has the private keys to his Bitcoin storage, those coins could essentially be ‘lost’ forever in the sense that they will just sit in his wallets without the ability to be liquidated.”

This may be a frustrating outcome for Popescu and those close to him but at least one person appeared to be trying to be optimistic about a tragic story.

Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital Assets, in a since-deleted tweet said that the lost coins ultimately make the current supply of bitcoin more valuable since there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence.",1625418414,3,1

I don't think it's likely but in theory it could be! Anyway suppose the following:

Suppose a secret longest chain is mined covertly without any transactions in the newly mined blocks. After a long time (say a year) this secret longest chain is revealed and all the transactions in that year are lost. Of course, this would be terrible for Bitcoin and the people involved. 

The only way we can defend ourselves against such an attack in my opinion is by keeping the orphaned blocks for some time (say a month) on disk after a (large) reorg. After this terrible attack nodes can then restart and demand that the last valid block should have a certain root hash, thereby making all the covertly mined blocks invalid. 

With this method, it's not necessary to change the Bitcoin protocol in any way (before the fact) and implement, for example, a maximum reorg limit. Implementing this feature would render a 51% attack practically impossible. What do you think?",1625417588,15,1

odne95,lilgalois,Bitcoin Sentiment Analysis on Twitter,"The last months, a friend and I have been doing a project on **Sentiment Analysis**, focused on Twitter data and searching for correlations and causality with Bitcoin price. In this post we present our results. We though that some of you may like them. 

**If you don't want to read the whole post and just want a TLDR** or visuals, look for the plots downwards and for the conclusions. :3

**Introduction**

Something we've seen a lot, is people using the mean sentiment as the input for the correlation/prediction. Some examples of this can be found on [BitcoinTweet](https://bitcointweets.com/admin/dashboard)or [BittsAnalytics](https://www.bittsanalytics.com/sentiment-index/BTC). There are also some projects in Github such as the one from [CyberMetalPun](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/reddit-cryptocurrency-trading).

After trying to use the same method for a while, we found no good results using it directly with price. Using it against percent change may be a good idea, but we are not looking for short-term analysis or prediction, so we leave this to whoever wants to try it.

**Idea**

After forgetting about the mean, we though about developing a more precise formula. The formula needed to fulfill some rules:

1. The amount of tweets must affect the sentiment. There isn't the same sentiment if we have 1.000 tweets than if we had 1 million, even if the sentiment of the million is a little worse.
2. The interaction between tweets must affect the sentiment, but not in a linear scale.
3. Average sentiment must be represented in some way.

The resultant formula was

[Sentiment formula](https://preview.redd.it/lf3k384bn7971.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12ce69924169c24127c68b6f04ae8dba436f0bb)

were **P** is a set of messages, **m** is a tweet, **s** is the sentiment, **l** the likes, **T** is the total number of tweets and **M** represents the average value(in this case, **M\_s** is the mean sentiment and **M\_l** the mean likes). The likes are counted as 1 + actual numer of likes.

**Data**

The data we used in this exploration were \~51 million scraped tweets from 2014 to May 2021 which mentioned either Bitcoin or BTC.

Duplicated tweets in the same day were filtered as spam since we kept having tons of repeated tweets from bots. They only represented a small fraction of tweets, but we preferred them out of our data.

We also used the minute to minute price of bitcoin in the same range of time, extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data) and Binance API for the last data. The gaps in the kaggle data were filled by copying the last non-zero value.

To extract the data we have implemented a software which can scrap the data from twitter and display some metrics in a dashboard.

[JABA Dashboard](https://i.redd.it/i16wtiqxv7971.gif)

**Method**

We have grouped the data on sets of half-hours and applied the formula to it.

For the sentiment analysis, we have tried some libraries, but Vader with custom lexicon seems to be the best analyzer right now.

**Results**

This is the result of applying the formula. We have also added the volume of tweets to the plot for reference.

[Linear Price, Sentiment and Tweet Volume Plot](https://preview.redd.it/s4n9y7kop7971.png?width=1347&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17f9d6a4e9cf75c3ac95186109271ca60f8f3aa0)

This is a log version of the plot

[Log Price, Sentiment and Tweet Volume Plot](https://preview.redd.it/ta0p3etqp7971.png?width=1321&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=baf9638a96521aa4a5edf785d3485437db3f00b7)

The correlation matrix is presented here

[Correlation Matrix](https://preview.redd.it/9vsh1jv0r7971.png?width=321&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b294d06fce4d571ac1bc57e8e545eec408381fea)

We can see that out metric is actually a more correlated variable than Tweet Volume, from where we can imply that the Sentiment sum is a valid metric for the Bitcoin market state. 

From the plot we can see some facts. The first is that the metric doesn't do well on short term volatility. The second one is that the metric seems to be a good macro metric from where we can detect Bitcoin price - Social Sentiment anomalies.

As a secondary result, we have also analyzed the correlation on shifted sentiment over price to see if there is some causality on them. What we could see is that the correlation maxed after 18, so we could say that ""sentiment was an indicator of the price of the next 18th hour"". When the sentiment was smoothed to avoid looking for spikes, the results where inverted. Correlation maxed 10 days prior, or, 'Price was an indicator of the sentiment of the next 10th day'.

**Conclusions**

We have found a good measurement for sentiment on Twitter and found that there seem to be a double causality between the sentiment and the price. The sentiment affects the price in the short term(18 hours), but the price affects the sentiment on a longer term (10 days). 

We have also implemented a program to scrap tweets, analyze data and plot it in a customizable dashboard.

**Code and Repo**

The code of this and the repo can be found [here](https://github.com/futotta-risu/JABA). The notebook of the metric [here](https://github.com/futotta-risu/JABA/blob/main/GlobalSentiment.ipynb).

**Future ideas**

Right now the formula is simple enough and works, but we aren't sure whether it is the best performing formula or whether it could be fine tuned with some hyper parameters, so parametrizing the formula and improving it is one of our main goals.

odlykw,SailingforSilver,Question/Strategy: Setting up Bitcoin automatic daily purchases for off peek hours.,"Ok, I’m considering setting up a daily purchase thorough an app. It mentions the purchases I’ll be made at the same time of day.  (And I’m assuming I establish this with my first order placement)

I’ve noticed that on a weekly basis some of the other coins I trade tend to dip down during the weekend and then pick up during the week. 

Also some of the more aggressive limit orders I place tend to trigger while I’m sleeping.  

My question is:

From your experience is there an hour or hours of the day that Bitcoin trades light? 

I’m in the New York (+5 hour) time zone.  And I am trying to figure out if it’s worth waiting until 4-5am to initiate this reoccurring purchase. 

My rational is two fold. 

1. I wonder buying during Off Peek hours will result in cheaper fees and faster confirmation times.

2. Having my purchases trigger more often during a lull in the international trading shifts (after hours) might possibly improving my cost average. 

Is my logic sound? Or am I way over thinking it?

everything was going good until the massive crypto crash in june when bitcoin managed to go to 28,000$, initially i went long at 31,000$ at 50x margin, cuz the weekend was over, and it would normally like every week pump back up, i had invested about 40% of my total money, into it and forgot to put a stoploss, a hours later i come back to my computer to see btc touches 29k, and i had a risk of about 89%, and binance decided to eat up the res 60% of my money to prevent liquidating my amount, now since 29k was the ATL, just so i thought, the son of a bitch managed to go to frikin 28k and bam!, lost all my invested 15,000 invested inr in the crypto market

I would like to hear about the situation with bitcoin and taxes in your countries.
I think it would be interesting to hear different experiences and compare results across countries.
Of course, I understand that in some countries you can't declare bitcoin tax.
I'm not interested in these countries but the ones where it is possible to declare and pay bitcoin tax.
I will start first.
In Croatia, several years ago we received clear instructions from the tax office on how to file a bitcoin tax.
In short, we must lead FIFO and if we can prove that we held btc funds more than 2 years, than we don't need to pay tax (long term investment).
If we have kept btc funds for less than 2 years, we pay 12 % tax plus surtax.

Is there a way to read the original white paper?

I guess thats the point of stable coins, Why doesnt BTC have a stable coin backed up by BTC; kind of like how they back up mortgages.

Will it only be used for investing/speculation as long as its price is this unstable? Can you imagine a normal acting like bitcoin does?

ogs4h8,-Corey_Dakota-,Killer answer to energy FUD - home heater mining bitcoin,"I was thinking of all the “bitcoin uses too much energy” FUD and and came across this project: [https://heatbit.com](https://heatbit.com) \- basically, an at home electric heater that mines bitcoin. Then I realised it’s not the “bitcoin uses 60-70-80-whatever % of renewable energy” that should be the answer to the FUD. The renewable (mostly hydro) used for mining would go into the grid anyways, so, even by using renewable energy bitcoin mining is increasing the total energy consumption globally. But something like these heaters is when bitcoin mining has no extra energy consumption, THAT is the powerful answer to Musk et al

The idea is definitely not new, I’ve seen quite a few people doing the same DYI style. But DYI is for the active&amp;techy few, don’t think it can be a mass movement. Having an easy to use device that my grandma (and grandpa) would use could actually gain enough volume to make bitcoin mining properly eco-friendly, consuming **NO EXTRA ENERGY &lt;== THAT’S the goal we should target.**

I liked the idea and even posted their video here before (can find it easily), clearly the more hardcore members of our community would prefer a bare bones S9 or whatever other miner but I’m just thinking how cool it would be to take the mining away from the large farms and make it a mass movement with grandmas&amp;grandpas participating.

You can see I’m very excited by the idea, even thinking of investing in their current round. Filled in the info on their website, fingers crossed they’ll approve me. 

Right now I’m not yet sure about two things:

1 Will there be enough to heat in the Southern Hemisphere during Northern Hemisphere summer? If not, the large mining farms will still need to exist, just have more competition in winter

2 This is a new device and maybe not all the specs will be as described. But finger crossed... this will definitely be good for bitcoin

ogryn3,KamleshBhoopal,Which Countries have banned Bitcoin so far?," First, there are those who are excited about the [potential for blockchain](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/10/26/4-reasons-bitcoin-could-hit-10000-and-why-its-stil.aspx), the digital and decentralized ledger that logs virtual currency transactions in a secure and efficient manner without the need for a financial intermediary like a bank. Enterprise customers are showing plenty of interest in blockchain, and since nearly all are open-source networks, it would make altering logged data practically impossible. That makes blockchain particularly secure. 

 Finally, we can't argue against the role emotions have played in sending cryptocurrencies higher. The fear of missing out on big gains has perpetuated consistently strong buying in bitcoin and other digital currencies. 

 However, bitcoin's ascent hasn't been without some notable speed bumps. Because it's not backed by a central bank or government, it's frowned upon in certain countries. For instance, earlier this year China outlawed initial coin offerings, which often involve exchanging bitcoin for newly issued virtual currency. The economic giant also announced the closure of domestic cryptocurrency exchanges. While it hasn't outlawed bitcoin, China has made trading or owning bitcoin a real challenge for its citizens -- and bitcoin is banned for banking institutions. 

 

Some countries that have entirely banned bitcoin:

1. **Bolivia:** Back in June 2014, the Bolivian central bank officially banned any currency or coins that aren't regulated by the government. Included in its list of examples was bitcoin. Bolivia's central bank also prohibited its citizens from denominating prices in any currency tha its national institutions haven't previously approved.
2. **Ecuador:** Not long after Bolivia's central bank banned bitcoin, Ecuador also removed its welcome mat in July 2014. The country's National Assembly of Ecuador banned bitcoin and other digital currencies while laying the framework for the creation of a new, state-run currency. In other words, the government has the permission to make payments in electronic money, but other digital currencies, like bitcoin, are banned for its citizens.
3. **Kyrgyzstan:** In July 2014, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic made it crystal clear that using bitcoin, or any digital currency, as a form of payment is illegal. The only legal tender in Kyrgyzstan is the som, the country's national currency. The Kyrgyz National Bank cited that bitcoin's lack of governmental backing makes public or private regulation almost impossible. 
4. **Bangladesh:** Bangladesh also followed suit in September 2014. The Bangladeshi central bank cited bitcoin's lack of a central payment system as the reason behind the ban, which it believes would allow people to be ""financially harmed."" Long story short -- if you're caught trading in bitcoin in Bangladesh, it could lead to legal trouble under the Foreign Currency Control Act of 1947 and the Money Laundering Control Act of 2012.
5. **Nepal:** Though it might not be a well-known fact throughout the country, bitcoin is illegal in Nepal, according to Kedar Prasad Acharya, the deputy director of Nepal Rastra Bank. The Nepalese government banned bitcoin on account of not being able to track its transactions, and it has gone so far as to arrest individuals suspected of trading bitcoin.
6. **Morocco:** The newest ban, coming as of November 2017, was in Morocco, which ironically came just days after domestic digital services provider MTDS announced that it would accept bitcoin as payment for the first time. Like the other countries before it, Morocco's central bank cited ""a hidden payment system that is not backed by any financial institution"" as its reasoning for banning bitcoin and other digital currencies.

A cryptocurrency, or crypto, is a digital currency that can be used to buy goods and services, but is secured but uses an online ledger with strong cryptography that makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. The most popular form of cryptocurrency is Bitcoin.

Now, I understand Nano came to be in a situation where smart contracts were not such a big thing, and there were no ""swaps"" and there were no staking/lending/liquidity pools, etc. People want more from crypto and that's OK. But I'm not OK with freakin' SHIB and SAFEMOON having a larger mcap than Nano. I'll never be OK with that. For the love of all that is holy, SAFEMOON should not be a word any of us remember in two years.

Sure, there were two major incidents, both occurring in the bull runs, the exchange exit scam crap and the spam attacks now. And sure, it was shilled here relentlessly. And people hate shillers. But how can a coin's main fault be ""it's fan base is annoying""??

I have a BIP39 12 word mnemonic phrase I've been trying to crack using 3rditeration BTCrecover. I got a machine with 44 gb RAM, 44 core processors and 24 worker threads running my most recent efforts on an Ubuntu 20.04 OS. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did manage to get the token file to work but it still keeps crashing (in python it reads killed23456) and I know I'm close to getting the desired results. At first I used Windows 10 but it didn't play well and crashed multiple times. 

&amp;#x200B;

My current token file looks like this. I can further refine and lock down words if needed.

\^1\^1stwordlocked  
\^2\^2ndwordlocked  
one word is known out of 4 spots  
7th and 8th words are known but unsure of order  
\^9\^9thwordlocked  
\^10\^tenthwordlocked  
\^11\^eleventhwordlocked  
\^12\^lastwordlocked

My current argument is 

 python3 seedrecover.py --no-dupchecks --mnemonic-length 12 --language EN --dsw --no-eta --tokenlist ./seedtoken.txt 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone got advice or insight to prevent the crashing or a new method of approach? I'm here all week.",1625793565,5,1

oeljkv,JeffGDoubleE69,It’s not worth risking a 5-6 figure gain over a few thousand dollars,"For a bit of context, I sold out of all my stocks in May after seeing Bitcoin drop from its ATH. Since then, I’ve been waiting on the sidelines to buy in. In that time, my would-be stock positions have risen 20-30K in total while I’ve been sitting on cash waiting for the right moment to buy into Bitcoin. 

I recently decided to say fuck it and pull the trigger on BTC at 33K. It dipped as far as 28K, and a part of me is kicking myself over the few extra .1 BTCs I could’ve owned for the same $. However, the way I look at it, if this is really going to 100-150K within 1.5 years I’d have to be mentally ill to risk those types of gains over a few thousand per coin. And, if I could time the market like some god, I would quit my day job and just become a billionaire overnight buying weekly options. 

I think this is a really good price for Bitcoin and it still remains an asymmetric bet. Yes we could even revisit prior cycle’s ATH of 20K, but that’s highly unlikely and represents a 35% markdown from current prices. On the other hand, there is a very high probability of a move to six figures, representing a 200% gain (at least). 

Everyone has their own timeline and when to invest is their own decision to make. However, I feel pretty good about my decision to buy in recently. I’m no longer checking prices every 5 min, because I know even if I was wrong in the short term, it’s not by enough to worry about, and it’s not permanent. 

Also, I bought btc at 8K in 2018 and held it until 2020 when I sold at around 11K. It does hurt to have to buy less coins for 3X the price, but it’s also an irrationality to let your past positions dictate your future positions. If you think something is a good investment, it doesn’t matter what you sold it for in the past. 

Anyways, rant over. Just wanted to monologue a bit and point out some (probably obvious) irrational tricks our monkey brains can play on us. Bitcoin and crypto are a beast, and if you don’t have the right temperament, they will buck you.",1625537389,285,1

[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/05/cryptocurrencies-financial-system-digital-future](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/05/cryptocurrencies-financial-system-digital-future)

They've gone really downhill recently with their crypto articles but this is a fucking joke. It's an opinion piece written by a historian, and it's total nonsense. It doesn't even mention the cypherpunk movement, or the history of digital currency (e-gold etc.), a quick nod to Hayek and then framing it as ""right-wing"" without context. Comparing gov coins with Bitcoin, totally blindsiding any real use cases and the usual shit.

Then they shut the comments down after a few hours and ""picked"" some bullshit top comments, the comment chain is actually way more informative than the article. Loads of more informed info getting ""upvotes""

Honestly, fuck that paper. I'm gonna do the British thing and write them an email telling them I'm done with them haha - I emailed them before about paying for a subscription via bitcoin (just to see what they'd say) and actually got a well-informed, personal reply so they do read the emails you send them.

The comment section is funny, if you have half an hour spare it might be fun to quickly make an account with guerrilla mail, and upvote all the informed comments. Just to show the bias to anyone reading through the comment section who doesn't know about crypto.

Rant over haha, it's actually kinda funny how misinformed some mainstream articles are. Almost as if there might be some outside influence going on *wink wink nudge nudge*",1625527770,76,1

While Binance can continue offering crypto trading services to Brits, it was ordered to notify users that it is not authorized to operate in the U.K.
The FCA’s crackdown on Binance has benefited a number of its rivals, including Bitstamp, Kraken and Gemini.
LONDON — Britain’s move to block Binance is boosting rival cryptocurrency exchanges, which have reported a surge in new users in the country recently.

The Financial Conduct Authority recently announced a crackdown on Binance, the world’s top crypto exchange by trading volume, restricting the company from carrying out regulated activities in the U.K.

Binance withdrew its application to register as a licensed crypto asset firm in the U.K. in May due to not meeting anti-money laundering requirements, the markets watchdog said.
While Binance is technically allowed to continue offering crypto trading to Brits, it was ordered by regulators to add a notice to its website saying it is not authorized to operate in the U.K.

For its part, Binance said the measures only targeted its U.K. entity, Binance Markets Limited, and would have no impact on services provided in the country by Binance.com.

But following the FCA’s restrictions, Binance has suffered subsequent setbacks in Britain. Customers were temporarily unable to make card withdrawals due to an issue with the U.K.’s Faster Payments system. Meanwhile, the bank Barclays has blocked customers from sending payments to the crypto exchange.
Binance’s woes in the U.K. have been a boon to its rivals, though, some of which have seen user numbers double since the FCA restrictions were announced.
“We’re seeing an increase in customers in the U.K. coming to us, with no changes in marketing,” Julian Sawyer, CEO of Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp, told CNBC.

As of Tuesday, Bitstamp had seen its customers grow 138% since the FCA issued its notice about Binance on June 25. Binance declined to comment on this story when contacted by CNBC.

“I think it’s a flight to safety,” Sawyer added. “If you’re told that the bank you’re with is less secure, you move the money out of the bank and move it into the next bank which is super secure.”
Meanwhile, U.S.-based exchange Kraken has also benefited.

“The percentage share of signups from the U.K. has approximately doubled in the last couple of weeks, compared to signups in Kraken’s other leading markets,” a Kraken spokesperson told CNBC.

Gemini, the digital currency exchange started by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is one of the few companies listed on the FCA’s list of registered crypto asset firms.
“We have seen tremendous user growth as consumers look towards approved firms when entering the market,” Blair Halliday, Gemini’s head of U.K., told CNBC.
“We expect to see exchanges and custodians registered with the FCA continue to gain market share due to the value placed on the approval process,” he added.

Coinbase, America’s largest crypto exchange, declined to comment on this story.Crypto crackdown
Binance’s woes haven’t been limited to the U.K.

On Tuesday, Binance said it had temporarily suspended euro bank deposits through the Single Euro Payments Area payments scheme, due to “events beyond our control.”

And regulators in Canada, Japan and Thailand have also issued warnings to the company about it operating without authorization.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known in the industry as “CZ,” said in a blog post Wednesday the exchange “still has a lot of room to grow” and that it hasn’t always gotten things right.
“Compliance is a journey – especially in new sectors like crypto,” Zhao said, adding Binance is hiring more compliance staff and localizing operations to better meet its regulatory obligations.

It follows a number of steps taken by regulators in China to clamp down on the crypto industry. Several regions in the country have moved to stamp out energy-intensive crypto mining operations, amid concerns over their environmental impact.
Earlier this week, Beijing called for the shutdown of a company suspected of providing software for virtual currency transactions, reiterating its tough stance on crypto.

oge8mh,obviatorscolp42,"Bitcoin, ether tumble as investors take off risk amid global markets slide","The price of bitcoin dropped Thursday as investors began shedding risk amid an equity markets decline. Fears of a slowing global economic comeback caused by the potential spread of the Covid-19 delta variant appeared to be behind investors move into safer assets like Treasurys.

Bitcoin is trading at $32,800, down about 5% on the day according to Coin Metrics. Most other cryptocurrency assets are falling with it, including ether, which is trading about 9% lower at $2,140.

That backslide came around the time of reports Japan has declared a state of emergency in Tokyo for the upcoming Olympics based on a potential rebound in Covid-19 cases. Stock futures fell on the news, and companies that would benefit from an economic rebound declined in early trading. The 10-year Treasury yield also dropped to 1.25%.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., warned against the growing risks the “highly opaque and volatile” cryptocurrency market poses to consumers and financial markets in a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler.

Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim its May highs. Its price has been hovering in the $30,000 range, down from its all-time high of $65,000 it reached in April. Some traders see bitcoin going higher in the long-term despite some near-term headwinds. Still, some say it could fall as low at $20,000 before institutional investors get back into it.
“We’re consolidating in here between [$30,000 and $35,000]. What we’re seeing is Asia sells it off, and then the U.S. buys it back,” Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said Thursday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “China has declared war on crypto as part of this broader cold war that we’re getting into, and so I think we’re still digesting that.”

On Tuesday, China’s central bank called for another shutdown of a company that “was suspected of providing software services for virtual currency transactions.” For years, China has regularly issued bans on the cryptocurrency industry and operations.
While bitcoin has sometimes been referred to as a hedge, the reality is it’s been quite volatile this year and tends to decrease amid broader declines in risk assets.

“There’s a lot of ownership correlated with other assets, right? So if you’re a hedge fund and you’re getting whacked in your rate position and your equity position and your oil position, you’re probably going to sell some of your crypto as well ,” said Novogratz, a longtime crypto investor. “It just takes a while for it to build a more diverse investor base.”",1625771732,4,1

oge37w,legionaryexes61,MARKETS Digital currency company Circle to go public via SPAC at $4.5 billion valuation,"Circle plans to go public by the end of the year through a SPAC with Concord Acquisition Corp.
The announcement comes as regulators seek more clarity around the trading and issuers of stablecoins — digital currency that’s designed to be less volatile than other crypto — with one proposal suggesting they obtain bank charters.
Payments and digital currency firm Circle plans to go public later this year through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Concord Acquisition Corp.

The deal, which Circle announced on Thursday, is expected to close in the fourth quarter and would value the company at $4.5 billion.

“We just see an incredible opportunity to grow rapidly and grow around the world, and we think that this set of transactions and becoming a public company really sets us up to be a trusted platform in this in this digital currency industry,” Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Thursday morning.

The eight-year-old startup is best known for co-creating the U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin USD Coin, or USDC.
Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to be less volatile than cryptocurrencies by pegging their market value to an outside asset like the U.S. dollar. Tether is one of the best known and most controversial ones, along with USDC and the initially Facebook-led Diem (formerly known as Libra). There are currently $26 billion of USDC in circulation, Allaire told “Squawk Box.”
The announcement of Circle’s deal comes amid growing concern by regulators that there should be more transparency in the trading of stablecoins, the reserves backing them and the overreliance on them to enable trading in decentralized finance or DeFi. 

In December, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., along with Reps. Jesus Garcia, D-Ill., and Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., introduced Stablecoin Tethering and Bank Licensing Enforcement Act, or the STABLE Act.

The legislation would require issuers to obtain bank charters and keep reserve funds equal in amount to the number of stablecoins they issue, with the Federal Reserve.
“We’ve seen growing adoption and usage of the USDC across an ever-widening range of use cases,” Jeremy Fox-Geen, Circle’s chief financial officer, according to a transcript of an investor conference call filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday.

“While we believe that the use case for USDC is the same as the use case for a dollar, for many of those use cases, USDC is the better product,” Fox-Geen said, because it can move and settle faster and more cheaply.
Payment systems adoption
“We operate this market infrastructure of USDC which doesn’t have a clear comparable,” Allaire said on “Squawk Box.” “It’s a fundamental innovation in payment systems, so you might think about large payment technology companies,” like Visa or Mastercard.

Earlier this year, Visa settled a USDC transaction on its payment network. The move lays the groundwork to potentially support a digital dollar and other central bank digital currencies worldwide. 

“On the other hand, we’re building this suite of what we call transaction and treasury services – those look more similar to at-scale, financial services platforms. It’s a diversified set of businesses,” Allaire added.
Circle also provides other commerce and financial applications for businesses. Allaire said on the same investor conference call that customers are “highly global,” with more than 50% outside the U.S., and that the company is investing aggressively to expand its international digital currency payments and treasury services operations.

Allaire, who is also the company’s co-founder, will remain CEO of the company. Bob Diamond, chairman of Concord Acquisition Corp. and CEO of Atlas Merchant Capital, will join the board.",1625771289,1,1

The current year's 500% aggregated addition took Ether's (ETH) cost to a $4,380 untouched high on May 12, and this convention was considerably more hearty than the late-2017 move.

The renowned positively trending business sector, or air pocket, contingent upon how you see it, took Ether's cost on a 390% convention from $290 in November 2017 to $1,420 in mid-January 2018. 

Possibly the current year's super meeting was a DeFi and NFT bubble that will require an additional two years to recover its pinnacle, yet it appears to be untimely to make an expectation now.

Notwithstanding, a few experts, including Celsius Network CEO Alex Mashinsky, contend that Ether's ""flippening"" has effectively happened when contrasting the broadness of resources under administration. 

As indicated by Mashinsky, Ether's essential use case is yield cultivating, the act of marking or securing up crypto return for remunerations, while Bitcoin is for the most part utilized as a store of significant worth. 

The assumption for expanded scaling is another explanation that drives Ether financial backers to stay bullish in spite of the current cost being 47% beneath its untouched high. 

Moreover, on July 1, worldwide inspecting monster Ernst and Young delivered the third cycle of its zero-information evidence Ethereum scaling arrangement called Nightfall 3. 

Nightfall 3 uses zk-Rollups, a layer-two adaptability brilliant agreement comprising of bunched moves ""rolled"" into one exchange, to further develop exchange proficiency and protection on the Ethereum organization.

Those rich assholes are going to buy out every company against bitcoin, every politician against it, &amp; make all things in the world integrate bitcoin, just like like the last rich assholes before them made the world integrate Facebook &amp; Google into every smart phone. There’s no stopping it at this point. 

Someone builds a quantum computer to try &amp; hack Bitcoin? Those rich assholes will already have a thousand quantum computers protecting the bitcoin network by then; just like Jeff Bezos, or any other billionaire does today, those rich assholes will buy out their enemies. 

Ever wonder why Visa card, PayPal, JP morgan chase, Goldman Sachs, etc, are now all pro bitcoin after being so negative about it only a few years ago? It’s because the rich assholes in Bitcoin already bought out a majority share of Their companies stocks &amp; forced them to integrate it. 

They’re buying up all the shares of the money companies first, anyone paying attention can see it. 

Everything else will be easy to buy majority share control over after owning the financial transmission companies. 

One day, those rich assholes will likely own a majority share of Google, Amazon, every major bank, and every major company in the world. And idk if you guys know how the federal reserve works, but it’s shares are owned by every major bank in the world, so once Bitcoin rich assholes own a majority share of every major bank as they’re buying up now, then they will eventually literally own the federal reserve. 

But the moral of the story is that it’s too late to stop this train. You can either join the rich assholes &amp; hop onto the internet 2.0 of financial energy storage &amp; transmission, or you can be left behind, just like all the Ma and Pa shops that were left behind and destroyed by the rich assholes of the last internet 1.0 of data information storage and transmission. 
Ma and Pa shops who they choked out by using the internet to take their customers, and then bought out for pennies on the dollar after their websites choked them out financially and left them in debt and ruin, just like crypto exchanges have been choking out the banks and investment firms for the last 12 years by attracting their customers to Bitcoin exchanges just as the first internet did with Ma and Pa shop’s customers.

The question is this.

If this was you. Would you still consider it a loss or getting even? I mean i lost too much BTC in leverage trading and all in all i handled
it well but I sometimes can’t stop forgetting the big loss and. Im trying to have the right perspective.

I stoped leverage trading 6 months ago and will never do it again. 

What i learned about my loss.

Leverage trading is gambling for 90% of the people if not more.

You can win 9 times in a row but lose everything the tenth time.

Bitcoin is real and it’s value going up is not a question about if but when.

90% or more altcoins are only for the creators to get more Bitcoin or fiat.

I  underestimated how much whales and smart money can manipulate the Bitcoin price. To what degree can they manipulate the price and what is the point in investing if they can manipulate
this much?

I told my friends to get in when Bitcoin was under 10K or DCA to be in a position of strength so to not panic when the price goes down. Most didn’t listen and got in much later and they are now considering selling at loss.

I try to make my friends understand this things i mentioned but they won’t listen.

odeq50,serhr792,How many scammers have you funded by putting your money in?,"
I think there's no shame admitting that we make mistakes, that's where you learn from. Sometimes even with DYOR, legit looking projects turn out to be scams. And sometimes we just want to risk it.

During last bullrun ico frency 2017-2018 many people were saying that ICO scams are now over and next time people will be smarter. However now there are more scams then ever, especially rug pulls in uniswap and pancakeswap. We just don't call them ICOs anymore.

My failures of judgement contain 2 icos from many years ago which were obvious scams in hindsight : Swiss Alps Mining, Envion and one latest where Dev disappeared after i aped in to some BSC shittoken for the hopes of 2x-10 flip (i can't even remember the name of it).

Luckily i haven't invested anything i couldn't lose (to scams anyway), and i have even made money with investing to something that turned out to be scam later on. But still they are obviously annoying.

So i would like to hear your stories on how did you get scammed. Was it because you aped in without research or something else?",1625379809,6,1

It's yet the day where most users in crypto land are composed of males. Women are the minority, since most of them express little-to-no interest in crypto/Blockchain tech. I find this to be odd, considering that women are as interconnected as males in today's digital era. If they use a payment processor like PayPal, why won't they use crypto/Blockchain tech?

So I've heard all the reasons to love Bitcoin. I'd be a lot more enthusiastic if I saw these 3 drawbacks being addressed.","I'm not saying that these problems are insoluble, just that I haven't heard the solutions yet, and this seems like a good place to look for answers.

1) The tactics I've heard to prevent being tortured to turn over your private key don't cut it. They include arming yourself, being cautious, and keeping mum that you even own Bitcoin. But look down the road a bit, say 40 years. If Bitcoin becomes our primary currency, that everyone owns, you can safely assume that the guy in a pricey zip code with a Maserati has plenty of Bitcoin, just like we can now assume that he has plenty of dollars.  Kidnappings and home invasions would be through the roof.  Well-paid professionals would need bodyguards 24/7.  

2). If the cost of energy were to drop dramatically (say 98%) as a result of new technology, would proof of work still matter? (If there are no hard costs, but only time to mine Bitcoins?) Our current tech would seem like magic to a person from 50 years ago, so who knows what the next 50 years will bring?

3). With every transaction recorded in the blockchain, are we sure there is no way for governments to identify who paid x satoshis for a night with 3 hookers and cocaine? Be a shame to have that info sent to your wife.  

I sincerely hope that all the shouting about Bitcoin is justified. If anyone can shed light on these concerns, I'd be most grateful.",1625370920,116,1

odckkx,Trentw,"I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be a shitcoiner","I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be a shitcoiner. That’s not my business. I don’t want to deceive or rob anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - rich, poor - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.  


Greed has poisoned our souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…  


The internet and the mobile phone have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in people - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my post is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes humans torture and imprison innocent people.  


To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of those who fear the way of human progress. The hate of people will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as humans die, liberty will never perish…  


Bitcoiners! don’t give yourselves to brutes - people who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men and women! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Bitcoiners! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!  


In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: “the Kingdom of God is within man” - not one man nor a group of men, but in all! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.  


Then - in the name of freedom - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give us a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!  


Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all humankind happiness. Bitcoiners! in the name of freedom, let us all unite!",1625370261,14,1

I know that Bitcoin is pseudonymous, as you can track every adress. It is somehow private in a way that nobody know who own which adress. Atleast until you glue your name to some of them.

If you buy through KYC service with fiat like coinbase or Binance, they have this one line that says ""date, amount, name, verification of ID, adress where it went"" and from this time they can track everything you did with your money.

Arent you afraid of your government? Until US passed executive order on gold confiscation, nobody thought that could happen.

Dont you think that they can do the same with bitcoin? They know everything they need and even if you dont have it anymore, you have mark on your skin... only way how to prevent them is buying though non-kyc or old P2P with cash.

There are other reasons. Tracking, social problems because they can prove you re ""dirty energy waster and you are probably molesting kids"", there might be persecutions and basically have to obey every law of taxation and persecution, because they KNOW you boght coin.

Arent you concerned about some of those scenarios? 

They might seem like the worst one, but every day we are losing our rights and this is not different. It might be much faster in future, if governments see their power vanishing with fiat currencies value and trust. 

What can i do to prevent that except buying bitcoins P2P with services like Bisq or face-to-face?",1625348204,40,1

The beelink t4 has an atom x5 processor, 4gbs or ram, and 64gb eMMC, new for 120-140$ Admittedly likely a slow unit so here's another: intel NUC5 with and I3 dualcore 4 thread processor, 8gb or ram, 128gb ssd: used for 100-140$ 
 There's all combinations of used and new units that seem to be right up there in capability with the PI4 series.

Buy a mining device, the more hash rate the more money you'll gonna make. Remember, you won't need any fans, just a good passive heat radiator, bigger surface is better.

2. Step:

Build a satellite and mount your mining device on that baby. In case of power, just stick a nuclear battery on it.

3. Step:

Launch that satellite into the space and let it fly with the highest possible speed into the Orbit of an black hole. 


Now you're done. You have the worldwide fastest minding machine! Because of the rising speed of your satellite, wich is slowly getting sucked into the black hole while it's spinning on the Orbit, relatively the time will slow down for that satellite. For example, at a specific speed of that spinning satellite, one hour of mining for that satellite would be just a second for us on earth.",1625342688,16,1

So I have been researching Tether since I like to check out contrary opinions to make sure I’m not self-validating myself (usually checking out the nocoiners at r/buttcoin) 

There they mentioned that Tether is not backed by USD. I read up on Tether and it seems that for the past 3 years they have come under a lot of pressure to be audited and had some recent legal troubles since something like &lt;5% of Tether is backed by cash and ~70% is backed by commercial paper. 

There was also a claim that Tether is artificially pumping up BTC by making huge wash trades. This I don’t understand and would like to hear your opinions on. 

Lastly the market cap for Tether seems to be increasing still and if you check out r/tether it is a desert. No one is there and a lot of bots post. 

So what do you think? I heard a lot of opinions about how Tether is going to destroy crypto but I don’t buy that right now. But to be honest I don’t have a compelling reason except that people will believe in crypto. 

What’s going to happen with Tether and how will that affect BTC? If it will affect it.

oblrvt,No-Result-2929,The principle of mining is introduced,"Bitcoin mining is the process of confirming transactions that have taken place in the Bitcoin system over a period of time and recording them on the blockchain to form a new block. The miners are called miners.

To put it simply, mining is the process of keeping accounts, miners are the bookkeepers, and blockchain is the ledger.How do you motivate miners to dig?The billing power of the Bitcoin system is decentralized, meaning that each miner has the right to keep the books.

Miners who managed to grab the bookkeeping rights were rewarded with new Bitcoins in the system.So mining is the process of producing bitcoins.Satoshi Nakamoto originally designed Bitcoin to provide that every 210,000 blocks produced, Bitcoin reward halved once, until Bitcoin can no longer be subdivided.Because bitcoin, like gold, has a finite amount of it.That's why bitcoin is called digital gold, and bitcoin production is also known as mining.

Mining, technically, is the process of random collisions in computer hashes (hash or hash functions).To put it simply, the Bitcoin system sets out a mathematical problem to see who can solve the mining equipment first.

Colored computers, led by the miners, began to calculate the correct answers.The Bitcoin system itself also adjusts the difficulty, controlling the time it takes to solve the problem, and typically mines a block every 10 minutes or so.During those 10 minutes, the computer just keeps calculating and trying out strings.

Until you first try out the only correct answer:

""Bitcoin"" (actually, it's not that simple), which corresponds to the exact same hash value as in the title. In this case, you write ""Bitcoin"" into a block and wait for the system to issue bitcoin rewards (50 in 2009).

Halve the reward every four years) and TIPS fees for all transactions within this block.

It is also a competition between different kinds of computing power, or computing power for short.

Miners with more powerful computers/mining machines made more money.

While mining is a probabilistic event, a miner with more computing power may not always be the fastest to find a positive solution, proportionally speaking, if the miner has 10% computing power, he will probably find 10 blocks out of 100.

Ordinary people can get into Bitcoin in one of two ways: by investing in the secondary market, or by buying a mining machine and digging it themselves

All commodities have a source of production. Gold is mined, apples are planted, and bitcoin is produced by miners.

Unlike other physical goods, Bitcoin is acquired online.

People compete with each other to solve an extremely complex math problem on the Internet, and the first person to complete it is rewarded in the form of bitcoins.

In the early days of bitcoin in 2009, bitcoin mining was done on a personal computer, using the CPU to compute math problems.

But as the number of people involved in mining increased, the difficulty of mining bitcoin was adjusted, and it became more and more difficult for people to mine bitcoin with the CPU, so the bitcoin mining machine appeared.

As the name suggests, this is a machine specifically designed to mine bitcoin, which is characterized by high computational power and high mining efficiency.

So you don't have to do it in your head anymore, you have to do it on a calculator.

Other people have a few computers in the exam. Can you still win by calculating by mouth?

Of course not.

So mining machines are now the standard allocation for Bitcoin miners. Small miners are those with fewer mining machines, and big miners are those with strong financial strength.",1625145862,6,1

Got a DM from a ""girl"" asking me how I'm doing. Naturally the first thing I did was check out the profile. 

100 comment karma, no posts. 90% of the comments in one of those subs where people beg for karma so they can post on normal subs. The other comments were interesting thou. They were on crypto subs and they promoted some ""big shot investor"" they had made money investing with - guaranteed returns of course.

The funny thing is they were responding to their own comments from different accounts having a conversation with themselves about how great said guy is and giving each other (themselves) tips on investment.

How do I know it's the same person you may ask? Well funny enough they used the same account description on all their accounts, all are online at the same time and only comment at the same time, all on the same subs first begging for karma and then promoting a crypto scam talking to themselves.

First red flag I noticed was that he said he likes to stay at home and examine the trends of Bitcoin. I felt like he was using that line to dangle $$$ at me and probably all the other women he matches with. I also have been following Bitcoin for some time now. I asked him what his predictions were for this year and he said he recommended it as a short term investment (I've never heard of this kind of advice lol I always thought the opposite). I asked for more clarification and he said
 ""I am doing a short-term two-way income model, and I can make a profit whether it goes up or down"". 
I asked how short term and he said 1 hour. 

I want to know is that really a thing? I have never heard of it and also tried looking it up but did not see anything relevant. I just want to make sure this is another thing he made up as I would really love to tell him that I think his investment strategy is garbage. 

Anyway, I'm continuing to message with him because I'm also an asshole and would like to continue making subtle jabs at his ego.  My friend told me this is a common scam and he is going to ask me for money soon, so I'm waiting to see what happens!

I could also save this money as cash and wait for a dip to make my buy. This would probably result in a lower average price over time but it also means I would have to be more diligent in tracking the price of BTC.

In 2011 the Silk Road paved the way for selling drugs on the dark web. Here, anyone anywhere could buy any drugs they wanted safely and anonymously. What looked like an innocent libertarian marketplace for users had a dark underbelly. Eileen Ormsby, journalist and author of 8 books covering the dark web came on the show to discuss what was the Silk Road.

oeahxf,Expired_Lizard_Milk,How much bitcoin can each millionaire realistically own on average if bitcoin were completely adopted globally today?,"According to a recent article there is roughly 56.1 million millionaires worldwide (https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57575077). There is also approximately 18.75 million bitcoin mined to date. Doing some simple math, 18.75 mill / 56.1 mill gets us ~0.334 bitcoin for each millionaire. That would mean each coin would have a face value of $3 million.

However, the above calculation is not realistic. There is approximately 4 million bitcoin that is lost forever. So really we should be calculating 14.75 mill / 56.1 mill which gets us ~0.263 bitcoin for each millionaire. This would mean each coin would be worth almost 4 million dollars.

However, this is still not realistic. If bitcoin were suddenly adopted globally then that would mean all the countries in the world would have a bitcoin reserve. At this point I'm making up random numbers, but let's say all the countries around the world own 5 million coins all together. Let's also consider all the private and public companies in the world that would have their own reserve. Let's say these corporations together owned 2.5 million coins. That would mean there would be only 7.25 million coins left for the millionaires. However, we also need to consider the amount of coins all the non-millionaires would own... let's say all the non-millionaires make up 1 million coins all together.

This leaves us with 6.25 million coins for the millionaires. 6.25 mill / 56.1 mill gets us 0.111 bitcoin for each millionaire. Meaning each coin would be worth about 10 million usd. However, this is not even considering that some millionaires are vastly richer than other millionaires. We need to consider the millionaires that currently own hundreds of millions of dollars of assets versus the millionaires that only have 1 million dollars worth. This would mean each millionaire would have on average much less than 0.111 bitcoin. Wouldn't this put bitcoin at a value worth 10s of millions of dollars?

What are everyone else's thoughts on this? How much bitcoin can each millionaire realistically own on average if the whole world suddenly adopted bitcoin today?",1625501300,9,1
oeaaze,_kr_saurabh,Bitcoin – The Future Currency,"Bitcoin (₿/BTC) is a Cryptocurrency created in 2009 (by Satoshi Nakamoto) that has been devised for anonymous payments made entirely independently of governments and banks. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer (like giving your cash from your pocket to your friend or anyone) technology to work, no bank/government/financial establishment will track or interfere in your dealing. Bitcoin is an ASCII text file (open source) no one owns or controls Bitcoin and everybody will participate. People will send Bitcoin to every alternative through an app (Digital Wallet) on smartphones and computers. Every single dealing is recorded during a public ledger known as the blockchain. The Bitcoin conjointly exists in physical kind through ""Casascius Bitcoin"" created by American entrepreneur Mike Caldwell, the distinctive code of Bitcoin being embedded in a gold-plated coin, conjointly divided. Satoshi is that the smallest subdivision of a BTC such as ten BTC (0.000000000 BTC). alternative subdivisions are microbothoin (μBTC) such as ten BTC (0.000001 BTC), millibitcoin or bit mil (mBTC) such as ten BTC (0.001 BTC) and centibicin or bitcent (cBTC).
In recent years, Bitcoin has generated an excellent deal of attention on many fronts. Bitcoin payments are supported a brand new attention-grabbing technical answer and performance otherwise from ancient payments. For sure payment things, Bitcoin will bring benefits within the type of lower prices, rapidity, anonymity, etc. over ancient payment ways. the employment of Bitcoin for payments is low nowadays, and though Bitcoin’s future is nice, it is a motivating innovation merit description. Currently, Bitcoin is poised between being a store of import and a medium for daily transactions.  Indian Rapper Raftaar has declared that he can settle for cryptocurrency rather than actual currency as his performance fee on June nineteen, 2021.
Institutional investors are needing to get in on the action and cash in on the volatility in its costs as governments around the world, like Japan, have declared it a legitimate type of payment for the product. Central American country (El Salvador) created Bitcoin monetary system on June nine, 2021. it is the primary country to try to, therefore. Bitcoin may be used for any dealing wherever the business will settle for it. The U.S. Dollar continues to be El Salvador’s primary currency.
Bitcoin’s functioning relies on miners validatory transactions. Incentives for them to try to therefore primarily contains new Bitcoins being assigned to miners as an award. The creation of recent Bitcoins declines over time. There will solely twenty-one million Bitcoin in future and approx. eighteen million Bitcoin already mined. a number of the consultants believe that the last Bitcoin ought to be mined within the year 2140.
 
We can list the dearth of notification and understanding. many of us still do not have the existence of Bitcoin. People must be compelled to learn concerning what Bitcoin suggests that to use it in their lives. Networking is that the best way to promoting Bitcoin. corporations settle for Bitcoins owing to the advantages; however, the list is comparatively short compared to physical coins. corporations like TigerDirect, Dell, NewEgg and buy-in settle for Bitcoin as a type of payment, which is nice. staff ought to be trained on Bitcoin to assist their customers. This may need your time and energy. Risk and volatility are 2 components that create an enormous disadvantage to Bitcoin. This is often volatile, particularly because there is a restricted quantity of coins and therefore the demand for them that will increase with each passing day. However, volatility is predicted to decrease as time passes. if several corporations, media and looking centres have begun to simply accept Bitcoin, its value can eventually stabilize. Currently, the Bitcoin value jumps from day to day, particularly because of the events related to digital coins.   
 
The success and way forward for Bitcoin are so not clear cut. All we all know is that the long run will not be because it is nowadays, and the way we tend to create payments in twenty-five or fifty years is an open-ended question.",1625500742,5,1

oe9zx6,Shellywig,I've just been scammed $200 and I feel terrible," 

So I feel terrible because I just got scammed $200 from a Bitcoin scam. I never post on reddit but I felt like I should this time just in case it stops anyone else falling for this trick. I'll post all the screen shots as well just so it's easier to understand.

Basically a guy called 'Bitmex Lightning Signals on Instagram 'who had hundreds of followers btw' had a free telegram signals channel which I joined, the last message in the channel was a post about advertising for 3 jobs that he had available. He basically just wanted people to help out his channel and answer questions that people may have he said he would pay $850 a week.

Now I can't believe I fell for this but being a uni student and being pretty broke I thought wow what an opportunity, I get to work in crypto and get paid a really good salary for it. He seemed very legit he had posts going back a good few weeks. So I messaged him said I was interested an replied saying great I'll start you off with a weeks trial and see how you get on.

However this is the scammy bit he said in order to join and get the links for everything I would have to join his VIP service which is 0.005 BTC. So foolishly I agree and sent 0.00577 BTC to him for the amount plus the fees. Again he seemed very legit he was asking me how I want to be paid and if I knew about erp systems and what my Instagram name was. But as soon as the BTC went through he blocked me on everything and has yet to reply to me.

I know this wasn't a load of money and I bet some of you make this of 1 trade but it's a lot of money to me and I feel terrible that this guy managed to scam me. If anyone has seen this guy before let me know I wish I had screenshotted his insta page and his telegram group so I could show you all.

Be careful out there guys I didn't think I'd ever fall for something like this but here I am.

This is where most people say we can just wait it out.

oe54um,l008com,Best way to check wallet is up to date via RPC?,"I'm using scripts to talk to the bitcoin wallet and I'm trying to find out if the wallet is currently ""synced"" or if it's downloading blocks. 

Common answers to this are ""a wallet is never sycned, it's downloading blocks forever"" and ""compare the wallets block count in \`getblockcount\` with the value available on this webpage here.... yadda yadda.

This is a script that runs very regularly and it talks to many wallets, so making repeated HTTP request for each ""check"" is not feasible. And as far as the wallet ""always"" being out of sync, the wallet knows when to throw up the ""syncing"" splash screen. How can I know when that screen will be up, via RPC? 

My first attempt used three RPC calls:

\&gt; getblockcount  
\&gt; getblockhash $result  
\&gt; getblock $result

This gives me a result that includes the timestamp of the newest block. I declare the wallet as ""out of sync"" if that block is more than 45 minutes old. 

I was then able to turn that down to 2 RPC calls by simply doing:

\&gt; getbestblockhash  
\&gt; getblockhash $result

So here is the million dollar question. Is there a way I can get the ""timestamp"" of the last block on my local blockchain in just \*1\* RPC command? Or is there a way to just ask the wallet if it is up to date or not via 1 direct RPC command? 

Also, the 45 minute time just came from something someone said in a chat room once. If checking the age of the last block I have is still the best way to check for up-to-date-ness, by what methodology should I calculate what to use for an ""expiration time""?

&gt; **We visited ""Bitcoin Beach"" to See How Bitcoin Works in El Salvador. AMA!**
&gt; 
&gt; Vice News reporter Keegan Hamilton and Motherboard editor Jason Koebler are here to answer your questions about how Bitcoin is being used in El Salvador. ICYMI: El Salvador is the first country to adopt Bitcoin as a national currency. It all started with a tiny surf town called El Zonte that rebranded itself ""Bitcoin Beach,"" installed a Bitcoin ATM, and created a way for locals to do everything from buy pupusas to pay their utility bills with Bitcoin. The system does have some problems and El Salvador's nationwide adoption has many skeptics. We dug into how this all began, how it's working, and who stands to profit.

Both can be used for payments and as a store of value

Both rely on widespread consumer trust in order to function as a means of exchange

Fiat money is issued and controlled by (central) banks and governments

Bitcoin is produced and distributed through a process called mining and is not controlled by a centralised authority

Bitcoin can be trusted because it is tamper-proof and cannot be spent twice

A Bitcoin transaction cannot be reversed, cancelled or charged back",1625634599,2,1

https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-tonga-fusitua

&gt; On this episode of the Bitcoin Magazine Podcast, Christian Keroles sits down with Lord Fusitu'a of Tonga. Lord Fusitu’a is Tongan royalty and a member of the Tongan government. Lord Fusitu’a is a die-hard Bitcoiner and often spends time on Twitter spaces chatting with Bitcoin plebs from around the world. He tells the story of how Tonga relies heavily on remittances from Tongan’s living abroad and how much of those funds are lost to middlemen and rent seekers. According to Lord Fusitu’a bitcoin is already starting to take hold in Tonga on a peer to peer level, and he sees a viable path to implementing an El Salvador style bill to make bitcoin legal tender in Tonga.
&gt; 
&gt; Lord Fusitu’a has been working with both Jack Mallers and El Salvadorian officials to take the best parts of that law and amend it to fit into Tonga’s legal framework. Lord Fusitu’a believes that by embracing bitcoin, Tonga can become more competitive and wealthy compared to states that are slower to adopt the digital hard currency. He believes the Tongan people stand to benefit immediately just based on the remittances advantages that bitcoin offers. Lord Fusitu’a believes that these immediate advantages will turn into a culture of long-term saving on the islands.

This article will introduce the different benefit levels of ACH card in detail. The specific rights and interests are shown in the following chart:

Otherwise shorts and liquidations would have driven it much lower. Sell pressure is drying up slowly, and in the meantime long term holders are accumulating from paper hands

For example, this address (https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ). It currently has over 100K BTC and you can see they have been accumulating coins for the past 2 months. There is also on chain data that suggests the same, that long term holders are accumulating at the same time short term holders are selling. 

It’s likely we will trade sideways for the next 1-4 months. But this is honestly a great time to accumulate. Btc price is already pretty low and the risk reward suggests it’s not worth risking a 4x over 20-30% price difference.",1625898755,52,1

oh919h,Cool-Pie-7091,How would one go about figuring out if a deceased person (my brother) bought bitcoin?,"Hi everyone!

I was wondering if any OG bitcoin folk would know what the most common platform's one might have purchased bitcoin on between the year 2009-2012?

I've recently gotten into cryptocurrency and made my first couple of investments on etoro. It suddenly occurred to me that bitcoin would have been just the kind of thing my brother would have been into. He was an avid redditor and loved new inventions, tech, and futurology in general so I could really see him buying a few bitcoin back in the day to see where it would go.

Here's the problem... My brother passed away very suddenly in 2012 from an undiagnosed heart condition. He was only 24 years old and had just graduated cum laude with a degree in mechanical engineering, 10 days before he died.

I know my parents still have his old MacBook and I recall that we were able to access his password keychain function in the past. I'm pretty sure I can log into his email which would be the first place I would look.

Any tips for keywords, websites, or company names I should look for in this little scavenger hunt? Or general ideas about how one would go about retrieving such information?

 If I wind up finding and gaining access to bitcoin he bought, I'm going to make a sizeable donation to The Heart Foundation, and then split the rest between my parents and siblings.",1625879800,31,1

If people use large sum of Yuan to buy BTC from individuals, they would’ve been tracked down by the police . All their banking system is under close surveillance.(locals only allowed to transfer out 50k usd per year).

My solution is simple, we could use gold to exchange into Btc. If people want to accumulate Btc without getting tracked by the government, all they could do is to change their CNY to gold/spot gold/ gold contracts ( perfectly legal ) and use gold to exchange for BTC ( untraceable by the banking system). All they need is just a soft/hard wallet.

Nonetheless one could argue that they could just hold gold instead of Btc to avoid all the hassles . But BTC is much more superior than gold and I shall not further expand here.

I received a random email that I had won a fair amount of BTC in a discord drawing and the page linked me to bitcoinspirex. Sure enough I go to bitcoinspirex and input the promo code and there the funds are input into my newly created account. Unfortunate for me I have never head of bitcoinspirex. There is no reddit page for the website, I have never seen any discussion of the exchange.

Then I get on the exchange, it looks nice, multiple pages with a solid layout, live chat where people responded to my questions and said it was a good option trading platform, then I que support and ask about retrieving these funds. Support was automated and this was the response.

""Dear user. Since our platform is fully automated and your account has no deposits with an active balance, the account will be automatically frozen and no Opitons Bets/Transfer/Withdrawal functions are available. To unfreeze and verify your account, you need to make a verification deposit of at least 0.01 BTC which you can then be withdrawn along with the remaining balance""

Now I am curious to what the deal is with this page because the winnings would make a deposit of .01 BTC feasible, but to think that this could all be a very well planned scam to get .01 which is about $350 Right now.

This is their claims:

""Cold storage for cryptocurrency funds

PCI DSS certificate

Strong relations with banks

Legal Compliance

MSB status in FinCEN (USA)

Registered with the ICO in the UK (EU)

Internal AML/KYC policy and procedures""

One of the offerings includes a bitcoin card that the online banking platform will launch as early as this month.**

## Monobank to Offer Users Bitcoin Card and Crypto Exchange

By the end of July, Monobank’s clients will be able to buy and sell cryptocurrency using a new banking card that will support crypto transactions. The news was announced by the company’s co-founder Oleg Gorokhovskyi on Telegram.

The Ukrainian mobile bank also plans to introduce an integration with a cryptocurrency exchange which has not been disclosed yet. According to sources quoted by Forklog, Monobank will accomplish the task in partnership with the crypto trading platform Whitebait.

Gorokhovskyi further emphasized that the development phase of the project is already completed. At this stage, Monobank is only awaiting approval from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), the country’s central bank.

This fall, the mobile bank will offer investors an option to trade company shares through a U.S.-based platform that is yet to be announced. Monobank’s team is currently working to introduce eSIM support with a mobile operator and improve its acquiring services. Both initiatives will be presented in August, the report details.

In February, Oleg Gorokhovskyi revealed he had “a fairly large portfolio of bitcoins” and advised his friends and followers on Facebook to buy cryptocurrency. At the time, the entrepreneur stated he was convinced by Tesla’s $1.5 billion crypto purchase that “bitcoin isn’t going anywhere.”

Later the same month, Monobank discontinued support for SEPA transfers from Binance citing restrictions imposed by foreign correspondent banks. The leading cryptocurrency exchange has been expanding its presence in Ukraine and launched an advertising campaign in major Ukrainian cities in June.

Last year, the East European country was ranked among the world’s top crypto adopters but the government in Kyiv is yet to introduce comprehensive regulations for cryptocurrencies and the related industry. A revised bill on “On Virtual Assets” should be voted this summer.",1625666995,4,1

One of the main differences between USD and bitcoin is that USD is inflationary and bitcoin isnt.  No one refutes that.  The key reason USD is inflated is to drive consumer demand.  No one refutes that.  Consumption is a key cause of environmental damage.  No one refutes that.  So USD by design is bad for the environment.  Can anyone say with a straight face that bitcoin’s electricity usage is worse for the environment than perpetually increasing consumer consumption?

You can argue that bitcoins deflationary quality makes it a poor choice for being a reserve currency for a country but stating that its bad for the environment is ridiculous compared to our current economic system based on inflation, never ending growth and perpetually increasing consumer demand.",1625944927,19,1

**Level 2:** Read Kissinger and Mahbubani and conclude China is good.

**Level 3:** Read Anthony Sutton and realize that China today is just another Rockefeller puppet.

The century of humiliation has not ended. The oligarchy moved jobs and technology to China in order to create their template for a society of total control. It is very shameful and un-Chinese to kowtow to western oligarchs! I am quite disappointed.

""The *social experiment* in China under Chairman *Mao's* leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history.” -David *Rockefeller*

**What this means for BTC:**

Do not believe any China FUD you hear. In fact, do not believe any FUD you hear. It is absolutely meaningless for BTC. Look at the network, look at the protocol. BTC is fundamentally the lifeboat while the oligarchy's fiat ship is sinking.",1625940639,2,1

They have done this at least three times since 2013. I think this last one in May will be the last effective one. Not only because people are catching on to the scam, but also because they have now driven out most miners from the country and banned all transactions. This was perfectly timed with Elon's flip-flop. Elon was then immediately awarded by the Chinese government (where he had previously been struggling with red tape and bad press). The only arrow the Chinese Communist Party have left in their quiver is to ban possession, but that would be impossible to enforce, and would only make the CCP appear weak (the thing they fear the most) due to their inability to effectively enforce. So I think we are at or near the end of the Chinese short-crypto-then-FUD scam.",1625936335,340,1

How do you remove that it ever was in possession of the ‘drug lord’

oibnfi,itachiwriting,"Bitcoin has been banned many times in many geographies, and yet today, adoption is outpacing internet adoption","An important quote from the board director of Blockstream and founder of Stillmark, Alyse Killeen. 

I've taken the time to collect and display the important points and subheadings from an article (linked below). 

**Intro** 

The death of cryptocurrencies has long been prognosticated and it is proving even harder to bring down this drive. Governments have started to reconsider their previous positions on their utility as some decide to adopt and regulate them as opposed to blindly opposing their use.

Despite being banned in some major countries such as China, Bitcoin has still held strong, which speaks to its strength and adoption. 

**Here are some lessons as to why these bans keep failing**

- You cannot ban the blockchain, its code
- Crypto is more than just about money, it’s fostering other technological innovations
- It's solving real financial problems where other systems have failed
- The world is changing and so is crypto
- No real reasons/fears to warrant ban

**Final thoughts**

Banning crypto is ill-advised. Instead, governments should seek to consider a crypto economy as the early beginnings of a new open financial system.

&amp;#x200B;

I am A new investor, who in a sense, FOMO'd in near the top (50ish-60k range) but have steadily DCAing small chunks into bitcoin only since the crash.I am a student, so don't have MUCH expendable income, but instead of buying weed/booze/going out, I just DCA into crypto now, study, and as soon as restrictions lift, I work out. 

Strategy wise on my end I do not intend to modify anything. However, I am deathly afraid of what governments and banks will do to crypto, and Bitcoin specifically. Idc if doggy meme coins get outright banned, good. I'm all for that. they should of been banned in 2017.

And I know that you cant ""ban"" bitcoin, and stop using it, but you can definitely stop adoption from taking place by making it economically unviable as an investment/store of value. (for example, MASSIVE taxes when making a purchase with crypto, or cashing it out - will make it ""unfeasible"" and virtually useless if the government takes the lions share of it, every time).

&amp;#x200B;

For a person that doesn't want to skirt around the government and risk repercussions is this a bad omen for bitcoin? The FUD is starting to rattle my outlook for the future with the way the FED and banks are treating crypto, and bitcoin specifically. 

Add on top of that the ""energy concerns"" and normies pile on board on the ""FUCK BITCOIN"" band-wagon.

For anyone who is ""in the know"", what will the reprecussions of a ""worst case scenario"" be for someone like me?

oib3sh,MrRom92,Can someone help me gain access to my Bitcoin wallet circa 2011?,"Hello, I was wondering if someone could possibly help me get access to my wallet from when I dabbled with Bitcoin circa 2011

Here’s what I have on an old hard drive, and here’s what I’ve tried:
 
 
• I have the various folders associated with the Bitcoin core client, and in the appdata/roaming/bitcoin folder, there is a wallet.dat
**HOWEVER** I have no recollection of using the core client at all, and don’t even know if there is anything in that wallet or if this wallet was synchronized in some way to the other program I used. 
 
I downloaded/installed a new version of the core client, and tried to copy this old wallet.dat file into the appdata/roaming/Bitcoin folder of the new installation, however when I place it there the wallet.dat doesn’t show up in the Core Client program as something I can select and open. 

 
If I rename the file to anything else besides wallet.dat, it shows up in the list of selectable wallets, however “opening” it seems to hang for an extended period of time without actually doing anything. So the current situation is that I’m not even sure if there’s anything in this wallet.dat, nor do I know how I can even check. 

 
• what I actually used back in the day was a program called GUIminer, and I have all the folders associated with that as well. However I don’t see any sort of wallet.dat in these files. I don’t know if there’s any other sort of file that a wallet used for GUIminer might be stored as. Or any sort of setting file or document here that might indicate what wallet my GUIminer client was mining to at the time. This is definitely the program I spent most time running though.

oi772a,_kr_saurabh,The Bogdanoff Twins Claim They Participated in Helping Satoshi Nakamoto Build Bitcoin,"**Following the infamous meme that shows one of the Bogdanoff twins on the phone telling whales to initiate a crypto-market dump, the Bogdanoff brothers now claim they took part in inventing the leading cryptocurrency bitcoin with Satoshi Nakamoto. During an interview hosted on L’Heure des Pros, the Bogdanoff twins said as mathematicians the two were able to “participate in the elaboration of some of the source code.”**

## Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff Claim to Have Helped Satoshi Elaborate on Bitcoin’s ‘Predictive Code’

There’s been a long-running joke that the Bogdanoff twins have the power to manipulate crypto markets after a meme started a few years ago showing one of the twins ordering a substantial dump on the market.

The meme has been seen by the twins, according to a recent interview on L’Heure des Pros and a recent appearance on the French television show “Non-Stop People.” Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff said they have seen the meme and explained that Satoshi Nakamoto probably has something to do with its online virality.

 “It is probably Nakamoto who made \[the Grichka Bogdanoff meme\] circulate,” Igor Bogdanoff said. Igor further added: 

""\[The image\] was in all blockchains between 2010-2012 \[and\] downloaded more than 1.3 billion times.""

**Satoshi’s Alleged Acquaintance ‘Soïtchiro Shimoda’ and the Two ‘Ancient Bitcoins’**

The Bogdanoff twins are well known for their science-based television show called “Temps X.” Since the 1970s, the twins have been scientific essayists and while Igor has a doctorate in theoretical physics, his brother has a doctorate in mathematics.

During the recent interview with the Bogdanoff twins, the two explained how they had worked with the touchscreen inventor François Mizzi and an interesting Japanese scientist dubbed “Soïtchiro Shimoda.”",1626019576,6,1

oi7128,nicky_papagiorgio,"one psychological reason people resist crypto, and ideas for how to change their minds","we have some idea about why those at the top tiers of the financial markets -- e.g., traditional financial execs, governments, wealthy investors -- resist and criticize the very notion of cryptocurrency: they want to retain the power and wealth they have been cultivating over generations. but what about the everday person, someone who does not hold a major stake in the financial game?  someone with modest-to-no savings? I'm talking about the blue collar workers, middle class families, ""retirees"" working another career just to keep the lights on,and those less tech savvy who may not have a basic understanding of the tech. I'm just thinking about normal, everyday people who may not be receptive to info concerning crypto and its unique benefits. why would they resist something that so clearly to many of us could put them on a path to financial security and independence? 

I'd argue that people's resistance to crypto largely -- but not exclusively -- stems from a core psychological phenomenon known as the status quo bias. the status quo bias refers to the (oftentimes irrational) propensity for people to favor the existing and longstanding states of the world. loss aversion, regret avoidance, repeated exposure, and rationalization can all contribute to this preference, among other deep-seated psychological mechanisms. these biases operate heuristically, forming barriers to cognitive and social change, and ultimately crypto adoption. 

a question I'm interested in is how can people reduce or overcome this bias? what can we, as early-ish crypto adopters and enthusiasts do to encourage others to break free from from their current mental state -- that in favor of traditional finance that they understand and with which they are very comfortable -- and at least begin to consider the possible benefits of crypto vs. the shackles of most of the world's current primary financial system? below are just a few tips you may be able to use to leverage psychological biases in others to increase the likelihood that they'll be open to, or invest in, crypto:

1. **Frame crypto in terms of loss avoidance**. another cognitive bias seen in many people is what's know as loss aversion. a perceived loss is seen as much more psychologically and emotionally significant than a perceived gain. In other words, losing $100 hurts much more -- psychologically -- than gaining $100 feels good. so perhaps framing discussions around the potential cost of sticking with the current financial system, rather than the many gains of crypto, would be useful. defer to what works best for you given your audience, but some ideas could include the demise of fiat, the low, low APR of traditional savings accounts, inflation, etc. basically, why is commitment to tradtinal finance harmful, especially as it pertains to your audience's specific situation?
2. **Appeal to emotions**. oftentimes when it comes to biases, people are driven not by careful deliberation, but by emotions. you can leverage this in your favor by appealing to certain emotions that you know might promote behavioral change with your audience, or simply common emotions seen across most individuals (e.g., fomo). for example, is the person you're talking to skeptical of powerful entities? use that to your advantage. highlight the concern (I.e., fear) of many that the few at the top dominate financial systems, and explain how defi could mitgate those concerns. People are driven by different types of emotions, so it's probably best to figure out what drives yours and tailor your message to that
3. **Highlight that crypto adoption is becoming a norm**. social norms have a huge effect in driving behavior. if you talk to someone about how commonplace crypto is becoming (e.g., wow, x number of new people are using crypto every single day; y % of people in your age group now use or want to invest in crypto!), particularly for others who share the same attributes with your audience, that could help persuade them more to see the benefits
4. **Highlight immediate benefits**. people are largely influence by immediate rewards, so if crypto can offer that (e.g., monetary credit for joining a platform), that could compel some to give it a shot, or at least look into it
5. **Wait until your audience has the time and mental energy to talk.** part of the reason why status quo bias exists is because it's easy. that is, inaction is clearly easier for people than action. after all, the form means they don't have to do anything! so, when talking to new people about crypto, make sure the context is right. make sure you both have the time to have a through discussion, and make sure they aren't tired or distracted by something else if at all possible. you want to have some confidence that they have the cognitive resources and time required to fully consider a new idea or action, and offer up some specific actions they can do to get started (e.g., send them a link to a good article on crypto)

once critical mass buys in -- at least to the idea that cryptocurrency has some value or traditional finance may not be all it's cracked up to be -- exponential growth can occur. social contagion will eventually take hold for good. it seems like we're headed on that path already (although I don't know what the data look like on that), but the more people buy in and the faster it occurs, the less likely it will be that the big players will be able to squash or hobble crypto's growth and adoption along the way. 

these are just a few ideas off the top of my head; it's not an exhaustive list. there are clearly lots of other factors and psychological biases at play, bot that underlie resistance to crypto and techniques that can help promote change, but I just wanted to give some here a starting point to break the crypto ice and get the conversatiin surrounding these issues going here. curious to hear others' thoughts. 

tldr: people prefer what they're comfortable with. if you want new people to consider crypto, highlight losses incurred with trad fin, appeal to emotions, describe crypto adoption as a norm, highlight immediate rewards of adoption, and wait until your audience has the time and energy to talk.",1626019044,4,1

oi65z2,JohnnyBlack22,"""Only Invest What You Can Lose"" is Misleading | Debt is not Evil","There are a lot of young people on this subreddit becoming financially literate for the first time, so I'd like to share a few not so obvious things I've learned in the last 5 years that I *really really wish* someone had told me when I was 20.

# Everyone Invests, Some Just Don't Know It

You don't get a choice whether to ""invest"" or ""not invest"" your money. If you ""haven't invested"" your money, you've just invested in cash. In the United States, that means you've invested your money in the United States Dollar (USD).

For an ideal currency, leaving your money in the currency means that it doesn't gain value, and it doesn't lose value. It just remains there, with its same value, until you purchase with it. That's why, traditionally, people have thought of leaving money in cash as ""non-investment.""

There is *supposed* to be no risk to lose your value, and no upside to gain value. Key phrase: *supposed to be.*

When your Grandparents or older folks tell you things like ""cash is king"" or ""you should always have some cash on hand,"" they are giving advice which is drawn from their experience of a far different monetary environment than the one in which we currently live. Theirs was closer to the ideal, where cash really was risk-free, reward-free investment.

So ""only invest what you can afford to lose"" is quite misleading. Typically, the person telling you this is telling you to invest more of your money in cash, and less in other traditional ""investments."" This is an awful idea, because when investing in cash, you are guaranteed to lose. 

There is no investment strategy in the world that is immune to losing money, even cash. There is simply risk-reward for each investment. And in the current environment, cash is a particularly bad one.

# Cash is Trash

Today, cash is a high-risk, no-reward investment. Central banks are increasing the money supply at an astounding rate. In the United States, the money supply [increased](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL) by about 25%, or $5 trillion (a little more actually) in just 2020.

Money supply increase devalues the currency with respect to economic output:

* If economic output is stable, then a 25% increase in money supply means that 1 unit of money gets you 20% less than what it used to.
* Let's say the economy grew 25% with the money supply. Your 1 unit of money can now buy the same as it could before, except that you were entitled to have that money go *farther* as the economy grew, and that was taken away from you.

The point is to communicate to all young people that if you are holding cash, you are hemorrhaging money. A conservative estimate for the cost of holding cash over the next decade is 10% a year.

# Living Expenses

Old wisdom is to always keep at least 6 months living expenses on hand in cash. It's referred to, tongue-in-cheek, as ""fuck you money,"" the idea being that if you have to tell your boss to go fuck himself, you won't starve.

In the current monetary environment, you're paying a solid premium on those living expenses, about 5% / 6 months, in order to hold it in cash. Because of this, dropping down to 3 months, or even 1 month isn't so unreasonable. It's really, really expensive to hold money in cash, so decide how big  the risk of needing fuck you money is in your current job.

If you're happy, save some money and ditch the cash. Also, the best investment today is quite liquid, which brings us to...

# Bitcoin

Bitcoin is designed as the ideal money we talked about above. Eventually (we're probably 2 decades away from this), Bitcoin won't lose value, and it won't gain value. It will just *be.* If you have 1 BTC and you hold it for 10 years, it'll entitle you to the same amount of value when you spend it as you provided to the economy when you earned it.

Now, if economic output doubled in that time, your 1 BTC will buy twice as much, but that's still just the 1 BTC of value your initial labor entitled you to, because your labor contributed to that doubling.

Currently, only a very small fraction of the world understands that BTC is the store-of-value asset layer of the future, and so only $1 Trillion of the likely $200 Trillion that will end up there is already there. That's why BTC, *today* is an investment, and not merely money.

But BTC, fundamentally, is *not* designed to be an ""investment"" in the traditional risk-return sense of the word. It's designed to simply hold value over the long term, the way USD and other cash does not (because governments can print more of those at will).

As such, BTC is quite liquid. Even today, you can sell BTC on an exchange like Gemini and withdraw the corresponding currency in less than a day. That means that it would be totally reasonable to hold your 6 months living expenses in Bitcoin instead of USD, and simply sell the BTC if an emergency strikes and you need cash. That way, you capture the upside of BTC, and avoid bleeding 10%/year on your living expenses money.

# Debt and Inflation

The worse cash gets, the better debt gets, and vice versa. When the value of the currency denominating your debt is collapsing at 10% a year, that means that the real value of the debt you must repay is also collapsing at 10% a year.

I'm just going to say this outright: in the currently monetary environment, paying off something like a 6% fixed rate mortgage is a terrible idea. It's throwing away *at least* 4% of your money every year for no reason.

People don't seem to realize that all financial instruments also exist as their mirror, because of opportunity cost.

*Paying off* a loan to the bank is effectively the same thing as *giving a loan* to the bank. If you have a $100 loan, and you're paying $1 interest/year, after one year, you have -1$, then -2$, then -3$. The bank is gaining $1/year from you over the long term.

All you're doing when you pay that off is reversing who gets the $1/year. If you pay that off, and now you have $0, $0, $0, instead of -$1, -$2, -$3. *You* are now earning $1/year, with respect to the loan option, instead of the bank.

When you pay off a loan, you are loaning the bank. Would you rather you have $100 and the bank gets $1/year, or the bank has $100 and you get $1/year.

Ask yourself - in the current inflationary environment, do you really want to be loaning the bank your hard earned money for a paltry 6%? And the lower the interest rate, the worse that is.

# Summary - Opportunity Cost is Everything

Money doesn't exist in a vacuum. All uses of money must be compared with all other possible uses for that same money.

Cash is trash. You want to avoid holding it if at all possible.

Bitcoin is very liquid, it will probably appreciate, and it's engineered to maintain its value across time. It's a better vehicle than fiat (government created and printed) cash in every way.

In an inflationary environment, paying of debt is a bad idea. You'd much rather take a loan from the bank than give the bank a loan. Interest rates matter for this. If the interest on the debt is high enough, it still may be correct to pay it off.

Any interest rate under the rate of monetary expansion is essentially free money, as long as that money is placed in an asset that will hold its real value.",1626016167,121,1

Typically, during expansions there is not only no discount, but a 10-15% premium over NAV. When we do see a return to ATH, this could correspond to a ~25% arbitrage when compared to buying Bitcoin outright. 

Is there any legitimate reason to not just buy GBTC? Obviously the problem of “not your keys, not your Bitcoin” but is this really an issue for a regulated security with billions under management? This isn’t exactly Mt. Gox. The benefit I could see to owning Bitcoin outright is you could yield farm, but you’d be hard pressed to match that arb. return. Not to mention taxes are way messier that way versus owning a stock.

oihejm,dragonmomz,I made a Bitcoin valuation model that generates accurate Buy-Sell signals for trading,"Bitcoin has been called Digital Gold, a bank in Cyberspace, and also a Ponzi scheme. 

For this valuation model, the distinction doesn't matter. The thesis is that Bitcoin is at least as valuable as the total value stored inside it. 

If Bitcoin is digital gold, it can be valued similarly to Gold – the more people exchange dollars for Gold, the more valuable Gold becomes in terms of dollars, and then the value of all Gold is equal to the total dollars exchanged for it. 

If Bitcoin is an E-Bank located in cyberspace, the logic is the same, you can think of it as a shared savings account between all owners, the balance of which is equal to the total amount deposited, and the amount of Bitcoin held by each owner is equivalent to the number of shares in the bank.

If Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, the fair value of a Ponzi is the same as the total amount investors have put in it. 

This leads us to the first component of fair value, which is the total amount deposited. This is also approximately equal to the Realized Capitalization. 

But ""Store-of-Value” is not all that Bitcoin is. With the advent of the lightning network and El-Salvador adopting it as a legal tender, Bitcoin has already cemented its status as a currency. In addition, because of its sovereign properties, it is also a call-option on becoming THE reserve currency of the world. 

For each day that Bitcoin resists attacks and doesn’t die, it further proves its value proposition, and the call-option trends towards becoming ITM (In-The-Money). 

This call-option premium is modeled with a regression with ‘days without dying’ as one of its main predictors. This is the second component of the valuation model. 

The addition of these two pieces, the realized cap, and the call-option premium, leads us to a fair value of Bitcoin, denoted by the blue line in the chart below. Historically, cycle-tops have been approximately 3 MADs (Mean Absolute Deviations) away from fair-value, denoted by the red line, and cycle bottoms have been 1.5 MADs away, denoted by the green line. 

[Model outputs as of 7\/11\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/5dmxpkraroa71.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0f32ae490f14d28682603c8ca4daf3e2bee8521)

The green and red lines can be used as buy and sell signals. These signals are sparse as there have only ever been four buy/sell signals each in the history of Bitcoin, but they’ve correctly identified ALL cycle tops and bottoms.

oih5ev,LastFireTruck,Bitcoin Newb. Trying to figure out GBTC.,"I know GBTC is problematic. Adds a whole extra layer of complexity to my upcoming investment. But… it's a portion of my retirement account that I want to invest, and I find that in the US GBTC seems to be the only feasible option. Looked into Microstrategy. Impure play scares me. Would prefer BTCC, but Fidelity won't allow int'l trades for retirement accounts.

I'm thinking the next few weeks are the right time for jumping into GBTC, but I'm still confused about a few things.

&gt; The 6 month GBTC lockup is only for institutional investors getting GBTC shares at NAV, right? Doesn't apply to retail investors. Now that there's a discount to NAV Grayscale has closed the trust, but again this doesn't apply to retail investors just buying GBTC shares, correct? So, for retail investors you can jump in and out at will at any time?

&gt; Does anybody have any sense about whether the imminent unlock will result in expanding the discount to NAV or narrowing/eliminating the discount?

&gt; More on timing. I'm trying to wait as long as possible to buy in, not because I need BTC to drop to $20K, but because I have to liquidate part of another investment that is gaining and might spike this month. Anybody have any ideas about how long BTC might go sideways or what the risks are for waiting a few weeks (particularly in light of the GBTC unlock possible effect on BTC or GBTC discount)?

&gt; Does anybody have a feel for if/when GBTC converts to an ETF how that will go down and what the risks are to the discount to NAV will be if, say, other ETFs get approved first. Would seem like there would be a huge exodus from GBTC if it's not the first, or in the first simultaneous group approval of, ETFs. It would suck to find the share price plummeting against NAV when I'm trying to sell out of GBTC to get into an approved ETF.

Thanks to anybody who made it this far. I appreciate any help and insight you can give. The learning curve is crazy thanks to the SEC not approving any ETFs. I've spent more time trying to figure out Grayscale than bitcoin.",1626053236,25,1

I have recently taken advantage of this consolidation period and have fired a few large bullets at Bitcoin and a few other solid coins (Yes, I am newer investor in the space). My position is long as I believe global Bitcoin adoption is a very likely possibility. That said I wanted to pick the great minds of this thread, especially from those who have been here for a long time, to ask advice on what the right strategy is for the long game. I KNOW NO ONE CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE but I believe that history is generally a great indicator. 

So here is my question...HOW DO I APPROACH BULL RUNS?

My strategy is to basically continue to DCA into Bitcoin weekly and treat it as a long term savings bucket, pretty straight forward. 

Here is where I need some help... What do I do when the price skyrockets during a bull run. For example there is much speculation that Bitcoins price will spike at the end of this year and maybe into next. I guess I just need to figure out do I 

A) take profits during a bull run and redeploy those profits in a bear market? 

B) Don't sell anything and wait until the next bear market to DCA weekly?    

C) Just keep DCA every week regardless of price for the next 5-10-15 years? 

My goal is to STACK AS MUCH Bitcoin as possible and hold for the long run and I am just trying to figure out how to maximize my efforts during these times. 

Thank you so much",1626042007,13,1

[How they steal your Bitcoin. Remember the Bitcoin ICO? Right, there wasn't one!](https://preview.redd.it/0rfw58rlbza71.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f80112ec07e750706a764f258ed4e2f61a14f836)

**Bitcoin is the culmination of humanity's 7000-year quest to perfect a democratic, disintermediated system for value exchange**.

It separates the monetary system from the state/central entity and sets every man in the world free from other men.

[ Central banking: The last vestige of slavery ](https://preview.redd.it/hksrkimr2za71.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47682fe3a840261ce50bd115d75728929a0da108)

There are three fundamental properties of Bitcoin that altcoins will never have because all altcoins compromise on one or more of these fundamental non-negotiable aspects to market themselves as ""better"" at the cost of security.

**Mathematically Infallible**

There is not an entity that's capable of enforcing change to the protocol or monetary policy in Bitcoin. Nobody can change Bitcoin's monetary policy, period. The issuance rate 10, 20, 50, 100... years from now is known and nothing can be done to change it.

Other protocols have already shown how unreliable they are in this regard because a single person/entity is effectively in charge.

We've seen u/vbuterin repeatedly meddle with his coin's protocol direction and monetary policy. If Buterin wakes up tomorrow and goes ""let's cancel PoS"" or ""let's cap the supply"", then you bet your bottom dollar that will happen.

**Real-world Cost Input**

No barrier to entry to participate in the issuance and distribution of coins. You can buy a miner and start mining even if you have 0 sats. The cost input is not a barrier.

The recurring cost input from miners is what links Bitcoin to the physical world and makes sure that miners don't just hoard the coins they mine but are forced to redistribute them. Bitcoin's network architecture, interface with the physical world and difficulty algorithm are key components of Bitcoin's meticulous game theory equilibrium.

This is one of the reasons POW is indispensable. With POS, there's no link to the physical world and the rich keep getting richer without any real-world cost to cover.

**Self-verifiable Truth**

This is arguably the most important aspect of Bitcoin. The cost to run a full node is very cheap. Because it's cheap, you don't need to run your node on centralized cloud servers like AWS which happens with almost all altcoins.

This was the crux of the blocksize wars and why Bitcoiners went to war with miners and corporate interests in 2017 and unflinchingly defended the right for every person to be able to run their own node.

If you're not able to run your own node because either the cost is prohibitive or the consensus model doesn't allow it, then you're not really free from other men. You're not verifying the truth yourself and you're delegating trust. We already have a system that involves delegating trust - the fiat monetary system. What's the point of going from bankers to anonymous ""validators""?

**Bitcoin Beyond Money**

Lastly, when you talk about other utilities beyond money, the reason Bitcoin doesn't have every new fangled thing you see on altcoins is that altcoins can afford to experiment and fail, Bitcoin cannot.

u/vbuterin's project is basically one failed experiment to the next - ICO to kitties to STO to DeFi (but actually CeFi) to NFT to dog coins...

Think of altcoins as testnets for Bitcoin. Anything worthwhile will inevitably end up being built on top of the most secure POW blockchain in the world.

**Bitcoin's latest upgrade, Taproot, which is set to go live in November, allows any L2/sidechain contract to be executed as a regular transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain**. **This is huge!**

This means Bitcoin can have any ""utility"" protocol built on it without bloating the base layer and thereby making sure that even 100 years from now, it will remain cheap for anyone to operate their own full node.

**If we cannot run our own full node, we're not really free from other men.**

Glassnode’s July 12 *Week On-Chain* report found that Bitcoin reserves on centralized exchanges have fallen back to levels not seen since April, the month that saw BTC blast to its all-time high of roughly $65,000.

The researchers noted that during the bull run leading up to this peak, relentless depletion of exchange coin reserves was a key theme. Glassnode concludes that much of this BTC went to the Grayscale GBTC Trust or was accumulated by institutions, driving “a persistent net outflow from exchanges.”

However, when Bitcoin prices slumped in May, this trend reversed as coins were sent to exchanges for liquidation. Now, the net transfer volume has moved back into negative territory again as outflows increase.

The report also noted that the proportion of on-chain transaction fees represented by exchange deposits declined to 14% dominance this past week, following a brief peak to around 17% in May.

On-chain fees associated with withdrawals saw a notable bounce from 3.7% up to 5.4% this month, suggesting an increasing preference for accumulation over sales, it added.

 

The fall in exchange reserves appears to have coincided with an uptick in capital flows to decentralized finance protocols over the past fortnight.

According to DeFiLlama, the total value locked has increased by 21% since June 26 as it climbed from $92 billion to $111 billion.

As the pressures placed on the market by China’s cryptocurrency crackdown begin to subside and the Bitcoin (BTC) hashrate starts to show signs of recovery, traders are now focused on how the price will be affected by this week's unlocking of more than $550 million worth of Grayscale's GBTC shares.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the early morning downtrend in BTC on July 12 continued into the afternoon as the price of BTC dropped below the $33,000 support level after bears took control of the market.

it's been a rough day since the cryptocurrency market is not going well

Many of you might agree with this haha...

So recently, I've been looking for a new business model that's emerging in the cryptocurrency market and found this ABP Token.

\[Asset Backed Protocol\] basically is a token specialized for real estate NPL. Based on block-chain technology, it works as a real estate-specialized investment platform. 

One of my friends introduced this idea of Asset Backed Protocol and I believe it is a high potential. It is a real asset unlike other tokens with vague values.

Webull is a SEC registered, SIPC insured broker (up to $500,000 in securities insurance), known for being the biggest competitor to Robinhood and one of the biggest investing apps in the app store. It also allows you to buy the majority of cryptocurrencies available in the market. They have awesome features and a really beautiful app/user interface. I would highly recommend this app to everyone interested in investing. They blow Robinhood out of the water in every single way possible!

They have a limited time promotion going on right now: Register an account with the referral link below and get 2 free stocks worth up to $2300!

For the first stock, you don't need to do anything. Just create an account using the referral link. To claim the second stock, you need to deposit $5 into the account. Once funds are settled, you can claim the stock.

If you're not interested in investing in crypto, i'd still recommend signing up just for the free cash. You don't even have to use their app, you can just sell whatever stocks you get from the promotion when the stock market is open during the week and transfer the money back to your account. And then spend with whatever you want, or transfer the money to your brokerage of choice. 

Obs: To get two stocks, it has to be done through a referral link. Otherwise, you will only get the one you get from depositing $5 into the account.

ojq9ll,cryptomann1,"Why Core does not support the ""spawn a wallet with 12 words"" format?","For instance in Electrum when you create a wallet you can spawn your wallet anywhere on the planet by remembering 12 words. This is insanely useful. With Core you have to carry a wallet.dat, and then encrypt this file and try to hide it somewhere safe. You can't cross borders with encrypted data since they stop you on customs check, airports, etc. If you upload the wallet.dat online even if temporarily and encrypted it is a risk because it got saved on some HDD server.

Anyway my point is, why you can't do this in Core exactly? 

What i've found related to this is this:

[https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/88237/is-there-a-reason-to-why-bitcoin-core-does-not-implement-bip39](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/88237/is-there-a-reason-to-why-bitcoin-core-does-not-implement-bip39)

Andrew Chow explained how BIP39 isn't considered secure and that is why Core does not implement it. But then he also explains Electrum does not use this anymore, yet Electrum still gives you the option to spawn wallets with 12 words. On the Electrum website they say:  ""Electrum 2.0 derives keys and addresses from a hash of the UTF8 normalized seed phrase with no dependency on a fixed wordlist."". So the question would be, why isn't Core using this method for wallets then? Electrum devs still consider secure the ""show 12 words for seed"" method when creating wallet, why not Core?",1626214204,19,1

The government didn't get created for evil, they originally created themselves for the protection of value. They gave power to the smart people that found ways to store value only to get controlled by them later on. Maybe Satoshi are the governments taking back control from the shadows? Or maybe the people that started it all knew corruption would be part of life but it was still the only way to get economies going at that time and now we finally have enough global peer-to-peer power of information to stabilize the corruption and concentrated power. What purpose could the government have for making your life miserable? The happier we the people are, the less headache they have, the less fear of anarchy and death they face, the less hard decisions and loss of sleep(the non-corrupt ones) they face...

If say Robinhood was to go bankrupt, I’m presuming that they would payout up to the $500k insured amount to that investor. With that said, since you don’t have it stored within a hard wallet, at that point they would sell your Bitcoin on your behalf leaving you without the ability to continue to hold you original investment even through somewhere else, right?

I’d appreciate any feedback anyone has! I’m new to contributing here as this is my first post. Thanks guys!",1626210337,6,1

Your digital value will go up and so will rent since they wont sell you the homes. DO NOT SELL YOUR HOME TO BANKS! they are making up stories so be careful. My moms friend just got offered 40k more on her home, the people didn't even ask any questions or come to look at the home and told her some story about friends and family living in the neighborhood and they want buy no matter how the home looks.

ojndoj,JohnnyBlack22,I Don't Want to be My Own Bank,"There's a funny little quip when people get mad after they lose their coins:

""I want to be my own bank.""

""I lost the keys to my bank.""

It's tongue-in-cheek, but it's actually quite accurate. Being your own bank is a ton of responsibility, and if you wanted that, you pay the price if you mess up.

But I, and I think many other people as well, really *don't* want to be our own bank. We're very happy to pay a small fee for someone else to store, manage, and secure our wealth.

Banking itself is not the issue. Banking is a useful, free-market evolved service that many people (like myself) absolutely love. All I need is to hold my wealth in a *currency* that isn't controlled by someone else.

Let's say the risk free return on capital is 6%. I'd be happy to take 4%, and have whoever does my banking take 2%. It'll be someone super familiar with private keys, and backups, and scams, and hackers. That's what I want. To pay for a banking service the same way I currently do, but a service built on top of a non-inflationary, decentralized asset.

I think being your own bank is *extremely* overrated, and ""not your keys, not your coins"" is not a tenable long term situation. It puts an extremely large burden on every citizen to spend hours and hours studying security and technology, just to secure their wealth. It ignores the entire driver of modern civilization: *specialization.*

No one can print more Bitcoin. The ability to create currency out of thin air (or essentially free credit) and give it to your constituents is the real problem. Banking itself, again is simply a useful, free-market industry which there will still be plenty of demand for in a Bitcoin world.

I think ""banking"" and ""central banking"" have gotten confused over the last decade. Every industry is corrupted when it's in bed with government, and banking is no different. Banking itself is not the problem, and banking built on top of a deflationary currency should be quite a useful service in the future.",1626205720,93,1

okga5s,mosesy,Bought a property this week thanks to Bitcoin,"24 years old at the moment. Have been wanting to get into passive investments for the last year and I found a condo in my area for around 60-70k. The goal is to rent it out for income 

I store a good amount of my Bitcoin and other cryptos with BlockFi to earn interest….they also offer the ability to get a loan through them. Instead of selling my Bitcoin to buy the property…I put my crypto up as collateral and got a cash loan equivalent (almost) wired straight into my account. Used that to buy the property! No banks involved at all In the process. Best part is after I pay off the loan (which I easily can right now) the collateralized crypto returns back to my account!

So while I didn’t buy this property with Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin did allow me to retrieve the cash equivalent of my loan. Times are changing and Bitcoin really is the future, I feel bad for those not keeping up.",1626304793,335,1

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Asked about the Fed's plans for a digital dollar, Powell replied: “As we are the international reserve currency, we believe we need to get this right and we don't feel the need to go first. In fact, we already have the pioneering advantage because we have the world's reserve currency. ”  
... On the rise of stablecoins (stable cryptocurrencies), Powell stated that ""There is clearly a demand \[for currencies\] and we have been very focused on providing better regulatory responses to potential global stablecoins."" According to Powell, studying stablecoins is a top priority for the Fed, as ""they can become systemically important overnight.""

&amp;#x200B;

Now get back here.

Have you ever stopped to imagine this: most countries in the world have their international reserves in dollars - Brazil, for example, has $356 billions - news in March 2021). Thus, it is not possible to deny that this is a fiat currency that move the world and business as a whole.

A series of concerns thinking here:

1- How is it that the ""health"" of cryptocurrencies can be maintained in the long term with the main ""threat"" being the ""centralization"" of central banks and their fiat currencies? Or the Opposite: How can central banks enter the decentralized world of cryptos in a way that does not undo all the power and underwritten capacity of their fiat currencies? It's a knot in the brain 😆.

2 - Here comes a number of other things in my mind: bitcoins, for example, are finite... which would prevent a person from just concentrating all this power for themselves in a physical wallet (imagine the hardware with all the Bitcoins already created in the world 🤣. This is a Rich guy!!!), or within digital central banks in your countries?

I go even further: would it be possible to still have a universal crypto currency of free circulation that has the same power as the dollar has today?",1626292439,12,1

I came really close to selling. I had my hardware wallet plugged in, typed my exchange address, placed a test amount and pressed send. Then my hardware wallet notified I had an invalid address, I made a typo. I paused and though, am I really going to sell, is this it? No Lambo? No citadel? No trip to the moon? No this can't be it. I decided I would take any job, no matter what it was, be a online typewriter, be a virtual assistant, take on low interest debt, anything to stall me from  selling. In the end I didn't sell. Today, despite bitcoin being ""low"" it is still my best performing asset. Today, I have even made buffers to prevent me from panic selling. I bought 2 safes, i placed my keys in 1 safe and placed that safe in the other safe, so a hardware wallet in a safe in safe.

oko917,BeGoodie,Analysis - Similarities to Oct '18 - Jan '19,"Hi all,  


Just thought I'd share something interesting I've found when looking at the weekly chart of Bitcoin with 9 period bollinger bands - at a glance I could hardly distinguish between the below two time periods.  


Note: I am relatively new to technical analysis and this in no way constitutes any form of advice. Just happy to share my curious findings with you all.

 

**BTC/USD - 15th of October 2018 to 14th January 2019**

* Weekly chart, 9 period Bollinger Bands
* Local high preceding volatility squeeze = $6700
* 54% correction, 2 large red candles after 1st squeeze
* Huge volume spike on second red candle
* Formed a multi-year bottom (never reached again) of $3100
* Time from local high to the weekly candle within second squeeze = 91 days

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: TradingView](https://preview.redd.it/gxqqrsfwybb71.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca45a21c96b7d5fdfe7766e0b0b0fa30de4fac02)

&amp;#x200B;

**BTC/USD - 12 April 2021 to 12 July 2021**

* Weekly chart
* 9 period Bollinger Bands
* Local high preceding volatility squeeze = $64,800
* 55% correction, 2 large red candles after 1st squeeze
* Huge volume spike on second red candle
* Local low formed of $28,500, is this a multi-year bottom?
* Time from local high to the weekly candle within second squeeze = 91 days

**Conclusions**

It is very interesting to see the similarities in these two moments in time, even down to the dollar figures involved (you could multiply the 2018-19 prices by 10 and get almost the exact scenario we have today).

This could point to our recent low being the equivalent of a bear market low as experienced in the 2018-19 scenario. In the earlier scenario, a big run to the upside followed to $13,800 approximately 5.5 months later, eerily similar (by a multiple of 10) to the \~$140k price prediction of Celsius' Alex Machinsky by the end of this year.

The most notable difference between the two scenarios are that the volume was much higher in the 2018-19 scenario compared to now, but its unclear to me what impact this would have.

Whatever the case, most likely this year ***does not*** play out exactly like 2019 did, but it is still interesting to see a plausible picture of the next 6 months or so for Bitcoin.",1626336022,0,1

For anyone looking to get started, here is a list...","In the past years, bitcoin has seen tremendous growth in terms of adoption not just by people but by companies, investors, and even entire countries. 

A lot of businesses are realizing the power of this digital currency and the value it holds. 

There is really no better time to start accepting bitcoin payments on your webstore. The market is flooded with a number of payment gateway companies offering varying benefits to people.

One key distinction between various payment processors is based on how *decentralized* they are, a characteristic that is inherent in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Such processors usually have: 

* No identity verification — KYC/AML
* Non-custodial payments (payments are *never* in custody of a third party) — P2P \[Peer-2-Peer\]
* Slightly technical setup
* No fiat support

**Centralized** payment processors on the other hand offer a less technical setup but payments are usually held by third-party companies making them slightly risky. 

Here is the list of the top bitcoin payment processors:

1. GoURL: It is a 100% open-source cryptocurrency payment gateway offering a **WordPress** Plugin and an **API**. For custom-made websites, GoURL offers API for various programming languages including *PHP, JSON, C++, Java*, etc. 
2. Blockonomics: For BTC payments, it offers plugin integration for **WordPress**, **Prestashop, WHMCS, Wix, Squarespace,** and a **Payment API** for custom implementation.
3. BTCPay Server: A self-hosted, open-source cryptocurrency payment processor that offers plugin integration for **WordPress**, **Prestashop, Magento, Drupal, Custom Integration,** and **API.**
4. MyCryptoCheckout: A crypto payment plugin designed for **WordPress**. It's a Peer-2-Peer gateway that allows merchants to receive payment directly to their wallets.
5. CoinRemitter:  Crypto payment plugins for eCommerce merchants are available for **WordPress, Magento 2, Opencart, PrestaShop, Laravel, PHP,** and **REST APIs**. 
6. CoinPayments: They offer support for hundreds of cryptocurrencies and plugins for a variety of webstores making it one of the most comprehensive payment gateways in the market. 
7. Coingate:  Coingate provides support for multiple eCommerce CMS, including **WooCommerce, Prestashop, Magento, WHMCS, OpenCart**, and more, plus 100+ altcoin support. 
8. BitPay: They offer plugin support for almost every eCommerce CMS including, **WordPress, Prestashop, Shopify, WHMCS, EDD, Magento, Drupal**. 
9. Coinbase:  Offers support for **WooCommerce** and **Shopify** and charges no fee for crypto payments. 

*Blockonomics, MyCryptoCheckout, BTCPay, GoURL* are decentralized and do not require KYC. 

BitPay and Coinbase are infamous for their centralized model and have come under a lot of criticism for it but they still remain the top 2 payment companies by size and number.

olegh6,somalley3,Deflationary debt spirals,"Naturally, it’s pretty exciting to have conversations about the many ways that Bitcoin is fundamentally changing and potentially improving the world. Whether it because it represents money for the people that is decentralized, secure and auditable, or the fact that it is provably digitally scarce and defined by a fixed currency supply making it the world’s most pure hard asset, or simply the innovations and technology being built onto its layered protocols, i’m inspired everyday by it as both a network protocol and an asset. 

And while I’d be among the first to explain to others the flaws with our current monetary system, the many ways in which inflation is a form of theft, the cantillon effect and quantitative easing etc., every now and then some part of me wonders deep down whether a world with a fixed and deflationary reserve currency represents a broadly better alternative (from an economic theory perspective) or whether it simply transitions us from one extreme to the other. 

The Bitcoin Standard fantasizes about the world during the gold standard and implies that a Bitcoin standard would be a permanent return to that, but I would push back and argue that there’s many more nuanced reasons as to why the gold standard failed from a business cycle and monetary perspective than simply arguing that it can only fail because of government greed and abuse. 

Ray Dalio has written plenty about the dangers of deflationary debt spirals and how they can destroy a society. I wonder if, while enriching those of us who already own it, a Bitcoin standard wouldn’t be terribly restrictive of global economic growth and progress as allocation of capital becomes much more limited.  For example, many of the great technologies we enjoy today (from Facebook to Google) may never have been created because “loose monetary policy” and low interest rates is what made it economically feasible for them to be developed and exist despite not being profitable for some period of time. 

There’s many other examples of how a deflationary currency alters the dynamics behind the growth in loanable funds and investment and correspondingly GDP. Would love to hear whether others have shared the same thoughts and concerns, counter responses and alternative versions of reality, flaws in my thinking etc. 

TLDR: A fixed money supply greatly limits the allocation of capital which would hinder governments from funding many of the services we rely on and stall economic growth. BTC is good at taking back freedom  but very long term (decades or centuries) i wonder if it’s good for the economy",1626432651,65,1

[Caixin.com](https://Caixin.com) published an article ""China Says Goodbye to Bitcoin Mining"", which recorded the closure of a Bitcoin mine in Sichuan, China through several photographic pictures. Among them, a picture recorded a Tibetan woman carrying a mining machine. Since this picture recorded the historic moment when the Bitcoin mine in Sichuan, China was closed, and resembled the well-known oil painting \`\`Rice Gleaner,'' it quickly sparked heated discussions in the Bitcoin circle and was named ""Summer of Mining Machines"" Dora""

3) nobody can unilaterally change the rules of Bitcoin unlike central banks can with their fiat. 

4) I can take my funds across different geographies either by storing the recovery phrase in my brain or leave it in my phone. This is a problem for people with a lot of money. If you don’t have a lot of money this is not a problem for you. 

5) instead of buying fine art, collectible wines, real estate, gold, or anything physical, I now also have an asset class that is purely digital as an option to store my wealth. 

Would appreciate additional thoughts/perspectives. Thank you.",1626424957,36,1

olb8yw,Howard_Roark_Hagbard,Living in El Salvador for Bitcoin Libertarians," Hello everyone. 

I've been in bitcoin since 2013 and I'm accumulating all the time. I am a libertarian. I am raised in the works of Mises, Rothbard, and other members of the Austrian School of Economics. My question is as follows.

 Does it make sense at the moment to emigrate to El Salvador and invest your bitcoins in local infrastructure development? I am a network engineer and unix / linux administrator. I have always dreamed of having my own ISP company, preferably in combination with a cryptocurrency mine. 

I currently live in Europe and in relation to Agenda2030 it is very difficult for a person with views of freedom to live here. Not economically but I feel that this is no longer my place on earth. 

Is El Salvador a good place to live for a person like me? What do i need: 

\- Little bureaucracy

 \- Low taxes

 \- Relatively good health care 

\- Safety for living and running a business. 

I am asking especially about security for a foreigner, because on the Internet you can read that El Salvador is one of the least safe countries in the world and I would like to verify it somehow. Post written using google translate, so sorry for mistakes.",1626417206,38,1

olsnpo,billy-gage,New investment opportunity in bitcoins,"  

Currently, the use of Bitcoin has spread worldwide, and it can be said that in every country in the world there are people mining this famous cryptocurrency. However, there are countries where Bitcoin is more widely used, so much so that there are companies, businesses and even ATMs to carry out transactions with this cryptocurrency. Being a currency not issued or controlled by central banks and the international banking system in general, they have been developing a campaign by all possible means with the aim of discrediting and the use of cryptocurrencies, and all because I use cryptocurrency releases those who use it from the control of banks and governments.

The operations carried out using the block chain cannot be monitored or controlled by any specific person or organization since it is a completely decentralized system. Some governments in the updated are trying without success to control the income that their citizens obtain in these currencies. Some even, like the Venezuelan government, tried unsuccessfully to create their own currency, which of course no one trusted or will ever trust. In the United States, for example, they have tried to issue regulations that force their citizens to declare their income in cryptocurrencies, since technically governments have no way of finding out this information as if it happens with their banking information. 

What is true is that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and it is indisputable that, in the near future, despite the war against them by banks and governments, their use will become more and more widespread due to the fact that each time more people are gaining confidence in them. In the race of some to get hold of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, many entrepreneurs, let's call it that, with knowledge in the world of computing, and of cryptocurrencies in general, have developed several strategies, the first and best known of which is bitcoin mining. which requires a strong investment in Hardware and is increasingly less profitable for reasons that I will not explain now. Another way to get bitcoins is simply by buying them from a friend or on an online platform that currently exists for these purposes. Another way is by trading cryptocurrencies, which consists of obtaining profits through the prediction of the price fluctuations of the different cryptocurrencies. This last way of earning cryptocurrencies requires a certain level of knowledge to perform this activity because otherwise the money used for trading operations will surely be lost. Another way and it is the one that interests us now and that can be used by anyone is making investments in sites that are dedicated to attracting micro investments with the aim of carrying out large-scale trading and / or short-term financial investments in the currency market.

The creators of these sites are teams of people who have acquired experience and knowledge in the field of finance, trading operations, and computing and cryptocurrencies in general, allowing many micro-investments to generate large amounts of capital to generate profits. which are systematically distributed among the micro investors. Sites like these are the famous Trust Investing that generates so much controversy regarding its legality and whether it is a scam, a Ponzi scheme or not. One thing is true, people invest in this site and make a profit, beyond the fact that they may not be legally well supported, which is very well understood if we remember that governments and banks systematically campaign to smear everything anything that has to do with cryptocurrencies. 

Many allege that companies such as Trust Investing are not officially registered in any specific country and if they are, it is not possible to locate their offices or representatives. But the explanation for that does not have so much to do with the business being a scam as it is the option they have as protection against actions of banking institutions and governments that are not very friendly with these types of companies. The most obvious case of this is what happened in Cuba, where one of the most recognized members of Trust Investing was arrested by government authorities on charges of illicit enrichment. In the case of Cuba, many Cubans use these platforms as a means of obtaining income that cannot be controlled or confiscated by the government that systematically works to ensure that the population remains in poverty. It is estimated that at present more than 300,000 Cubans have inerted in Trust Investing and it is generally recognized if they have received significant gains that have influenced the improvement of their living conditions.

Trust Investing is one of the most recognized sites to invest in cryptocurrencies but there are others such as Mind Capital, Mirror Trading, Arbistar, X-Toro. Personally, the writer knows of people who invest in Trust Investing and X-Toro and until now they continue to make profits. Another site that began operating since 2020 is PIETRAVERDI, which is where I am registered and so far I am doing well as well as other people I know. The site is currently officially registered in Costa Rica. I have always considered the possibility that one day the site will stop operating as can happen with any of the other sites that have been operating for several years, but by that time I will have recovered the investment I have made and thus I will not have lost anything and the most possible thing is that in fact I have already earned much more than I invested. The principle of investing in these sites is never to invest in anything that we are not willing to lose. In my case, I invested as little as possible at the beginning, which is what I always recommend. In this case in PIETRAVERDI it is 25 dollars in bitcoins, because this particular site operates only in this currency. PIETRAVERDI pays 24% per month on the amount invested, which is 1.2% daily from Monday to Friday, fixed. 300% of each package invested will be recovered. This means that if $ 25 is invested, the site will pay up to $ 75 for that investment package. The amount is recovered faster through the referral system, since for each new referral captured, the site pays the person who captured it 10% of their investment, that is, if a referral enters and on a given day buys a package of 25 dollars the one who brought it to the site will add to his recovery amount of that day of 1.2% of the package invested the 2.5 dollars corresponding to 10% of the package purchased by his referral. An important element is that registering on the site can only be done through a referral link from someone who is already registered on the site.

PIETRAVERDI also offers the possibility of recovering the investment even faster through the binary network system that consists of building a network of referrals that in turn bring more referrals, dividing the network into two parts hierarchically located below each new user who enters. to the site, so that each new user will be able to have a direct user from each side of the network underneath in the network scheme, the network being successively divided into two for each new user. The earnings per binary network will be 6% of the leg that has the least accumulated points for that day on a given day. The points are equal to the amount invested in a package, if you buy a package of 25 dollars it will be 25 points. It is therefore important not only to attract new referrals that in turn bring new referrals to expand the network more and more, but it is also important to distribute the new referrals so that the two legs of the network are balanced, since the profits 6% will be calculated, as I mentioned before, on a given day of the leg that has the fewest points on that day. Earnings from direct referrals and binary network add to the investment amount recovered and once the investment amount has been recovered, it must be invested in a new package to continue earning. Always for each package 300% will be recovered. It is possible to buy several packages and for each one, the daily 1.2 will be recovered from Monday to Friday and only one of them will be added the amount earned by direct referrals and by binary network, once 300% of a package has been recovered what was earned by referrals Direct and binary network will go to the next purchased package, if you do not buy a new package you will not be able to earn money through binary network or direct referrals and of course no interest. In addition, the maximum amount to earn daily for 1.2% plus 10% of direct referrals, plus 6% of binary network will not exceed the amount of the largest package purchased. This must be taken into account because there are users who have a very large binary network and the daily earnings are therefore significant and can reach hundreds of dollars a day, in the best cases, so it is very important to monitor their behavior and growth. of the network so that it grows in a balanced way on both legs and that the daily amount of earnings never exceeds the amount of the largest package invested because it will be losing money.

To make the first extraction from the site, which will always be to a bitcoin wallet, it will only be necessary to have a minimum of 25 dollars accumulated. I decided to invest in this site for several reasons, the first because it was highly recommended to me by people I trust and with foolproof decency. The second thing is that the site has only been running since the beginning of 2020 and these sites usually, in case of being a scam, last a few years, that is, the sites that arise with the ultimate objective of scamming their users accumulate money for a few years. 5 or 6 years, maybe more and suddenly one day they stop operating, although sometimes they start presenting problems with payment or technical problems on the site. Trust Investing, for example, has been operating for quite some time, I am not sure of the number of years, but it still pays its investors, according to some I know who invest there. In addition, after entering PIETRAVERDI the impression I have is that everything is very well organized and so far it has not stopped paying what they promise, although it has not been a long time, so the earnings are not significant yet, although other users who They entered before and they already have a more developed binary network if they have started to earn more. Finally, another aspect that I left for the end, although it is not the least important, is that normally platforms of this type are usually very sensitive to abrupt variations in the price of cryptocurrencies, even Trust Investing itself had some problems for some time during the recent fall of bitcoin, although afterwards it has continued to operate. However, PIETRAVERDI was operating normally at all times. If after reading all of the above some interest has been aroused in taking the test of investing in this new world of cryptocurrencies and you want to do it through PIETRAVERDI, you can do it through my referral link that I share below, but before you Here are some instructions that you should read well and follow to the letter: 

INITIAL REQUIREMENTS TO REGISTER PROPERLY IN PIETRAVERDI:

A) The email with which you register must always be from GMAIL. (This is very important, do not use Yahoo, Hotmail, etc).

B) Always use the PIETRAVERDI website in Portuguese, do not translate it into Spanish or English.

C) Check 5 times that your GMAIL email is well written, without fingerprints, or errors and without blank spaces before or after the field where you wrote it. If your email has an error and you start investing, it will be impossible for you to get your money out of PIETRAVERDI for security reasons. It is not possible to change the email once a user account has been created. After reading and understanding the initial mandatory requirements, you can proceed to create your username through the following link:

[https://office.pietraverdi.com/rafael77](https://office.pietraverdi.com/rafael77)

The data requested during the registration process must be the real ones, name and surname, etc.

Any questions during the process get in touch with your sponsor, that is, me in this case. Once registered, they will be able to share their own referral link to new potential investors to build their own referral network. Remember that the objective of the binary network is to attract referrals who are willing to invest, even if it is in a minimum package initially, because if a new user registers and does not invest, it is never a place in your network that will be occupied for pleasure. If a new referral invests in a minimal initial package later, they will invest more, once they are convinced that the site works and is reliable. After registering and when you decide to buy your first package, which I recommend that the first time is always the minimum, verify that when you create the user account in PIETRAVERDI, an email reaches the Gmail account that you used to register. If the email does not reach you, the registration was incorrect and you should not under any circumstances buy any investment package using that account.

To buy an investment package, you must first have a fund in bitcoins to be able to transfer bitcoins and buy the package. Remember that in bitcoin operations it is necessary to pay a transaction cost in addition to the amount to be transferred, that in some wallets it is necessary to calculate the total to be transferred by adding the amount to be transferred plus the transaction cost and in others the same It calculates the cost of the transaction separately so that you are always sure that the amount you want to transfer in bitcoins is the one that will reach the person who is transferring it. 

That said, let's move on to the operations that must be done within the PIETRAVERDI platform to buy the first package. For the purchase of PIETRAVERDI packages it is recommended to access the site through a personal computer or Laptop, since it is an easier interaction process to do the operation, it can be done through a telephone, but obviously it raises a greater difficulty. First, you access the menu called Contracts that is located in the upper left part of your user's BackOffice, once you access this option, the following is displayed: 

https://preview.redd.it/2m9fkttolnb71.jpg?width=551&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea9915fa347f93fc36b4e431f73c3a282854563d

Here it is selected, as it is the first time that a package is purchased, the minimum is 25 dollars, once selected, click on New Plan. At the bottom of the screen a new contract will be added that in status puts in open or pending. At this moment you click on the yellow button that says bitcoin that is below on the right:

https://preview.redd.it/xgdxy2hzlnb71.jpg?width=589&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2feea860842f2313a4991ef7e75db93c04dc14e9

If the site was accessed through a PC, a new window will open in the browser, displaying the following information. The following information will be displayed:

https://preview.redd.it/4pja0ya5mnb71.jpg?width=589&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0f5169959f9087d4ac1be171a3ae8fe2b86c350

At this time, the available time that is shown to perform the operation must be observed, in this case it indicates 5 hours, 46 minutes and 47 seconds, here in reality the time was 6 hours only that when the capture was made, a few minutes had already passed Normally contracts are for 4 hours, which is also sufficient time and is the time that is most frequently given to make contract payments, the time depends on the congestion of the blockchain that day. You should never accept a contract that only shows 2 hours to complete the transaction. In case of showing only two hours, exit the application and wait another day to buy the package.

One of the important data here is the wallet address that that sequence of numbers and letters that begins with 3LCN and ends with CPtW, that address is to which bitcoins must be transferred from a wallet that has funds for it, I must do the Warning that this address of the image is an example, it does not occur to anyone to transfer anything to it because they will surely lose their bitcoins. The address to which you must transfer the bitcoins is the one that will be generated at the time you are performing the purchase operation of a package. I suggest that this address is always copied from here and pasted into the wallet from which it will be extracted, verifying that the copied number is always the same as the one pasted and that there are no spaces before or after it is pasted, thus avoiding loss of money when making the transaction. The other data is the amount in Bitcoins, which as observed is 0.00211 BTC, which means that during the time that the purchase of the contract lasts, which in this example we already mentioned was 6 hours, a payment of 0.00211 BTC will be accepted and that amount will be equivalent to $ 25.

It must be guaranteed that when making the transfer, the amount of bitcoins that arrives at PIETRAVERDI is exactly the one requested in bitcoins in this case 0.00211 BTC because while the package purchase transaction is active that amount will be the equivalent of 25 dollars. The cost of the transaction in bitcoins is an additional value in bitcoins that is not included in the value to be transferred to PIETRAVERDI, my suggestion is that they use a normal operation cost that takes around 30 minutes or the priority one that owes around 10 minutes. A longer delay puts the receipt of payment for the package at PIETRAVERDI at risk. I recommend using the Mycelium wallet. 

 The contract screen should not be closed until it is confirmed that the package is already paid for. To verify that the package is paid without closing the contract screen, go to the initial tab of the browser and update the page, the paid contract will appear in status as paid. If it does not appear paid, the contract window should not be closed, wait and then refresh the page until the state says it is paid.

Once the contract is paid, the screen with the contract data can be closed. The initial screen will show that 75 dollars is pending payment, since 300% of the investment is recovered:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/grjjvit3snb71.jpg?width=457&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5105252eba84f627ad500942316a0e4a7a9a6e4c

Before making a money withdrawal from PIETRAVERDI you must have a minimum amount available of 25 dollars and have the financial key that can be obtained by requesting it on the PIETRAVERDI site, accessing the options that are displayed when clicking on the user with whom you accessed being inside the site.

https://preview.redd.it/n0qta14mnnb71.jpg?width=293&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51c2843293800610f95f8d5989aa7b68a03d8506

The financial key will be sent to the Gmail email with which you registered on the site. Once you have the financial key, you can make withdrawals as long as you reach the minimum of $ 25 accumulated and available to extract. To make a withdrawal of money in you go to the Financial-Take out backoffice option:

https://preview.redd.it/wlt3106rnnb71.jpg?width=566&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb5d44d1e5df63512d28d0da523f151d6cd1da34

https://preview.redd.it/l94bcarqonb71.jpg?width=589&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d797c0f1d45973cccae4d4030e7be461e1fd5a37

Where it says carteira, the wallet address to which you are going to transfer the money will be pasted. You can delete a previously used address or add other addresses when making other extractions. Where it says value and confirm value, the amount to be extracted will be written and where it says Financial key, the financial key sent to your Gmail email will be written. The financial password that is sent to the Gmail email can be used every time you want to make money withdrawals from PIETRAVERDI, it is not necessary to change it. Great care must be taken not to leave spaces before or after the wallet address to be transferred. When all the data are correct, click on request service. PIETRAVERD charges 5% for each extraction transaction.

Final tips: 

Be patient, the process of assembling the binary network can take a long time, do not expect to earn a lot of money overnight. If they are patient and follow an adequate strategy of attracting referrals over time they will reap the rewards in the form of significant profits. It is also possible to earn money by making several investments thus obtaining a compound interest and accelerating the obtaining and profits. In addition, the site has additional money stimulus forms for users that attract many additional referrals to 6% of the binary network. Once they get into the business they will see that it is an excellent way to generate sustained income over time.",1626477884,1,1

Could anyone use the paper wallet generator code to reverse engineer 12345 and create the private key to match with it? Or the script could generate 12345 and create a new private key that is VWXYZ... either way they'd be access whatever gets sent to 12345?

I know this isn't the case, but I want to know how/why that isn't the case, please! Hopefully the nature of the question outlines my technical understanding; more than a no-coiner, less than an enthusiast.

olpjsb,PM_ME_YOUR_THESES,GOLD CUP SHITPOST: El Salvador v Mexico,"Hello friends and fellow HODLers.

So, lately, there's been a lot of enthusiasm around here for El Salvador, first sovereign nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender currency. I think we should extend our support to El Salvador in their upcoming soccer match against Mexico, in the Gold Cup!

1. About the Gold Cup

What is it? It's a soccer tournament. In soccer, there is a World governing body called FIFA which oversees the rules of the game and the organization of the World Cup (and other, smaller tournaments). National Federations of soccer clubs are, of course, members of FIFA. But other important members of FIFA are regional confederations. You've probably heard of UEFA or Conmebol. UEFA organizes the Champion's League between the top clubs in Europe and the EuroCup (recently won by Italy), while Conmebol organizes the Libertadores Cup (between the top clubs in South America) and the Copa America (recently won by Argentina). Similarly, the area of North America, Central America, and the Caribbean has its own Confederation called CONCACAF. CONCACAF organizes the region's equivalent to the EuroCup or the Copa America. It's called the ""Gold Cup"", and for commercial reasons, it's always held in the United States. This is the biggest international tournament held in America that most Americans have probably never heard of.

Usually, either Mexico or the United States wins the Gold Cup, as they are the countries with the most developed soccer infrastructure in the region. However, soccer is extremely popular in other countries in Latin America, too, like Costa Rica, Honduras, and, of course, El Salvador. In fact, [in 1969, Honduras and El Salvador went to war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_War) (literal military conflict) over a soccer match! And there's no team that Central American countries compete hardest against than Mexico, who frequently called themselves 'the giant of CONCACAF', often undeservedly, and who belittles their national team and leagues. Mexico is the team to beat.

2. About the match

So, my proposal is to cheer for El Salvador as a proxy to cheering for Bitcoin. But also, let's cheer against Mexico. Why? Here are a few reasons:

a) They suck ass. They always belittle and abuse their neighbors to the south will playing victim at the treatment they get from their northern neighbor. You've heard of the migrant crisis? Those migrants are not Mexican but Central American, many of them Hondurans and Salvadorans, and where do you think they get the most abuse? Not in ICE detention, but in Mexico's INM, not to mention, of course, the Mexican cartels...  

b) Mexico is anti-bitcoin. Yes, you've heard of Salinas Pliego, the Mexican billionaire that has invested 10% of this liquid assets to bitcoin. Well, he tried to integrate bitcoin payments and bitcoin accounts into his bank, ""Banco Azteca"", and was quickly rebuffed by Mexico's banking authorities and the Central Bank, Banxico. Mexico's government's official position is that bitcoin is a ""speculative digital asset"" that has no place in the retail financial sector. 

And have you heard of Agustín Carstens? Agustin Carstens is the current chair of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), so called the central bank of central banks. He's the counterpart to the IMF's Christine Lagarde, coordinating with the central banksters from around the world in case they ever need a global bailout from their fixing of the their national economies. He's also Mexican, formerly head of Banxico, and prior to that, head of Mexico's Finance Ministry. He set the policies that today put Mexico against bitcoin. 

On top of that, Mexico has a long history of infringing on FIFA rules against discrimination by having the crowd yell an homophobic chant. They have done this every match, and continue to accrue penalties. FIFA has threatened them with barring them from the World Cup if the behavior continues, and since Mexico are sore-losers, the behavior will continue if they continue to lose.

c) The match. Mexico is the obvious favorite to win. But we like underdogs here, right? El Salvador, against all odds, currently leads the group. Mexico needs a win to secure passage to the next round, but El Salvador qualifies with a tie. Mexico's stars Hirving 'El Chucky' Lozano and Raul Jimenez are injured, so El Salvador has a real chance here. The game is on Sunday night. Tune in!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: The Gold Cup is the equivalent to the EuroCup, but for North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. Usually, the finalists are USA and Mexico, and Mexico has won most often. The tournament is held in the USA. This Sunday, El Salvador play Mexico. The winner will lead their group and secure a qualification to the next round. El Salvador only needs a tie to achieve this. Mexico is the favorite, but we like underdogs. El Salvador is the pro-bitcoin team. Mexico is the anti-bitcoin team, that is also obnoxious and homophobic. So, I invite everyone here to support bitcoin by proxy of supporting El Salvador, and tune in on Sunday!",1626467980,3,1
olpezn,Samalamm99,I got scammed…bad.,"So earlier today I was graced with a woman who would help me with getting into investing and “flipping” my money Now that I am familiar with the terms, I now know that “flipping” is a load of BS. So I started with $200 on cash app, buying 196.00 of bitcoin and then sent it to her. She then told me that I needed to “send her $500 for confirmation fee” and I told her I only had $458 left in my ENTIRE account total. She said she would be fine with it and she would help me so I get the best amount possible flipped. I sent it to her and she then stated it was “updated to 400…” so it was now at 4k being flipped and I stated I didn’t want that I just wanted to do the confirmation fee and get the 2500 back. She told me if I sent her 1k i would get my money. I told her no I don’t have that and she told me to ask friends for it. I said that’s BS and she said she would pay it off for me. Then she requested a validation of ID and SSN. I told her fuck that no. I called her out and told her to just revert it back to me and give it back, but she said basically “Fuck you call the police idc”. I have contacted my bank and they said it was still pending on my card, and Cashapp has made a dispute claim. Is there ANY hope for me to get my money back? I know there is a blockchain, I don’t understand what any of that means. 

Now I get it: I messed up. and I have DRASTICALLY learned from this situation. 
Can someone provide some insight or at least tell me what I can do or if there’s any hope at all for me?

As far as I understand there is an limited amount of Bitcoins, still a lot but it is limited. So my question is simple (I think).
The rich (like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates) have no possible way of spending all their Money, except donating huge amounts. They are, maybe unwillingly (if that makes sense), hording a lot of Bitcoins and not spend them therefore making them not accessible to the public. 
Won't the point come when the lower classes don't have access to Bitcoin anymore or a very limited amount? 

Let's say there are 100 Bitcoins.
50 Bitcoins are owned by states.
30 Bitcoins are owned by the richest 10%.
And the remaining 20 are owned by everyone else.
(Oversimplified but I hope that makes it clearer)

The Bitcoins owned by the state and the ""normal"" population is in circulation, getting payed in salaries, spend in stores, Taxes and so on. The richest 10% being, mostly, unable to spend their wealth will get more and more Bitcoins and therefore starve the state and the general public of their main currency. 

Will there be a point when we run out of Bitcoin because some people have most of them?

It could be a stupid question but it is on my mind for the past two hours and I need an answer. Thank you in advance.",1626461067,197,1

Over 13,600 bit coin shorts have been recorded while 51,000 long positions were observed on the derivatives exchange, Bitfinex. This leaves the market ripe for a short squeeze. 

With Apples rumored $2.5 billion purchase, the market could witness a short squeeze. 

The occurrence of short squeezes in the bit coin market is fairly common and in the event, a strong pump will leave short sellers in the mud leading to LIQUIDATION!

The short squeeze will trigger a price rally that will lead to the increase of Bit coin’s market capitalization which has been brought down to $611 billion. The common sentiment is that bit coin will continue to crash into the 20's pushing everyone away from entering the market or taking their money out but is this discount what the whales have been looking for?

3. Something else

If option 2, how much from the taxable brokerage account do you sell?

Few reasons:

* Usual point about unit bias, but feels easier to grasp - *bits* already implies a smaller denomination of bitcoins, *sats* needs to be explained.
   * *""You don't have to buy a whole coin, you can buy 1000 bits""* vs.
   * *""You don't have to buy a whole coin, you can buy 100 000 sats""*
* Easier to explain in relation to major fiat currencies:
   * dollars / euros and cents
   * pounds and pence
* Easier to explain in relation to a bitcoin:
   * 100 sats in 1 bit
   * 1 million bits in 1 bitcoin
* Pricing for most items makes more sense than using bitcoin or sats. People are already familiar with using 2 decimal places in commerce. Some hypothetical examples:

||BTC|bits|sats|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Coffee|0.000095 BTC|95 bits|9500 sats|
|Big Mac|0.00016 BTC|160 bits|16000 sats|
|Computer|0.032 BTC|32000 bits|3200000 sats|
|Article Paywall|0.00000395 BTC|3.95 bits|395 sats|
|Podcast Stream|0.0000005 BTC / min|0.50 bits / min|50 sats / min|

&amp;#x200B;

* Future proof
   * Bitcoin at $32,000 \~ $1 = 32 bits
   * Bitcoin at $100,000 \~ $1 = 10 bits
   * Bitcoin at $1M \~ $1 = 1 bit

This also [doesn't change or introduce any new terms](https://bitcoin.org/en/vocabulary#bit), bitcoins and sats are just as valid and should be used if it's more appropriate, just think that in most cases bits / sats is more useful.

I also don't think it would add confusion. Americans are all familiar with a cent, a dollar and a grand. People in India and South Asia all know what paise, rupees and lakhs are. I think we can manage sats, bits and bitcoins.

ollet2,living_space,Contrarian view on CBDCs (single point),"It’s obvious that everyone is keeping a close eye on the ongoings, and trust me I am like everyone here wondering what’s going to happen. 

I do not have the authority to say how it will unfold, although I can speak to one specific aspect surrounding the concern of traceability. 

What I hear goes something like… the gov will track every transaction and we will lose even more privacy

I’m not here to defend or discount CBDCs. No matter how illogical or logical, their existence is inevitable. So instead, I’m just outlining a single point. Whether cash is in physical or digital form, anonymity (frictionless flow) will be a component in the design. 

Take paper currency for example: by design not easy to track and follow. Go back further to gold coins: again, same thing. 

Free flowing cash is necessary for a free market to function properly. 

Breaking anonymity for some extra tax money would not add up to be enough to compensate for the friction it causes in the market. 

Surprisingly, in the late 90s an American economist predicted the need for a digital currency - all while clearly stating anonymity as a function.

Time and again, friction is left out.

The following excerpt from Wikipedia describes the environment at the time. Sound familiar? 

The Kansas City Star described a national climate of ""high unemployment, inflation and double-digit interest rates [which added] pressure on builders to win contracts and complete projects swiftly"". Described by the newspaper as fast-tracked, construction began in May 1978 on the 40-story Hyatt Regency Kansas City. There were numerous delays and setbacks, including the collapse of 2,700 square feet (250 m2) of the roof. The newspaper observed that ""Notable structures around the country were failing at an alarming rate"", which included the 1979 Kemper Arena roof collapse and the 1978 Hartford Civic Center roof collapse. The hotel officially opened on July 1, 1980.

You also have full control of your bitcoin with your keys.

omfdi5,Snowwzzz,Up to $2300 worth of stocks! Limited time Webull promotion,"This promotion is a no brainer for everyone out there interested in more buying power to buy more crypto on the dip!

Webull is a SEC registered, SIPC insured broker (up to $500,000 in securities insurance), known for being the biggest competitor to Robinhood and one of the biggest investing apps in the app store. They have awesome features and a really beautiful app/user interface. I would highly recommend this app to everyone interested in investing. They blow Robinhood out of the water in every single way possible.

They have a limited time promotion going on right now: Register an account with the link below and get 2 stocks worth up to $2300.

For the first stock, you don't need to do anything. Just create an account. To claim the second stock, you need to deposit $5 into the account. Once funds are settled, you can claim the stock.

If you're not interested in investing, i'd still recommend signing up just for the cash. You don't even have to use their app, you can just sell whatever stocks you get from the promotion when the stock market is open during the week and transfer the money back to your account. And then spend with whatever you want, or transfer the money to your brokerage of choice.

Bitcoin doesn't have ERC20 tokens or a programming language like Solidity, so the backend isn't going to be the same as ETH defi. However, I do believe you can create decentralized financial applications for bitcoin that on the frontend function the same for the users as ETH defi. It's going to be engineered with a different design philosophy and more centralized/decentralized in some areas, but accomplish the same goal for the user.

As we know, the weak point of Ethereum right now is the network fees, and I think Jack Dorsey is trying to hit Ethereum where it hurts. With the lightning network bitcoin fees are reduced to near 0. Another weak point for Ethereum Defi is user interface. If Jack Dorsey can build a platform with a more friendly and easy user experience, I could imagine Bitcoin Defi stealing some of Ethereum's thunder.",1626559511,70,1

If there will only be 21 million EVER and some will be prone to loss (and assuming the species keeps growing) will less than 21 million be enough for 10/15/20 billion humans? Will another unit smaller than the Satoshi eventually be needed? If so, is that akin to devalue or debasement?

And that bad actor can stay undetected at least for some time. But.....

If s/he changes that old transaction, *and* then is able to find right hash for the new block before everyone else, *and* can then ""force"" a consensus on the network (because s/he controls &gt;50% of compute power) the fraud will *still be plain obvious* to a minority of ""behaving"" nodes on the network. 

Because by the very nature of SHA256 algorithm, the hash of the last block in the chain (before the above 51% attack took place) will have suddenly changed too.  

Doesn't that make the 51% attack detectable *immediately* upon occurrence? Where am I going wrong?",1626552435,9,1

om8ll4,charleyeeee,Bitcoin Maxi Needing Some Help,"So as the title states, I am looking for the options of you all to help me in this situation. 

I (27M) have been a Bitcoin maximalist for quite some time and I feel like I truly understand the value Bitcoin and and will continue to play in our world. I feel so strongly about Bitcoin, because I have put in so much time and effort through the years learning. 

Recently, my sister (23F) came to me asking for some assistance with investing her money. She has been stacking cash and has created a great nest egg to get her started thanks to her efforts of working hard and saving. 

To give a bit of background. Our father is a financial advisor and because I have always took an interest in it, we have always spoke about it and I have learned a lot through him. My sister was never really interested or seemed to care. All she wanted was the cash sitting in her shoebox. With everything going on my dad and I speak about BTC alot.. like to the point my sister gets annoyed about it. 

We truly believe it is the best place to put your cash long term for the future with the best returns with the least risk.. opportunity cost. 

I asked what she was thinking about investing in or how I could help. She responded with, well I'm not really sure where to start. I gave her some response to the idea that Bitcoin would be the simplest, quickest, and best way for her to allow for her money to appreciate. She of course is very turned aways by that idea because she has never cared to actually learn what Bitcoin is and it's value. 

She stated that she has been watching lots of TikTok videos on how she could buy house/real estate to do Airbnb because it's so easy and she says she can live off the income. I am unaware of her true knowledge in this area and feel like she is just getting the very bare basic information on how easy it is, but she has not thought about all the time, energy and efforts she would have with going through the real life process. In addition she is still having to pay for her own rent, which counteracts what she would be having to spend for the mortgage, fees, insurance, taxes, etc. In hopes that she would make a % difference from her costs and what she would make renting through Airbnb. In addition, her money is not liquid at all and she is taking on more unnecessary debt for the chance to make some profits with the uncertainty of the property decreasing/increasing in value.

Overall, I am unsure how I should go forward with this conversation. I would like to help her, but how would I best go about that? Our father always told us, invest in what you know and what you enjoy learning about. She has no interest in learning about Bitcoin at all, even though I believe it will be bigger than what the internet is today. I want her to think about her future and how she wants to spend her time, energy, and efforts. But, in the end, we all don't know what we don't know. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or advice on how to approach this situation? 

If you have any questions, I left out anything or you need additional info, please ask.",1626542691,13,1

Is this just a matter of Bob broadcasting a ""normally fraudulent but potentially helpful"" transaction that spends the money to him, without Alice publishing a 'punish' transaction?

#### Mass control and mass surveillance are the real truth and goal behind theses very dangerous measures, every smart person know that.Further on, we are stepping in a total and global digitalised world.Where everything is controlled by and from the technology :

#### QR code, banking system, security system and so on …Digital euros and other governments cryptocurrencies are in development and soon will be implemented, cash will soon disappear.This is our 2.0 golden handcuffs where everything will be traced and controlled by the power in place.Privacy is one of biggest right and freedom that any human being on the planet should have.

#### Quick exemple :When you are having sex with your partner you are closing your windows not because you have to hide something or you are doing something wrong but just because you are protecting your privacy.

#### Privacy is freedom.

Now ask yourself : How can we fight back? How can we take back our power and freedom? not everyone is a developer or hacker, not everyone can bypass this high-technology and the power in place by themselves.

**The solution :** First we have to look at the root of all problems : the financial banking system.

PRINTING ILLIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY and bailing up only the big players, leaving the real economy in the dust, is the main factor that keeps this corrupted power in place.As we all know on this planet there is always a cure for any disease and yes this is a disease !

The cure is cryptocurrency technology, and we are now certain that it’s the most powerful and efficient threat to the entire global financial world order.

We are still in its early days and we don’t have yet it’s full potential deployed but we can see already how it affect the central banks, having them stating multiple time that they have to urgently regulate cryptocurrencies markets or they will lose their sovereignty.

Some of you are waking up and some resistance groups are forming, and especially the Mechanics of the future team which are one of the leader in the matter. Developing a complete anonymous cryptocurrency ecosystem will place every holder and users into a special untouchable position. 

By joining our forces throughout the network of nodes of the upcoming IPRO blockchain of Insider protocol, based on the mimble wimble protocol, we will be able to give birth the most unstoppable cryptocurrency ecosystem on the market. And by this mean building our safe zone where anyone will be able to take back their freedom and mostly their financial freedom.The more you're going to be using decentralized cryptocurrency ecosystem the more we are all going make the old banking financial system disappear, and the more we will take back our power and freedom

I bought bitcoin in 2019, below $10k. When it peaked near $60k I sold a third of it making some nice profit and put this money into some less volatile assets.

At the time of writing, I basically have bitcoin risk free as the initial investment has been taken out of the markets, plus profits, now I just got a bank loan (roughly $25k) which I'll pay in 5 years at 6.8% interest rate. I figured, I'll have this BTC on blockfi getting ~5-6% and getting more BTC with very low risk, if BTC goes south, I have enough money to pay back the loan and liquidate my position.

What do you guys think of this strategy? Imo it's sound and puts me in a nice position for the next 10 years.

Given the recent difficulty rate adjustment, I realized I didn’t quite understand something. It will be hard to articulate, but here it goes. 

When the difficulty rate adjustment happens, does it compensate for the previous periods slow or fast blocks?

For example, if for 2 weeks we are solving blocks only every 20 minutes, then we are behind schedule 50% on blocks (extreme example). Does the difficulty adjustment factor this in, and set us up with a new schedule that will bring us to where we SHOULD have been? Or does it just shoot for 10 minute blocks, and hope that the behind schedule periods and the ahead of schedule periods even out?

Part of my concern in asking is because we almost always, until recently, see difficulty adjustments increase… meaning that without a prorated correction mechanism, we would consistently be ahead of schedule….?

I suppose I could do the math and figure it out for myself, but I wanted to see if anyone knows.",1626584843,6,1

oog8v8,4homiptthrowaway,My bank shut down my account and banned me for life after trying to buy bitcoin from Kraken. What do I do?,"Hey guys, I will make this post short so it is quick and easy to read, I am asking advice because my bank (or rather credit union) recently did something to me that is really unfair and pissed me off, so I want to get some compensation for it or try to hold them accountable. I am pretty sure what did they is illegal/not allowed and I need some help or guidance from the community. Any help is greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Ontario, Canada and I do personal banking with Meridian Credit Union (I know, they're a crap company). I recently signed up for the bitcoin platform Kraken, after hearing about it here. I got verified, submitted my ID and went to make a purchase for some Bitcoin off their website. I was instructed to send a bank wire to their overseas account so I could complete the purchase. The next day I went to my local credit union (Meridian Credit Union), which is not technically a bank but for all intents and purposes works the exact same way. I had all the money lined up in my account (about 25K CAD) and was ready to buy a bitcoin (purchase was for about 0.6 BTC).

&amp;#x200B;

I sent out the wire and I chatted with the teller, told them I heard about Kraken and that I was buying bitcoin for the first time. Explained I saw it as an exciting opportunity and wanted to make some money off of my investment. The one teller was really nice but the other was being kind of nosey and rude. I don't want to assume things but she seemed like a Karen and kept asking where the money came from, how I got it and if it is mine, kept acting shocked that I had 25K of disposable income to spend, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, fast forward a few days and the wire is not received by Kraken, despite all the info being correct. I call up my credit union and ask what's wrong, turns out the bank ""flagged"" the wire for ""Security reasons"" or suspicious activity. Eventually after a week of fighting with them over it, the wire was eventually reversed and bounced back into my account (minus a 50 dollar fee). I was not able to buy the bitcoin and my bank blocked me from sending a payment to Kraken.

&amp;#x200B;

That alone would be fine and I would have moved on, but it gets worse. About a week or two later, I got a call from my credit union (Meridian) and they called me to inform me I was permanently banned from Meridian and they would be closing down my account, and I had to come withdraw all my money so they could close it. I asked if I could be reinstated and they said no, I was banned for life and I wouldn't be allowed to reopen a new account. I asked why and they said over the phone there was ""suspicious or illegal activity"" coming from my bank account, and they could not work with me any further. I am not involved with any illegal activity whatsoever, my income is 100% legal (I work for a company and get T4 slips) and it was my first time ever buying bitcoin in my entire life. It seems like the conversation I had with the teller about Kraken ""tipped them off"" and they misunderstood it as being something illegal.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on the harshness of the lady's tone over the phone, I am worried they possibly even alerted authorities or tried calling the cops on me because of this stupid Karen who works at the bank. I now have to switch banks to a new provider (eg BMO or RBC) and every time I go to Meridian now (for things like cancelling my cards or withdrawing my money) the Karen at the teller gives me a really hard time.

&amp;#x200B;

So what gives? This is absolutely ridiculous and I did not expect this to happen. What do I do? Is there any way I can try complain somewhere or demand some sort of compensation? I feel like the whole situation is extremely unfair and a big misunderstanding, and I also don't even think a bank or credit union is allowed to do this to someone, especially a paying customer. So what do I do? What are my options for demanding compensation? Is it possible to take legal action against them or is doing so a waste of my time?

&amp;#x200B;

Any help or advice is appreciated. Thanks",1626832219,97,1

At first tried to transfer the blocks folder from my laptops HDD to the SD card but I was having trouble with that. So I backed up my wallet.dat and deleted bitcoin core /all files and decided to download the entire blockchain again. 

I edited the bitcoin.conf file to direct to the SD card which is datadir=D:/Bitcoin.

Everything is going well blocks downloading on SD card but my question is when I add my old wallet.dat to the new bitcoin core data do I need to transfer It to the SD card or %appdata%/bitcoin on my laptops hdd? 

i uploaded pictures of my SD card folder and my %appdata% folder (appdata folder could be files left behind from my old bitcoin core data, wallet file in appdata folder is not my backup) which is why im confused 

I am assuming a SD card will work very similarly if not the exact same way as a external HDD would so i hope i can get some help

oofiie,Expired_Lizard_Milk,Companies should sell products at fixed bitcoin prices no matter what the usd value is,"I think if we want to see any price stability with bitcoin then companies should sell their products at a fixed bitcoin price in order to establish price floors.

For example, let's say a tesla model 3 was priced at 1 bitcoin. No matter what the price of bitcoin is in terms of USD this car will always sell for 1 bitcoin. This helps create a price floor for bitcoin. People would be incentivized to buy up bitcoin at current prices because they know they'd be getting a deal if they were to buy something worth 29k and use it to purchase a car worth 35k. The demand of people wanting to buy bitcoin in order to get a discount on the car would actually push the price up back to 35k.

Another option companies can do would be to buy up large amounts of bitcoin over the counter at today's prices and then offer product at extremely cheap bitcoin prices. For example, a company like Lamborghini could theoretically purchase a billion dollars worth of bitcoin OTC today for $29k per bitcoin. They then announce that the newest Lamborghini model will sell for exactly 1 bitcoin no matter what the current USD price is. Imagine people finding out that they can buy a 300k car for just 1 bitcoin which is currently at 29k... this would cause the price to skyrocket and we'd potentially see a new price floor near 300k for bitcoin due to all the demand from people buying up cheap bitcoin today in order to purchase a very luxurious car. Lamborghini as a company then benefits vastly because their OTC purchase of 1 billion dollars of bitcoin is suddenly worth 10 billion. They also wouldn't be losing any money selling a 300k car for 1 bitcoin today because pricing their latest Lamborghini at 1 bitcoin would create enough demand to establish a price floor at 300k.",1626829553,16,1

oodw05,Trenchcoat_Economics,Big Tech's next move for Bitcoin tomorrow? I think so.," Completely hammered by sustainability FUD. 

Quick recap. Here are the events of thinking us westerners used to get here this cycle, as per the public’s focus and the media's amplification:

1. **Jan 8 Elon Musk puts Bitcoin on TSLA’s balance sheet, plans to accept payments**

*“I don’t know if it makes sense for TSLA to buy Bitcoin \[…\] but I do think it could be a catalyst for sustainable energy.” — From the Ark Invest Podcast Feb, 2019*

The corporate treasury move was foreshadowed by his Twitter interactions with Michael Saylor

2**. Bitcoin consumes energy and therefore results in CO2 emissions (exponentially so during euphoric price action)**

Which he was surely aware of beforehand 

3. **TSLA stops accepting Bitcoin as payment may 12**

ESG pressuring TSLA is a highly likely outcome for this cyclical problem in which Musk has no choice but to comply, and it's not worth the publicity hazard if his company were complicit.

So far as I see it, there are two possibilities. Elon had basically no idea what he was doing, and recklessly gambled with TSLA’s balance sheet. Or this is somehow a favorable situation. He is bringing attention to the problem before presenting the solution.

&amp;#x200B;

# ""Tesla will resume accepting bitcoin payments for its cars once miners of the cryptocurrency can show they are using roughly 50% clean energy""

 \- Elon's twitter (a somewhat reliable source)

We shouldn’t put the man on a pedestal, or assume he’s altruistic. There are plenty of incentives within the largest crypto communities for him to maneuver. Big Tech shall have their way regardless, as they offer valuable influence in the battle of information. In this battlefield social media is already the marketing frontier for such debates, while traditional media is at best only incentivized to cover the controversies. Terms like “green-washing” imply cultism, or more importantly, that no debate is worth hosting.

But for Proof of Work blockchain technologies, it may be the most interesting topic to consider. Ominously, it’s the cliff hanger Hal Finney ,  early contributor and first receiver of Bitcoin ,  left as his last tweet related to the crypto.

To be clear, neither side is currently capable of fully proving their point. Jack, Cathie and I’m sure Elon will put on a good show. If the mining counsel’s data is considered reliable and more complete, it’ll unlock a more resilient narrative for Bitcoiners. If their ventures create economic incentives for developing sustainable infrastructures, in it may change the whole ball-game. With only their (quite) incomplete paper so far released, these remain fantastical concepts held by those with the power to actually change the world.

1) I sent in 2 wires on Friday July 9. I made a mistake in that I did not put the reference ID. Instead, I put my full name in the memo line. I have asked blockchain.com to either return the wires to my bank or credit my account. It has now been 12 days and I have yet to receive a response. I have opened multiple tickets, but just silence? Where is my money?    
2) I needed to send BTC urgently, so on Monday July 12, I wired in $25k and bought BTC in order to send it out. My send requests were not honored. My account activity just shows the deposit on July 11 and BTC purchase the same day. But my account balance is now $30. Why is there no record of any activity? What has happened to my money? I opened my first ticket for this matter on July 11 - it is now 9 days later and I have not heard a peep.    
3). I have wanted to sell the BTC that I bought on July 11, but I cannot trade it. I have to wait for Compliance to finish their review - it's been 9 days already!  Who will be responsible for the losses?

oosy8a,CoinCollector567,My BTC journey...,"The first time I heard about BTC was during the 2017 bull run. Like most people who heard about it for the first time I invested a very small amount without really understanding anything about what it was or did. My only aim was making a quick return so I could buy those lambos!! 

However, once the price peaked out and started to drop and the value of my holding when down and down, in fiat terms. I didn't sell and instead just chose to forget about the investment altogether. A few months later a video about BTC popped up on my recommended youtbe feed. I then remembered that I had some BTC and decided to watch the video. Can't remeber what the video was about specificially but it was interesting enough to make me want to research more about the topic. 

Over the next few weeks and months I then researched as much as I could about BTC, how it worked, what its uses were etc. I also became increasing concerned about the exteremly loose fiscal and monetary policy employeed by western governments and central banks. These two reasons convinced me that I needed to get some more BTC in order to help prepare myself for the future.

I didn't do any crazy trading stragegies or YOLOs, instead I started dollar cost averaging into BTC from early 2019 onwards, not large amounts since I was at university and didn't have much money but as much as I could spare each month. Since then the price has had its ups and downs and occasionally I fall into the habit of thinking in hindsight that I should have bought more there or sold out there but in general I have stopped paying attention to the price and instead focused on getting enough fiat to continue buying BTC!

I think what people can learn from my story is that it doesn't matter when you hear about BTC but how you approach it after you do. Once you do your research on the topic it really does open your eyes to a whole new way of thinking about money, the global economy and of course personal freedom. So to everyone reading this keep on stacking BTC and focus on yourself not the price flucuations!!",1626883482,1,1

My understanding is that instead of Bitcoin, I will receive 1.5x points per $1 spent the card but that's it is actually rewarded in ""BlockFi Cryptocurrency Rewards Points."" Once the points are deposited into my BlockFi account, it then gets converted into bitcoin.

My question is: How does BlockFi determine how much Bitcoin is actually received? Since it's still being converted from $1 spent to rewards and then into Bitcoin, what is their determination of Bitcoin reward?

Example: $10,000 spent = 150 BlockFi Cryptocurrency Rewards Points = ??? Bitcoin

If the 150 Rewards Points = $150, then that amount of Bitcoin rewards could vary depending on the time it's rewarded to me and price of Bitcoin at that time. 

Surely BlockFi isn't going to be evaluating the time of each purchase on the credit card and correlate it to the price of BTC at that point in time to adjust the rewards accordingly?

Grab Bitcoin historical price data from https://www.investing.com/crypto/bitcoin/historical-data


Click on the calendar icon to select the date range.

Set start date to Jul 18, 2010 ( the earliest data they have ).

Set the today's date for the to date.

Download and import into Excel ( or Libra Office if you're a cheapskate like me ! ).

( If you don't want to signup and download the csv simply use CTRL A to select everything on the page they right mouse click and select copy ).

Delete any unnecessary rows or columns until you have the word 'Date' in cell A1 and 'Price' in cell B1 (today's date should now be in cell A2).

Click on cell D2 and enter the formula =A1463

In cell E2 enter the formula =A1463

In cell G2 enter the formula =B2/E2

Select cells D2 to G2, and select copy

Select cells D3 until the end of your data and select paste.


You now have an awesome data set that will display line at a time &lt;Date&gt; &lt;price&gt; &lt;Blank space&gt; &lt;Date 4 years previously&gt; &lt;price 4 years previously&gt; &lt;Blank space&gt; &lt;how many times your BTC value has multiplied by&gt;


Truly amazing to see that Apr 09, 2017 was the worst day for a 4 year HODL'er to sell, as Bitcoin purchased on Apr 09, 2013 is only worth a little over 5 times what it was purchased for !

Remember that nasty red candle yesterday ?

If you'd sold yesterday (Jul 20, 2021) Bitcoin you'd bought 4 years previously on Jul 20, 2017 you'd have a fiat value a little over 10 times your purchase price.

oorim3,xcryptogurux,Visualizing Bitcoin Lightning Network growth and Taproot upgrade explained,"What is Lightning Network? (ELI5)

Lightning Network is a decentralized layer-2 network protocol that uses a native smart contract scripting language to enable instant, almost feeless Bitcoin payments.

On the Lightning Network, both parties to a transaction are required only to have a sufficiently funded open channel on the network. This is done through a single on-chain transaction.

If there is a direct channel open between the parties, the transaction is routed directly and incurs zero fees. Without a direct channel, the transaction is routed through routing nodes.

Whan a transaction passes through a routing node, it is referred to as a ""hop"". There are currently 23k nodes on the Lightning Network with 13k nodes having active channels.

Three years ago, Lightning Network was admittedly far from ideal.

*Processing img h9ll0z9rwkc71...*

But the network has seen exponential growth since, particularly this year. Lightning Network is now nigh-on a fully functional global payments network secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. Lightning wallets have also come a long way and are now very intuitive to use for the average user.

*Processing img 1auw5sjvwkc71...*

Network capacity has doubled this year. Likewise, nodes and channels have grown exponentially,  reducing the number of hops, channel lifespan and fee incurred for hops through routing nodes.

*Processing img cow6o2aywkc71...*

The growth of the Lightning Network has inspired some pretty cool developments this year,

Following the success of the Bitcoin beach project, a pilot for Lightning Network's viability as MoE, El Salvador has adopted Bitcoin on the LN as legal tender.

Other countries like Tonga, Colombia and a few other LatAm countries have expressed interest to follow suit.

Twitter will launch a tipping system on its platform later this year using the Lightning Network.

*Processing img gd1odw5qxkc71...*

**Taproot**

Now with Lightning Network's maturation as an instant, almost feeless, infinitely scalable decentralized global payments network, Bitcoin is shifting focus to its next big milestone, Taproot.

Taproot brings a set of protocols that further enhance Bitcoin's scalability through even more efficient use of block space by introducing a new type of output - Pay to Taproot (P2TR).

P2TR uses Schnorr signatures, which are more compact than the conventional Elliptic Curve Digital Signing Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures. Schnorr signatures are between 6 and 9 bytes shorter than ECDSA.

An even more exciting aspect of Schnorr signatures is that it enables the aggregation of multiple signatures into a single signature. This opens up infinite possibilities, including being able to execute multi-sigs and L2/sidechain smart contracts as a simple regular transaction on-chain.

It's a truly game-changing development, as it allows Bitcoin to have smart contract protocols without bloating the blockchain layer.

Taproot also includes optimization for the Lightning Network called Point Time-Locked Contract(PTLC). PTLC replaced Hash Time-Locked Contract(HTLC). PTLC uses adaptor signatures which enhance privacy and security on the Lightning Network, enable escrow contracts in Lightning channels and allow users to retry stuck payments.

Hello,

art  cult leader here seeking some theoretical guidance. So let's say I've  amassed a collective of talented and up and coming artists hell bent on  making the world weirder. Here's what I'm thinking, tell me if this is  stupid.

As part of our cult  initiation program, we put candidates through a crypto literacy program.  Get them setup with wallets, tips on safely storing, and how to get paid for art through crypto . A portion of each transaction  goes into a sort of shared crypto investment account. We use smart contracts to pay out a  percentage of any growth automatically (each participant paid a relative  % based on how much they've put into the pot) when it hits a certain  percentage of growth. Basically like rewards on a credit card, except  there's no limits on number of payouts.

There's  two reasons I like this concept. 1: It sort of mathematically codifies our ethos of  ""We all do better when we all do better"" and 2: It essentially makes us  our own bank without adding any operational overhead.

  
Idk, crazy? Would bitcoin be the most sensible coin to store the pot in? Could Ethereum 2.0 execute this sort of contract? Is any of this remotely possible? I'm pretty new to crypto, if ya'll have any helpful links to where I could learn about this myself, I'd appreciate that too. Thanks!",1626715061,2,1

The niara is considered monopoly money here. For the last year I've been earning from the internet. Bitcoin is helping me to get by much better than making $1 a day with money most people don't  want to accept! It was helping earn some extra profit but for now its stack until the next bull run. 

This is a post for people who are in countries similar to the situation here in Nigeria. Bitcoin can change your life. It has for me. Next time somebody offers you PP or WU ask for them to send Bitcoin. It's faster and easier once your client understands it. 

You may get lucky if they already have some tucked away. Then the only problem is getting them to let go of it :P",1626709460,13,1

The problem is that I don’t currently have a PC, only iPhone. I’ve been looking at the ledger nano X for its Bluetooth and that it doesn’t need a computer to set up or use. 

I have about $300 to budget for this, $200 in a visa gift card and $100 cash.

My other option is to get a cheap chromebook and then something cheaper for a hardware wallet like the Trezor. Ideally whatever money is left over will just be converted to btc. Does anyone have a suggestion on which would be the best way to go?

onepg8,2358452,Lightning Network limitations (the case for PoS update),"The lightning network still has severe limitations. The fees are still significant.

To open a channel, the receiver needs a collateral (say, $100). When this collateral is exhausted, you need to commit a transaction to the blockchain. With fees being high, that would still be way too high for day-to-day payments; remember that fees are multiplied by the number of asymmetric hops as well.

In terms of volume, there is still a requirement of about one transaction on the main chain per channel opening, i.e. payment processor setup (per collateral allocation time). Bitcoin supports at most about 400k transactions per day -- if every channel lasts about 1 year (very optimistic), only about 140 million users, **absolute max**, can use Lightning.

Other cryptocurrencies (like Eth) use both Proof of Stake to keep costs low, as well as sharding to enable high scalability of main chain. This means 2nd layer (or even other currencies) integrate well with low fees into the mainnet.

The largest problem with BTC is not this however. It's simply that PoW energy usage is too large. We're using far too much energy, and it's not necessary at all. PoS concerns amount to pretty much FUD (fear, uncertainty doubt) because there are proven PoS chains for a while now (I suspect there were far more attacks on PoW chains than PoS). It's criticized by people that don't understand the self-stability of the system, just like no one really understood how reliable Bitcoin can be at the start. Satoshi and original founders never spoke against PoS -- they simply didn't even consider this could be an option. In light of this PoW doesn't make sense.

As I see it, there are only two options for BTC:

(1) Switch to PoS

(2) Become obsolete

( (3) is Burn the World. Please don't. )

onenwv,BadBoyFinance,"Hey Friends! I made a video on how you can earn a passive income using your bitcoin, check it out if you're interested :)","Hey friends! First up, I would like to mention that majority of your bitcoin should be in a cold hardware wallet and NOT in the following methods which will earn you passive income. However, if you would like to earn some passive income using bitcoin/crypto currency and are accepting of the risks - I made a [video](https://youtu.be/WrWIt71vlsU) explaining how to. I always wished to be able to live of my crypto and I have finally reached that point, I hope to be able to help you in your journey as well. If you like to read instead, then I have written a guide here. Nevertheless, please take good care of yourself in this current climate :)

 1. Lending Platforms 

Lending platforms are lending services that offer deposits and loans on both centralised and decentralised platforms. Essentially, as a crypto holder, you will deposit your crypto onto these platforms and earn an interest on those crypto funds that you deposited. It's pretty similar to how a bank works. These services will hold our crypto and lend it out in order to generate interest  and this interest is then paid back to us on a regular or even daily basis. With most lending platforms, you do not have to deposit your cryptocurrency for a fixed period of time, in fact you have access to your funds at any point in time should you require to utilise your crypto. In addition,  many of these platforms provide insurance to the funds that you deposit making it one of the safest ways to make passive income. To sum it up, the beauty of lending platforms are that they allow your money to compound daily with minimal risk whilst giving you 24/7 access to your crypto funds.  

 2. Staking Coins (NOT RELEVANT TO BTC)

Coin staking is the action of staking your coins in order to help maintain the decentralised consensus on proof of stake blockchains. It's kind of like being a miner in a POW blockchain such as bitcoin. But in bitcoin - miners compete with their computing power, in proof of stake block chains - people compete with the amount of coins they stake. The more coins one stake, the higher the probability of being chosen to validate a node. When you stake a coin, you earn a a decent return of your coin in kind and you also help to secure the network of the coin you are bullish on. There are a number of things you have to consider: 

\- Wallet Support - Staking complexity - Duration of lockup  - Staking returns

 Different coins have different staking parameters. 

  3.Liquidity Mining/Yield Farming 

Liquidity mining It is the practice of supplying liquidity to a protocol which is then used in order to facilitate the decentralised exchange of different assets. The transaction fees exchange users pay in exchanging the two coins is then distributed among liquidity providers based on the proportion of liquidity they provide. Some examples of such DEXES are Uniswap and Sushiswap. However, the risk of liquidity mining is impermanent loss. Impermanent loss is the quantified opportunity cost of providing liquidity should one of the tokens become volatile in price.  For Yield Farming I recommend Yearn finance - an app which automates the process by sending your crypto currency to different platforms in order to earn the highest return possible. The risk is that your funds are being moved in yearn vaults and pools may be exploited.",1626703365,1,1

It is a kind of cool bitcoin wallet in the form of paper money that resembles banknotes traditional. In theory, anyone could load funds onto the bill and pay with it at establishments that accept BTC.

In addition, any business or trade that accepts bitcoin as a form of payment could use the banknote as a wallet and receive funds directly from its customers.

onu6ng,mredvard,Personal stories about inflation,"I was born and raised in Venezuela, 6 years ago I decided to leave for good. 

During my time there, I witnessed inflation and its consequences first hand, and I learned a few things that helped me maintain some of my purchase power and escape. Many, if not all of the things I will point out are obvious to many of you, many here are knowledgeable and can reach the same conclusions by studying some economics and applying simple logic, I’m not that smart, I had to suffer it.

Inflation seemed to have started to be a concern for everybody in 1984-1985 during the “black friday” (no, not that one you know), a day where the government devalued the currency against the dollar by 100% if I’m correct. My numbers are not exact, I’m sure if i google them i’ll get them right. It probably started before that, I don’t know, point is, it was the day that entered into people’s radar. Things continued to go downhill ever since and, it hasn’t stopped. 

 “The rich gets richer, the poor gets poorer” my dad said it ever since i have memory. It wasn’t obvious, I didn’t get it, it took me about 25 years to understand that “the rich” hold onto assets and not cash, as for the rest, the story is sad. This kind of statements are true but have negative consequences as people start to resent against those who have managed their finances properly and protected themselves, people will say they cheated, it is unfair! The playfield is indeed unfair, but it is not the richs’s fault. This will usually leads to social unrest, opening pandora’s box.


“Politicians love to print money” if rich get richer, the politicians are not exempted, they will adjust their salaries according to the properly measured inflation rates, plus, their missmanaged projects will receive funding at the beginning of the year, so they will have a chance to spend it all before the prices goes up, and lets not even talk about their complicated corrupt schemes to pocket the surplus and deposit it in foreign currencies as a hedge.

Prof Huerta de Soto explains monetary expansion is usually done in a way that spreads like honey being poured on a plate, those who gets it first, gets the best of it before it reaches the edge of the plate.  

 “Enjoy this year, the next one will be worse.” I heard this so many times, even on TV shows. It is some sort of “positive” statement for you to cheer up now and enjoy the moment, I’m not sure if it ever worked. Inflation is a degenerative process, like a disease, it wears down your income, your quality of life, your health. Its consequences can be seeing in the society in general, everythings seems to be in a constant state of decay, first people lose the power to buy their hobbies, then new clothes, then expensive food, then snacks, then cannot afford 3 meals a day. But they still have jobs, and this will lead to my next story.


“Inflation doesn’t kill jobs” it actually does but, let me explain. Is not an atomic bomb that pushes company to declare bankruptcy or forces them to fire everybody in a shocking event. Is toxic gas that slowly kills you, most companies won’t cease to exist, they will adjust their prices as their costs goes up, they will be forced to lower the quality of their products to compensate the lower sales, but people will remain in their desks living their normal lives, without really thinking about what’s going on, assuming that everything is just normal. 

I even got used to the fact that prices will always go up, I though it was the natural course of life. It is the governments objective to feed and perpetuate this lie.

“Cash is trash” pretty obvious right? people started trading cars as currency, anything was better than holding cash,  cars naturally depreciate over time, like houses or most material things, their rate of appreciation measured against the local currency surpassed the natural depreciation of the asset, in this context, people failed to see that those so called assets or hedges were depreciating, and as they saw their value go up measured in local currency they saw themselves as wealthier, but they were not, they just had a car in their garage.

“Hedging made me a millionaire” I wish this would’ve been true in the whole sense of the word. I didn’t become wealthier, my assets simply were valued now in millions of  the local currency, but I was simply able to afford the same things, maybe a bit more food, maybe a bit more entertainment, it is hard to see wether assets have more value or your pocket have less, or both. Hedging was not a winning lottery ticket, it was a shelter against the toxic gas, there was nothing to celebrate.

“CPI is in the realm of macroeconomics, not your finances” of course macroeconomics affect your finances, but doesn’t tell you the whole story of what’s happening in your pocket. The real picture of your finances is in your consumption habits and goals in life, food prices affect you, but if you are hedging against inflation, the inflation of those specific hedges affect you dramatically. If cpi inflation is at 80% annualy but your hedge is inflating 1000% annualy then inflation for you is 1000%.",1626752589,21,1

I sell you a laptop for .25 Bitcoin on that same Monday when the value is $10,000 per coin. ($2,500) for said laptop. Then say Friday rolls around and the price of Bitcoin has dropped to $7,500 per coin, so if I sold you the laptop for .25 Bitcoin I would be making less than I did on Monday in profit (about $625 less). Would I then charge more for the laptop based on current value of Bitcoin? If so that seems like a lot to keep up with for how volatile it is. Now maybe this is just basics economics and inflation but I don’t know much about that (marketing major) and I’m to tired to post more thoughts but think about it both ways as if the market were to fluctuate a couple thousand dollars over a few days. From a business owner and consumer perspective. Would love to here some thoughts on this and other made up scenarios to help me wrap my brain around the concept as this as a future universal currency and convince myself to buy more.

I sell 1 BTC for $2,000. I have 2 BTC left. $2,000 - $2,000 = I'm at break even with cost of $0 out of pocket

I sell 1 BTC for $1,000. $1,000 - $0 = $1,000 profit so I pay taxes on this gain.

I still HODL 1 BTC and I never sell. I never pay any taxes on it.

Also shout out to the RaspiBlitz team for making such a great open source project that makes running a lightning node mindless.

I have been terrified to use lightning. I don't understand how it works fully. It seems most of the resources either give you some very superficial overview, or go DEEP and require lots of time to grok. I ended up listening to the Lightning series just released on the What Bitcoin Did podcast. Some amazing information that hit the sweet spot and helped me understand a little bit better and lift some of the fear.

I don't care about earning fees. I just want to grow the network, provide more routes and more liquidity for more people with the goal of increasing adoption. Now I need to learn how to recover funds in the event I need too -- a bit of a scary knowledge gap that I want to close before I open more channels.

For anybody considering running your own node, I hope my experience might help you drum up the courage to do it yourself. I am happy to help in any way that I am able. Here are some resources:

**CONCLUSIONS:**

**WHAT OUR CURRENT FUND? WHAT IS THE INTERESTING AVERAGE PRICE OF MAKING MORE CONTRIBUTIONS?**

Taking into account the average correction of previous cycles, our average correction of the current cycle is 46% ie our average correction price is +- at $34,325.00 (PURPLE line in image 5).

&amp;#x200B;

With this analysis, it is clear that any value between $34,325.00 or less is very interesting to make the contributions, finding exact funds is a legend in this market, since we never know what tomorrow is, so it is clear that the values ​​we find today, at around $32,300 (at the time of writing this article) it is indeed a very interesting value and very affordable.

&amp;#x200B;

I say more, for me the fund that we reached of $29,500.00 was the definitive fund of this cycle, it remains to make the contributions and wait for the next chapters.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the calculations:

&amp;#x200B;

Average correction calculation - 32+71+35/3=46

&amp;#x200B;

Average price calculation of the correction fund - 63564-46% = $34,330.50  


**IMAGE 6**, purple line is the projection of the average price of the fund/correction.  


https://preview.redd.it/665606zmusc71.png?width=1801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a332ccf4a14436df6ea92281c97503af80518bb7

&amp;#x200B;

**PROJECTION OF VALUES FOR 2022**

To make this projection, I will take into account the average valuation of the ATH of movement 1 of each cycle to the peak of ATH of movement 2 of each cycle, our calculation being like this...

&amp;#x200B;

260+398+492/3= 383.33 (I will round to 383%)

&amp;#x200B;

Taking this average into account we have:

&amp;#x200B;

63,564.83+383%= $307,018.12

&amp;#x200B;

There is something else that I find interesting to take into account, notice that with each cycle that the BTC had, the second movement had an even greater appreciation compared to the first (cycle 1 260%, cycle 2 398%, cycle 3 492% ), in my opinion, this is mainly due to the increase in the media and the ecstasy of beginning investors in this market. With each cycle that the BTC reaches new highs, more is said about it, more is said about investing in it, more new people enter this market envisioned with the possibilities and profits, if we take this into account we can have an even greater appreciation.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's calculate...

&amp;#x200B;

If in cycle 1 we had an appreciation of 260% and in cycle 2 we had an appreciation of 398%, this means that from cycle 1 to 2 we had an increase in appreciation of 53.08% (260+53.08% = 398)

&amp;#x200B;

If in cycle 2 we had an appreciation of 398% and in cycle 3 we had an appreciation of 492%, this means that from cycle 2 to 3 we had an increase in appreciation of 23.62% (398+23.62% = 492)

&amp;#x200B;

If we look at these percentages, we see that in each cycle, despite having greater valuation (more people entering and more media), we also have a decrease in this increase in valuation, this decrease is 55.5% (53.08-55.5 %=23.62)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, taking these factors into account, if in cycle 3 we had an appreciation of 492%, in cycle 4 we could have an appreciation of 492+10.5% = 543.66%.

&amp;#x200B;

(The 10.5% valuation growth comes from the 23.62% of the previous valuation growth discounting the 55.5%.)

&amp;#x200B;

If we have an appreciation of 543.66%, we will reach the value of $409,141.38 (63,564.83+543.66% = 409,141.38)

&amp;#x200B;

**THENNNNN...**

We have these two scenarios, both very optimistic, the first taking into account a type of calculation and predicting our BTC at $307,018.12 and the second scenario taking our BTC at $409,141.38.

&amp;#x200B;

We can only wait and see the next chapters of this market.

&amp;#x200B;

i wanted to do an updated review after using my [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) visa card (ruby) as a daily driver for a month:

My original post can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o8tj4c/as\_a\_european\_a\_cryptocom\_visa\_card\_honest\_review/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o8tj4c/as_a_european_a_cryptocom_visa_card_honest_review/)

In my linked post ive talked about alternatives pros and cons and the reason i went for crypto.com

**TLDR**  As germany doesnt offer any decent credit / debit card with cashback besides Amazon if u are a heavy shopper. I decided to go into the cryptosphere and binance and [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) are the only decent one available (Still waiting on maybe NEXO).  Decided for the [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) ruby (Why? Check my linked post)

\+ 2% Cashback

\+ 10,63 Cashback in Spotify

\+ Premium feeling metal card

\+ referal program gives 25 USD for both sides

\- u have to stake 350 Euro worth their Currency without interests

\- Cashback in CRO (Can be swapped in any Currency details below)

\- Debit Card u always have to top it up. Takes usually 24h until SEPA arrives

1 Month with my [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) ive also followed them a bit more. They got some really nice partnerships. One is Formula 1 the other is UFC (If im not mistaken UFC is a 10 years deal.) Im sure this will be a huge way to get more people into crypto.

Topping up my card usually is no hassle and i just use a template which takes 15 seconds to send the SEPA transfer and 24h til it arrives. I use CURVE as an APP so i can use my Card virtually. All in all my cards works fine virtually and physical. I had a few payments issues in super small shops like backeries and thats why i just carry my regular bank card (i could also use google pay linked to my bank account).

So far i got regular cashback worth 4 Euros, and additional 4 Euros for normal spendings (Fly ticket, new wallet...) - In germany using my bankcard would gain my zero money back (!)

Cashback is like payback it is instant.

Ive changed my payment plan in spotify and also received my spotify cashback instantly. Super rat.

I also recommended the ruby card to a few communities on reddit and gained referal money.

All in all i can say im super happy that im an early adopter to it. I have a set limit to spend money on crypto and i dont wanna increase it. With the cashback and spotify im able to put an extra amount of 15 Euros in crypto every month, for basicly free. Only risk is staking their CRO Coins, but as in every alt coin it can be risky. I've swapped my CRO for ETH and got a nice small bag of additional ETH.

Hit me up for any further questions!

EDIT: Obviously i only use FIAT and no Crypto. Paying with crypto isnt worth as it still swaps in between and fees are making it not worth.

So, as we all know, technical analysis is an extremely useful and accurate way to predict price movement over time. However, most people fail to use it correctly because they lack the skills to recognize great set ups. Triangles, wedges, cups and handles and flags and pennants and everything else you've been told to use might work 40-50% of the time, but what if I told you that there was an **extremely rare,** ***EXTREMELY BULLISH*** chart pattern that you've never heard of?

I introduce to you: the ""Stegosaurus Under a Rainbow"". Charts this bullish are almost always the stuff of fantasies, but as of the 7/20 daily candle's close, Bitcoin has broken out of its spiked tail range and will soon be on the move to ATH.

[ The \\""Stegosaurus Under a Rainbow\\"" Chart Pattern ](https://preview.redd.it/59cds49l8sc71.png?width=2709&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64a095425bcbaef8470a484557b2c5dd0d13df2e)

 

So, how does it work? Glad you asked. First, we start with the formation of the head, and most notably, the eyeball. The uptrend into 2021 began to reverse and form the neckline, which ended in mid-February. The long wicks in January, one green and one red, form a level of support perfect for this little guy's eye to sit at. But, the formation of the head + eye do little on their own, so let's move on.

During the massive bull run, we see BTC in a strong uptrend, creating higher highs and higher lows between February and the end of May. These form the iconic scutes, (the bony plates on its back) and lead us gently into the consolidation phase, the spiked tail.

Before I forget, the rainbow is an often overlooked feature of this highly technical pattern. In order to be confirmed, there needs to be a touch from the candles in the head range, the tail range, and each and every scute. Although we almost didn't get the last bounce from the tail spikes, it managed to eek out two bullish days in a row and close the rainbow.

The most delicate and most important phase is the final consolidation down Mr. Stegosaurus' spiked tail. These choppy movements are volatile and difficult to trade, but somehow the candles managed to outline an exceptionally strong tail.

The nearly 8% swing on the 7/20 candle broke out to the upside of the tail range and confirmed that, beyond a shadow of a doubt, Bitcoin is about to take off and reach ATHs very very soon.

opfcbh,Raverrevolution,A change I would love to see,"I see it time after time again that everyone who starts looking into buying bitcoin will always rope alts into it as well.

As we know alts are a complete waste of money.  Alts are basically just companies trying to promote their products and having their token as a store of value is similar to buying a stock in a company.

Alts to Bitcoin is like apples to oranges.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to see a coordinated effort by the entire bitcoin community to declassify bitcoin away from alts.  Exchanges are reluctant to do this because they'll make money over unsuspecting people.  It's really sad when you look at the big picture.

You cannot explain bitcoin to people without having them bump into alts and get duped.  It just literally slows down the inevitable.

&amp;#x200B;

Crypto top 10 lists should not exist the way they do.  Instead bitcoin needs to have its own page and alts should have a top 10.  Then people would understand that there is a difference and it would be more of an imperative to seek it out rather than just buy everything as if it was like a stock.",1626965411,9,1

opxf3o,jreesun,I made an open-source multisig hardware wallet!,"A healthy mixture of paranoia, frugality, and the desire to become One with the Bitcoin has culminated in...

[Krux Wallet](https://github.com/jreesun/krux-wallet), software that turns your M5StickV into an airgapped hardware wallet.

Krux is written in (Micro)Python and built on top of the awesome embedded bitcoin library [embit](https://github.com/diybitcoinhardware/embit).

It _only_ works as a cosigner in a multisignature setup and communicates via QR codes, sending and receiving. It also never writes your keys to disk, so it may be odd to consider it a ""wallet."" It's probably more accurate to call it a hardware signer.

The reason I chose the M5StickV for this over something like the Pi is because:

1. You can buy it and use it as-is, no assembly required.
2. At &lt; $50, it's cheap for all the parts you get: screen, camera, buttons, battery, etc.
3. Nobody else had done it yet (I think). There's already a great project for the Pi called [SeedSigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner)!

It needs more thorough testing and vetting before I would consider it production-ready, but it's now ""feature complete"" and I wanted to share it with the community!",1627025604,9,1

Saunders had [a combative YouTube conversation with Richard Heart](https://youtu.be/ml1FbpcOax0) just before the allegations were levelled. Saunders has been vocal against Heart's HEX coin and HEX has a very zealous fan base.

It *could* be a fan faking this screen shot or some bizzaro marketing stunt by Heart and BitBoyCrypto. There are many possibilities other than the accusation being true.

There are systems created like OpenNode and Strike with open APIs. 

Through utilizing a platform like this, or creating my own?????, Would it be a viable solution to develop the connection for accounting solutions ie. QuickBooks, Sage, Viewpoint, etc to create a more efficient payment process than using typical ACH.

Both of these platforms charge 1% which is basically the same as ACH. 

Is there any value in a solution like this?

I don't come from poverty, just a standard middle class upbringing. In many ways I had everything I needed, but lost a lot as time went on. I lost my dad. I lost a lot of friends, and now I feel like I'm losing my mom to alcoholism. I work hard, and try to keep everything together but it never feels like enough, and the dread of impending, increasing living/housing costs.. not just for me, but my future children.. feels like a lead weight on my shoulders. I can't even watch the news anymore, listening to politicians tell me that inflation is ""good, actually"" just makes me feel sick. 

2 years ago I started to read about bitcoin. It sounded fresh and alternative and.. hopeful. I didn't invest until Aug 2020, buying 1 btc for around 10k. This was what I'd saved for my future (not my essentials), and I basically thought ""if this turns out to be something small.. at least it's something in the sea of nothing, and that would worth the risk"". People told me I was stupid of course. But, I researched and I stayed strong. And here I am today, 3x up in a 'dip'. 

Even in the worst most uncertain times, btc represents hope for me. When I'm struggling with my day-to-day, I just remember that there's a light at the end of the tunnel and that everything I do doesn't have to just burn away to nothing. That I can protect my earnings and secure my future, myself. 

I'm really grateful for this community, and appreciate everyone. Thank you.",1627072196,68,1

oq7tp7,xcryptogurux,ELI5: What makes Bitcoin so valuable to humanity? Lightning Network and Taproot.,"Alright, this is a long post. But hopefully, it is able to further your understanding of Bitcoin. At least, that's the goal!

To educate newcoiners, and perhaps a few old HODLers as well, on what makes Bitcoin uniquely valuable, the Lightning Network and upcoming Taproot upgrade without overly complicating the conversation.

*Processing img kngn40wr20d71...*

**What's so unique about Bitcoin?**

There's a common misunderstanding that Bitcoin has such great value because it was the first. This is untrue. There were several prior attempts at digital money - B-money, Bit gold and Hashcash (although not technically money) the most prominent among them. Satoshi's PoW algorithm solved a critical flaw in the use of blockchain as a public ledger known as the Byzantine Generals Problem.

The concept of blockchain predates Bitcoin by almost two decades. So the value was never in blockchain but the way Bitcoin was able to utilize blockchain as a trustless, permissionless, decentralized public ledger to democratically create, distribute and exchange value.

Centralized iterations of blockchain are indeed a waste of time. Permissioned protocols can often achieve greater efficiency using an SQL database instead.

Another misconception among newcomers is that you're late to the Bitcoin party. Just as you can never be late to the Internet, you can never be late to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not just a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, in the broader sense, is a protocol capable of functioning as the network layer of a decentralized Internet. Bitcoin can therefore fix the Internet's original sin, centralization at the hands of a powerful few, and restore it to its original form - a decentralized P2P network protocol.

Bitcoin is capable of remaining decentralized by allowing any participant in the network to access and verify the truth on their own in a very economical manner. Throughout Bitcoin's history, Bitcoiners have staunchly defended the right of every Bitcoiner to not be priced out of running their own node. 

You can run your own Bitcoin full node on a Raspberry Pi. This allows you to be an equal rights citizen on the network and not have to delegate trust to a third party. Without being able to verify on your own, you're just going from trusting bankers to trusting a random person on the internet. That's hardly revolutionary.

*Processing img 1ohgb7ol00d71...*

Bitcoin is not only time-tested but has proven to be doggedly antifragile. Elon Musk remarked at the B-word conference a few days ago that the ""average person"" is not going to run a Bitcoin node, once again revealing that he probably needs to acquire a better understanding of Bitcoin before passing misguided remarks.

What makes Bitcoin antifragile is precisely the ability of the average person to run a full node. There's no locus of power to attack. Every node is equal on the Bitcoin network and they're distributed all across the world on every continent. Every quadrennial cycle, while higher profile individuals and entities attack Bitcoin to further various agendas, these attacks only end up effecting even greater faith in the protocol.

*Processing img 5rc5zsks00d71...*

&amp;#x200B;

**Lightning Network**

Lightning Network is a decentralized layer-2 network protocol that uses a native smart contract scripting language to enable instant, almost feeless Bitcoin payments.

On the Lightning Network, both parties to a transaction are required only to have a sufficiently funded open channel on the network. This is done through a single on-chain transaction.

If there is a direct channel open between the parties, the transaction is routed directly and incurs zero fees. Without a direct channel, the transaction is routed through routing nodes.

Whan a transaction passes through a routing node, it is referred to as a ""hop"". There are currently 23k nodes on the Lightning Network with 13k nodes having active channels.

Three years ago, Lightning Network was admittedly far from ideal for everyday payments.

*Processing img 59n45ig110d71...*

But the network has seen exponential growth since, particularly this year. Lightning Network is now a fully-fledged global payments network secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. Lightning wallets have also come a long way and are now very intuitive to use for the average user.

*Processing img u1tuqyu410d71...*

Network capacity has doubled this year. Likewise, nodes and channels have grown exponentially, reducing the number of hops and fees incurred for hops through routing nodes, and improving channel lifespan.

Lightning Network's remarkable growth has inspired some exciting developments this year,

Following the success of the Bitcoin beach project, a pilot for Lightning Network's viability as MoE, El Salvador has adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. Other countries like Tonga, Colombia and other LatAm countries have expressed interest to follow suit.

Strike app has introduced a Bitcoin tab, with the ability to purchase Bitcoin for a nominal fee of a few cents through the Lightning Network.

Twitter has announced a tipping system on its platform later this year using the Lightning Network.

Square is building an open-source, permissionless, non-custodial DeFi platform on top of Bitcoin.

*Processing img esqddcdq10d71...*

&amp;#x200B;

**Taproot**

Now with Lightning Network's maturation as an instant, almost feeless, infinitely scalable decentralized global payments network, Bitcoin is shifting focus to its next big milestone, Taproot, which is due to go live in November at block height 709632.

Taproot brings a set of protocols that further enhance Bitcoin's privacy, scalability and unlock the path for smart contracts on Bitcoin. Following on from SegWit, Taproot will allow even more efficient use of block space by introducing a new type of output - Pay to Taproot (P2TR).

P2TR uses Schnorr signatures, which are more compact than the conventional Elliptic Curve Digital Signing Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures. Schnorr signatures are between 6 and 9 bytes shorter than ECDSA, which saves block space.

Perhaps the most exciting aspect of Schnorr signatures is that it enables the aggregation of multiple signatures into a single signature. This opens up infinite possibilities, including being able to execute multi-sigs and L2/sidechain smart contracts as a simple regular transaction on-chain.

It's a truly game-changing development, as it allows Bitcoin to have smart contract protocols without bloating the blockchain layer. Smart contracts will run on L2/sidechain protocols, but on the Bitcoin blockchain, they will only take up a small space like any other transaction. It ensures that users are still able to economically run their own Bitcoin full node.

Further, Taproot also includes optimization for the Lightning Network called Point Time-Locked Contract(PTLC). PTLC replaces Hash Time-Locked Contract(HTLC). PTLC uses adaptor signatures, which enhance privacy and security on the Lightning Network, enabling escrow contracts in Lightning channels and allowing users to retry stuck payments.

These are very exciting times to be a Bitcoiner and that has nothing to do with Bitcoin's price.

oq7s5q,_kr_saurabh,Greener Days Are Coming – 4 Reasons To Be Optimistic About Bitcoin for the Next Months,"After quickly falling below the psychological barrier of $30K, the price of Bitcoin has just rebounded to above $32K. However, it is not certain that the price of Bitcoin will climb back up to $40K quickly. Several resistances will have to be broken for this to happen.

The current situation with the price of Bitcoin moving sideways between $29.5K and $34K could continue throughout the summer.

Even so, the fact that the Bitcoin price has held up like this after the $30K mark was lost suggests that the market has already been purged of weak hands over the past few weeks. The remaining players are well aware of the opportunity that a Bitcoin around $30K represents.

Their goal is to accumulate as much BTC as possible in this price range in anticipation of what lies ahead for Bitcoin in the next months. By taking a step back to see the bigger picture, you will be able to understand why greener days are ahead for Bitcoin in the coming months.

In what follows, I highlight the 4 main reasons why I think so.

The Bitcoin network continues to grow
Since the Bitcoin price crash in May 2021, many observers have made the mistake of focusing solely on the price of Bitcoin. This short-sightedness prevents them from seeing the bigger picture.

The only thing these people see is that the price of Bitcoin is currently 50% below its April 2021 All-Time High (ATH) near $65K.

That being said, you must learn to focus on the fundamentals of Bitcoin. These are far more telling of Bitcoin's long-term success than the short-term volatility of its price.

If you make this crucial intellectual effort, you will see that the Bitcoin network continues to grow month after month since the beginning of 2021:

The number of users of the Bitcoin network has reached an ATH in the past month. This number is far more important than the current price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin adoption continues to grow block by block. This is something Bullish for the coming months.

Bitcoin's Hash Rate is already rebounding
China's ban on Bitcoin has caused many miners in several parts of China to shut down their equipment. The Bitcoin Hash Rate has inevitably suffered as a result. This caused a major drop that had some observers unnecessarily worried.

Since then, we have seen the great exodus of Bitcoin mining from China to the West.

What seemed to some to be something ultra-negative for Bitcoin is in fact something extremely Bullish. This ban on Bitcoin mining in China will do two key things:

Better decentralization of the Bitcoin Hash Rate around the world.

A major improvement in the share of electricity from renewable energy sources used by the Bitcoin network.

Two problems used by Bitcoin's opponents to denigrate it will be solved in the process. You can see that the Bitcoin Hash Rate is already rebounding strongly:

The macroeconomic environment remains favorable to Bitcoin
The ultra-aggressive monetary policies pursued by the central banks of the major economies to combat the effects of COVID-19 on the economy have highlighted the benefits of the Bitcoin system more than ever.

Bitcoin brings back to light the virtues of quantitative hardening. This is in contrast to the quantitative easing that the Fed and the European Central Bank have been practicing unreasonably for years.

This possibility given to central banks to print as much fiat money out of thin air as they deem necessary is the original sin of a system that will end up collapsing sooner or later.

While the Fed has been denying the obvious for months, it is finally starting to acknowledge that inflation will be a problem in the months ahead. It has reached 5.4% in June 2021 in America, and for many observers, including the CEO of BlackRock, the problem is systemic.

This inflation will remain at high levels for a long time. This will benefit Bitcoin as a safe haven to protect what you own. More and more investors will come to seize this opportunity in this macroeconomic environment that clearly favors Bitcoin.

On-chain data confirms that the market has already been cleansed of weak hands
Since the beginning of June 2021, a trend has emerged: whales have started accumulating Bitcoin again. Those players who know how to take the long view have realized that the big opportunity with Bitcoin is now.

This trend has even accelerated since early July 2021:

ImageBitcoin Supply held by entities with Balance 1K - 10K - Source: Glassnode

Investors with at least 1,000 BTC added over 96K BTC to their holdings. While the weak hands were selling and hesitating to take advantage of the current opportunity, the whales were buying fear.

The fact that Bitcoin did not see its price collapse after breaking the psychological barrier of $30K is also something that tends to confirm that the market has already been purged of weak hands.

Greener days are therefore expected for Bitcoin in the coming months. It is only a matter of time in my opinion.

Final Thoughts
It is always difficult to know when the bottom has been reached after a Bitcoin price crash like the one we experienced in May 2021. However, there are several indications that greener days are within reach.

The great opportunity with Bitcoin for the next few months is clearly now in my eyes. It's up to you to make up your own mind based on the 4 elements I've just presented. Then you will be able to make the best decision for yourself.

A NEW crypto-native index where the composition is:

- 33.3% Bitcoin
- 33.3% Ether
- 33.3% DPI

Rebalances in the first Friday of every month.

#Why?
This allocation for BED seeks to give safe, passive access to an index which captures equal-weighted upside from the most promising use cases around the themes of blockchain as a disruptive technology: 
 - store of value
 - programmable money
 - decentralized finance DeFi

#Ethereum
ETH is economic bandwidth and the reserve asset of Decentralized Finance DeFi, so a heavy focus on ETH makes sense for any initial investment in crypto. This is an investment in Ether as (1) a store-of-value, (2) a commodity, and (3) a capital asset.

#Bitcoin
BTC is the largest cap crypto money and currently a reserve asset of crypto banks. Some exposure is essential, but too much means an underweight position in DeFi. Having a portion in bitcoin  with monthly rebalances captures some of the benefit of the volatility vs ETH.

#DeFi Pulse Index
DPI is a market cap-weighted index of the top ""Blue Chip"" DeFi protocols. DeFi is growing &amp; an investment in a carefully curated set of DeFi money protocols, through the DeFi Pulse Index, provides broad exposure. Use of monthlyBED rebalancing captures the volatility.

#Key benefits of the $BED Index:
- Set it, forget it, “sleep well” with automatic rebalancing
- Socialized gas costs
- Exposure to #crypo's 3 major themes 
- Equal weighting (33.3%) allow for volatility capture (the old ""sell your winners, buy your losers"")

#When you purchase BED, you are getting:
- 16 tokens in ONE 
- automatic rebalancing 
- socialized gas costs 
- exposure to the three major crypto themes
- sleep at night 

#A breakdown of what you REALLY get👇🏼

oql1q0,iamthephantompain,Some advise on saving up for a holiday (serious question).,"Hi all. First of all, I am not seeking financial advise, but would appreciate some guidance from you all.

I am not in a rush to travel (maybe in 2023, travel-restrictions willing) however, I am wondering what would be the ideal way of going about saving and storing the said savings.

Say I want to save $10,000 by the end of 2022 or the start of 2023 (so I can purchase airline tickets and book the hotel in advance), what would be a good way to save (and store the money while waiting to book). 

Once I've saved up $10,000, I'm thinking of these options below:

\- Let the full amount sit in a bank time deposit and withdraw it once ready to purchase

\- Put 50% in a time deposit and the other 50% in say, BTC/ETH and withdraw it once ready to purchase

\- Put 60% in a time deposit and the other 40% in BTC/ETH and withdraw it once ready to purchase

(I think this question could apply to other non-critical savings, right? Like say what to do with the $500 sitting in my bank as I'm saving up for a laptop - could I put some of it in crypto and withdraw it once I'm ready to buy the laptop?)

oql0a6,emilioermeio,Does holding BTC actually consume energy?,"Past months have been full of discussion about how much energy Bitcoin uses. First of all, I think that the value of this technology is immense but I’m concerned about the emissions produced from it. Much of the hashrate is said to be carbon neutral, but for a technology of the future that’s not enough. I know that other industries currently produce much more emissions, but as I said Btc is the base for a future financial system and therefore should use 100% renewables. Climate change is the most important matter of our time, that’s why I’m asking if I should blame myself for holding Btc. My question is: does holding btc actually use much energy? I mean, the network is made safe from node validators and they do not use much energy at all compared to the mining sector. What do you guys think about all this?

P.S.
I know that Btc will eventually use close to 100% renewable energy, but this needs to be done faster",1627110157,31,1

There is real value being created over the long run but in the short term it definitely has ponzi characteristics. And I honestly think the culprit in both cases is debt. The engine of all bull markets in crypto is leverage, and it is also the cause of sharp downturns as liquidations occur. Obviously you have fomo and on the flip side paper hands but arguably these are enhanced when leverage is in the system. 

There is definitely some level of debt that a society can draw from with disproportionately small negative effects. But can we really trust ourselves not to abuse it? It seems to be in human nature. And more, I wonder what impact crypto would have on our debt based economy, if any. 

Honestly, debt could be a necessary evil. Maybe Bitcoin wouldn’t have made it this far without debt acting as a spark for massive bubbles that attracted attention to the space. It’s likely we wouldn’t have a lot of our other modern technology without debt either. But it does have real downsides and ruins lives",1627106398,6,1

Yesterday Bitmain, has announced a collaboration with ENEGIX to host the Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro at their 180MW that’s in Kazakhstan.

The current 180MW building, which started operating in late 2020, is the company’s third data center. It is intended to house over 50,000 current-generation mining equipment.

oqimve,TheWorldofGood,Just a fun conspiracy theory,"Hi, don’t take this post seriously as I just want to make some fun post about this crazy conspiracy theory I’ve been having for few days.

So, if I was a mega rich banker and bitcoin is a threat to my banking industry, what would I do try to destroy bitcoin?

First, I would try to spread FUD news by paying the mass media and news stations and just slender bitcoin to no end.

Second, when the market is used to all the FUD and slender about bitcoin, I would ask my rich friends such as celebrities, CEOs, and politicians to start spreading “good” news about bitcoin. But this is just a beginning of my bigger scheme to destroy bitcoin.

Third, my rich friends and I will buy a whole bunch of bitcoin to raise the price. The market will get excited and buy more bitcoin. And than, just then, we will dump all the bitcoin to crush its price to the ground.
What happened? Average investors would panic.

Fourth, our rich group will spread positive news about bitcoin again. Even install bitcoin ATMs and make advertisements about bitcoin. Average investors will start having hopes again.

Fifth, we will buy some bitcoins to slowly raise price again. Average investors will buy again. Maybe this time, they will be able to make profit from bitcoin.

Sixth, we will dump bitcoin even lower than the last big crash. To the point where people will start crying and lose faith in bitcoin completely.

Seventh, repeat step 4-6. The point is to make bitcoin so volatile and illegitimate that it is seen as another great pyramid scheme of the 21st century.

Eighth, average people will look at bitcoin with disgust and stay away from it like it’s some sort of a plague.

Ninth, take over the crypto market with my own altcoin that is backed by world governments and banks.

Tenth, everyone will use my altcoin. We will control the money with one altcoin system. And thus the whole world.",1627099570,14,1

oqhtg7,Deep-Art3195,Bitcoin made a better person!!!!,"Hear me out..I made plenty of mistakes initially when I came into crypto space. Went after alts and shitcoins and should have ended up with more Bitcoins than what I have right now. All of this happend cos I didn't 'DYOR' and had very little clue about the space. Once I went in the Bitcoin rabbit hole..I have learned so much that now I am a different person and feel better about myself.

Things I learned - 

1.) I understand finance and money much better now

2.) I used to be quite pro govt and used to trust the authority. I now understand how these guys use fiat money to fund war and use the central banking system to benefit themselves

3.) You guys might remember that in 2016 Govt of India made 500 and 1000 rupee bills illegal tender in name of curbing black money and stopping money laundering and replaced it with new currencies. All of this was annouced overnight and from next day the 500 and 1000 rps bills that people held had no value. I was stupid enough to support this and trust the Govt in this move.

After going down the Bitcoin rabbit hole I realised that how wrong and dangerous this move from the Govt was and how stupid I was to trust them. Many poor and middle class people suffered due to this move. Rich weren't even affected cos they had power and contacts they find loopholes. 

4.) After this I realised the importance of Bitcoin. I understood what decentralization means and why it is important. Words like censorship resistance and be your own bank started making sense.

5.) I won't lie - I have cheered the powerful countries invading the less powerful in name of ""Fight against Terrorism"" and ""ending dictatorship"" cos I belived they were right. I realized how these invasion were made possible due to central banking policies and printing money. I don't do that anymore and understand the struggles of the less priviliged nations. 

6.)  I am not saying that with Bitcoin Standard there will be no wars. Humans are shit and will kill each other regardless but funding wars won't be that easy with Bitcoin Standard. Number of wars will go down significantly. 

7.) I was foolish to think that poor people stay poor cos they don't work hard, they  are lazy and stupid and blah blah blah. After going down the rabbit hole I learned how inflation is eating away the little savings that these people manage despite working hard and living on bare minimum expenses. I realized due to lack of credit history they never get loans to help educate themselves or their kids or start a business. If they borrow money from some unregulated borrower then they get ripped off due to insane interest rates and frauds. Its like being stuck in a endless loop of poverty with no way out. I no longer look down upon poor people and feel empathic towards them. I feel I am a better person now and all this happend cos I went in the Bitcoin rabbit hole. 

If anyone of you haven't read enough on Bitcoin then pls pls go for it. Read 'The Bitcoin Standard', 'The Bullish Case for Bitcoin' and watch all those documentaries. This will be your best investment.

It's the sender alone, he might  have delegated this decision to his wallet or provider. E.g. in BTC  transaction  3ba0c9eaf3185898164518cda7e3433d1d2049188d737f2b2a7e188aaeb8b4de someone  sent 0.01088549 BTC and paid a 2.66038352 BTC fee.   


The standard  explanation for this is that it was a senders mistake. But it could be  as well money laundering. If the sender is the miner or a person dealing  with the miner it could be that this fee close to $100k was paid by  intention to convert bitcoin from criminal activity into miners coins  which are usually seen as innocent virgin coins.   


How to  investigate this? If the transaction was not in the mempool of the most  nodes or if the transaction wasn't in orphaned blocks at similar time  then it's very suspicious that the fee was given to the miner by  intention to launder the coins.",1627249846,84,1

I have no debt other than my house, my car is paid off and I have an extra 1500 a month to invest if I choose.

My goal is to own a whole btc. Now, people saying DCA is the way to go but to me the math doesn't work out. If I invest 1000 a month now at 35000 I can get about .03 btc. If that price spikes past 100,000 then each 1000 becomes only .01 btc.

Now, if everyone on here preaches that anyone who has ever held btc longer than 4 years has been in the green, then I can only ask for people on here to debate me on why I shouldn't buy as much btc right now by taking on a small loan to do it.

What if, btc spikes to 100k in less than a year, then in 2024s halving it spikes above 200k. I bet I'd be damn proud of my decision.

oriu9g,Historical-Session66,Which Investment Will Perform the Best in the Coming Bear Market?,"Although some are predicting Bitcoin's cyclical bull/bear markets are over, I believe another bear market will begin sometime in 2022 after Bitcoin peaks again.

My question is which investment will give the best ROI as a result of the crypto-winter?

A few caveats:

1. The ideas cannot revolve around just shorting Bitcoin itself. Many people have suggested to me to just short Bitcoin directly. While I do think that's a great straightforward way to make a good return, I am skeptical it's the highest ROI achievable.
2. No leverage allowed - Also, I know some services let you get crazy levels of leverage (i.e. 100x), but I'm really looking for longer-term investments (1-2 years) that have a smaller risk of liquidating me. 

My favorite idea so far is shorting stocks highly correlated to Bitcoin - Microstrategy is a great example, but also mining stocks like RIOT and MARA will probably see profitability drop drastically. My favorite is Coinbase (COIN); I think their trading revenue is going to tank in the bear market and investors might realize the company doesn't have a ""moat"" that other exchanges can't copy.

orh50x,rodgins13,Got hacked 1.72 BTC even with 2FA. Hacker sells in exchanges... Please help me identify the exchange and potentially recover my crypto," Some weeks ago my Binance and gmail accounts were hacked. As I logged into my Binance account and put my 2FA, I get an error, check the website URL to confirm I'm in the correct website and then put my 2FA again. Within a few minutes I realize I have more Bitcoin than I remembered. I check my past trades and see about 90% of all my balance was sold for Bitcoin (around 1.5 Bitcoin) . I immediately check my email but don't see any emails from Binance.

I continue to check what may have happened - I had a few limit orders to buy Bitcoin so I thought maybe that was it. Unfortunately that was not the case. I receive an app notification 'Your withdrawal has been successful'... taking 1.5 BTC + 0.22 BTC I already had there, taking a total of 1.72 BTC... Worst part is that just a few days prior I had sent USDT to buy the dip and don't usually leave my funds in exchanges for long.

Tried talking to cybersecurity experts, lawyers and customer service from Binance and Google for weeks, but no progress unfortunately. I track [the address where the BTC was initially sent to](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qty6kec79p5sguq3dm6z3v73ssmjefru2jlacwg) constantly for about a week and then sign up for an address notification service since my mental health was already fucked by that moment and checking all the time was not helping.

I continued checking every now and then but then thought I should just wait until I get a notification from [cryptocurrencyalerting.com](https://cryptocurrencyalerting.com/), where I had signed up to avoid this hassle. The website did not work, and don't recommend it to anyone...

Now I realize my Bitcoin got sent around between multiple addresses and [ended up here](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3AnHEBvW1VeyyoVPY3YvwLrVfgShqRQkNZ), an address that has received over $600MM worth of Bitcoin. At this point I assume this is an exchange wallet and my Bitcoin has been sold. Even though it is highly unlikely I'll recover it, I was hoping someone could help me identify the Bitcoin address so that at least we can put pressure on the exchange and hopefully identify who was behind this hack, especially since its unlikely I was the first or last that they have done this to.

Thanks for hearing my rant, and again if anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated. Needless to say, if someone can help me recover the stolen Bitcoin, I'd be happy to give them part of it.

There are a few things in life that we all have in common, no matter who we are or where we live. Perhaps one of the most important is that we all use some form of money to procure the things that we need in our daily lives. Some of us use credit cards, while others use cold hard cash. Even people currently living under a barter system use the goods they produced themselves as a type of money with which to exchange for someone else’s goods. No matter what type of money we use, we want it to maintain its purchasing power so that we can continue to enjoy the fruits of our labour throughout our lives.

Inflation is the enemy of that hope. Inflation refers to the decline in the purchasing power of money. Inflation can sometimes happen gradually over decades as it has for currencies like the U.S. dollar and the Euro. In extreme cases, inflation can happen over weeks or months, like in Germany after World War I or in Zimbabwe in the 1990s. The root cause of inflation is an increase in the supply of money. Economists will argue that there are a variety of factors that drive an increase in the money supply. However, at its core, the blame for inflation rests primarily with those individuals who are in a position of power over money.

Inflation has infected various types of money for thousands of years. Inflation is so common and has been around for so long that a lot of people erroneously think inflation is natural and that it has to happen for economies to function. As a result, societies look for a variety of ways to protect their wealth from the effects of inflation. This usually leads them to invest in inflation hedges, which are assets that typically rise in value (i.e., price) as the money supply increases. Gold, real estate, and stocks are some of the most recognizable types of inflation hedges. However, investments in things like art and fine wine can also be effective hedges. The investments we’ve mentioned, and all inflation hedges that we haven’t, have one thing in common: their supply increases much more slowly than the supply of even the most tightly limited currency. To this group, we add Bitcoin, the newest inflation hedge.

**Bitcoin: A Quintessential Example of Finite Supply**

The attribute of limited supply also applies to Bitcoin, more so than most, which is a large part of the reason why it is commonly referred to as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin’s software code dictates that the total supply of Bitcoin is restricted to 21 million. No more, no less. And that limit is almost assuredly going to remain in place, no matter what.

Perhaps you’re thinking to yourself that software code is rather easy to change. After all, don’t companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and IBM send patches and updates to our computers all the time for their software? They do, but there is one glaring difference between their software code and that of Bitcoin, and it comes down to ownership and control. The majority of the software on your computer was produced and is owned by a centralized software company that retains the right to change the software in any way and at any time. 

The same does not apply to Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s code is not owned or controlled by any one person, group, or company. It is controlled by the full community of people using the Bitcoin blockchain. As such, changes to Bitcoin’s code can only be put into effect by getting essentially the entire community to agree to accept the change and then actually carry out the change when the time comes. In the simplest of terms, to change Bitcoin’s limit of 21 million tokens and introduce inflation into the system, it would be necessary to convince millions of Bitcoin users around the world to accept inflation. As we discussed above, inflation benefits the few at the expense of everyone else. So how likely is it that millions of Bitcoiners are going to choose to rob themselves so that a few members of the community can benefit?

Bitcoin’s completely inelastic (i.e., unchanging) supply makes it the perfect inflation hedge, all else equal. In a system where nothing else affects Bitcoin’s value other than the supply of the goods or currencies on the other side of a trade, Bitcoin’s value would always go up because the supply of everything else always goes up. More cars are manufactured, more bananas are grown, and more fiat currencies are printed. In the face of it all, Bitcoin’s supply remains the same.

That said, we are all reminded every day that we do not live in a perfect system. There are a variety of competing factors in any market that impact the value of different assets, and the same is also true of Bitcoin. Even so, it is extremely common for critics to claim that Bitcoin is a broken inflation hedge or not an inflation hedge at all when its price doesn’t move in a perfectly opposite direction to inflation.

**Bitcoin: An Aspirational Inflation Hedge**

The last few months have offered us a prime example of Bitcoin’s value is subjected to more than just inflation. For example, the consumer-price index, a proxy commonly used for inflation by a variety of market participants in the United States, grew by 5.4% in June 2021. However, Bitcoin’s price during June 2021 dropped by a few percentage points, and that was after it saw a fair amount of upwards and downwards movements throughout the month. Critics have latched onto June 2021’s results to declare that Bitcoin is a failed inflation hedge. Truth be told, if inflation was the only factor currently affecting Bitcoin’s value, they would be right. But even a brief look at the Bitcoin space over the past few months can reveal several of the numerous other factors impacting Bitcoin’s value on a day-to-day basis:

* In mid-May, Elon Musk announced that his company, Tesla, would no longer accept Bitcoin in exchange for Tesla vehicles over concerns about Bitcoin’s environmental impact.
* In early June, the FBI announced that they had recovered Bitcoin paid to a hacker group in connection with a high profile ransomware attack, leading many onlookers to incorrectly assume that the FBI had hacked Bitcoin’s blockchain.
* A little more than a week later, Bitcoin underwent a Death Cross, a bearish market indicator that happened when the short-term moving price average fell below the long-term moving price average.
* Throughout June, the Chinese government systematically banned Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining in most of the country. The resulting drop in Bitcoin’s hash power and mining difficulty was the largest in history.

Each of these events, and countless others over the past several months, has negatively impacted Bitcoin. And as seen by the drop in Bitcoin’s price by nearly half since its all-time high in mid-April 2021, these events have weighed on Bitcoin much more significantly than rising inflation has influenced Bitcoin’s price to move up.

Expecting the value of an inflation hedge to always increase as inflation increases are extremely naïve. And to have that expectation for an asset as new as Bitcoin, which faces far greater headwinds at the current time than mainstay inflation hedges like gold and real estate, is even more so. Bitcoin’s perfectly finite supply makes it the perfect inflation hedge over time, which will be confirmed as more people use it and fewer people fight against it.",1627233199,2,1

ore2vp,AdAny287,Seed phrase centralization? My wallet my keys my crypto…not my seed? Please help me feel more at ease with my recent discovery. This post was deleted from r/Cryptocurrency so feeling even more sus," 

So, as I was scrolling through the sub and throwing out one liners as usual an interesting realization came to me, though my technical knowledge of the process of seed creation is limited, Im hoping someone can come in and answer some questions about it and then either tell me what is wrong in my logic here or how what Im about to say is impossible, or, if what I’m about to say is plausible and correct how it’s been allowed to happen and what we need to do to fix it.

Firstly, I realized that while generating seed phrases, you never encounter vulgar and obscene , or never encounter complex/multi-syllable/hyphenated words either. One question I have is are there dictionary word lists for every seed phrase word that could possibly populate a generated seed list? And if so, wouldn’t sufficient computing power and time be enough reason to ""mine"" peoples crypto wallet seed phrases by hashing through these combinations?

Secondly, if there are no known dictionary lists for seed phrase word generation possibilities, then who decides what words can be generated and why are they keeping this knowledge private? Why do seeds generate with only ""short easy and acceptable"" words? I would assume this biased look at acceptable seed words would result in a less secure seed phrase no? More secure with more possibilities seems like the entire point to me, why let ""bad"" words not be a part of MY seed, I want to type FUCK when I have to type this damn thing in again on my phone, so whose stopping me?

Finally, what is the point of my wallet, my keys, my crypto, plus a seed THEY generated for me? What’s stopping me from being the one who creates MY seed phrase? If these wallet creators hold the information of seed phrase word generation possibilities aren’t they centralizing a pretty damn large part of the security and actually able to mine for my seed phrase? I think someone needs to tell me what’s goin on here or I’m rethinking this community as a giant rug pull waiting to happen.",1627228521,26,1

ory56l,_kr_saurabh,Bitcoin: R.I.P. to the Bears.,"It has been a long timing for bitcoin, but finally, the tide is turning.  Bullish times are ahead.  I just hope that you are still around, and took advantage of the accumulating opportunity that was given.  As it is those who maintain conviction and take action during uncertain times that end up being the most successful.

Yes, that is right, bitcoin has finally had a short squeeze and rose to a price of around $39,000.  While we still have quite a ways to go until bitcoin can reach its all-time high price again, but it is looking much better than the situation that we were dealing with last week. Just a week ago bitcoin dropped to $29k, amid fears of the GBTC unlock sale, amongst an endless amount of other FUD that was being aimed at the bitcoin markets.  All attempting to cause enough FUD to scare the market into selling; resulting in the bubble of this bull market bursting.  The market and big players were shorting bitcoin heavily, and any attempt at recovery were all met with resistance and the price was eventually sent right back down.

But what caused the price to go up so much this time? Why was bitcoin able to surpass its obstacles this time around?

Well, the first thing that needs to be mentioned is that this situation has been building up for weeks now.  We have seen constant bitcoin reports being taken off exchanges, miners have stopped selling, and the market was oversold.  All things that point to a sudden and incredible bounce.  

But there were still those pesky shorts that needed to be overcome before this rally could finally return to the upswing.  We needed a big new story that would cause enough instant hype that would cause the market to pump hard and instantaneously.  The only problem is that those types of news announcements are few and far between.  I'm talking about the likes of Paypal beginning to sell bitcoin, or Tesla putting bitcoin onto their balance sheet.  

And then we finally found our news story.

As it stands, this is merely a rumour of something that may happen, and there is no confirmation of anything.  But, the heavy rumour of Amazon potentially accepting bitcoin as payment is a big enough story that it sent the price of bitcoin upwards.  Because the market was heavily shorting the bitcoin price, this price swing upwards led to a huge squeeze and then came the liquidations, which send the price even higher at a blistering pace. The bears were laid to rest.

Everyone who wants the price of bitcoin to go over $100k, and then to heights even beyond.  For that to be possible heavy volatility is required.  It is that volatility that will bring us down to lows that we had just felt at $29k, but it is that same volatility that will take us upwards as well.  My conviction in bitcoin has never been higher.  Since the price began to drop I have to stay consistent and explained the reasons why there are so many reasons to be bullish.  While it is difficult to remain positive somedays when your portfolio drops many thousands of dollars.  You must always keep looking at the larger picture.  Bitcoin was being dealt an unprecedented amount of FUD attacks that kept coming one after another, and oftentimes they were being dealt at the same time.  These were tests for bitcoin and it passed wonderfully.  Some of those same obstacles it might not have been able to overcome in its life infancy.

And then you have the whole world situation.  Covid, unlimited money printing, inflation rising at an unprecedented level.  Then you have El Salvador making bitcoin its legal tender, the Lightning 2nd layer beginning to take off, the miners leaving China.  And always inching closer to another halving.  This storm isn't going to stop.  I just hope that you have been able to take advantage of bitcoin being at a 50% discount.

Like I mentioned before, we are still far away from matching the all-time high price, but today is a day that gives hope to those that may have begun to think that the bull run was over.  Today is a day that shows that the people who were proclaiming that the bull run wasn't finished, may just have been right.  But the biggest change of all is what this has done to the mood of the entire market.  The mood is an incredibly powerful thing that controls where the price will go.  Last week it was incredibly bearish; people were scared and depressed.  But that has now been erased and we are moving back towards positive movements.

It's an exciting time to be in the market.  Remember this the next time that you being to feel doubt.  Never take your foot off the gas pedal in your accumulation, and always dollar-cost-average no matter what.

How about you? Has your mood shifted thanks to this movement? Were you able to take advantage of the last few months' price dips and grow your bitcoin holdings?",1627304181,7,1

osie41,VimNatrium,BTC news,"Here at BTC Automation’s decentralized headquarters, research has been proceeding to develop a line of blockchain products that establishes new standards for security, technological leadership, and execution excellence. With user scalability as our world-class dev team's North Star, work has been proceeding on the crudely conceived idea of a distributed virtual machine that would not only provide irreversible trustless transactions, for use in layer one proof-of-work protocols, but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing stateful ledger systems on Web 3.0. Such a network, comprised of Nakamoto block producers, ZK proofs, Shannon-Hartley channels, and all monitored by Buttcoin's community-driven analytics, is BTC Automation’s “Crypto Encabulator.”

Now, basically the only new principle involved is that instead of entropy being generated by the cryptographic hash function, it’s produced by the free market interaction of elliptic bonding curves and staking derivatives. The original fault validator had a backing peg of Bayesian commercial paper, propagated by an exogenous threat model in such a way that the peer-to-peer game theoretic incentives were in a direct line with the algorithmic governance burns.

The layer two consisted simply of six pseudo-random Markov surfaces, so fitted to the lunar sharding schedule that side-chain fumbling was effectively prevented. The main net was of the normal write-locked mutex type placed in the legacy fintech accounts of a pre-regulatory Panamanian money transmitter, every seventh consolidated arbitrage block being connected by a censorship resistant mem-pool pipe to the oracle on the ‘bottom’ end of the consensual deposit receiver. Moreover, whenever non-repudiated contract settlement is required, it may also be employed in conjunction with an asymptotically decaying block reward to reduce voting node decentralization.

The Crypto Encabulator has now reached a high level of development, and it’s being successfully used in the construction of Merkle Treehouses. It’s available soon; wherever Buttcoin Automation products are shilled.

Edit: Some improvements, keep any suggestions coming! I might actually record it...",1627372246,3,1

Here are my transfers:

That was until my teacher informed me that the gold standard no longer existed. This new information didn't bother me, as I knew money automatically had value. Now I've gotten older and found out money is actually worthless in physical form. Money has two forms physical in which poorer people see and digital for the wealthier society. Our working society is more controlled by the physical form of money as the wealthy use credit cards and seldom carry any physical form of currency. I had never heard of Bitcoin until 2018, in which I was already late to the party. I built computers and wanted to know more about how all this Bitcoin technology worked. The Blockchain is nothing but a digital ledger that is checked over and over. It is similar to a very good records keeper that never gets tired of numbers. I read and asked everyone in my circle, a majority of people had never heard of such a thing. It wasn't until I started working with my uncle from Pakistan that I started to understand Bitcoin. He wasn't my real uncle due to I am African American, but he taught me everything. He bought into Bitcoin at 35 dollars and cashed out at 2.3 million a year earlier as it spiked to 20k. He had worked in a European banking system as a CFO and informed me that this could hurt the banking system in their business on many levels. He also said once he heard about it that he immediately bought a lot of Bitcoin. Then one day he told me that we are about to start processing cryptocurrency transactions using several methods. I was shocked by the statement and asked him how. My first day of contact started with 8 Gpu's, on the boxes was marked 1080ti by MSI INC. Graphics cards were used to mine Ethereum a cryptocurrency that worked on a different algorithm but was similar to bitcoin and easier to mine. I had built hundreds of computers and felt that this would be harder to do. This first contact lasted all night as I lowered and connected CPUs and GPUs to the motherboard. Then the tank in which a government dielectric cooling agent would be used was NOVEC which cost around 2k a gallon.  I could only express the highest of astonishing emotion. I had never seen anything like this in all my years of building computers. This liquid would keep the whole system at 15 degrees Fahrenheit by way of an industrial chiller. It was around 4 a.m. and with the preinstalled hard drive, we turned the power on, and with amazement, the GPUs started mining. He said 40 more GPU's and 80 more ant miners to hook up and we will make some money. I turned and looked at him and said what date is this. I have to mark this date on my calendar. He moved back to Pakistan, but before leaving he left me everything and I still run it all to this date.

So I’ve been doing a bit of reading on how quantum computers work and how it could apply to Bitcoin mining. Let’s say a quantum computer with say 200 qubits came out tomorrow that could mine Bitcoin (i.e. it can do 1.6 novemdecillion (1.6 x 10^60) calculations in an instant. Assuming that the difficulty has just been adjusted and the computer performs a 99.9% attack on the Bitcoin network (i.e. it hogs up of 99.9% of the total hashrate on the Bitcoin network, including the insane hashing power it contributes), the computer could mine close 2013 blocks worth of Bitcoin instantly. At the current block reward of 6.25 BTC, it could mine 12,581.25 BTC instantly before the difficulty adjusts. It could also mine a good chunk of the next several 1000s of blocks before the difficulty grows so high that even it slows down trying to mine.",1627350665,23,1

We have seen some extremely toxic rhetoric lately from the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Brad Sherman.  That toxicity may spread to other less-informed politicians, and we may end up with bad policy in the end.  Some might be tempted to say that it doesn't matter--that Bitcoin was built to exist outside of legacy political and economic frameworks.  But let's be realistic, even though politicians can't stop this movement, they can put up some fairly large barriers and try to slow it down.

**What is needed is a Bitcoin-friendly PAC that works to unseat politicians who take hostile positions against crypto and the promises of the new economy**. I'd be one of the first to make a donation. It would be even better if they accepted donations in BTC, but that wouldn't be a requirement.

To me, it looks like the model generally agrees with Benjamin Cowen's forecast, a lengthening cycle into the Spring of 2022. We could see some kind of peak between 100k and 200k, but I'm unsure if higher than 200k is in the cards.

&gt;**Will Continue to Explore Cryptocurrencies**

That's all I read of Amazon's statement yesterday. Sounds like its potential for cryptocurrencies' futures to me, though most likely years out if it does become fruitful. Companies like this take years before they make a move. There are a lot of regulatory steps to vet and get passed, as well as a shitload of RnD, Testing, and whatnot before a product is ever officialized and launched.

I mean, just look at the company that handles Crypto for Paypal; Paxos Trust Company, LLC. They were granted a feasibility study to settle security trades like stocks and derivatives on the blockchain in 2019. We've yet to hear or see anything from that yet. Things from big players like this take time. Consider that, consider the potential future, then consider how much you're willing to DCA into that future if you find you want to be a part of it and own pieces of the networks all these potentials can develop into, with companies and countries of these magnitudes, and the markets that can potentially trade for this network's financial energies that are easily stored and transmitted.",1627404161,1,1

otmdrh,stratpop,Persuading people to buy Bitcoin,"The strategy I generally use for persuasion is to keep it casual, keep it simple and minimize pressure. This approach keeps people comfortable and above all keeps the dialogue open even if whomever is unconvinced at this time. You are selling bitcoin and selling is fundamentally an emotional process, meaning people need to like you, then people need to trust you, then they need to take action.

I’m going to start with conversation strategies, common questions, and close with general behaviors to avoid because if none of these strategies work, then avoiding the pitfalls should maintain your credibility and approachability.

The “elevator pitch” is your ability to explain why own bitcoin in about two minutes. There are many reasons, some of which I’ll likely touch on, and if you’re serious about bringing in new people then you should practice and revise as you learn and gauge receptivity from people you talk to.

Bitcoin is a financial asset so the entry point for most newcomers is going to be through the emotions of fear or greed. These are excellent mechanisms to drive action from people, but to grow true adoption and momentum the goal is to have people understand the hope that Bitcoin provides for the future.

**Greed:**

These people are usually obsessed with price. One of the best blanket statements I deploy is that no one who has held Bitcoin for 4+ years is ever down. This leads you into conversations around the deflationary nature of Bitcoin and the rewards of patience and discipline. Be honest with people, tell them what you bought in at, or what percentage of your net worth is in Bitcoin because if you truly believe in Bitcoin then you will be proven right. Any embarrassment due to volatility will be short lived.

Savings

One of the best ways to engage with people is to talk about their savings account because almost everyone has one and the interest rates granted to savings accounts is basically nothing. This approach transcends economic class but is especially convincing for people without much savings framed in the following way. Let’s say you have 1000$ in your bank account. Major banks offer .01% That nets you (1000 \* .0001 = .1) 10 cents in a year. Over at Blockfi, which I believe is the safest and most conservative of the interest bearing crypto accounts, you get 4% for the first .25 Bitcoin you deposit. You take 10$, buy bitcoin, put that in Blockfi and quadruple(10 + .04 = .4) your savings interest rate. Risking 1 percent of your savings to 4x your returns, you barely have to do the math.

Investing

The sophisticated investor can because convinced with arguments such as exposure to a new high growth asset class, proper risk management in the form of 1-5% of their net worth, the asymmetric risk profile of Bitcoin. If you’re having this level of conversation, then you’re likely trying to overcome technical uncertainty, send this person some sats or send them to Coinbase.

Why is it valuable or where does the value come from?

Technically speaking, X amount of electricity(ability to mine) generates Y amount of bitcoin(value) which serves as a soft floor for its value. Value drops &gt; Less miners &gt; Easier ability to mine &gt; Value rises &gt; More miners &gt; Harder ability to mine &gt; Value drops

Practically though, you’ve got the forces of supply and demand that are being driven by the feature superiority of Bitcoin to gold and fiat that are eating market share for various use cases. Those features being, it’s cheap and easy to move and verify, it’s decentralized, and in its short life it has proven to be a better store of value than any other asset class.

Questions around volatility?

Volatility is the vehicle to Bitcoin uses to grow. It would be completely unreasonable to expect a new technology that’s reshaping the financial landscape to grow in an orderly linear fashion.

**Fear:**

Given how the government and banks have operated through the 08 housing crisis and now the 21 global pandemic. Everyone sees the wealthy getting the first bite at the apple. Everyone sees the banks exploiting the government with no consequences. The endless money printing because, well it hasn’t been a problem yet. We see what the banks and governments of the world do. Bitcoin is the peoples response. I’ve got Bitcoin and no one can take it; it can’t be garnished, frozen, or seized. I can send it to whomever I want because it’s mine and no one can stop me. The antidote to fear is empowerment.

FOMO

Fear of missing out quintessentially captured by the question, “Is now a good time to buy?” Responding with “It’s always a good time to buy” is as facetious as telling people to buy low and sell high and will usually kill your conversation. The best answer I’ve found is broadly saying I don’t know for your financial situation. Bitcoin has some risks, but there’s a limited supply so theoretically the earlier you get in and the more risk you take on the better your position in the long run. Most importantly though this is your opening for a call to action. Encourage them to just try it out and see how it feels. Get 10$ on Coinbase send it to Green wallet on your phone, or whatever spot trading and wallet you would recommend. Better yet send them a couple sats right then and there.

General FUD

The most recent example being the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining. The best approach to address these sorts of reservations is history. Bitcoin has been around for 10+ years at this point and its first major use case was the purchase of illicit goods and services via the Silk Road. There’s been massive scams, the block size wars, government bans, hacks on exchanges, but you know what I saw? I saw the visionary whales opening huge positions, the individual early adopters growing into communities, financial institutions creating crypto products, major companies hedging their bets with Bitcoin, the beginnings of nation state adoption. I see the inevitable march to the future, that’s why I’m holding Bitcoin.

**Approachability:**

Bitcoin is a fascinating topic and people want to talk about it. You have to be likable before someone will trust you. Keep it cool.

If you’re seriously trying to convince someone, avoid all the memes and the “to the moon” bullshit. It’s good fun for hodlers, but reasonable people don’t put their hard earned money in jokes.

Do not lie, guess, or assume if you do not have an answer for a question. The most valuable answer for your credibility is “I don’t know”. 

It’s hard to convince people to consider your position if you come off as dogmatic. They're looking for information not a religion. Explain your reasons and give your exposure i.e. 5% of net worth or whatever. 

Don’t push Bitcoin non-stop in your circles. If people know you’re all about it and want to talk about it, trust me, they’ll bring it up.

There are some people that can not be persuaded. Some will have good reasons, some bad, but don’t do anything excessive and maybe they’ll come round when they’re ready to hear you out.

**Action:**

You want people to buy some Bitcoin. I’ve brought these up throughout the write up but I wanted to end with a list.

\-Recommend small amounts to try it out, 10$

\-Have a phone wallet you use and recommend just to show people

\-Send them some sats

\-Recommend Coinbase or whatever you think is easiest

\-Bitcoin rewards credit cards are starting to roll out

\-1%, 5%, 10% net worth allocation depending on who you’re talking to

Hopefully this helps because so many bitcoin people I’ve come across dive straight into a bunch of crypto shit that normal people couldn’t give two fucks about, while being really aggressive about it. The main goal is relating Bitcoin and its use cases to something people already understand.

Do you just trade for USD and then buy back in when the price is high and then buy Bitcoin back with USD? Or, is it cheaper and wiser to…say…convert your Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin or something even its high and then convert back to Bitcoin when the price goes back down?

I’m curious about CoinBase specifically and can not find the best practice for this “day trading”. How do you guys do it?",1627510498,13,1

The lightning network allows for way faster transactions for (currently) nearly free if not totally free. What happens in 2140 when all the bitcoin has been mined and everyone is using the lightning network (assuming lightning continues getting adoption)? 

Why would anyone use the normal chain for any transaction at that point given the cost? Maybe security? But if Lightning isn't secure then why the fuck are we using it? I'd imagine the fees miners will charge would only increase after all the bitcoin has been mined otherwise there would be no incentive for them to continue. And if not by a little, by a lot.

How do we not end up in an ethereum-like situation where miners have all jacked prices up so high that it's unusable to average joes? And, if the majority of people end up using lightning, how would the network not collapse when mining rewards are gone? Lightning only works if those channel payments are then written into blocks.

otv1f9,41Finance,What is Bitcoin ETF? Why is Bitcoin ETF so difficult to pass?,"Since Winklevoss and Cameron proposed Bitcoin ETF to the SEC in 2013, countless organizations submitted an application to the SEC throughout these 8 years, but without exception, they were either directly rejected or postponed. As a result, everyone has doubts on whether there is still a possibility for approval?

Although Bitcoin ETFs are frequently rejected by the SEC, there have been successful applications in other regions. For example, on February 18, Canada's first Bitcoin ETF was officially listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange(TSX). Then on June 24, the Brazilian Stock Exchange launched the first Bitcoin ETF in Latin America, and on July 14, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Brazil(CVM) approved the first Ether ETF and will be listed on the Brazilian Stock Exchange B3, which is also the first Ethereum ETF in Latin America. Since then, more organizations have moved towards applying for Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum ETF, such as VanEck, Coinshares, 3iQ, ARK funds, etc., but without exception, the US SEC has not approved any application for Bitcoin ETF. 

***So, what is a Bitcoin ETF?*** 

In short, Bitcoin ETF provides a legal and simple way to trade Bitcoin and trade in the traditional Stock market. The significance of this is that it lowers the entry threshold of Bitcoin. In the past, the complicated procedures of exchanges shut out most outsiders. The successful approval of the Bitcoin ETF means that many users in the traditional Stock market are likely to come across Bitcoin through ETF. In addition, Bitcoin ETF is a layer of legal identity. If the Bitcoin ETF can be approved by the SEC, it means that it provides a certain degree of regulatory recognition to a certain extent.

***Then why does the SEC not approve the Bitcoin ETF?*** 

The SEC supervises and manages the massive market scale, and the supervision of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is not clear in various countries, making the SEC extra cautious in the review process. Second, Bitcoin is still heavily controlled, and the price is often controlled in the short term through the combination of spot and futures. Moreover, the price volatility is very high, and the side effects on the victim increase with it. Perhaps, only when Bitcoin is no longer so easily manipulated will the SEC have the possibility of approving a Bitcoin ETF.

Furthermore, the liquidity of Bitcoin is insufficient. Its volume reached a trillion U.S. dollar market value this year. A magnate's purchase or even just words can affect the direction of Bitcoin, showing that Bitcoin's liquidity is insufficient. In a big market, the remarks of a minority of people are pointless. Perhaps as Bitcoin continues to grow in the future, the SEC will approve the Bitcoin ETF one day, but this day may not come so soon.",1627555352,17,1

I call it the ""Heat Theory."" The market seems to follow the temperature throughout the year (at least in America). Why is this? I don't know.

I know we're unlikely to ever see that again moving forward due to diminishing returns, but even if that's brought down to 100% over a 5 year period, that's still insane. I plugged in some numbers using a compound interest calculator and discovered that if you invest $200 a month for 5 years at a CAGR of 100%, the $12,000 you invested would hypothetically grow to nearly 300k.

otuo6z,Lagiol,Risk assessment leveraged grid trading," 

Hi there,

for about 2 months I am using grind trading on Binance and Kucoin. On Kucoin I use a very wide range without leverage for the long term, on Binance I create rather narrow grids for the short term when I expect a time of sideways action, especially after strong price action. For these short-term Grids, I use ""high"" leverage, usually an x10.

Now I was wondering what would happen in case of leveraging a wide grid for the long term (let's say BTC Grid range 22000 - 100.000, 149 steps, x10 leverage). How high would be the risk of liquidation in a grid with x10 leverage? I was playing around in excel and I am normally mathematical experienced but couldn't figure out how the risk of liquidation changes while running a grid. Is there a risk of liquidation at all due to the constant averaging down in the grid? And if there is a risk of liquidation, how could I calculate the amount of margin to avoid liquidation of my x10 futures?

Would be happy to get some ideas from you. Or maybe someone already has experience in this approach.",1627553590,1,1

I have always been aiming to buy 0.1 bitcoin (approx 4000 usdt?) To day trade and hope to earn just 1% return. However it appears that the price would drop drastically right after I attempt this action. This also happens with me in other coins when I try to trade with same amount of USDT. I have been using different indicators like the RSI, BB, vumanchu and EMAs, and all seem like its a good opportunity to buy... When I buy, i usually do limit on exactly the latest price was showing on the screen...

Am I doing something wrong here by investing this amount and hoping to get a 1% return? Are there some market theories Im missing here? Is there a better way in trading with this amount to gain a small amount of return? I trade with 30 mins timeframe if that would help.

Most my crypto is stored, at the moment, on paper wallets. Yes I know many would argue against that but I personally feel a paper wallet safely stored in 3 separate locations is very high on the cold storage/security rating.

I've been thinking lately to moving to a titanium stamped/brain wallet combo. Where you create a wallet using a 12 word pass phrase, stamp it into a titanium plate and commit to memory, then store securely the plate(s).

I love the idea of the brain wallet, it seems like the mind is the most private and secure place one has. If you can memorize a string of words and it becomes your storage of value, it becomes permanently portable and ultimately secure.

While traveling I may loose every single personal item in an unfamiliar land, and yet still obtain my greatest store of wealth, with a string of words in my head.

I could go on about that point but what I'm curious about is can I memorize the same pass phrase and then establish wallets on multiple blockchains with the same phrase and have a brain wallet on separate blockchains simultaneously?

I'm fairly certain it's technically feasible, but I wanted to prod and see what the community thinks on it before I move to such a format.

Preemptive edit: Sorry if this has come up before. Yes I understand that cashing in a strictly paper/brain wallet means it should be completely emptied when accessed, and yes that I could instead do a hardware/brain wallet. But I like the paper wallet, or non digitized hardware wallet, because using it makes it difficult and disincentives's me from spending from it.

No, but not for the reasons that you might think.
There have been many cryptocurrencies that have been developed that are technically superior to Bitcoin in some form or fashion, all have failed for different reasons, but they also failed for another fundamental reason. Their developers all misunderstood something fundamental about Bitcoin's success, that was quite deliberate and well known by the very early Hodlers.
And that point is that Bitcoin was developed as an experiment in Austrian Economic Theory, and until you understand (in detail) what Austrian Economic Theory predicts regarding naturally occurring money, you can't hope to predict the next-big-thing in the crypto marketplace.
But let me attempt to provide an extremely oversimplified explanation of what Bitcoin was actually designed to become, because it Wasn't intended to be used by the common person.
Austrian Economic Theory predicts that all natural moneies must first become the most tradable commodity within any society. One that nearly everyone (within that society) is familiar with. Many things have fullfilled that role on history; including the obvious ones such as gold and silver (although most people were never familiar with pure gold, and probably wouldn't have accepted it as payment from someone they didn't know), but also much more mundane commodities such as table salt (in regions far from a salt water coast) and common iron nails.
The conditions that predict that a particular commodity could become a natural money were…

(As mentioned) Familiarity

Durability (they didn't rot or otherwise decline in value during normal storage)

Fungability (each unit of the thing was equal in value as any other of the thing, under any normal trade circumstances)

Authenticity (it's hard to fake the real thing, at least to anyone who was familiar with it)

Predictability (on the sense of the trade value, so it would be hard to produce too much of the thing in too short a period of time) this one is related to the “regression theory of monetary value”

So, taken together, Bitcoin aims to satisfy all of these conditions, while also being a pretty good trade currency. You see, Bitcoin wasn't designed to be the “best” currency on the internet; but the “best” store of value on the internet. The store of value part is more important, because the better, faster, stronger trade currency can still BACK it's currency value with Bitcoin; as that is a deliberate process called a “sidechain”. But none of the other cryptocurrencies have chosen to become the silver to Bitcoin's gold, including the many “splits”. None have a hope over overtaking Bitcoin in market share, or even in net asset value, without understanding this part of what Bitcoin is; and the many splits also demonstrate that many in the current crypto development community overlook this",1627612894,2,1

Bitcoin options contracts allow traders the (ahem) option of buying BTC at a set price.

oubizk,Rascalthewolf,The power of Bitcoin and compound interest,"Many of us are familiar with the concept of compound interest, but sometimes it's difficult to grasp its true power. 

According to [this source](https://www.upmyinterest.com/fund?tick=Bitcoin) Bitcoin's mean annual return has been 408.8%.

This means that, if you buy $100 dollars of Bitcoin today here's what those $100 are expected to become:

Year                          Amount

2021                         100

2022                         509

2023                         2.589

2024                         13.172

2025                         67.018

2026                         340.985

2027                         1.734.933 (!)

Let me say this again. If these trends continue and you invest $100 in Bitcoin, you can be expected to become a millionaire by mid-2027! 

So stop worrying about the short-term fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin. Stop worrying if you don't have that much to invest. Even a little amount, with the power of compound interest, can become something huge if you just HODL and are patient. 

And remember Albert Einstein:

 “Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. **He who understands it, earns it** ... he who doesn't ... pays it.”",1627610898,28,1

The noncommercial, open and decentralised financial liberation of a global network of individual human beings. 

The cryptosphere and it's industry generally share this same noble ideology. 

There is a definitive point, objective and use case for crypto and therefore a clear justification for its energy usage.

Yet at every turn these days mainstream media and governments seem to take every opportunity to FUD Bitcoin and Crypto over energy.

But wait a fucking second....

 If we're going to start questioning and pointing fingers at the carbon footprints of industry.. 

Apart of self gratification... what the fuck is the point of the adult entertainment industry? Think how much coal is burned to produce that money shot!.... and for what.. to help someone beat one out.

The Gambling Industry? Think of all those website, machines, lotteries, sports and even entire cities like Vegas and how much needless/ pointless energy they sap from the grid every year... and for what?!?

It continues....

The gaming industry, the sport industry, the movie industry, the fashion industry, the music industry, the art industry, the TV and Broadcasting Industry, the advertising industry... the list goes on and fucking on.

Crypto was never about recreational fun and entertainment.. it has always had a serious objective other than for our own personal entertainment and gratification.

So if eco warriors are going to ignorantly start pointing their green fingers at Bitcoin and crypto.. then they need to realise that when you point a finger.. three fingers tend to actually be pointing right back at you!

Is there such a thing as a reputable exchange? Or are they all a bit shifty and you just have to take the gamble that you won't get ripped off when it comes time to sell?

ou9rsz,HUMPDAY77,"Bitcoin is Digital Gold. Except it is way better than Gold, of course.","Yup. 

If your first thought is,”why such an outrageous statement” Well, clearly you need to do your homework on bitcoin. Bitcoin is better than gold at being gold, as it has many of the same qualities, but more. It is scarce, as there are only 21 million that will ever be mined and put into circulation. It is becoming increasingly less inflationary as well, as miner block rewards go down 50% every 4 year. It is durable, as it exists on a network with many incentives to hack and find bugs in, yet has never once successfully been taken down in 12 years, and not even quantum computing in the future will be able to take it down. It is easily verifiable, as the code is open-source and everyone can refer back to a decentralized digital ledger to confirm their trade went through. It is censorship resistant, as countries can try and ban bitcoin, but network participants can always send transactions within countries that try this. Yet, it also is slightly scaleable, proving that bitcoin is somewhat representing the characteristics of not only gold but tech stocks. Lastly, it is portable, and this is where Bitcoin is a trillion times better than gold. You can send $1M bitcoin from New Zealand to remote desert islands in Canada for less than $10 via the lightning network, and it will be instantly delivered. 

Best thing yet, is its social impact on the world. To 3rd world countries, gold represents “that thing their labor gets exploited for”, as corporations hire kids as young as 8 years old to help in the gold mines, for little pay. Bitcoin, however, is a liberator for these countries. It allows people to send remittances back home to relatives, with no third party interception, as done by criminal organizations like West Union which take 30% off the top of the money you are sending back to your families for the groceries. This automatically boasts entire countries GDPs, while putting more food on the table. No brainer, this is freedom money, and without a doubt the world in 20 years will view it as such and potentially consider it as a world reserve currency. Remember, just because you don’t understand it doesn’t mean it’s a scam, because I promise you the kids of this digital age who grew up with smartphones and iPads in their faces at age 2, will overwhelmingly choose Bitcoin over Gold as an investment as money gets passed down from Boomers to Millenials, Gen Z, and Gen Alpha.",1627604226,0,1

ouufig,BitPLATES,New (2nd generation) Bitcoin seed storage device...,"Following months of Bitcoin community testing, and invaluable feedback, the BitPLATES® Domino® plates have now evolved into a 2nd generation product!

www.bitplates.com

Domino® plates are now more intuitive and easier to use... therefore, safer to store your Bitcoin wallet seed words, by preventing user error.

The addition of the built-in alphabet guide wasn't totally welcomed by all users, but we think that it's much safer to avoid confusion.

We've kept the 3mm hole to tie things to, or help hang the Domino® from, and the deep engraved letters, numbers and grid-lines with black inlay, still remain an integral part of the design.

Choosing 1 dot for the first 6 words, and two dots for the second six words is also more intuitive to understand, and was suggested my several people during the testing... This will make it safer to store 24 Bitcoin seed words per plate.

Removal of any brand markings and serial numbers, reduces the plates value to a non-technical thief, and is better for overall personal security.

Finally, the brushed-finish on both 304 (industrial-grade) and 316L (marine-grade) stainless steel models, reduces reflective glare, and therefore, makes the Domino® easier to use.

All of our existing customers are being offered a free upgrade, and there are free plates for all of our valued Bitcoin community testers, without whom, this evolution would not have been possible.

A video overview of the 2nd generation Domino® plates can be seen on our website or here: https://youtu.be/aIuayXWXzyg 

And a full step-by-step tutorial guide can also be found at on our website or here: https://youtu.be/kOalZrCujwk 

Just to make things a bit sweeter, we've added an automatic 15% discount when purchasing more than one plate at a time: www.bitplates.com

The price of a single Pocket Domino® starts at just £18.50 GBP before the discount, and we hope you agree that this is good value for money.

Your feedback, as always, is very welcome!

I want to further elaborate on this. It is important for people to understand the legal precedent that was used to take down both Helix and Bitmex, because it has everything to do with this bill. They charged bitmex with banking secrecy act violations and tax evasion aid because they had enough proof that bitmex did commerce with us citizens. This Bill isn't just a way to enforce this on US entities. We know the US will use DeFi overseas, and the federal agencies know it also. The mere failure to collect KYC by offshore entitites is in and of itself a breach of US law on the banking secrecy act. This law helps set the precedent domestically in clear language so that they have a basis to extrajudicially and extrajurisdictionally sieze, litigate, threaten, enforce, and prosecute anyone in the world in any country. That's why FTX and Binance instituted mandatory KYC yesterday. The purpose of this bill is to enforce global surveillance on all validators and miners in the world, not just the US. They will, and they intend to, and that's why they introduced the bill. They have been planning to litigate against Trezor and Ledger Nano for a long time. This Bill is to help them do it.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been a calculated play by the way. You cannot tell me that the billionaires in the states didn't have something to do with the CCP shutting down Chinese mining and that crypto billionaires are totally innocent. Who stands to gain from making it illegal for most open source borderless home users and businesses operating as governance token holders, validators, and miners. This is why they want Marathon to censor blocks. If you let them censor Ofac, soon they will start censor everything. This is setting up to be a hostile takeover of the industry by wallstreet types to try to fundamentally backdoor the protocols to censor at the node and miner level. They wouldn't do that if they didn't have a plan to collect KYC and a plan to make it only affordable for mega industry players to collect that KYC, putting the miners and validators and governance in the hands of these billionaire corporations in the states.",1627676459,14,1

oushzc,AlexandrosTsolis,The other story about money,"We are doing the following thought experiment in the steps described below, with some instructions as well.

&amp;#x200B;

instructions have to be followed for the experiment to be completed, or else you are not really considering what is written below...

&amp;#x200B;

...so if that is the case for you, and you didn't follow the instructions below,

&amp;#x200B;

please don't waste our time and effort with your reply about something, that you could have posted as a subject on its own elsewhere...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1.Imagine that you do something,

&amp;#x200B;

instructions 1: feel free to imagine, following the steps and instructions below from beginning until the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications...

&amp;#x200B;

follow the instructions from beginning until the end, and don't waste my time and effort.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2.You do this something that you imagine in two different ways from its beginning until its end

&amp;#x200B;

instructions 2: you can come back to me with two stories, each with a beginning and and end, about something done in two different ways from its beginning until its end.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications...

&amp;#x200B;

Two stories that start and end, don't waste my time and effort, and follow the instructions from beginning until the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Where the instruction don't limit you, there you are free to imagine.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3.First you do it with money from its beginning until its end

&amp;#x200B;

\*instructions 3:\*Trade is happening in the first story with money.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications...

&amp;#x200B;

This means that, either you do something for another, and another gives the agreed amount of money to you,

&amp;#x200B;

or another does something for you, and you give another the agreed amount of money to another...and the agreed amount of money...

&amp;#x200B;

is the amount of money you and another...agreed in order to trade.

&amp;#x200B;

Example...

&amp;#x200B;

Why the below is provided as an example, in case it offends you, you will find out in number 4.

&amp;#x200B;

e.g. prostitution is legal in the place where this example...takes place, and you or another give money to the other other one in exchange for sex.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

4.Secondly you do it without money from its beginning until its end

&amp;#x200B;

\*instructions 4:\*Trade is happening in the second story without money.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications...

&amp;#x200B;

This mean that, you do this for another and another does that for you, this and that is whatever it is for the specific occasion and instance, and money isn't involved between the two of you, in the second story.

&amp;#x200B;

Also this means that the stories you can come back to me are one story with trade and money

&amp;#x200B;

and the other story also with trade but without money...so follow the instructions, and don't waste my time and effort.

&amp;#x200B;

Example...

&amp;#x200B;

And now time has come to find out why prostitution was discussed in number 4, with the following example.

&amp;#x200B;

e.g. you and another have sex, and money isn't involved in this example.

&amp;#x200B;

You and another freely chose to have sex with one another, and freely chose not to use money.

&amp;#x200B;

Why this example is used in number 5., you will find out in number 6.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

5. For the second way when you do it without money, you have to spend less time and effort to do it, from its beginning until its end

&amp;#x200B;

\*instructions 5:\*In the first story when you do it with money, you have to spend more time and effort to do it, from its beginning until its end

&amp;#x200B;

Example...

&amp;#x200B;

Time to find out the difference between 4. and 5. with the following example.

&amp;#x200B;

e.g. You have sex with another, another is your partner in life, and after sex...

&amp;#x200B;

having heard that that money's means , store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account...

&amp;#x200B;

you decide to give to another, who is your partner in life, after you had sex with one another...money...

&amp;#x200B;

so as to show the value of another to you, for the exchange that took place, with a real unit of account...

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think another would do, especially if you were a man and another was a woman...and you gave to a woman who was your partner in life, money after having sex with her, in order to thank her for having sex with you?

&amp;#x200B;

Still unconvinced?.. ok, let's move one...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

6. I wonder would you say you are using your money wisely?

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications...

&amp;#x200B;

follow the instructions from beginning until the end, and don't waste my time and effort.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

7. Because if you would, wait a minute before you start replying, and listen to me.

&amp;#x200B;

In both stories that you can come back to me, you are trading with another.

&amp;#x200B;

In one of the stories, you have to spend more time and effort, to do what you freely imagined you do with another, plus you have to also use money on top of having to spend more time and effort to do it, unlike the way you do it in the other story.

&amp;#x200B;

In the other story, you have to spend less time and effort, to do what you freely imagined you do with another, and as you also have to not use money in the second story, you don't have to spend time and effort to use money, unlike the way you do it in one of the stories.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

8. So it seems to me that the other story, and not one of the stories, is what you would be looking for...if it seems sensible to you to spend less time and effort, and not get caught up in one of those stories...you know the ones I'm talking about, no?.. if not, I am talking about one of the stories where you have to spend endless time and effort even for the simplest of things.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey, I don't understand the above, what's the summary?"", one may ask.

&amp;#x200B;

Money reduces the time and effort people have to spend to trade with one another.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications for the ""I don't understand"" one.

&amp;#x200B;

When one is wasting one's money, it is up to that one to find this out in the end for oneself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2. When the way one uses money increases the time and effort one has to spend to do what one wants to do, one is wasting either one's money, or another one's money, or the rest one's money.

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications for the ""I don't understand, and I am offended"" one.

&amp;#x200B;

When one is wasting another one's money, another one doesn't want to waste another one's time and effort, and tries to avoid trading with one, and trades...with another one.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3. And in the end, how all have to remember the above, is...

&amp;#x200B;

When some are wasting the rest of our money, it is up to the rest of us to show to some that we don't want some to be wasting our time and effort with their endless nonsense stories about what money does, because...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Clarifications for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Money reduces the time and effort people have to spend to trade with one another,

&amp;#x200B;

or people are wasting each other's time and effort spending their money...

&amp;#x200B;

...and then they have the nerve to call what they are doing trading with one another

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Up to now, some people don't know how to not waste one another's time and effort, it seems to me,

&amp;#x200B;

and they add money on top of that, as if that would make their case better...

&amp;#x200B;

... how about they put some time and effort thinking now, so that they don't end up wasting our time and effort, because money reduces the time and effort people have to spend to trade with one another.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ok and in the end?**

&amp;#x200B;

just do me a favor and consider the following...

&amp;#x200B;

looking around you for cases where the majority of people spends more time and effort to do things than needed, either because...

&amp;#x200B;

the majority doesn't know something a minority knows (regardless of this being a secret of the minority or openly discussed by the minority, both are valid), or

&amp;#x200B;

a minority dictates the way a majority does things, and this way isn't the least time and effort one.

&amp;#x200B;

And what's the least time and effort way? It is common sense, and

&amp;#x200B;

common sense happens...in a funny way. Why? Because if the way that you made sense of the world around you wasn't funny for you, well

&amp;#x200B;

then it wouldn't be funny for you...and you would be only afraid or worse all the time...

&amp;#x200B;

But both the minority and the majority are trying to avoid being only afraid or worse all the time, as their senses work...in a funny way for them...regardless is they occasionally forget that.",1627674486,5,1

ourboy,tpmv69,Single Bitcoiner that's Relentlessly Stacking Sats,"Hello my fellow Bitcoiners, I don't know where I'd be without Bitcoin, Bitcoin Twitter, and reddit. I've been single for several years and haven't gone on any dates since COVID started. I know it's lame but I've been focused on Bitcoin. 

Don't know what I'm trying to accomplish in this post, but I felt like sharing how I feel since none of my no-coiner friends can relate (I've convinced some to buy BTC but they aren't believers). Prior to Bitcoin, I was a lot more open minded with girls; I still had high standards, not necessarily for looks, but I care about intelligence + character. But ever since I've dived super deep into Bitcoin, it's hard for me to see myself with someone that doesn't understand the revolution we're on. 

For me, there's nothing more important than to relentlessly keep stacking sats and evangelizing Bitcoin, even if it means living in a cheap apartment, not going on trips, and living far below my means in order to buy more Bitcoin. I'm quite fortunate to discover Bitcoin when I did, but I was young working at a minimum wage job in a first tier expensive city so it sucked. For a few years I was working 50-60 hours in the film industry (low paying industry btw) barely surviving, never eating out, rarely having fun since I couldn't afford it, and I barely could afford buying sats. But I bought as much I could. 

Over the years I've advanced in my career and finally after 3 years, I accomplished my goal of getting a job in Bitcoin! I've only been in the job for four months but I'm incredibly happy to wake up everyday and help grow this amazing ecosystem. 

I'm used to being alone, I'm not one of those guys/girls that's always in a relationship and this isn't me searching for pity. I don't need pity and I've learned to be happy with who I am. Not being in a relationship has afforded me to really keep my living costs insanely low. I don't have a six figure salary so the only reason I've been able to stack sats is due to making lots of sacrifices. I don't have a car, I take public transportation, and I cook 5-6 days of the week, and I haven't done a big vacation in several years. All the extra money I have that isn't used for expenses goes straight into Bitcoin like clockwork. I don't even care what the price is. I buy as soon as I have funds available.

In no way am I saying that having a gf is bad. I know lots of Bitcoiners have families + girlfriends and I'm not a hater. I'm genuinely happy for everyone that has a partner in life! I believe that you can be successful, buy lots of Bitcoin, and still have a family or gf. I know so, because I've met people on twitter that are in these situations and I'm happy for them. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I've accepted that in order for me to find a new gf, I'll need to find a girl that's also a Bitcoiner. I know it's shallow and my no-coiner friends always get upset with me when I say this. But I just don't see a way I can get in a relationship with a girl that just wants to spend money and live a high consumer lifestyle since that's not me. In no way am I saying that all girls are like this, I see lots of girls on Twitter working in Bitcoin that are awesome and stack sats too. I know they exist but I just haven't been lucky to meet any. I've now become a person that's attracted to a woman that is focused on her future which includes buying Bitcoin for herself. Does anyone else feel this way?

I'm an introverted extrovert so I'm okay being alone. I get comfort and peace being on Bitcoin Twitter and reddit. I also feel joyous every time I buy more Bitcoin because I know one day it will lead to economic freedom. Without Bitcoin I would truly be lost. Bitcoin gives me hope and I'm incredibly thankful to each and everyone of you. All my knowledge of Bitcoin came from Twitter, Reddit, podcasts, and reading articles. I've truly built out incredible knowledge about the world, money, and it's astounding how much this community has given me. I just hope I can find a Bitcoin girl that shares similar values as me. Thanks all.

Having these centralised systems make it easy for people to adopt, and make it even easier for people to send crypto to others (like me) for services.

I think PayPal, Amazon etc should be welcomed with open arms and everyone should encourage their use to get more and more people investing and filling their toe in.

Having millions of new users who can throw money at Bitcoin easily is absolutely beneficial to everyone currently holding, so don’t hate this mass adoption, you really should be celebrating it.",1627659530,32,1

ockzor,black-dog-pt,Brainstorming: Can Proof-of Stake based coins be more attractive to big states that want to keep control?,"Disclaimer: I am Bitcoin-Only, anything but Bitcoin is garbage to me. This post is just a discussions on a recent thought I had when assessing potential risks for future Bitcoin adoption. I am a very recent Bitcoiner so it is very possible that I'm making a basic logic mistake. Feel free to point that out.

As stated above, I only hold Bitcoin and I am constantly assessing the risks of Bitcoin failing or the Bitcoin adoption not going as I expect in the next 10 years.

As any Bitcoiner I don't believe any other cryptocurrency has any value because they trade-off fundamental values that only Bitcoin has been able to bring to the table (truly decentralised, censorship resistant, proof-of work, etc.). However, I am trying to assess the possibility of a Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrency seeing wider adotption or at least endorsement from big states (US, EU countries, etc), and here is my rationale:

**If Proof-of-Stake is worse at ensuring decentralisation because whoever has the biggest stakes has the biggest power, wouldn't that be attractive for governments who want to keep at leats a certain level of control on the circulating currencies?** For instance, If the US was to use adopt one cryptocurrency as a reserve asset, would they be more attracted to one that they could more easily control (like Ethereum 2.0)?

I am assuming that everything else works properly in Ethereum 2.0 in this case (both technically and economically), which is far from obvious and granted.

I had picked a random address before the shut down: (1EFUPp9gf1kWevhVKvchEdAXk3YQiBtnub, if you're brave enough to mess with it), and sent about 100 quid, 0.0041 Bitcoin, to the address. After about 12 hours, I get an email from an unrecognized address to my main email (not the email associated with my bitcoin address) saying the following:

Dear Mr. M2BT\_1328,

Thank you for your donation to our organization, and your support for our international pursuits is duly noted. We will use these funds to continue our cryptographic activities to bring online privacy to all.

It had this PGP ID: 7A35090F. What group is this? I know that the chances are low that this is real, and that it could be any old person on the internet trying to troll me, but how did they get my main email address, that I have not associated with any of my subscriptions, least of all bitcoin.

I did some further digging, and found this is a freewallet.io address. Clearly the account holder did not want to give any information to a registered company, so they opted for the opensource alternative. Can anyone do more checks and digging? I really want to know what's going on, and if this is a hoax. If I didn't make a mistake, the PGP is the same as Cicada 3301, and the signature at the end of the email supports that. I have read that in the US, Cicadas swarm every 17 years. Honestly that's as far as I can get since I work as a builder and am not tech savvy .

Do you see any way this could change in the future where you could allow for essentially trustless-SPV wallets without this requirement?

Breeze e.g. is non-custodial, but it works by essentially running a node on your phone?  
Now this would be good option, if the wallet itself wouldn't charge you fees on top of it?  
Phoenix is another wallet, but also charges you fees to use it (and requries a huge 10k sat inital deposit?).  
It's similar for muun IIRC.

Wallet of satoshi is of course custodial, but since it doesn't charge you fees it actually seems like the best option for a mobile wallet right now?

But then there are also transaction fees that senders have to pay to minders. At the moment, average transaction fee is USD 10.61 ([https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin\_average\_transaction\_fee](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee)). Also, at present, each block contains an average of 2,420 transactions. In total, the fees paid by all senders inside the block would be USD 10.61 x 2,420 =USD 25,676.2

So the total comp that a miner (or mining pool) who successfully ads a new block would be: USD 207,500 + USD 25,676.2 = **USD 233,176.2**

ocghhz,smartmonty21,Awesome method to secure your seed phrase.,"Hi folks. We know in crypto world, private key gives anyone the full authority to use the funds. So securing your seed phrase is of utmost importance. Here i suggest a very clean and a secure method to store your seed phrase(which in turn generates your private keys).

1. We need a MacOS computer. Open the Keychain Access program(it is buid-in app on every mac).
2. Click the File menu and choose NEW KEYCHAIN to create a new keychain(it is a file basically). Give it name which will make this file easily recognisable to use even after many years(eg- important file OR bitcoin wallet seed phrase keychain). Create a very very strong password for it consisting of numbers alphabets &amp; special characters.
3. On the upper left corner of the Keychain Access program, you will see your newly created Keychain added to the list of default existing kekychains. Select the newly created keychain. Then go to File menu and choose NEW SECURE NOTE. This will create a secure note item inside this keychain. Give the note a suitable name(eg- my first bitcoin wallet details ETC).
4. Write down the seed phrase in this note. So now, your seed phrase sits in a secure note, which intern in sitting inside a special keychain file which a very strong password.
5. Now, from your Finder, reach your newly created keychain file(it will a .keychain file) and transfer it to a usb drive. Once you have the keychain file on a usb drive, enter the keychain access app and right click your keychain file(in the right upper corner of the app) and select DELETE FILE AND THE REFERENCE. This will delete that keychain file from your mac and it will also dissappear from the keychain access app. So if someone gets to your mac, opens keychain access, he will see only your default keychains. Problem of storing seed phrase in a secure note in the default keychains is that the password for it is the same as your macs logins password(which is mostly a simple password for daily use ease purpose).
6. The vey strong password that you created in step 4, you save it in a secure note in your default keychain. 
7. So if thief gets to your mac, reaches your keychain access and gets your very secure password, he will not get the secure keychain file(which you will be storing in a secure place away from your mac). You can make multiple copies of the secure keychain file and store it in multiple usb drives and store them at multiple places. As no one can open the file without the very secure password, just getting the file will not be useful for the thief. 
8. On a later date, if you feel that your very secure password is compromised somehow, you can open your secure keychain file from the usb drive in other secure imac and change its password.
9. This way, using the keychain access app of macos, we can secure our seed phrase.
10. Please leave your comment if you feel this helpful OR if you find any flaws in this method. Thank you.",1625251472,12,1

ocg72v,arcrad,Mark_bear two years ago...,"&gt;And then I found it: I heard about Bitcoin. I read the white paper. Then I read it again. Then I did research into the math/cryptography... this is IT, the kind of thing I was looking for:

* 'good' money

* mobility

* cannot be taken by force

* will never have its value inflated away

​

Meanwhile, it slowly dawns on the rest of humanity that ""central banking"" and its fiat ""play money"" currencies is the biggest scam of all time. Slowly.

​

We're one financial crisis away...

​

At this time, people are still willing to part with some/all of their Bitcoin for a large enough amount of fiat money, say, USD. As fiat fails (in the future), there will come a point where nobody will be willing to exchange their Bitcoin for ANY amount of fiat. ""Permanent Backwardation.""

oces58,GBArcturus,"I had a psychic premonition dream about bitcoin and other crypto, call me crazy.","I often have that seem to always predict the future, i do psychic work and am I practicing witch. These premonition dreams are not always literal so keep that in mind. My dream was set 10-15 years into the future and i was in an old school but it looked very futuristic but “trashy” it looked kind of like a refugee camp but with holograms and that kind of stuff. I was surrounded by surprised and worried looking students, i introduced myself and told them i was from the year 2021. They believed my and started showing them their phones and other technologies. They showed my a phone which looked kind of like an old nokia 3310 but with colored oled display and where the rubber silicone buttons are on the old nokia there were screens little oval screens that could turn into emojis letters and numbers etc.

On the larger screen on the phone at the too i saw a little logo that displayed a symbol that looked like alien currency, i asked what’s that? They told me it’s their wallet app. I immediately understood it was a crypto wallet and asked about which cryptos were most valuable. They told me bitcoin, but that they used safemoon and the other part of town used dogecoin. 
They explained that they were “refugees” teens and young adults who fled their homes and larges city’s because they didn’t have any freedom and we’re being used for their blood? I don’t know either…

These refugee communities all used different crypto’s in what they called a hub. A hub consisted of different communities that all used different currencies and had different rules with their own smart contracts. They also told me that ethereum and bitcoin were the main world wide currency and ethereum smart contracts held all laws and were used to sell anything from insurance to houses. 
Whenever the refugees traveled to mayor cities they exchange their crypto for bitcoin or ethereum at these kind of gates with terminals they inserted their phone devices into to be let into the city. They put their arm into these terminals and get pricked with vaccinations. 

They also told me Bitcoin and ethereum became centralized by mainly china and the usa and the European Union. They held all validators and banned anyone else from mining. Ethereum 2.0 was banned and cancelled and all other proof of stake tokens were used by what they called free minds, refugees and people outside of mayor cities. The world seemed really deviced.

Once school was out they took me to a mayor city and we went out to eat, they now explained that only in large companies and city’s they used bitcoin and ethereum. In all other cities and towns they used altcoins like ada dogecoin shiba and safemoon. If you wanted to get into a large city you would have to have bitcoin and get vaccinated at automated machine terminals. We got our food from a large vending type machine the size of a wall and we payed jn bitcoin. But they didnt show it as for example 0.000005 but it looked like this. (5)5 BTC, we ate are food and went to a market to buy some items. They were long streets with a lot of virtual screens showing all kinds of adverts. When i took and item from a shelf a hologram of a bitcoin coin flew towards the standkeeper.

This is making bitcoin extremely unfriendly to use for day-to-day transactions that average at about $10-$50, paying a $10 fee for such transactions is absolutely ridiculous. 

Even though it is lower than the ridonculous $60 fee BTC saw back in April during the ATH, it still is pretty useless.  

That problem has been bought up multiple times but nothing seems to be the solution. I am aware of the Chinese crackdown on miners and upcoming difficulty adjustment but daily use cannot be put on hold and if such external factors affect bitcoin fees every time then the developers need to acknowledge the problem and find a solution. 

I have tried everything to [speed up the transaction](https://blog.blockonomics.co/how-to-speed-up-bitcoin-transactions-4ca4159991ab) but nothing seems to be working other than paying the $10 fee.

Hello everyone, today i want to tell you about my crypto-depression. 
So in 2010 i was working in IT company and my friend from work told me about bitcoin mining. 
Next day after this information i register on this forum and start mining coins, everything going perfect but bitcoin price was really low and unstable. 
I was investing everything in gpu. Couple times i lost my fund's on scam-exchange but i still had a lot of ""mining power"".
In 2015 i quited my job and invest my whole savings in bitcoin, in that time i had more than 15 bitcoin's and gpu worth 20k$.
And after 2 or 3 week's everything fucked up, in same time i lost my job and my wife get sicked.
In Nov 2015 i selled everything but still i had cash to pay, so you probably asking why i made this post?

Now after 6 years i have biggest depression ever, if i only burrow money from somewhere 5 years ago and didnt sell my miners...

I have feelings that i lost my biggest life chance to get really rich and i just want to forget about crypto and work in normal work but it is impossible. 
It's hurt much more if you can see that your old crypto-friend's get cars and houses from crypto profit, i wonder if someone have some feeling's as me.",1625223783,163,1

The recent popularity of Bitcoin has brought the attention of governments and central banks worldwide. We've seen certain opposition from countries like India, China, and Russia against the pioneer cryptocurrency. Countries that are friendly towards Bitcoin (like the US and UK), are constantly surveilling its citizens for any suspicious activity. I've seen that some countries have taken action against Bitcoin mixing services with the excuse that they're used for money laundering and terrorist financing. Since most (if not all) of these centralized mixers don't comply with KYC/AML regulations, they're subject to being shut down by the government. Imagine if criminals begin using Bitcoin mixers in mass for money laundering purposes. If the trend continues, mixing Bitcoin may turn out to become illegal.

Do you think there's a possibility this will happen in the future? If not, why? What do you think will happen once mixers (both custodial and non-custodial) are banned by the government? Will this force people to use privacy coins more thoroughly? Or will everything remain the same? Any input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance",1625217234,18,1

Dude is a real OG if so," **Note:** ***Springs or shakeouts*** *usually occur late within a TR and allow the stock’s dominant players to make a definitive test of available supply before a markup campaign unfolds. A “spring” takes price below the low of the TR and then reverses to close within the TR; this action allows large interests to mislead the public about the future trend direction and to acquire additional shares at bargain prices. A terminal shakeout at the end of an accumulation TR is like a spring on steroids. Shakeouts may also occur once a price advance has started, with rapid downward movement intended to induce retail traders and investors in long positions to sell their shares to large operators. However, springs and terminal shakeouts are not required elements: Accumulation Schematic 1 depicts a spring, while Accumulation Schematic 2 shows a TR without a spring.*

A week ago I got logged out of my account and couldn't log back in.

It keeps saying incorrect password despite me using the correct one.

Still, it could be that I forgot the password so I tried to reset it. But their password reset page is broken!

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I've emailed them, opened a support ticket, messaged, and posted on their social media.

But still not a single response from them.

Their phone numbers are also switched off.

Hello everyone. For all of us who are very pro Bitcoin and other crypto.
We all look to the day that more people use it and accept it as daily use.

However we are far from that. One thing that I am finding is Bitcoin is still not user friendly enough.
Many people even who are young like 25 and under and even over 25 etc. Are not tech knowledge or financial educated enough to understand.

I am thinking that even the apps out there are still confusing for people to use.
Sure many people may own a mobile phone but many do not understand how they work.

Therefore many people do not understand Bitcoin and seems too complicated still.

What are 5 things you think are needed to make Bitcoin more easy for people to use?

More less they can use and move Bitcoin without really being mindful of what they are doing in a transaction.

I'd make a subreddit, private it, and have the description be my wallet address.  Then whoever wants it would DM me and I'd post one of them and allow the user.  After that they screenshot it or save it then they will send the bitcoin to the address and then I'll delete the post and wait for the next person.

odhfhy,VeronZ76,Bitcoin on TV?,"
Bitcoin is well-known in cyberspace as it's often proclaimed to be the ""currency of the Internet"". There are a lot of education material about Bitcoin either in the form of a book, a web article, or a video tutorial. This is great since it helps spread awareness for Bitcoin across the Internet. But something else is missing for Bitcoin to reach a wider audience. It's yet the day where Bitcoin isn't promoted/marketed on TV. Seniors aren't connected to the Internet as much as young people are, but they are mostly watching TV. All it takes is for someone to air a commercial about Bitcoin on TV, and the pioneer cryptocurrency will be on a road towards non-stop growth in the mainstream world. Add to this a movie related about Bitcoin and you'll see demand rise like skyrocket in no time.

Do you think Bitcoin will be promoted across TV sometime in the future? If not, why? What do you think will happen after Bitcoin is marketed across major TV networks? Will it boost mainstream adoption? Or will it have no effect whatsoever? Your input will be greatly appreciated",1625392886,4,1

It’s been a year since I entered the currency circle. After experiencing bulls and bears, I still look at the future instead of looking back at the past time. I am full of joy for the future. I also feel that his birth and development have spread to the whole universe in the past ten years. Announcing that there is a new thing on the earth that humans cannot interfere at all. As long as humanity is greedy and selfish, there will be countless human individuals holding Bitcoin, opening nodes for him, and mining for him. Although the current market oscillates in a space, it does make people feel very tortured, and sometimes I feel that my chest is suffocated. Grin Grin Grin
Bitcoin is the first existence independent of the existence of human civilization after the birth of human civilization on the earth. Its quadratic elliptic curve encryption and the packaging and verification system attached to human society are completely immune to humans. Quite terrible, quite remarkable. Imagine that since the birth of human civilization on the earth, human beings can control everything at will. Everything can be said to be under the control of humans, even cancer, AIDS, etc. will be controlled by humans sooner or later. But humans just can't control Bitcoin, whether it is reverse cracking the private key or successfully attacking the entire package verification system, humans can't do it. So in fact, Bitcoin, born in 2009, is already a new civilization.

I want to call it a kind of machine civilization, using technology, mathematics, cryptography, and philosophy to form the underlying blockchain technology to constrain humanity and establish a new economic order, or in the near future, I hope to use the forum The study, constantly improve my own cognition, and become a valuable member of this civilization, to bring my views to everyone, and to help everyone.",1625380790,3,1

I believe that the majority wants to see Bitcoin being globally adopted, including myself; I imagine people using it in their daily transactions for food, coffee etc. Lightning payments can tackle the scaling issue and the only thing left for Bitcoin to be used as a currency from the whole world is its mass usage. If the adoption rate increased so would the price's standability. 
 
So, do you set a good example and pay with Bitcoin whenever you're able to or do you prefer not to spend your coins? I'll speak my personal view about this, in my country none of the merchants accept it and I rarely buy some hosting services from the internet. If they do accept it, I'll pay for it, but not because it satisfies me; it's just that I can't with PayPal. I'd prefer paying with PayPal for online services, because I may be scammed if they aren't popular.

ob38ds,AwfulWaffler,Deflation: the real reason it's good for you,"tl;dr: No matter who you are, deflation can be good for you. But there are some misleading misconceptions.

When most people talk about deflationary vs inflationary financial instruments, they assume that deflation is good because ""savings are the difference between production and consumption."" Which is true for most people, but NOT MOST WEALTH.

This is because most wealth is held by entities that produce nothing, whether we're talking about ultra wealthy individuals or the state.

This entire logic train that ""savings = production -consumption"" is based on the assumption that the people reaping the profits from production are the people doing the producing, which is seldom the case.

I have run several businesses in my life, large and small, and I've consistently made the most money by paying a small amount of money to other people to produce things, which I then charge other people a large amount of money to buy, then pocketing the difference. Any business owner who has done well will tell you that human capital - the balancing act of hiring the best possible people for the least possible pay - is key to long term success.

And, this is the real hangup. Anyone who has run a business will tell you, you wanna maximize the amount of money you can charge people for the crap you sell. Which means you want wages to be high in general. Which means you want all other businesses to be as generous as possible (thus trapping less wealth).

But pretty much every business I've ever run, the biggest expense is... payroll. So to maximize my own profits, I want to pay my employees as little as I can without sacrificing quality.

This is why we have boom and bust cycles, because it's in my business as a capitalist to horde my wealth and drive down wages at my companies, but it's against my interest for everyone else to do that. And if every single business owner AND employee horded twice as much money as they do now and didn't spend it out into the economy... that's what we call a depression.

This doesn't mean inflationary money is good. Inflation doesn't really affect hording or expending of wealth from the TRULY wealthy all that much BECAUSE WEALTHY PEOPLE NEVER HOLD THEIR WEALTH IN INFLATIONARY FIAT.

Only poor working people keep their money in fiat because they typically work paycheck to paycheck and need immediate access to their money, and they literally can't afford the risk exposure of investment. So deflationary currency will benefit working people a lot, assuming it succeeds, by giving working people a foothold for retirement and other long term building.

Sorry, I know this was a long rant, but the idea that everyone just holding onto all their wealth and stockpiling all their ""profits"" is good for the economy is so backwards. A healthy economy is one where things are moving all the time, a market which is efficiently transferring commodities to people who need them the most. Unfortunately that's pretty much not how things work in our economy, as I explain here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/nnxssa/we_do_the_work_they_take_the_profits_some/

The best most of us can do is try to defend ourselves against these monumental tidal forces of the ultra wealthy accumulating and trapping wealth. Pretending those forces are good for everyone (which they spend a lot of money trying to convince us all is true in their media) is a fast way to financial ruin, which is why we need to be realists and study how things REALLY function so we don't get stomped like most poors (which = most people).

Inflation is REALLY harmful to the majority of working people precisely because most people have great difficulty building savings or buying better assets (most folks in the USA, the richest country on earth, live paycheck to paycheck) and 2-3% inflation is brutal for those folks.

For wealthy people, inflation can be completely avoided. For them, BTC's chief value isn't ever going to be deflation, but PROFITS they can reap through the platform. Totally different game they're playing than most working stiffs, you see. (Again, see my post link above)

So, if you're wealthy... hopefully you already know what you're doing, and it should be easy to hold onto your wealth (by siphoning it up from people who are doing the actual producing - which is literally what we call ""investing"" in the vast majority of cases)

But if you're NOT wealthy, don't try to pretend you are UNTIL you are and you have enough money stockpiled up to make your money do all the work so you don't have to.

I'm expecting a lot of folks to downvote this because it challenges the prominent narrative. I don't care, because the prominent narrative is deliberate disinformation that can lead to bad decisions. Keep stacking sats and best of luck!",1625077332,2,1

For the first time in history, money is separated from the state. Bitcoin aims to be an alternative to Fiat currencies by providing financial inclusion to anyone, anywhere in the world. A system governed by mathematics and cryptography will put an end to corruption once and for all. The pioneer cryptocurrency can be used globally without limitations thanks to its decentralized model. People can send cross-border payments in minutes without the need for ID verification, background checks, or credit checks of any kind. This brings a whole new era of financial sovereignty as we know it. 
 
What do you think? Is Bitcoin better than Fiat? If not, why? Is it still too early to tell?",1625077018,5,1

I recall seeing a top voted comment critisizing LN over a year ago which I now see was complete BS. The comment I read was saying that LN can never catch on because in order to onboard you must perform an on-chain transaction and since bitcoin can only support around 7 transactions per second it would thus take decades to on-board the world population.

Now that I've used LN I see that comment is full of shit. Yes, I myself had to perform an on-chain transaction, but my friend that I sent sats to never had to do such a thing. This means that one entity can potentially onboard MILLIONS of users with a SINGLE on-chain transaction.

I think of the el salvador government and I assume they are doing exactly this. They will be sending every adult $30 worth of bitcoin. That's over 130 million dollars worth of bitcoin. They can send that entire amount of bitcoin to their personal government lightning network address. This will be one on-chain transaction. From this point on they can send $30 of bitcoin to over 4 million adults individually to their corresponding lightning network addresses for a total transaction fee cost of 0.1% which is actually pretty amazing if you compare that to the traditional banking system.

I encourage everyone here to play around with the lightning network. Maybe next time you have poker night with the boys get them all to install a lightning wallet and gamble away using sats. I can only see the lightning network getting better from here. Right now you have to scan a qr code but I'm sure in the near future we can use NFC and simply tap to pay with LN.",1625076778,83,1

What I realized though... it it doesn't have to be this way. If less people were mining a bitcoin, then the difficulty would just go down, and the power usage would go down as well. I was trying to thinking if there was a simple solution to this. I've heard of ""proof-of-stake"" which sounds interesting, but is also a pretty big departure from the current system.

What if, instead, we used a randomized selection for each block of, say, 10,000 TB of available mining RAM/GPU (or some other suitable number). So if you make your machine available for mining, it has a probability of being chosen proportional to it's computing power. This not only could significantly reduce power output, but it *doesn't change miners incentive, and actually increases profit.* If the probability of being chosen is proportional to mining capacity, then your probability of being the one to mine the current coin should be relatively unchanged, and your electricity output would be significantly reduced.

Thoughts? And, would their actually be any way to implement this in bitcoin if the political will existed, or would a totally new currency be needed?",1625067511,24,1

oazoqe,ravenhands,Intrinsic value is exactly what Bitcoin has.,"Intrinsic : **Belonging to the real nature of a thing; not dependent on external circumstances.**

**: Of or relating to the essential nature of a thing; inherent.**

&amp;#x200B;

Value  :  **Worth in usefulness or importance to the possessor.**

&amp;#x200B;

There are of course a number of definitions for 'value' but I think we generally understand the meaning of it to be along the lines of 'worth' or 'importance'.

So intrinsic value would imply something along the lines of : 'inherent importance'. A worthiness based upon what it is itself and not dependent upon external circumstances.

And in a sense, everything has a certain intrinsic value. For eg. Portland cement is inherently worthy because it is good at setting when combined with water. That is its 'valuable inherent nature'.  

Water keeps us and all life alive, it hydrates everything that needs hydrating, so that is arguably waters inherent value.

Golds inherent value is probably its malleable workable texture as a soft yellow metal which means it can be used for jewelry and industry.

Golds 'monetary' worth is dependent upon it having been allocated a monetary worth based upon these external circumstances along with its prettiness in jewelry or its difficulty of mining and relative scarcity. Its monetary value has been allocated and can be un-allocated by the centralized legacy financial controllers.

What is Bitcoins 'valuable inherent nature'? 

Well, in essence it was created to *be* new money. That is the designed nature of it and the system which supports it, that is the starting point of why it is considered worthy and why people swap their old money for it. 

The network effect that has followed and all its other brilliant characteristics increase its value because they make it better and better at being money. 

But its 'valuable inherent nature' or 'intrinsic value' is that it was created for the sole purpose of being money.

It has always made more sense to me that it is better to have something solely dedicated to being money than something which can be temporary allocated. 

One could say Fiat money is dedicated to that purpose and so it is, but its downfall is that it is owned and controlled by a small amount of people and manipulable to such a degree as to make it unacceptable to those who prefer to *own* their own money. 

Bitcoin is better, freer, fairer money. 

That *is* its 'intrinsic value.'",1625066966,5,1

ogkzds,Accurate-View-2114,Michael Saylor's argument on Gold (Commodities) and why they are awful.,"Was watching Saylor/Breedlove discussion on Gold/Commodities and ""why it's awful"" [https://youtu.be/1Ms7ql\_S63A?t=1560](https://youtu.be/1Ms7ql_S63A?t=1560)

&amp;#x200B;

I am kind of new to the finance/economics side of things here. I understand the basic model of profit/loss and cost of production with respect to units sold from a company's operating POV.

I watched the his argument on Why Gold/Commodity is awful from the 26:00 mark to 30:37 mark.

I have few questions specifically on what Saylor talks about in the above segment (would appreciate if anyone would care to shine a light and educate on the following points) -

1. Why are commodities awful?
2. (27:14) Why do the commodities producer keep pumping commodities even if they are losing money? \[is it because they hope the price would go up or the variable cost would go down ONE day?\]
3. (27:52) Can't transmute $ X bn gold mining capital to something else. \[can't they sell it off to recover atleast the fixed cost?\]
4. (28:28) The producers overproduce the commodity. (28:45) the real risk of gold (29:22) variable cost equals price \[how can one produce at below variable cost?\]
5. (29:36) Government will produce below variable cost to maintain jobs \[how can one produce below variable cost, and how it helps it maintaining jobs?\]

I basically want to understand his argument on why Gold/Commodities are awful based on what he is saying here.",1625793334,10,1

ogifes,Tyranoc4,⚠️ Celsius Network WARNING⚠️ 🚩,"This is a warning for all current clients and people thinking join [Celsius Network](https://celsius.network/).I learned the hard way that lending plateforms are not trustable at all.They say they support decentralisation and freedom etc... THEY DON'T. All they want is more (your) money.Celsius created hodl mode for clients that want a ""security"" so a hacker can't withdraw everything instant and will need at least 24 hours to deactivate it and 24 more to change withdraw address.Once again all of these measures aren't for your protection but for them to keep your money longer (as banks do).So the hodl mode wasn't created to help celsius clients but for the sole purpose of blocking clients funds at their will (with or without their consent).

Freezing account COULD be ok for legal reason not for personal reason of a staff member.

\*\*So what happened exactly?\*\*Withdraws on celsius are free and seems to be unlimited. So I wondered if there was a limit, even a big limit to avoid spam and what's celsius policy about lot of withdraws.So before doing anything I asked on the telegram group these questions politely.An admin nicked ""Xineohp"" answered me “Don’t abuse the system” several times pretty aggressively. I said it wasn't multiple times too but he didn't seem to understand and told me to contact support.So I proposed to contact support to ask them directly and maybe show a potential flaw so they can patch it.So in view of the aggressiveness I decided to not do any batch withdraw and just make a single withdraw. Just withdraw MY funds peacefully.

*few minutes later*Before take my phone in my hand I got a notification from celsius app ""We activated HODL mode on your behalf"" and my mom got the SAME.So the guy seems to have search for me in clients files based on my telegram username AND ip to link to my mother (which live in same home) to completely freeze us.

Asking questions politely is not a reason to block ME and all my family members. Even worse as anybody could use your nickname on telegram, so anybody could say anything using your name and your money get frozen. So that could be someone else than me!

When I said ""Celsius team forced all mode on my wallet"" I got muted from the group by the same admin ""to avoid FUD spread"". FACTS are here.

I did a thread on twitter that was ignored by influencers I tagged which prefer share their referrals and make money than warn their community. I also tagged CEO which is active on twitter (maybe he isn't aware of these internal practises?) but he played blind too.I tagged cointelegraph writers and proposed to tell them more about al lof this but I wasn't contacted. Probably the same reason again, not financially interesting. If I'm not wrong they are paid to write about companies, why would they write a free article warning ppl?I contacted the admin the again which doesn't denyed anything but just answered

`I do not want FUD in the chat. Celsius placed you in HODL mode because of your actions.`

`I'm no longer going to communicate with you. Please communicate directly with Celsius via support email at` [`app@celsius.network`](mailto:app@celsius.network)`.`Then I contacted another admin of that group and described all of this and after insistance I got that answer:

`I have just heard back from support and they said they will be in contact with you about your account`then no way to get any response from him either and of course refuse to unmute me too.

The so called support doesn't answer since more than 72 hours now and I have serious doubt getting answer anytime soon, telegram muted and telegram group admins refusing to answer anymore.Celsius often give welcome bonus to get more clients, they once proposed to do review on App Store/Play Store/TrustPilot in exchanges of bonus (20$ crypto if I remember well).

Cryptocurrencies have a bad reputation because it's often related to scam, rug pull, ponzi schemes AND exit scams.My family members don't want to hear about crypto anymore after about -50% and now plateform blocking us just because a staff member doesn't like me.From my side I hope to get our accounts unfrozen asap so if I still have that right I'll withdraw everything and uninstall the app forever if not I will sue them. My family members will market sell asap because as I said they're now disgusted of crypto.

For current and potential futures clients of Celsius you are free to listen that warning, you can't get a worse red flag than this. I you absolutely want a lender I may redirect you to [Nexo](https://nexo.io/).You should think twice before depositing anything on Celsius.My DM are open for any journalist that would like more infos about this.

The company is currently partnered with Coinbase, Circle and BlockFi to allow its cards to access crypto wallets on those platforms.
Visa said digital payments such as cryptocurrency have the potential to disrupt $18 trillion of annual consumer spending with cash and checks.
Visa said Wednesday that more than $1 billion worth of cryptocurrency was spent by consumers globally on goods and services through their crypto-linked cards in the first six months of the year.

By comparison, Visa estimated crypto spending at only a fraction of that amount in the same periods last year and in 2019. The payments giant did not release exact numbers.

“We are doing a lot to create an ecosystem that makes crypto currency more usable and more like any other currency,” Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu told CNBC. “People are exploring ways in which they can use cryptocurrencies for things they would use normal currencies for.” He added, “There are lots of issues in terms of volatility, etc. But that’s up to the owners of cryptocurrencies to manage and track.”
According to recent research from Visa rival Mastercard, 93% of North American consumers plan to use cryptocurrency or other emerging payment technology, such as biometrics, contactless, or QR code systems, in the next year. The study also showed that 75% of millennials would use crypto currency if they understood it better.

“We see a lot of volume on our [network] of people buying crypto currencies at these various regulated exchanges and as far as we can see that trend continues,” Prabhu said.
This summer, Mastercard will launch a card with crypto exchange Gemini, co-founded by billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. The card will allow consumers to earn cryptocurrency as a reward. However, cardholders will not be allowed to access their digital wallet on the site.

Visa also announced Wednesday the FTX cryptocurrency platform, founded by billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, would be added to its Fintech Fast Track Program, focused in part on making cryptocurrency more practical for consumer and business spending.
Circle, BlockFi and Coinbase, which went public in April on the Nasdaq, are current Visa partners that allow cardholders to spend from their cryptocurrency wallet at more than 70 million merchants globally. Visa estimated crypto-linked cards and other emerging payments including biometrics and QR code have the potential to disrupt the $18 trillion spent every year with cash and checks globally.

Bitcoin’s market cap topped $1 trillion for the fist time in February and hit an all-time high near $65,000 per unit in April due to retail investor enthusiasm during the coronavirus pandemic as a store of value and an inflation hedge. However, bitcoin has fallen roughly 45% since then — and last month, it plunged briefly below $29,000 where it started the year.
Prahbu said Visa has no near-term plans to add any cryptocurrency to its balance sheet like Tesla, MicroStrategy and other companies have done recently.

“We don’t hold crypto currencies on our balance sheet today. We hold currencies on our balance sheet that we need to run our business. We hold currencies that we get paid in or we pay people in. That tends to be the dollar, euro, pound. So we don’t have plans to hold crypto currency because it’s not typically the way we get paid or the way we pay people,” he said.",1625775390,1,1

oeg15f,fullmetalz3,Powering 2x3090s and it's risers from a single PSU,"Hi everyone. I currently am planning a 4x 3090 mining rig. I have 2x EVGA 850W supernova GA power supply where I plan to have 2 cards and its risers on each 850W psu.

The 3090s I have require 3x 8 pin connections. The power supply provided 2x single 8 pin cables and 2x 8 single with a (6 +2) split.

Currently powering the 2x 3090s with no issue while they are connected directly to the board.

However, adding 2 cards and utilizing gpu risers I'm having a concern on how to power the risers.

Can anyone recommend how I power the 2x3090 and its risers from the 850W power supply?

I know I shouldn't use Sata and it seems like 2x risers on molex is also not advised.

Should I use an 8 pin cable split on the tail end of the 8 pin cable to power the gpu riser or is that also a fire hazard?

Do I need to upgrade the power supply just for extra 8 pin vga ports?

Thanks.",1625518165,2,1

[Explained]","Some of the community members complained about the incompleteness of my previous post \[[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/odfu8m/my\_wife\_convinced\_herself\_and\_myself\_to\_not\_sell](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/odfu8m/my_wife_convinced_herself_and_myself_to_not_sell/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\], therefore I would like to take the chance and explain the arguments in more details.

We have a portfolio of BTC, gold, ETFs and Rental real estates, and BTC is 25% of the entire portfolio ( and 100% of our Crypto portfolio). We started to buy BTC since 2018 in average price of \~24.000 Euro.

So the ""Hope"" for us is not only about the price action of BTC but mostly about the role it can play in the world financial system. BTC is a democratized, decentralized and incentivized financial system which leads to less corruption and power accumulation among those elites of the political groups.

BTC is a hope for people to secure part of their wealth against systematic inflationary economy. My wife's parents have worked 40 years and now are retired, their retirement is \~ 40 Euro per month!!! They have never had a chance to invest their money in any financial asset/market due to the established corruption in the government and financial sector. BTC is an anti-corruption system which is transparent and mathematically secured and predictable.

BTC is a peaceful financial system which did not establish itself through f\*\*king bloody wars, like petrodollar, so it is a hope to guarantee the future of our children. It is green and environmental friendly, since it allows anybody to plug Terawatts of renewable energy available around the world to its network. It is fair because it does ask your nationality, color, gender, race and etc. BTC does not believe in ""with us or against us"", so it is a hope.

I hope it could help.",1625515441,4,1

But this recently came across that on Kucoin there is a way to lend and the interest rate seems better than the two platforms mentioned. Is there a catch? Is lending on Kucoin riskier than just holding them on BF or Celsius?

Safety is my priority so maybe 1% higher APY at the cost of 10% of risk won't work for me personally.

I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oga8Pwbq9M0) talk and was left with a couple of questions.

1. If miners get fees for what's going on in the side chains, then who will provide resources to validating what's going on in the side chain? Doesn't it need its own miners? And what do those miners get?

2. Why do we need to ""improve miner incentives""?

3. When he says we'll copy alts, does he mean we'll transact wrapped alts in sidechains? Or is he speaking of clones that can't be ""unwrapped"" into the underlying alt?

4. Paul says you can run a turing complete language on this. He also says you can't use BIP-300 sidechains to extract money from people. How do these two statements play together?

The MMC card is uses is incredibly specialized and there's no chance of accidentally putting in a modern HD SD card that may have a virus on it because it won't fit.  The OS is incredibly specialized as well.   The load time is just right to give you time to think before you panic sell, but also not too slow so you could pull up your saved files where the private keys and seeds are stored to make your moves.  The only short range technology you'd have to be careful with on the N-Gage is BlueTooth, but there's no NFC device to worry about.  You can't even charge the thing without a specialized adapter.

REvil also known as Sodinokibi is a cybercriminal group that runs private ransomware as a service (RaaS) operation

On July 2 REvil attacked Kaseya, which is a cloud based platform and has a net worth over $2 Billion, over 40,000 organisations worldwide use Kaseya's services.

Although no company has come forward with the details on how the cyber attack has affected them, the number of attacks is expected to increase, says John Hammon, a security researcher.


REvil has asked their targets for a ransom of $70 million in Bitcoin for publicly decrypting their data within an hour, This leaves companies with one choice, to pay the ransom and wait for REvil to decrypt their data. 


The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have been working with Kaseya and coordinating to conduct outreach to impacted victims.

og6i6b,ismirschlecht,Andreessen Horowitz is planing to invest Billions in cryptomarket,"Sorry, my lazy ass just used a famous website to translate this article, but my english isn't any better you guys.

You may tend to refuse to see this as positive, but the more big players are in, the more stable BTC price becomes. If there's just hodlers and a few whales, whales can do whatever they want. Also there's no more FUD about ""cracking down"" anything, because who is messing with big money (except reddit stonks of course lol).  


&gt; **Investments in crypto assets**    
&gt;  
&gt;The venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz invested in companies such as Airbnb, Facebook and Instagram at an early stage and was thus able to gain a high reputation in the venture capital market. Today the venture capital firm is one of the most prominent in Silicon Valley. The venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, has also been investing in crypto startups since 2013: including in the first place in Coinbase, but also in Uniswap, Dapper Labs, Protocol Labs, Solana Labs and Facebook's stablecoin project Diem.   
&gt;  
&gt; **Great success with the Coinbase IPO**   
&gt;  
&gt; In April 2021 Andreessen Horowitz made good money on the IPO of the Coinbase company. Even before the IPO, investor Marc Andreessen owned shares in Coinbase. Andreessen Horowitz itself also held 24.6 percent of Class A shares and 14.2 percent of Class B shares right from the start. This made them the largest institutional investor in the crypto exchange. The venture capitalist entered with $ 25 million and a company valuation of $ 140 million. When the company went public, the stake was worth around $ 11.2 billion on an initial price basis.    
&gt;  
&gt;**Crypto Fund III**    
&gt;  
&gt;Now the venture capital firm wants to continue investing in crypto assets. The third crypto fund that the company is launching is totaling 2.2 billion US dollars. According to ""Trending Topics"", this makes it the largest crypto fund that has ever been launched. For comparison: Andreessen Horowitz's Crypto Fund I was worth $ 300 million, and the Crypto Fund II was $ 515 million. According to the company, top-class employees from a wide variety of areas have also been hired to support the venture capitalist with the challenges in the crypto sector. Last year, for example, Anthony Albanese, who previously worked at the New York Stock Exchange, was hired to manage investments. The company website also states that Andreessen Horowitz is more excited than ever to see how and where the crypto industry will develop: ""We have never been so excited about where crypto is going and we are relying everything on the talented, visionary founders who determined to be part of the next chapter on crypto. If you are one of them we would love to hear from you ”. Judging from this, Andreessen Horowitz will probably make further crypto investments in the future. The venture capitalist is optimistic about the potential of cryptocurrencies. According to the company's website, it is planned to continue investing in crypto networks and the founders and teams who work in this area.",1625748447,14,1

She also expressed her concerns in a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler on Wednesday. Warren stated that she needs to get Gensler's response to the SEC's power to protect consumer investment and trading BTC before July 28, and to determine what actions Congress needs to take in the future. Warren said in a statement: ""Although the demand for BTC and cryptocurrency exchanges has soared, the lack of common sense regulations has left ordinary investors at the mercy of manipulators and fraudsters. These regulatory loopholes endanger consumers. And investors, and undermine the security of our financial markets. The SEC must make full use of its power to deal with these risks, and Congress must step up to close these regulatory loopholes.""",1625747996,157,1

I'm considering starting to trade and for that I would like to make wire transfers.  I have used ACH in the past with Coinbase Pro and while it shows up in the account immediately, it takes a week to allow me to withdraw my bitcoin after I purchase.  For what I would like to do, that sounds kind of slow.  I'm a little worried about Coinbase wire transfers also being slow which of course destroys the point of a wire transfer.  However, nobody else sounds any better.

Unfortunately, I cannot use Binance so I'd like to hear about other quality exchanges that will allow me to efficiently (within a few hours) wire in fiat cash.

When you send a response, please write that you have used the exchange, you have withdrawn bitcoin, you have wired them fiat money, the exchange received it and how fast the exchange credited your account.  If you did not do all of this then you are just guessing and wasting everyone's time.

Thanks and happy hodling.",1625739982,3,1

og39ln,Vairlee,Deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China: Bitcoin and other private digital currencies are speculative tools that pose potential risks that threaten financial security and social stability,"For the first time, the People's Bank of China responded to the recent crackdown on Bitcoin, emphasizing the opposition to the central bank's digital currency, and emphasizing the threat of stablecoins. These relatively negative new formulations mean that the future regulatory situation does not seem to be loosened. This is the first time to take the initiative to explain the recent strong supervision policy, revealing the following important meanings:

First, the negative vocabulary of virtual currency is no longer used, but it is defined as a private digital currency (a typical representative of a private digital currency is currencies such as Bitcoin, including various so-called ""stable coins"" launched). A new formulation is more in line with international standards. But there is also a vague definition of whether it is an asset or a currency. For example, Zhou Xiaochuan recently called it an encrypted asset.

The response emphasized that ""for these private digital currencies, whether they exist as monetary credit or not, we are still observing and studying"", showing a relatively open attitude. Prior to this, Li Bo, deputy governor of the Central Bank (now transferred to the IMF), expressed similar views, saying, “If it is used as an investment tool, many countries, including China, are also studying how such an investment method should be. A kind of regulatory environment"".

In addition, more information about relatively strong supervision has been released.

Second, respond to the issue of digital currency can be divided into private digital currency and central bank digital currency, to oppose the two, and to emphasize the follow-up promotion of central bank digital currency with more space. In the case of confrontation, the negative and the impact are even stronger.

Third, the response stated that these currencies themselves have become a speculative tool. This situation has occurred in the market, and there are also potential risks that threaten financial security and social stability. At the same time, it has also become a payment tool for some money laundering and illegal economic activities. The so-called ""stable coins"" of some commercial organizations, especially the global ""stable coins"", may bring risks and challenges to the international monetary system, payment and settlement system, etc. We are still quite worried about this issue, so we adopt Some measures have been taken.

Private digital currency is classified as a ""speculative tool"". Although this is a neutral term, it must be negative in the current policy context. This is also similar to the expression of the former central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan. Zhou Xiaochuan said, “When it comes to the innovation of cryptocurrency, China’s attitude is also to focus on how you serve the real economy in many analyses and discussions. To provide important services to the real economy, then more attention may be given.""

Fourth, this response emphasized stablecoins. Previously, only Bitcoin was mentioned in the Financial Committee meeting. In fact, compared to Bitcoin, stablecoins anchored to the US dollar have more applications in illegal activities such as speculation, payment and even money laundering and gambling. But on the other hand, it seems that the conventional practices have been exhausted, except for the prohibition of institutional participation, public opinion crackdowns, and crackdowns on electronic fraud and money laundering. Whether there will be more stringent measures, such as new regulations and even legislation, to target stable currencies such as USDT, remains to be seen.",1625734009,3,1

Growing up, I have always read, heard, and occasionally seen how so many impoverished nations are unable to have the same standard of living and quality of life that I enjoy every day. 
 
Now that places like El Salvador, Venezuela, and Nigeria are on the front lines of full scale Bitcoin adoption, the only feeling I have is hope for them. 
 
How incredible would it be if these countries were able to get themselves back on equal footing and dramatically improve the lives of their citizens? 
 
I’m hoping, and we should make sure we fight hard for them. I’m so far from being an activist, but I’d fashion signage, take to the streets, and vocally show support for them.

The whales are waiting much lower price to enter heavily. What do you think about it? Is the descent over or will the price go even lower?

If an attacker were to gain 51% of hash power, they could spend BTC, wait until the vendor delivered the purchased product (e.g. fiat), and then use their excess hash power to produce a revised block history without their BTC spend in it.

Say nodes agreed on a block revision limit, say, 6. This would mean that if they see an incoming chain that is longer than the previous longest chain they have seen, they would reject it if it involved changes in blocks further back than 6 blocks ago.

If vendors then required 6 confirmations before delivering purchased product, they could be sure that the consensus chain will not be revised to double spend the BTC used to purchase that product.

od4qo8,HammondXX,Crypto Cancer and Covid and kids oh my. Lets pull together #blockchain4good," 

I am looking for initial interest, and I will do the leg work.

So I was just informed of how scary it is for pediatric cancer survivors to exist in times of covid. Would your exchange sponsor help us donate crypto to an accredited charity to help improve the quality of life of kids with terminal diseases and compromised immune systems?

I was thinking of bringing video games especially VR to hospitals to give an escape.

I think this will help adoption and be amazing PR for crypto as we know, all while doing something awesome in scary times.

The idea is simple:

We get exchanges to allow users to dust their accounts of tiny odd crypto and donate it to a cause.

(e.g. we get the charity to set up a wallet(s), and the crypto goes directly to them.)

I have had preliminary very early conversations with folks at Childrens Miracle Network, Cals Angels and Lurie's Childrens. They are skeptical of crypto as a whole, but like the idea if it was all on the up and up.

I am trying to drum up initial interest to make it a reality",1625340811,3,1

A number of looming risks could result in further pain ahead.
Bitcoin had a solid start to 2021, hitting an all-time high of nearly $65,000 in April. But the digital coin closed out the first half of the year down about 47% from its record — and a number of looming risks could result in further pain ahead.
While proponents appear to be holding onto bitcoin for now, other investors are wary about wild volatility in the market and what it means for their portfolios. With that in mind, here are five of the biggest risks facing the cryptocurrency as we enter the second half of the year.
Regulation
One of the biggest risks for bitcoin right now is regulation.

In recent weeks, China has clamped down on its cryptocurrency industry, shuttering energy-intensive crypto mining operations and ordering major banks and payment firms like Alipay not to do business with crypto companies.

Last week, the global crypto crackdown spread to the U.K., where regulators banned leading digital currency exchange Binance from undertaking regulated activities.

Simon Yu, co-founder and CEO of crypto cashback start-up StormX, told CNBC that China’s moves should be viewed as a “positive” thing for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like ether as it will lead to more decentralization. However, he added that “over-regulation” of crypto in the United States could be a problem.

However, he added that “over-regulation” of crypto in the United States could be a problem.

“As a country, the U.S. has too many departments regulating it from different angles — is crypto a security? A commodity? A property?” Yu said. “As of now, the U.S. hasn’t figured out how to properly regulate the industry, which oftentimes leads to decisions that are difficult for crypto to operate.”

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other officials have recently warned about the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit transactions.

Last year, former President Donald Trump’s administration proposed an anti-money laundering rule that would require people who hold their crypto in a private digital wallet to undergo identity checks if they make transactions of $3,000 or more.
“We’ve long warned that shifting investor sentiment or regulatory crackdowns could pop bubble-like crypto markets,” UBS wrote in a note this week.

Volatility
Another big risk is persistent, extreme swings in the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies.

Bitcoin rallied to an all-time record of around $64,829 in April this year, on the day of crypto exchange Coinbase’s blockbuster debut. It then tumbled as low as $28,911 in June, briefly sliding below $30,000 and turning negative for the year. It’s since risen back above $34,000.
Bitcoin bulls see it as a kind of “digital gold” — an asset uncorrelated to the wider marker that could provide sizable returns in times of economic turbulence. But while volatility can be good when the price of an asset is going up, it goes both ways.

While you would have doubled your money if you bought bitcoin in January and cashed out in April, today those year-to-date returns would be 18%. Still, that’s above the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index, which is up 16% since the start of the year. And over the last 12 months, bitcoin has more than tripled in price.
“Limited, highly inelastic supply on single cryptos can exacerbate volatility,” says UBS. “Limited real world use and extraordinary price volatility also indicate many buyers are seeking speculative gains.”

Meanwhile, the trend of traders who have made highly-leveraged bets on bitcoin getting flushed out of the market has led to intense price fluctuations this year.

While continuous volatility could put off some investors, Ross Middleton, chief financial officer of decentralized finance platform DeversiFi, said that volatility in itself isn’t a barrier to institutional adoption.
Volatility “can actually be a significant draw as the potential for large price movements means that funds can make significant profits with a relatively small allocation compared to the size of their overall portfolio,” he told CNBC.

“The longer that Bitcoin moves sidewards in the $30-$40k range,” Middleton added, “the greater the perceived ‘base-building’ and the sooner that new capital will flow into both the asset and the wider crypto market.”
Environmental concerns
Questions surrounding bitcoin’s impact on the environment could be another big headwind for the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin mining equipment requires lots of electricity to run, and bitcoin’s energy consumption has risen considerably over the years in tandem with its price.

While bitcoin’s critics have long warned of its huge carbon footprint, Tesla CEO Elon Musk brought the issue back to the fore this year.",1625339922,2,1
od4f0t,legionaryexes61,Bitcoin mining is now easier and more profitable as algorithm adjusts after China crackdown,"More than 54% of bitcoin’s hashrate, which is the collective computing power of miners worldwide, has dropped off the network since its market peak in May.
The bitcoin code has re-calibrated to make it 28% less difficult to mine.
Miners who are still plugged into the network stand to make greater profits while most of the network’s miners remains offline.
It just became a whole lot easier and much more profitable to mine for bitcoin.

The world has known for months that more than half the world’s bitcoin miners would be going dark as China cracked down on mining. Now that it’s happened, the bitcoin algorithm has adjusted accordingly to make sure miner productivity doesn’t continue to fall off a cliff. 

That adjustment – which took effect early Saturday morning – also means that way more cash is going to the bitcoin miners who remain online.

“This will be a revenue party for miners,” said bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi.

“They suddenly own a meaningfully larger piece of the pie, meaning they earn more bitcoin every day.”
Mining made easier
A bitcoin miner runs a program on a computer to try to solve a puzzle before anyone else does. Solving that puzzle is what completes a block, a process that both creates new bitcoin and updates the digital ledger keeping track of all bitcoin transactions. 

China had long been the epicenter of bitcoin miners, with past estimates indicating that 65% to 75% of the world’s bitcoin mining happened there, but a government-led crackdown has effectively banished the country’s crypto miners. 

″For the first time in the bitcoin network’s history, we have a complete shutdown of mining in a targeted geographic region that affected more than 50% of the network,” said Darin Feinstein, founder of Blockcap and Core Scientific. 
More than 50% of the hashrate – the collective computing power of miners worldwide – has dropped off the network since its market peak in May.
Fewer people mining means that fewer blocks are solved each day. Typically, it takes about 10 minutes to complete a block, but Feinstein told CNBC the bitcoin network has slowed down to 14- to 19-minute block times.

This is precisely why bitcoin re-calibrates every 2016 blocks, or about every two weeks, resetting how tough it is for miners to mine. On Saturday, the bitcoin code automatically made it about 28% less difficult to mine – a historically unprecedented drop for the network – thereby restoring block times back to the optimal 10-minute window. 
The bitcoin algorithm is programmed to handle an increase or decrease in mining machines, according to Mike Colyer, CEO of digital currency company Foundry. “It is a self-regulating market that does not require any outside committee to determine what to do. This is a very powerful concept,” he said.
Fewer competitors and less difficulty means that any miner with a machine plugged in is going to see a significant increase in profitability and more predictable revenue.

“All bitcoin miners share in the same economics and are mining on the same network, so miners both public and private will see the uplift in revenue,” said Kevin Zhang, former Chief Mining Officer at Greenridge Generation, the first major U.S. power plant to begin mining behind-the-meter at a large scale. 

Assuming fixed power costs, Zhang estimates revenues of $29 per day for those using the latest-generation Bitmain miner, versus $22 per day prior to the change. Longer-term, although miner income can fluctuate with the price of the coin, Zhang also noted that mining revenues have dropped only 17% from the bitcoin price peak in April, whereas the coin’s price has dropped about 50%.
“We are expecting a period of much higher mining profitability for Compass Mining clients,” said Whit Gibbs, CEO and founder of Compass, a bitcoin mining service provider. “We expect miners to be approximately 35% more profitable.”

Blockcap’s Feinstein agrees. “We are expecting a revenue and profit increase for the foreseeable future.  This was an unexpected gift to the network, not just on revenues but on decentralization and sustainable energy metrics.”

Although the difficulty drop benefits all miners, those using new-generation equipment stand to benefit the most.

Feinstein tells CNBC that most of the gear in China that was turned off was old-generation equipment, which is inefficient and runs on much smaller profit margins.  
Six-month surge
It is hard to predict how long the hashrate deficit will last. Barbour said that it is totally possible that Beijing could simply reverse their policy, and this could only be a short-term interruption. 

If not, most mining crypto experts agree that it will take anywhere from six to 15 months for all of that idle and displaced mining hardware to migrate. “It’s going to take a long time for the surplus to find a home,” said Barbour. 

Gibbs thinks miners should see heightened revenue for at least the rest of 2021.

“Every day the Chinese miners are searching globally for places to turn their machines back on. There is very limited space at the moment,” said Colyer.
Part of the problem, according to Feinstein, is that even before China cut off mining, there was already a lack of infrastructure to house the new-generation miners being deployed monthly by Beijing-based manufacturer Bitmain.

Now that the market is flooded with an over-supply of used mining rigs, it is tough to say how fast countries will be able to absorb the influx of gear. 

“Some mining companies have had everything built and were just waiting for these ASICs to plug in, which would only take a couple days,” explained Arvanaghi.

“Others may need to build containers, extend warehouses, or increase their power capacity. We won’t see the hashrate reach what it used to be overnight, but we’ll see it tick back up over the next few months,” he continued.
Of all the possible destinations for this equipment, the U.S. appears to be especially well-positioned to absorb this stray hashrate. CNBC is told that major U.S. mining operators are already signing deals to patriate some of these homeless Bitmain miners. 

U.S. bitcoin mining is booming, and has venture capital flowing to it, so they are poised to take advantage of the miner migration, Arvanaghi told CNBC. 

“Many U.S. bitcoin miners that were funded when bitcoin’s price started rising in November and December of 2020 means that they were already building out their power capacity when the China mining ban took hold,” he said. “It’s great timing.”

But Barbour believes that much smaller players in the residential U.S. also stand a chance at capturing these excess miners. 

“I think this is a signal that in the future, bitcoin mining will be more distributed by necessity,” said Barbour. “Less mega-mines like the 100+ megawatt ones we see in Texas and more small mines on small commercial and eventually residential spaces. It’s much harder for a politician to shut down a mine in someone’s garage.”",1625339764,5,1
od4bzq,boggyboarding08,Here’s what cryptocurrencies will look like in 50 years according to experts,"We may not know what stocks in the S&amp;P 500 will do next month, or in two years, but over the decades, we have a pretty good hunch that they’ll go up. Most of us also know what a stock is, and that definition hasn’t changed in centuries.

None of that is true, of course, with cryptocurrencies. Some predict the coins will forever change how we understand and interact with money and others warn of a dangerous bubble.

But whatever a person forecasts for cryptocurrencies, it’s getting harder to imagine a future without them.
CNBC asked experts from a variety of fields to describe their vision for the currencies 50 years from now. Their answers have been condensed and edited for clarity.

• Ivory Johnson, certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management

“Cryptocurrencies will disrupt traditional finance because one of their most attractive utilities is the ability to efficiently transfer payment across borders with little to no cost, delay or foreign currency fluctuations. With respect to bitcoin, 50 years is a long time and bitcoin could either become the world reserve currency or the next AOL that made a lot of people wealthy until it was unseated by better technology.”
“Way before 2071, the dollar will have more in common with a crypto than with silver or gold, so there is no need to doubt the longevity of encrypted algorithms as stores of value and media of exchange. All money is a form of encryption. It’s been that way from the start, and as our lives converge ever more closely with the digital universe, the drive to invest in tokens will only accelerate. Ironically, that impulse will connect us to primitive instincts, and do its part to keep us human.”
“Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have proven themselves useful for money movement and speculation, and they’re unlikely to go away. But where and how we’ll generate the energy to meet the demand of a growing crypto market is worth considering, as well as whether state-actors who view it as a competitor to fiat power will make it even more of a black-market commodity.”
 Dragan Boscovic, founder and director of the Blockchain Research Lab at Arizona State University

Question: Won't the eltoo proposal allow someone to transfer ownership of bitcoin at an address without a chain transaction?

If it's possible to fashion a new signature that satisfies a transaction requirement even after an eltoo transaction is in the UTXO, and also makes previous signatures obsolete, won't it be possible to create a signature that authorizations a subsequent signature and transfer ownership?  Thus transferring ownership of the UTXO without anyone being aware?

oe3eh7,GroundbreakingOwl933,Who is better to use Bixin Wallet and Coinbase Wallet?,"What does a digital currency wallet mean?  
A digital currency wallet is a tool used to help you store, manage, and trade digital currency. Using the digital currency receipt address generated in the wallet, you can accept digital currency transfers from others to you, and you can transfer the digital currency you own to others. It is important to note that when you choose a wallet, you must choose a reliable and regular one, otherwise your assets may be damaged.

Who is better to use compared to Coinsign wallet and Coinbase wallet?  
Coinsign and Coinbase wallets are both digital currency wallets that have developed well in recent years, and it can be said that they have their own characteristics, so you can’t directly say which one is better to use. Next, I’ll introduce them respectively.

一、 BiXin wallet

1, theBixin wallet is relatively simple to use and medium security. It was founded in 2014, formerly known as HaoBTC wallet, in February 2017 the brand was fully upgraded to Bixin, and now belongs to Hong Kong Bixin Network Technology Co. Now the team brings together the earliest domestic bitcoin investors, bitcoin early evangelists, bitcoin underlying code contributors and so on, a team of bitcoin believers.

2. As the first bitcoin mobile social platform in China, Bixin App is people-centered, socialized to achieve information communication and value transfer, easy to play bitcoin, free and orderly. The real and rich community and the minimalist and extreme tools make Bixin a new way of life for more people.

二、Coinbase wallet

1. Coinbase wallet is derived from Toshi wallet, which is redefining what users expect from a crypto wallet, and the security is still very good. This is not just a tool to access cryptocurrencies, you can see it as a foothold to explore the decentralized network.

2. With it you can manage ETH and all ECR-20 currencies, receive airdrops and ICO currencies, buy and store cryptocurrencies, trade cryptocurrencies with anyone anywhere without fees, buy and sell currencies through mass decentralized exchanges or proxy parties, and buy and sell cryptocurrencies with no fees.",1625476028,1,1

So if you still need to write your pass phrase down on a piece of paper or in an USB key, why even have the hardware wallet? The hardware wallet isn't going to make those backup methods any safer and isn't that just one more thing that can be compromised?",1625475722,71,1

... how many coins could be mined in a day on a standard home PC?

I saw a guy being interviewed on a news channel the other day about Bitcoin.  Assuming he's telling the truth, he said he stumbled across Bitcoin in the very early days when it could easily be mined with a basic computer.  He said he was easily mining up to 50 coins a day but, given these were very early days for crypto, he didn't really know what he was mining (as in what they could be used for, potential value etc) so he placed no importance on it whatsoever.  So much so, he didn't retain the keys for many of his earlier coins Sad

He said he got back into it a few years back and is now a lot more careful about the crypto he has.  The guy could very likely have been a multi-millionaire by now.  Not sure if he's mining these days (doubt it) or buying/trading.

I find it surreal in a way that you can be sitting today deciding 'do I buy 1 coin for $50k?' whilst only a decade ago you could have been mining dozens of them, essentially for free, on your home PC!  Yeah I know that's all with the benefit of hindsight, however it makes me smile nevertheless.

What we were dreaming is now the reality.

We used to dream about prices above $20k, but now look at the price, it's way more above $30k, of course, we have had our ups and downs, our peace and war, agreements and disagreements, but now we stand victor, years of disbelief, understatement, hate speeches, haters, etc.

Holders of yesterday now are the winners, this is the fruit of their patience now, do not stop believing in Bitcoin, fight as you have fought before, go on and keep going, if you feel it's time to get out, then cash out and go home, if you still believe in the system, then keep holding and wait for the big turn ahead, because the ride has just started, and there is a long road ahead of us.

I would like to congratulate everyone who believed and stood by Bitcoin, hope to see more and big changes for us all in the years to come.

oe0opv,1entreprenewer,Idea for an app to expand bitcoin commerce and get us all some more Sats. Someone wanna build it?,"The other night I was lying awake thinking about an app that should exist in the world. 

Most likely, we would all like to be paid in bitcoin for the every day things. Selling something on craigslist, splitting dinner with a friend… stuff we would normally use cash or Venmo for. 

However, 90% of people still don’t use or hold Bitcoin, and those who do aren’t eager to part with it. 

So what if, instead, we built an app which *connects* to Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, or whatever (in my country there’s a few of these offered by the banks). They may not have an API, but we could build it so that the person pays OUR account with a unique identifier in the comments (generated by an iPhone app at the point of sale), and then we automatically buy Bitcoin on an exchange for that person and transaction. 

To avoid fraud, we could “hold” the Bitcoin for however long is needed, showing the expiry date of the hold right in the app. I don’t know what the chargeback period is for Zelle or Venmo, but I think as long as you record in the app the person’s balance and when it will be unlocked, it would be fine. 

THEN, at the end of the hold period, we offer the option to move to your own wallet (I’m hardcore on self custody so I probably wouldn’t even make a full fledged wallet but rather encourage people to self custody). 

For this service and the risks incurred we could charge 5%.

I think it’s an interesting idea and a way to get more commerce happening on Bitcoin. 

I don’t know about you, but I don’t want shitty fiat when friends pay me back, and I know my kids nanny would love to accept Bitcoin if I were willing to use it - but for tax implications I prefer to pay her in fiat.

Hope I'm in the right board here but I guess the mining board is more about hardware. 

As we know the more miners the more difficult it gets to mine. So when there are for example 1Million pc's mining it doesn't matter if they are all in one basement or spread each across the world (Technical not fairness or whatsoever related). So the reason why bitcoin mining got so competitive and non usable with a normal desktop pc was because it got harder to mine. So how then does the vision of satoshi, that everyone validates and mines with his pc makes scene,  when its doomed to end in a few big mining farms? (In expectation of getting really popular) . Because due to the high difficulty nobody could mine on a pc, even if everyone would mine on a single desktop pc.

Currently picking between two courses. One is called Computer Networks and the other is Distributed Software Development. Here are the descriptions of the courses, respectively:

Network architecture and protocols, principles of network applications, socket programming, flow and congestion control, switching and routing, link-layer technologies, traffic capture and analysis, security.

Distributed system architectures and design, service-oriented computing, and frameworks for development of distributed applications and software components.


Which do you think would be more applicable to someone who wants to do blockchain/defi engineering? I'm learning towards networks, but distributed computing is a pretty powerful field as well.

It makes HODLers of every person who buys it because it shakes people out, who then regret every day the sale they completed when it was so damn cheap.

ofhlel,Olga_Ukolova,Smart contracts ELI5 + RGB POV,"In order to understand the concept of a smart contract one has to make a shift in their mindset - from thinking about Computer Science, blockchain, transactions to remembering how physical world works, about people interacting and proving something to each other. Imagine that there are no computers, they don't exist. After you design the interaction between humans and the way they can prove something in trustless or anonymous environments, the matter of digitalizing it by designing protocols that can fit it into computer and internet world becomes simply a question of application. You have to do first things first, meaning to design the game theory between humans and only then put time into contemplating computer science possibilities to make it work in digital form. This is also the best approach while trying to understand [RGB](https://www.rgbfaq.com).  


So, what is a smart contract in this perspective? **Smart contract** *is the way to enforce the fulfillment of a certain agreement between humans without an external centralized agency (military, government, court etc).* Say, you don't have a physical contract and the parties of the agreement are anonymous, meaning you can't use physical force to make them follow the agreement. If in these conditions there are economical incentives to make the fulfillment of the agreement happen without applying any physical enforcement - this is what a smart contract is. As you can see, it has nothing to do with Computer Science per se. Computer Science can help to solve cryptographic part of the situation, can make it more efficient working over Internet and not requiring physical presence, but it can't solve the game theory problems. For that you need to use economics first. And if you analyse the smart contracts from that perspective, you will understand that you have to distinguish many things, for example ownership rights (ownership of different assets defined under that conctract) from the contract states (under which conditions the contract exists currently, as each contract between humans defines certain, let's call them, state machines). Thus we can say that the contract defines an event-consequence algorithm 'if this happens then that happens'. And of course, each of these algorithms also needs to follow certain verification rules.    


If you think about [client-side validation](https://www.rgbfaq.com/glossary/client-side-validation) in this regard, it is easy to create parallels and understand that in the described scenario you need to run client-side validation with single-use seals (without any blockchain). Let's imagine someone gave you $10 for you doing something or paid you for coffee. When you got this bank note of $10, you perform a client-side validation: you look at the bank note, you touch it with your hands, you check the watermarks (which are single-use seals), and you either accept it or you don't. That's the client side validation happening without any computer being involved. Also, in this situation you don't need to have all the information about every single other note that ever existed (no need to store the global state). And the only thing RGB adds in this regard is it simply puts this paradigm of client-side validation into a digital world, utilizing cryptography such that you could do the same, but in anonymous way. This and similar use cases can be seen in many other situations beyond finance. And that's why we say that RGB covers smart contracts use cases and different enforcement rules under them, while still having the game theory designed outside of its scope.",1625659718,18,1

(Armed Forces Brewing Company)
SHARE
Robert O’Neill, the former Navy SEAL who is widely credited with firing the shots that killed Osama Bin Laden, has a new mission: To get you to invest in a beer company. Specifically, this one.

On Thursday, a commercial for Armed Forces Brewing Company began making the rounds on social media after the company uploaded the full promotional video to YouTube featuring the SEAL Team Six veteran as he shoots bad guys off-screen, mocks beer snobs, and makes a last-minute reference to that time he got into a Twitter fight with an airline for refusing to wear a mask.
“This beer is for everybody to drink, it’s not some pretentious asshole beer for some slackster or coffee-house misanthrope,” O’Neill says in the clip as he pulls a Spock and knocks out a guy wearing flannel because he likes hoppy beers. The advertisement itself is pretty standard fare these days, and it’s similar to the videos from veteran coffee and apparel companies that are already out there, and have been for a while, which is to say that it plays like a military-grade and mega-moto version of Dollar Shave Club’s 2012 viral hit. The video also includes a CGI flyover from a trio of aircraft — that look a lot like Russian MiG-29s — and the same woman appears to have been cloned several times over in different service-specific outfits.

The company’s investment page pledges to have at least 70% of its workforce be military veterans. The website lists O’Neill as its brand ambassador and notes that he also serves on the company’s board of directors. The company’s onsite roster lists a number of other military veterans, from fellow Navy SEALs to former Army Special Forces.
“I’m proud to work with some great Americans making great American beer,” O’Neill said in a July 6 statement. “Our beers pay tribute to the men and women of the greatest military in the world, and I am thrilled that anyone and everyone can own part of this patriotic company at this early stage alongside me.”
According to their recent statement, Armed Forces Brewing Company was launched in 2019 and aims to raise $7.5 million in order to acquire a brewing facility “to maximize production so the company can reach as many Americans as possible.” Investments in Armed Forces Brewing Company begin at $200, at $10 a share and come in different tiers with their own perks.
You can “enlist” by investing $200 to $499, at which point you’ll get a sticker, a challenge coin, an invitation to an annual event, a 5% discount at their online store and a few other benefits. From there the investments jump up quite a bit, as do the titles. There’s “Bootcamp” which comes in between $500-$999 and “Brigade” at $1,000-$4,999, and then it just keeps climbing. You can read a more detailed breakdown of the perks, here.
Now, I have to circle back because at first when I saw the “enlist” option I was irritated, because it felt like one blatant attempt at over-the-top military branding too many. However, upon closer review, I realize it’s spot on. I mean, think about it. That’s not unlike enlisting: You get a challenge coin (because of course you do), an invitation to an annual event (like the birthday ball), a discount at a very specific set of retailers (the PX), and you might not get exactly what you expected out of it. So, hats off to Armed Forces Brewing for that one. I mean, I won’t be shelling out that much cash for a sticker and a few minor benefits, but I’m sure someone might.[Armed force Brewing Company ](de863755@gmail.com)",1626006381,0,1

oi0hm1,Zeeblackbaron,A simple heuristic for when its the best time to buy Bitcoin: the 80% devaluation rule,"After analyzing the entirety of Bitcoin's price history, I came up with a simple heuristic for when it's the best time to buy Bitcoin. Note that this heuristic is not 100% accurate nor will it ever be nor is it guaranteed to work forever, but for now it gives a good idea on when you'll want to throw some money into Bitcoin and I have strong confidence that it will work for the next few price cycles given the investing/speculating behavior we've seen over the past few price cycles. This heuristic is what I call the **80% devaluation rule** and it goes like this: the best time to buy (and hoard) Bitcoin is when it has devalued at least roughly 80% from its most recent all-time high via a on-going crash; i.e. the current price of Bitcoin is roughly 20% of its most recent ATH.

I came up with this rule after analyzing the price history on [this graph](https://bitcoin.zorinaq.com/price/). Most other graphs of Bitcoin's price history only show data from 2013 onwards, but this one goes all the way back to the genesis block.

Here is a list of previous devaluations occurring after ATHs that help prove the rule:

**Mid 2011 ATH:** $29.60

**Late 2011 trough:** $2.75 (roughly 10% of $29.60)

**Early 2013 ATH:** $230.00

**Mid 2013 trough:** $66.33 (roughly 20% of $230.00)

**Late 2013 ATH:** about $1k

**Late 2014 trough:** about $250 (roughly 20% of $1k)

**Late 2017 ATH:** about $19k

**Early 2019 trough:** about $3.6k (roughly 20% of $19k)

**Early 2021 ATH:** about $60k

**Late 2022 expected trough:** about $13k-15k (roughly 20% of $60k)

&amp;#x200B;

The first cycle analyzed deviates with a 10% devaluation as Bitcoin was a lot more volatile back in the early 2010s when it was still new-ish.

**NOTE:** we may see a price rebound to a new ATH later this year as there is speculation that we could see a repeat of the 2013 cycle. However, due to Bitcoin's slowing price growth over time, this is not guaranteed!",1625990793,12,1

&amp;#x200B;

There is a lot of myth around BTC and most of them have been already proven wrong, are just nonsense and some might be true, cause there is no counterargument so far.

I'm a strong believer in bitcoin and all it stands for, don't get me wrong.

BUT, the thing I can't wrap my mind around is, wouldn't BTC create even a much greater inequality if it would become the world currency?

Did some research and as of now, it seems that around 1,000 people are holding 40% BTC. Let's assume, that the other 60% are held by 2% of the world's population. I know, it's probably less, but still...

How could you force the whales to share their wealth with the rest of the world, so everyone would even possess some of it for their daily lives and everything else?

If you're disgruntled getting up in the morning going to work just remember that every dollar you earn and put into Bitcoin you're going to get at least ten back in a few years.  


My greatest takeaway from being in this space for the last few years is: Every extra sat you stack this year could very well allow you to retire by 2030.

Yes most of this might be insured, especially the big corporations being emptied, but if I was invested in this economy in any way, I could care less about anything being insured when the masses will come back and empty the store room of every shop in major malls.

oj6rfh,Formores,Bitcoin Transaction Fees Dropped Due to These Main Reasons,"In recent months, not only the price of Bitcoin has fallen, but the current cost of using the network , the transaction fees, is also falling.

On July 10, the average bitcoin transaction fee fell to $3.92. About three months ago, on April 21, the bitcoin transaction fee hit a historical record of $62.78. According to data from BitInfoCharts, the last Bitcoin transaction fee as low as it is now occurred on December 23, 2020, when the average Bitcoin transaction fee was $3.61.

Bitcoin has experienced a moody year. The average transaction fee in April this year was the highest in history. It is indeed very abnormal. It is important to know that the only time Bitcoin approached the record high fee at the time was on December 23, 2018, when the average transaction fee was $52.18. Things is that the price of Bitcoin hit a record high [of $64,300 on April 14](https://st.didimessage.com/jraV), but the average transaction fee on that day was $29. But only a week later, the price of Bitcoin dropped to around $55,000. At this time, the transaction fee hit a historical record of $62.79. As a result, more than 130,000 transactions were unprocessed on the network.

High fees often have a certain correlation with the high activity frequency of the blockchain network-when everyone scrambles to make bitcoin transactions, the network fees will rise because they exceed the supply of miners. When investors are eager to exit the market, transaction costs will increase even more.

At this stage, Bitcoin seems to be less dramatic. According to data from Coingecko at the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is[$33,588.54, a decrease of 0.7%](https://st.didimessage.com/jraV)in 24 hours. Although there is still a long way to go compared with the historical high in mid-April, it has risen slightly from the previous few days.

In mid-May, when the three China Internet Finance Association, China Banking Association, and China Payment and Clearing Association jointly issued an announcement requiring a correct understanding of the essential attributes of virtual currency and related business activities, relevant institutions must not conduct business related to virtual currency: Financial institutions, payment institutions and other member units must effectively strengthen their social responsibilities. They must not use virtual currencies to price products and services, and must not underwrite insurance businesses related to virtual currencies or include virtual currencies in the scope of insurance liability, and must not directly or indirectly provide customers with other services. Services related to virtual currency, including but not limited to: providing customers with virtual currency registration, trading, clearing, settlement and other services; accepting virtual currency or using virtual currency as a payment and settlement tool; developing virtual currency exchange services with RMB and foreign currencies; Develop virtual currency storage, custody, mortgage, etc.; issue financial products related to virtual currency; use virtual currency as investment targets for trusts, funds, etc.

Immediately afterwards, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia also began to suspend bitcoin mining operations, and bitcoin computing power also plummeted. According to the Bitcoin Power Consumption Index of Cambridge University, since Sichuan stopped mining, global Bitcoin energy consumption has been reduced by more than half. Before the real ""crack"" of bitcoin mining in China, the global bitcoin mining energy consumption was as high as 130 TWh. If ranked according to the national energy consumption ranking, bitcoin energy consumption is among the world's leading. But since May, the situation has changed dramatically. Specifically, the energy consumption of the Bitcoin network has fallen by 51% since May 10: from an all-time high of 141 TWh to 68 TWh. The carbon footprint of the Bitcoin network previously exceeded 60 billion pounds of coal burned, which is equivalent to the annual average electricity consumption of 9 million households. But now, as the energy consumption of the Bitcoin network has dropped by more than 50%, the direct impact on the environment will also be reduced.

According to data from BitInfoCharts, Bitcoin's entire network computing power was about 97.53 Ehash/s on July 10, the lowest point since May 24, 2020.

There is no doubt that the regulatory effect is immediate. Bitcoin seems to have entered a state of ""inertness"".",1626145146,0,1

It was a small sum that I forgot about, but when I saw how it grew, as well as many headlines about bitcoin in the news around April of 2021, I have gotten a job and have been investing more and more. I have watched many educational videos and have gotten myself a cold storage wallet to keep my coins safe. This subreddit has also been very educational, inspiring, and supportive in my Bitcoin journey. Now I have accumulated 0.03 bitcoin which is worth a significant amount of fiat (shitcoin) to me.

I used this for a few weeks with a higher end iMac around 2012 or so to mine through this browser based website. I finally just figured out the site again thanks to the article linked [here](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/browser-mining-cryptocurrency) 
I don’t really know honestly what year it was I just remember Bitcoin was like 50 cents or something crazy. And I was like well damn this will take a long time to even get 10 dollars worth. 
I definitely had an account with them so I imagine the wallet would be linked there. 

I’m having no luck with the email, it was a yahoo @aim.com account which from what I read yahoo deletes after so long of inactivity.
The site now linkes to the Coinomi wallet app so I guess that’s what they’ve changed to after all this time. 

TLDR: have a account with bitcoinplus.com’s old browser based mining, they are now coinomi. I used yahoos @aim.com email for the account, but yahoo seems to delete these old accounts.

However, just because cryptocurrencies are one way of storing and moving value it doesnt mean crypto is BAD! criminals will ALWAYS find ways to commit crime and crypto is just another option. 

Dont BLAME crypto for making this way of life easier!

Criminals will always be criminals but at least with BLOCKCHAIN tech we are able to keep our eyes opened for any misuse.

Crypto is the future and will be here to stay; this is just the beginning.

Back in 1994, Amazon started in a garage and with the help of investors developed a great website which back in the day the Internet was just consolidating and what kind of foundation did websites have back then? There were lots of scamming websites, practically every email inbox was filled with spam.

Fast forward 27 years and most people are aware of the problems mentioned above BUT the internet got regulated; we can easily confirm if a website is a scam or not just by googling it.

Of course there are coins that are for pump only but most companies that have their own coin have a goal in mind with its own environment to run.

Imagine going to a DMV without physically carrying any form of ID and being able to get an ID replacement by just logging in through a blockchain that has all your info saved... They would scan your fingerprint/eyeball/signature to confirm your true identity...

Carrying wallets, money, documents etc in public is not safe in many places of the world and very few places you are able to do so. 

In other words, crypto is here to revolutionize the world.

Blockchain tech just needs regulation, education of its use and adoption.

Slowly and more importantly the environment will strive if we dedicate 100% renewable energy to the crypto industry.",1626195192,4,1

As far as I understand, it is believed that BTC can (will/should) become a primary transaction medium like fiat money. But there are few things that bother me:

1) Volatility. It is impossible to plan you investments with such crazy volatility and unpredictability of BTC value. How can we avoid it?

2) No easy way to balance the amount of circulating BTC. It is inevitable that some BTC will always be lost due to human and technical errors, but the complexity of mining always goes up (or do I get it wrong?). It means that there will liquidity shortages and no way to smooth it or is there?

3) Very slow transaction speed. Ok, the speed is much better than bank wire transfer, but if I want to buy a cup of coffee, I want an instant transaction. Is it possible to achieve with BTC?

4) Energy waste. BTC mining looks like an incredibly wasteful business. You literally waste energy and equipment. Is there a way to transform mining into something useful?",1626194183,15,1

ojhosf,aLebanese,3 Reasons Why a U.S. Bitcoin ETF Will Be Approved Soon And Be The Next Major Catalyst,"**1. Regulation Could Clear Way for Bitcoin ETF**: Senator Warren's request that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler develop a regulatory framework for crypto exchanges could be a blessing in disguise for the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC may be delaying approval due to U.S. government concerns about crypto. Warren asked Gensler to respond by the end of July, which could finally get the ball rolling on crypto regulation. The SEC likely can't approve a Bitcoin ETF until government officials are satisfied with crypto regulation, and the push from Warren could speed up the process.

**2.** **An ETF Fixes Deviations From NAV**: Bitcoin ETFs already exist around the world, and all of them use crypto exchanges without problems. However, U.S. fund investors can only get Bitcoin exposure indirectly through Grayscale's GBTC, a private trust. It has a limited number of shares outstanding so can't be arbitraged, causing the price to deviate from its underlying NAV. This wouldn't happen in an ETF because shares can be created and destroyed. Bitcoin is volatile so an ETF structure would likely track it well.

**3.** **Fourteen Filings Await SEC Approval**: The longer the SEC delays, the more ETF filings it will face. There are already 13 from issuers. Almost all have filed for an ETF that would store Bitcoin physically, like GLD and gold. Grayscale also filed to convert GBTC into an ETF, which brings the total to 14. More issuers are likely to file soon to help meet the estimated $20-$40 billion in pent-up demand that may flow into Bitcoin ETFs in their first 3-6 months. Bitcoin ETF assets could eventually top $100 billion. (*Source: Bloomberg Intelligence)*",1626189327,1,1

oobjqa,catsx3,Update to the situation in which I sent $5000 in btc to the wrong address. I got the money back! (Original story linked inside),"This is a follow up to 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/oda6uf/accidentally_sent_btc_to_an_input_address_from_a

This all began on July 3rd.

After I noticed the wallet I sent it to was an output address used by Kraken I immediately emailed them asking for help and what my options were. 

Over the course of the next week I sent many emails back and forth explaining the situation and how I meant to send it to a Coinbase wallet but accidentally long-pressed on an output address used in the transaction from Kraken to my Electrum wallet.

Finally they send me an email saying they've identified the owner of the account and would be emailing them to ask if they would allow their email to be shared with me so we could actually speak and resolve the situation.

The guy ended up being from Brazil and when he received the money he moved it to an online Casino where he proceeded to lose $2000 before seeing the email from Kraken.

After seeing the email from Kraken, he actually emailed me! It took a lot of convincing that this wasn't some sort of elaborate scam and I explained that the $2k ""lost"" wouldnt be a problem if he returned the rest of the money.

He wanted me to sign some sort of contract stating what happened, we both signed it and this morning I woke up to .10 in my Electrum wallet.

Holy. Fucking. Shit.

I just want to send a huge shout-out to Kraken for helping me navigate this ridiculous situation I put myself in.

I want to send an even bigger shout-out to the man that received the coin and was willing to send what was remaining back.

I don't even care about the $2k and I'm honestly hoping he just made that story about the casino up so he could keep the $2k because he deserves it and I know $2k goes a long fuckin way in Brazil so I honestly feel like really good about it. How could I not?

I've never heard a story like this in the btc world. Ive been trading since 2013 and never made the mistake of sending money to the wrong address and the stories I've heard of people who have, I've never heard of a story of that btc being recovered in such a fashion.

I am beside myself with joy. It looks like I'll be able to buy the car I want after all.

I've always said I'm simultaneously the luckiest/unluckiest person I know and this is solid fuckin evidence right here.

THANK YOU KRAKEN!

THANK YOU UNNAMED BRAZILIAN GUY!

I quite literally thought I lost that money for good and this whole ordeal has been such a whirlwind. I'm so glad it's been resolved but it wouldn't have been if I didn't study the Blockchain and followed the money, and even then 99.9% you won't get your money back but I actually fuckin did. 

I'm agnostic and this nearly made me believe in God lol

This community is amazing and it was thanks to your help in my initial post, here I am, issue resolved ,15 days later, but resolved.

Was anyone crying market manipulation when the price shot up to 60k+? Nope. 

Frankly, I've yet to see a clear definition or even an example of true market manipulation, whatever that is.

The only example I've heard of is flooding the market with sell orders to spook the market, allowing you to buy in lower. If you're one of the weak hands who sells as a result of this, I can only hope the person on the other side of the trade has a longer time horizon and a better understanding of bitcoin's value proposition than you do. 

In short, I embrace and welcome more ""Market Manipulation."" It's getting rid of the weak hands, cleaning up this subreddit day by day, and allowing me to continue stacking at a reasonable price.

There is a small minority of folks here who understand and agree with the things I'm saying here, but to those complaining the loudest, we'll see you when you come back during the next ATH.

oo8d7m,swolleddy,A piece of advice,I’m relatively new to the crypto space and like many of you I didn’t get in at the best prices. Ever since the dip in may I have averaged down but I’m still red. Since that dip in may I have spent way too much time staring at red candlesticks all day. That absolutley destroyed my mental health seeing my investment getting rocked and looking at it all day like a gambler. It took me a while but then it hit me: I’m getting worked up over price moves by the hour by the day which are so meaningless in the long run. For example when bitcoin was trying to recover to 40k I was so sad to see it go back to 38k. Now I wish it went to 38k. When I became aware of this I realized how stupid staring at charts are especially if I’m not even trading. I also became aware of how meanglingless price changes are. I took time away from the charts to study and understand bitcoin better and my mental health improved dramatacilayy. I used to have guh movements when bitcoin would drop and now I’m kinda numb to it. I would advise you alll to understand the tech better take a break from the charts. And read up on al the great news for bitcoin.  It’s literally being adopted. Who cares about the price rn this shows how the tech is working. What else do you need to see the bullish picture. If price was all that made you bullish you shouldn’t be here.,1626806896,10,1

I have been seeing people “buying the dip” the whole time we have been stuck in between a range. It didn’t make much sense to me. The opportunity risk of buying mid 30’s was still too high. There was always a risk of falling into the 20’s. Even now I am setting my buy orders in the low 20’s all the way down to 13k. Patience will always play a huge role in your success in this crypto game. If you’re stuck in bad positions don’t worry bc BTC is known for surprises. Who knows exactly what the end of the year will bring! My advice is to have a strategy and clear entry and exit points. Set buy orders to avoid fomo’ing in and stick to your plan. Being ready for ANY situation is the best way to play the game. Good luck and happy stacking.,1626806243,12,1

&gt; Twelve years into its creation, Bitcoin is just beginning to gain institutional acceptance. To encourage adoption, education is key. In this track, we aim to correct mainstream narratives about Bitcoin, debunk the most common Bitcoin myths, and offer insights and real-world experiences on its various benefits.   

https://www.thebword.org/c/track-1-demystifying-bitcoin  

&gt; Bitcoin As A Tool For Economic Empowerment, featuring Cathie Wood, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk, Steve Lee will moderate this live panel discussion where nothing is off limits!   

https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment  

&gt; Thanks to millions of open-source developer hours, Bitcoin no longer is considered an obscure cryptographic toy. Instead, it has become an open-source financial network. In this track, our speakers explain why Bitcoin’s long-term success requires a sustainable funding model for open-source developers to maintain and extend the protocol.   

 https://www.thebword.org/c/track-3-Supporting-the-Developer-Ecosystem  

&gt; Bitcoin's security is predicated on the accuracy and robustness of the software and hardware running it, and the actions of those participating in the network. As the use of Bitcoin grows, the security of the network must grow and strengthen. In this track, our speakers detail why supporting Bitcoin requires understanding and proactively addressing its security risks:  

https://www.thebword.org/c/track-4-securing-the-bitcoin-network  

&gt; Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin is not an unregulated asset. As the next wave of participants adopt Bitcoin, it is imperative to continue to educate policymakers and advocate for sensible regulatory approaches to Bitcoin.

He didn't say who ""them"" is, but it doesn't matter. ""They"" are real for him and he doesn't want them to stand between him and me.  
I may be stupid, but after years of casually reading about btc, his statement made me finally understand what ""electronic peer-to-peer cash with limited supply"" really means. 

And why the idea is huge.

After I made this realisation, I will never go back to the ""store of value"" narrative. This is just for rich pricks and moonbois who want become rich pricks too. Store of value is just fancy gold and not a better world for everybody.

I will never be fanatic about any altcoin again. It takes a Satoshi Nakamoto and many many years of gaining trust for a project to get a chance of becoming the world currency.

Unfortunately... I also realised how far away we are from achiving Satoshi Nakamoto dream.  


We can't use Bitcoin directly, we have to rely on LN, which isn't perfect at all...   
Bitcoin is not anonymous as it could be...  
There are so many whales with malicious intentions...

This is not opinion. It is mathematical fact. There is really no way around it as long as we make two assumptions.
1.) There will be a maximum of 21,000,000 BTC ever. If there is less (which there is) this only proves my point further. 2.) The population of earth stays at 7,700,000,000 or increases. If the population were to decrease then my numbers would be off a little but it will still hold true.
With those assumptions, the fact is that if you own 0.25 BTC now or in the future... that you own more Bitcoin than 99% of the world.
This is not arguable. There are a maximum of 21,000,000 coins so let’s pretend they are all available. None are lost or in Satoshi’s wallets.
21,000,000 / 0.25 BTC = 84,000,000
That means there are 84,000,000 segments of 0.25 BTC available.
84,000,000 / 7,700,000,000 = 0.010901
So as long as you own 0.25 BTC you own more bitcoin than 99% of the world. You are in the top 1%!
And in reality, we know that only 18.5m have been released. And 1m is in Satoshi’s wallets and they say 3m has been lost. If that’s the case then lower the 21,000,000 to 14.5 million and you would only need own 0.20 BTC to have more than 99% of the world.
Again, there is no getting around this. It is fact. It doesn’t matter if 1 person had the other 20,999,999.75 bitcoins. Your 0.25 BTC means you own more than 99% of the world. You would not necessarily be in the top 1% of bitcoin holders. You simply own more than 99% of the world. It is impossible for you to fall out of that number if you have a quarter bitcoin.
0.25 and HODL

If you have 0.25 BTC at the moment, you have the equivalent  of  8000$ in a savings account.
The average American has about $4,500 in savings.
By 2026, BTC will likely be over $100,000, putting that 0.25 BTC at $25,000.
So, long before all the Bitcoins are mined (around 2140), that small amount of BTC (0.25) will exceed most American savings by factors of 10 or 100.
By 2031 (about 10 years away), you'll likely have a comfortable nest egg for retirement ($250,000), assuming you own your own home, have a good 401k retirement plan and medical coverage.
If you have 0.25 BTC, you're a very lucky person. But don't let it go to your head. Live modestly, eat healthy and keep fit.
No one enjoys regular visits to the hospital, even if the doctor is a nubile blonde who does amazing things with her glove.

According to markets research. “ The cryptocurrency market, this market was valued at USD 541.0 Million in 2017 and is expected to reach USD 2,902.0 Million by 2023, at a CAGR of 32.31% between 2017 and 2023. The cryptocurrency market is witnessing significant growth because of the benefits of compliance-free peer-to-peer transaction, cross-border remittance transfer, and increase in use cases, as well as some macro drivers such as volatility in the stock market and fluctuating monetary regulations in different countries. The growth of the cryptocurrency market is further propelled by the transparency and immutability of the distributed ledger technology and benefits such as faster transaction and reduction in total ownership cost.”
This clearly indicates that the various benefits of cryptocurrencies coupled with the fact that it acts as insurance against national economic failure has helped it find many takers. It would not be far-fetched to see cryptos fast becoming the currency of choice in 2030 as it epitomizes personal freedom.

# What Is Bitcoin? 

Bitcoin is high-level money made in January 2009. It follows the considerations set out in a whitepaper by the bewildering and pseudonymous [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://cult.today/a-week-in-which-we-are-all-satoshi/).  The identity of the individual or people who made the innovation is as yet a secret. Bitcoin offers the guarantee of lower exchange charges than conventional online installment instruments and, not at all like officially sanctioned monetary standards, it is worked by a decentralized position.

[Bitcoin](https://cult.today/category/max/bitcoin/) is a sort of cryptographic money. There is no physical bitcoin, just correspondence kept on a freely available report that everyone has direct permission to. All bitcoin trades are affirmed by a huge proportion of handling power. Bitcoin isn't given or supported by any banks or governments, nor is an individual bitcoin important as an item. In spite of its anything but being legitimate delicate in many pieces of the world, bitcoin is famous and has set off the dispatch of many other cryptographic forms of cash, overall implied as altcoins. Bitcoin is ordinarily contracted as ""BTC."" 

## KEY TAKEAWAYS 

· Dispatched in 2009, bitcoin is the world's greatest advanced cash market capitalization.

· In contrast to fiat cash, bitcoin is made, appropriated, exchanged, and put away with the utilization of a decentralized record framework, known as a blockchain. 

· Bitcoin's arrangement of encounters as a store of huge worth has been wild; it has gone through a couple of examples of win and fizzles over its modestly short future. 

· As the soonest virtual cash to meet far and wide notoriety and achievement, bitcoin has propelled a large group of other digital forms of money afterward. 

## Understanding Bitcoin

The bitcoin system is a grouping of PCs (similarly insinuated as ""center points"" or ""backhoes"") that all run bitcoin's code and store its blockchain. Symbolically, a blockchain can be considered as an arrangement of squares. In each square is a collection of trades. Since all of the PCs running the blockchain have comparative once-over of squares and trades, and can clearly see these new squares being stacked up with new bitcoin trades, it's not possible for anyone to cheat the system.

Anyone—whether or not they run a bitcoin ""center"" or not—can see these trades happening persistently. To accomplish an evil demonstration, an agitator would have to work 51% of the processing power that makes up bitcoin. Bitcoin has around 10,000 center points, as of June 2021, and this number is creating, making such an attack improbable.

Yet, on the off chance that an assault was to occur, bitcoin excavators—individuals who partake in the bitcoin network with their PCs—would probably fork to another [blockchain](https://cult.today/category/max/blocks-and-chains/), putting forth the attempt the provocateur set off to accomplish the assault a waste.

Harmonies of bitcoin tokens are continued using public and covered up ""keys,"" which are long series of numbers and letters associated through the mathematical encryption computation that was used to make them. The public key (basically indistinguishable from a record number) fills in as the area circulated to the world and to which others may send bitcoin.

The private key (like an ATM PIN) is planned to be an ensured secret and basically used to endorse bitcoin transmissions. Bitcoin keys should not be confused with a bitcoin wallet, which is a physical or progressed contraption that works with the trading of bitcoin and licenses customers to follow duty regarding. The articulation ""wallet"" is fairly tricky, as bitcoin's decentralized nature suggests it is once in a while taken care of ""in"" a wallet, however rather decentrally on a [blockchain](https://cult.today/do-you-really-know-how-blockchain-works/).",1626857408,1,1

**Summary**: There is a scammer impersonating Mr. Leon Li (Huobi CEO) to ask me to invest 1 BTC in order to receive 6 BTC per week. This scammer's Facebook is in the top of Google search because the Huobi CEO does not publicize his personal Facebook. The scammer also video called me and play a muted video of Leon Li for a few seconds and said there is a problem with the connection to make me into believing him. And here is the story of how I ""tricked"" this scammer lol

I have long been annoyed with scammers because every now and then I get scam/spam calls. I used the Page Editor extension on Chrome to create some screenshots to convince the scammer that I transferred 1 BTC to him but was blocked by Binance because of the high risk. To verify, the scammer needs to transfer 0.001 BTC ($31) back to that wallet. So he really did it haha

ool0h5,CyberPunkMetalHead,"I wrote an algorithm to buy cryptocurrency based on what coins Reddit talks about positively and I've been running it for 3 weeks, here are the results","Reddit feels positively about Bitcoin? Let’s buy some. Reddit likes ALGO today – great let’s get some of that as well. 

I built an algorithm to do just that, you can see a detailed guide on how to set up your own reddit sentiment crypto trading bot [here](https://www.cryptomaton.org/2021/07/10/coding-a-crypto-trading-algorithm-that-analyses-reddit-sentiment/) and I have been testing it for about three weeks now.

Today it’s time to look at the overall performance, as well as how the bot logic has worked in general.

During this testing period the bot has accumulated 20 out of the top 40 coins by Marketcap: BTC, ETH, ALGO, XLM, ADA, SOL, LINK, DOGE, MATIC, XTZ, LTC, VET, DAI, CAKE, DOT, EOS, AAVE, XMR, MKR, ATOM.

The parameters I gave my crypto trading bot is to only look for keywords from the top 40 coins by marketcap, in order to stop it from buying into scams or other suspicious projects. Within 3 weeks the bot has invested in half of the top 40 coins.

Looking at some of the coins that weren’t picked up by our bot tends to reveal an interesting conclusion: USDT, BUSD, BNB, USDC, UNI, Crypto.com, SHIBA. Although these are in top 40, Reddit didn’t bother talking about them, or not positively at any rate.

What these coins have in common is that most of them are transactional tokens, stablecoins, or downright useless coins (looking at you SHIBA). As a Redditor myself, I’m quite proud of the result generated by the hivemind, yes DOGE is there but it doesn’t matter. Most coins picked by the trading bot with help of the Reddit sentiment are coins that I would invest into myself. 

For now the return on our investment doesn’t look so great. But then again, no accumulation strategy will perform well in a downtrend so this is not representative of the overall result. The outcome is relatively predictable, if the market is up, we’re up as we’re buying the actual asset and not using CFDs or futures trading.

Overall I’m on 15% loss, but as the entire market is down, this is not indicative of the performance. The data that does get me excited is the quality of the coins bought, which means that if nothing else, this could be an automated buy and hold diversification strategy.

See how you can set this up yourself to use in test mode or live mode (at your own risk).

It was an amazing day yesterday. I first told my dad (an older boomer) about crypto curriencies in 2016. He thought they were full of shit, only used to buy dr\*gs on the internet, and for other illicit ventures. He wanted nothing to do with them.

Fast forward to 2021 and my dad is taking pain relief meds that you can't get in the US. Not that I condone any of it - but they make him feel better and he's tried just about every other option and is tired of seeing new doctors every week.

Yesterday, since his friend that he usually buys from is out of town, my dad managed to find what he was looking for online - but the only accepted payment was with BTC or LTC. So he calls me for help and within 5 minutes of sitting with him I've sent 12 LTC to a wallet, recieved a confirmation email on the purchase, and a shipping notification for when he can expect his order. (used LTC because no way was I giving up any of my BTC).

The look on his face was priceless and I've now set him up with a wallet of his own as well as taught him how to use the feautes, what different coins do, and how to check his transactions on the blockchain.

I'm working on an app that provides insights into different coins. Its aim is to alert users when certain coins are on the rise. We're currently in the BETA phase of our validation tests. I'm looking for some users I can showcase the app to and get their feedback.

Here's a snapshot of the apps functionality and result below:

[Crypto Insights - PoC Screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/ohdxmah7q5c71.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc396e156fd1eefcc7de8ef7c8f8ab9a037c1180)

Top Graph (G1) represents cryptocurrency HEX value in USD off coinbase.com Bottom Graph (G2) represents our systems predications regarding HEX performance. Both graphs are portrayed between the dates of 13/07/2021 - 18/07/2021 at day intervals.  Off G2 our system alerts us on the 13/07/2021 that HEX is on the rise. From G1 on the 13/07/2021 its value in USD is $0.086. By the 18/07/2021 HEX is valued at $0.173 equating to approximately 100% increase. At that point any investments made during G2 first alerts wouldve effectively doubled the users HEX investment. 

If you'd like to recieve these alerts, please send me an email and I'll place you on the mailing list.",1626695172,1,1
onceag,cascading_disruption,The good old days: I’m Kevin and I'm the guy who bought 259684 BTC for $2613 yesterday,""" I was watching, like many of you, a gigantic sell order burning through  the bids. Mt Gox doesn't execute trades very quickly, so we were  watching this huge order slowly eat up every buy order on the books. The  price started at around $17.50, and within minutes was below $10. At  this point, I realized this wasn't merely a large seller willing to  accept some losses. This was someone attempting to crash the market by  selling a huge percentage of the market's total bitcoins at once.

I  had around $3000 USD in my Mt Gox account, from earlier sales I'd made.  I looked at the market stats, and realized that there were tons of  orders to buy BTC at $0.01 that would likely eat up any remaining  bitcoins this seller had on the order. I figured if I put a buy order in  for $0.0101, my order would execute first and I could buy a huge amount  of bitcoins from this seller before it hit the bottom. The only problem  was that Mt Gox was running slower than molasses at the time, and  everyone was saying that it wasn't accepting trades. I had to try  several times, but eventually I got a buy order in, offering to buy as  many bitcoins as I could for $0.0101.

The site stopped responding  completely for a while, probably from so many people hitting refresh to  see what was going on. When I got back in, I saw in my account:

06/19/11 17:51  Bought BTC  259684.77 for 0.0101

I  had just purchased over 250,000 bitcoins for $2613. At the trading  price immediately before this large sell order happened, that number  would have been worth nearly $5 million. After I regained my breath, I  tried to figure out what to do. I wasn't sure what was really going on.  Over the past few days there had been a lot of talk and complaints about  Mt Gox's security. Lists of Mt Gox usernames, email addresses and  encrypted passwords were being traded around, which was an obvious sign  that security at Mt Gox had been breached in some way. If there was an  attacker in the system, perhaps he was able to log into my account now  and force my account to execute some other crazy trade. ""

oknvto,Big_Perception5395,Poolin Wallet Introduction," 

Wallets are divided into onchain wallets and offchain wallets.

Onchain wallet transactions can be checked on blockchain. The user keeps his own private key to support mnemonics, import private keys and other functions.

Offchain wallets are centralized wallets, generally provided by exchanges. The transaction is essentially an adjustment of the amount of the internal account of the exchange. The user does not need to keep private key, but only needs to remember the account of wallet. This mode is simple to operate, and can realize real-time payment.

Poolin Wallet is an offchain wallet with high efficiency. Poolin Wallet is a centralized digital asset management wallet that integrates storage, transaction, lending, asset management, and DeFi production by Mixin team with technical support. 

* One-stop service. Poolin mining pool and Poolin Wallet are connected, and Poolin mining pool account can be used directly to log in to Poolin Wallet, safe and convenient.
* No threshold limit. Mining in Poolin mining pool and using Poolin Wallet to receive money is not subject to threshold limit.
* Diversification of financial products bring you stable income, and it's safe and reliable.

Please contact us if you have further questions.

Saylor even went so far to say in [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1Gu7Ym-Quo&amp;lc=z23uyjcgyzqdxptdbacdp43bmhr2al5dqctrtce4bipw03c010c) a day or two back that Stablecoins, specifically, will fill that niche.  

Anyone who was around in the early days of bitcoin or has read cyphperpunk history can easily tell you what the government used to do to anyone or any company that tried to compete with the dollar. Stablecoins are run by centralized parties like companies and governments are never going to let them compete with their money when they can just tell the centralized party to stop. US congressmen went nuts a year or two back when Facebook announced Libra, and held a grand congressional inquiry just on the plans, stopping his original approach. They'll continue to stop future approaches too as long as he tries to make a coin that competes with the dollar in any way.

But even if you think there is some loophole, there's another, more important reason why bitcoin will in fact destroy any other coin, stable or not, that tries to be a medium of exchange.

In short, the best money that everyone desires is the hardest money. The hardest money is the one with the best store of value features. Gold proved this for millennia. Saylor fails to remember that gold was the most used medium of exchange for most of the last 5000 years! 

When your hard property takes on the  characteristics of a currency, (being portable, scarce, fungible, easily  identified, hard to counterfeit, durable, etc) then it's called ""Hard""  money. That's a good thing. It's the money that you hold onto more than  other money, but it's still the most desirable money.  

Goldbugs and Austrian economics have long sang the praises of hard money. Separating hard money from transactional money has only been done because of government decree. (Fiat) Transactional money on it's own simply cannot compete with hard money on an open marketplace. 

Stablecoins will never be able to compete with bitcoin because they aren't desirable to hold on to. People will never trust them to store value over time, so why hold them at all? Why BOTHER to hold two types of money when you trust one and not the other? It's an unneeded hassle.

I give this stablecoin fad another 4-8 years tops. After that, all you can depend on in this world is your bitcoin, and the lightning network will be more than capable by then to make it more useful as a transactional currency than any other money on earth. 

Now the question is: Is Saylor wrong on purpose to avoid some kind of government backlash against bitcoin?",1626327242,57,1

okkedz,bjustman,Boss said he'd pay me in Bitcoin. NEED ADVICE,"TLDR: Dad will pay me in Bitcoin if he doesn't have to worry about cap gains tax.

My dad agreed to pay me for my labor on the family farm in bitcoin. He is super hesitant about bitcoin, but respects my conviction in this as long as I do all the set up and he doesn't have to worry about anything.

The plan is to buy 3 months worth of wages at today's prices to then set my hourly wage in sats based off of that.

I live in the US and want to avoid him getting hit with capital gains taxes on this if the price goes up. Is there a way to do this?

okk4gb,Ryanliubt-miners,BTC mining will still be less difficult but analysts say the bull market has not yet reached its peak,"July 14, Hefei online published an article ""I comprehensively clean up and shut down the virtual currency mining project"" pointed out that in the next three years, the province's electricity supply and demand situation is grim, Anhui will fully clean up and shut down the virtual currency mining project.  Prior to this, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Yunnan and Sichuan have also issued relevant policies to promote the liquidation of crypto-mining projects.  As the policy came out, the Bitcoin hashing rate dropped.  

However, the latest data showed an average bitcoin processing power of 96.6 eH /s, slightly higher than the previous 90.5 eH /s.  At the next reset, the difficulty of mining could be reduced by 11.08%, the data estimated, a slight downward trend from the last drop of more than 20%.  

Analysts say that as the gradual completion of the evictions and a steady migration of remaining miners have leveled off the Bitcoin network, computing power has leveled off and the difficulty has eased.  

In addition, half of the world's computing power will eventually leave China and need new ""homes,"" said Castleisland Ventures founding partner NicCarter. ""Chinese miners or those registered in China are looking to Central Asia, Eastern Europe, the United States and Northern Europe.""  

According to public data, the first batch of virtual currency mining machines arrived in Kazakhstan on June 21. 320 mining machines are estimated to be 18.2PH/S, and are expected to be deployed and put into operation on June 27. Other mining machines are also being shipped overseas in batches.  A handful of virtual currency mines are already in Kazakhstan, Texas, Canada, Europe and elsewhere.  

To date, Iranian authorities have authorized 30 cryptocurrency mines to conduct digital currency mining.  The cryptocurrency mines are spread across several regions, including one in Tehran province, which is home to the national capital.  Semnan province is reported to have the most licensed mines with six, followed by Alborz province with four, Mazandaran, Eastern Azerbaijan and Zanjan.  

U. S. utility Talen Energy is building a nuclear crypto mine and data center near its Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, with a capacity of 164 megawatts in the first phase and 300 megawatts when completed.  Talen Energy founded Cumulus Data in 2020 to ""invest in opportunities to merge digital infrastructure with power.""  Cumulus has two separate businesses, Cumulus Data, which focuses on ultra-large-scale computing centers, and Cumulus Coin, which focuses on digital currency mining.  

In addition, US-based cryptocurrency consultancy and mining company Wattum has signed an agreement to acquire a crypto mine operated by Energix in Kazakhstan.  The two companies will build a mining facility to provide 16 megawatts of energy for mining machines and have committed to invest $2 million in the joint venture.  Wattum and Energix are also negotiating for another 50-megawatt mine at a cost of $8 million  

It is worth noting that the migration of miners has been accompanied by a growing search for clean energy.  Bitmain has been holding information sessions for customers looking for clean power.  The US House of Representatives has also recently passed legislation requiring public companies to disclose environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators.  The bill passed by a vote of 215 to 214 and now goes to the Senate for consideration.  The bill also requires the SEC to establish a ""sustainable finance advisory board"".  The bill's passage could help shift bitcoin miners to clean energy.  

In addition, billionaire Chrissacca said he owns many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, and believes their environmental costs will drive the development of clean energy solutions.  

With the migration of miners and the search for clean energy.  Many analysts believe the bull market is not over yet.  Analyst Willywoo recently tweeted that the estimated number of users on the Bitcoin chain is growing faster than at any time in its 12-year history, even at this stage.  

In his latest video predicting when the Bitcoin bull market will end, crypto analyst NicholasMerten points out that we're seeing cycle extensions of 11 to 13 months per cycle.  So if we follow history, we can add 12 months here.  Forty-seven months is the expected length of the cycle we're in right now...

okha29,Additional2342,How to sign a psbt transaction with software wallets? [Electrum &amp; Others],"**So I've been looking for days to sign a PSBT transaction but upon to all my research i failed or i just haven't searched in the right place.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The PSBT content is generated from a payment gateway that I've been using for my web services  named** [btcpaymerchant.com](https://btcpaymerchant.com) **and it provides me a version of the PSBT encoded and decoded with inputs/outputs/txid/pubkey/etc..**

&amp;#x200B;

**I only need to sign it and** **~~broadcast~~** \*\*it from what i understood I've tried importing the file to electrum but it doesn't let me to sign it/\*\***~~broadcast~~** **ibt.**

# •What i tried:

* Tried directly importing the **PSBT** content to electrum and saving it to transaction history and proceeding to sign it but **electrum** disables the buttons to sign/~~broadcast~~ automatically when opening the transaction.
* Steps i took on **electrum** to import the **PSBT** to wallet are:

*Tools -&gt; Load Transaction -&gt; From File/From Text -&gt; Save*

\*Then the transaction appears as local \[rbf\] without allowing me to sign it/\**~~broadcast~~* *it,*

*image:* [*https://imgur.com/a/AGrhjo9*](https://imgur.com/a/AGrhjo9)

&amp;#x200B;

* Tried using [coinb.in](https://coinb.in) to sign/verify/~~broadcast~~ the transaction no success and it resulted in an error when attempting to ~~broadcast~~.

***Error:*** *\[scriptsig-not-pushonly (code 64)  error\] when trying to* *~~broadcast~~*

* Different wallets and wallets type from bip32-&gt;44-&gt;49.
* When trying to import [https://coinb.ib](https://coinb.ib) encoded transaction to **electrum** it results in the same error \`scriptsig-not-pushonly\` **\[image of the error:**  [https://imgur.com/bnx5LZV](https://imgur.com/bnx5LZV) **\]**
* I also tried researching the shit out of this and how to do it for 2 days.

**•Most of you may ask why didn't i contacted support?**

*That's a good point i tried but they haven't responded, i read the documentation several times but still no success \[*[*https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Wallet/*](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Wallet/)*\].*

&amp;#x200B;

**They offer the following steps for PSBT transactions.**

* *A PSBT gets constructed with certain inputs and outputs, but no signatures*
* *The exported PSBT can be imported by a wallet that supports this format*
* *The transaction data can be inspected and signed using the wallet*
* *The signed PSBT file gets exported from the wallet and imported with BTCPay Server*
* *BTCPay Server produces the final Bitcoin transaction*
* *You verify the result and broadcast it to the network*

**Most of the people use hardware wallets to sign these transactions but currently i do not own one if you have any other suggestions of software wallets that could help me out im all ears.**

**Thanks for your attention and helping!**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT \[reason: more specific questions\]:**

**What exactly needs to be signed?**

* The whole transaction?
* The inputs or outputs?
* Or anything?

&amp;#x200B;

**How do you combine the signature  with the message/transaction?**

* I know there is a setting ""merge signatures from"" while viewing the transaction but for me it results in a parsing error :

***Electrum was unable to parse your transaction: ValueError('failed to recognize transaction encoding for txt:...)***

Here is the transcript:

What is Bitcoin? In this video I will explain Bitcoin, from a non technical perspective. 

I will use easy language and examples that help you to understand everything better. 

Bitcoin was introduced during the financial crisis in 2008 by a group or person under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. In a 9 pages PDF document they describe how Bitcoin works, and what makes it special and important to all of us. 

I will not cover every detail of the so-called Whitepaper, but I will try to explain Bitcoins most important features. 

Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. 

Let us start with that. Everyone of you knows what cash is. Some of us still use it on a daily basis to purchase goods and services. We use coins and bills. Once we give our cash to someone, this cash is not in our possession anymore, and we can not give the same bills or coins to someone else. So far so good. If one person gives cash to another person, you could call it peer to peer. One peer gives cash to the other peer. Simple like that. There is no need for someone in between, a middleman, or a bank, to verify the peer to peer cash transfer from one person to another. 

And Bitcoin in its core is exactly this, just electronic. You can send (or transfer) Bitcoin from one person to another, just like cash. And the best is, you don’t need a middleman, for example a bank, or a company like PayPal or Visa, in order to do so. That you can do this peer to peer, electronically, is maybe the biggest and most important feature of Bitcoin. It also makes Bitcoin resistant and resilient. You don’t have to trust anyone to store your Bitcoin or run the Bitcoin network. This is one of the reasons it is often called trust-less. As there is no central authority controlling Bitcoin, Bitcoin can’t be shut down. The only way for Bitcoin to disappear is, if everyone that is running Bitcoin needs to be convinced to stop doing this. As of today, we are talking about tens of thousands of computers and companies all over the world. Together they create the decentralized peer to peer Bitcoin network. The only way to shut down Bitcoin, is to shut down the internet. And this is very unlikely to happen, especially when we are entering a time where the internet can be accessed via satellites from every corner of the earth. 

Access is also a very important topic for Bitcoin. As explained before the Bitcoin network is a decentralized peer to peer network without a central authority or middlemen. Everything is public at any time, every transaction, every address (often called a wallet or identity) that is used to send or receive Bitcoin. Even more important is that everyone can participate in Bitcoin without asking for permission. Think about it like a public park, everyone can enter, you don’t need to ask anyone to do so. This is why Bitcoin is also called public and permission-less. Bitcoin is for everyone, the only thing you need is an internet connection and a smartphone or computer.

The easiest way to get started with Bitcoin is getting a Bitcoin wallet. It’s like your physical wallet in your pocket, just as an app, on your smartphone or computer. Once installed, you will receive an address, and a key, usually 12-24 English words. The key is like your password, only you know it, and only with the key you can access your Bitcoin. If you lose your key, you lose your Bitcoin. If someone gets to know your key, this person can access your Bitcoin. Therefore it is advised to store the key in a very safe place and never show it to anyone. Think about it like the key to your physical Tresor. So protect it well!

You can create as many addresses as you want, it is completely free, public and permission-less, for everyone in the world, no matter if your government allow it or not, Bitcoin is literally for everyone, no one is or can be excluded, like you can’t be excluded from receiving cash from someone who stands in front of you and giving you it. 

If only you have the key to your wallet, you become your own bank. 

You have full control and ownership of your Bitcoin and no one can ever access them without your consent, or better said, without your key. If you die and don't pass the key to someone, your Bitcoin will be lost forever. Bitcoin gives you strong control and ownership but it comes hand in hand with being self responsible. There is no way to recover your Bitcoin once your key is lost or your Bitcoin has been sent to a different address. 

This sounds scary, but it is a very important feature of Bitcoin. Also the fact that Bitcoin transfers are non-reversible, you can’t get them back, or call someone, once sent (remember: there are no middlemen, Bitcoin is peer to peer). The fact that you can’t take back Bitcoin you sent so someone also ensures that you can’t send the same Bitcoin to multiple people. Again, think about cash. If you pass a bill to someone, you are not in possession of that bill anymore. You can not double spend it. Bitcoin can also not be double-spent. If you received it and if you own the key to your wallet, those Bitcoins are solely accessible and owned by you and not by anyone else. 

Bitcoin is private. No one knows who owns which address. This is why addresses are often called identities. If you want, you can create a new identity for every single transaction. You can, but you don’t have to re-use an address. This makes Bitcoin very private. If ten different people want to send you Bitcoin, you can give every single person a different address. This is how you stay anonymous and private. As Bitcoin doesn’t require any registration with your real name or passport, there is no connection to you in real life. This is one of the reasons why platforms like Wikileaks accept donations in Bitcoin, or why the dark web is using it too. Bitcoin is like cash. If you give someone cash on the street, both of you don’t have to know each other and you can still make a transaction.

But of course there is much more. First of all, there are only ever 21 Million Bitcoin in existence. Every Bitcoin can be divided into one hundred million pieces, the smallest piece of one Bitcoin is called a satoshi. One satoshi is 1/100.000.000 of a Bitcoin. To compare it with USD, one USD can be divided in 100 US cents. So 1 cent is 1/100 of a USD.

But other than USD or Euro, Bitcoin can not be created out of thin air, the total amount is fixed to 21 Million. 

So how can you get Bitcoin? 

Bitcoin can be earned by securing and running the Bitcoin network. As this part is quite technical and difficult, I will not explain it in this video. 

An easier way to own Bitcoin, is to exchange Bitcoin with another currency, or buy Bitcoin from someone, or get paid in Bitcoin for work, instead of getting paid in Euro for example. You can exchange Bitcoin for Euro or USD or any other currency, the same way you can exchange USD for GBP for example. 

Why does Bitcoin have value?

To be honest, before Bitcoin I never thought about the question why money has a specific value. I had no idea where it came from (the state? The government?) and I didn’t really care. But with more and more people calling Bitcoin an alternative to traditional cash, I became interested to learn more about it. 

You could say, the value of a product is defined by its importance of utility. Meaning, if a product is very useful (can be used for many things) it’s worth a lot. But that argument doesn’t hold. Life could not exist without water, but water seems to be less expensive than diamonds. 

Scarcity is important too. Scarcity (how many diamonds exist and how many people want them) is an important factor. Let it be a bottle of wine or a Picassô painting. Marx once said, the value derived from the labour used to produce it. Growing a tomato is easier than growing a cow, so cow meat is more expensive than tomatoes. 

But all this didn’t really explain to me the value of Bitcoin, so I looked into the USD. The name Dollar was derived from a place that produced the first silver coins, a valley that was called Joachims-thal, the coin was called Thaler, throughout the time Thaler became Dollar. So there we go. First dollars were silver coins. 

With the introduction of the dollar more than 200 years ago, the dollar was basically a certificate for gold. At any time you could go to the bank (or government), give them your dollar and receive your gold. Gold was scarce back then and is scarce today. It has a high scarcity, and there is nothing more scarce than Bitcoin today (think about it, there are only ever 21 million Bitcoin!). 

Back to the topic. Good money (how Austrian economics called it) can not come from thin air. Why does anyone like Pablo Picasso’s paintings? And pays a certain amount of USD or Bitcoin for it. Nobody knows and it doesn’t matter. Bitcoin can easily be money. Scarcity is important, and it’s very difficult to find anything scarcer than Bitcoin.

Today, the Dollar and the Euro and basically all government issued currencies are centrally planned and controlled. At any time, governments can create money out of thin air. And there is nothing we do about it. We need money to pay for goods and services, and when the government needs money, for example to fight a pandemic, they create money. 

This leads to problems though. Money needs to be in balance. There can’t be free money, or everyone would take as much as they want and money would become totally worthless. Hyperinflation would start. 

One person that received the Nobel prize in 1974 for economics is Hayek. He described the value of money in time. There are two types of people, he said, one type that has money, one type that needs money. Someone who has a very high time preference, needs money at this very moment, to buy champagne in the club or to start a business. These people usually borrow that money from someone who has a low time preference, someone who has saved money, usually through banks. The interest they ask for is the balance between these two parties. For what percentage are you willing to lend me money? This is what Hayek received the Nobel prize for. The natural rate of interest is the balance between low and high time preferences. 

Today money is completely out of hand. You can borrow it for free from the bank, and there is no limit. Other than in Bitcoin, there is an unlimited number of dollars (or other fiat currencies) and this number grows at an incredible increasing speed.

We have the problem that governments create money. Nearly 80% of all USD ever created, have been created in less then one and a half year. 4000 billion (21%) in 229 years, 19.200 (100%) billion dollars, 79% in the last 16 month years (Jan2020-May2021). 

Bitcoin is really difficult to imagine. Inflation too. We trust central authorities to not cause inflation. Bitcoin has no central authority and its supply is clearly limited and known in advance.

No more people, at any point in the history of the world, have thought about what money is. Or how central banks work, or how money is created. 

I don’t see the existence of fiat money and central banks as unchangeable. Bitcoin was able to educate more people on economics than any book. And we are just getting started. 

Bitcoin is good money. Accessible through a public and permission-less peer-to-peer network for every single person in the world. Become a Bitcoiner, continue to educate yourself, speak to others and ask questions. I promise you that you won’t regret it.

ok9o4w,Western_Reading4875,Orignal post by u/xcryptoguru - EXPOSED: Tesla lost its carbon credits market in Europe so it's trying to create a renewable credits market by attacking Bitcoin mining,"
I'm going to try to explain Elon Musk's seemingly ""big brain"" but actually pretty dumb gambit with regards to Bitcoin mining. Note carefully the dates on each development in the story.

Why did Tesla buy $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin?

Couple of factors - one short-term and one long-term.

**Short-term play** \- Tesla's production was halted due to supply chain effects from the pandemic. This is why there has been a lot of delivery delays this year. This meant that Tesla's shrinking profits from selling carbon credits to other carmakers alone wasn't enough to post a profitable quarter. So Tesla decided to buy Bitcoin and then sell some of it before the end of the quarter to make up for the shortfall.

[Bitcoin purchase ensured profitable Q1 2021 for Tesla](https://preview.redd.it/2cbuwb9xt4b71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f26f8d68c1e3d87def0783972627696905d5368)

**Long-term play** \- The reason for Tesla's revenue from carbon credits sales shrinking is that European carmakers are shifting focus to EV themselves, meaning they no longer need to purchase credits from Tesla to comply with strict emissions regulations in the EU.

[2020 was Tesla's first-ever net-positive year thanks to soaring carbon credits sales](https://preview.redd.it/4xyofb47u4b71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=821d0344237233cc0322cf0daa03bb0c0282e66f)

[But that source of revenue is now shrinking \(May 6\)](https://preview.redd.it/cqcxl5kbu4b71.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4121b24c5321d3530eb4e306d0da98193446a3f)

So Tesla now needs to make up for this potentially permanent revenue loss. What do they do?

**One day before Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin payments due to** ***""rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions""*****, Tesla applied for renewable credits certificate from the EPA.**

[Tesla applied for renewable credits one day before Bitcoin mining FUD \(May 12\)](https://preview.redd.it/bxtcrpigu4b71.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3a8106383a5b92051bde86f2136fdcc5f2932ab)

Unlike carbon credits, the EPA's renewable credits can be sold in the open market to ANY industry. Elon figured he could create a new renewable credits market out of Bitcoin mining.

Too bad for Elon Bitcoin mining uses 4x higher than the average share of renewables in the US (56%)

The dumbest part of all this has to be the use of ""and transactions"" because no incremental energy is used for transactions. This guy frankly has zero understanding of how Bitcoin works.

Personally, I don't think he cares to understand. Notice how he's trying to hijack dog coin and turn it into PayPal.

**Bitcoin does not benefit beneficiaries of the fiat pyramid scheme. Tax-dodging billionaires who get free money from the government making the rest of our money worth less are at the top of the pyramid and they're loving it!** ***(credit iTruth84)***

[Billionaires reap all the benefits from inflation. All the ill effects are dumped on us!](https://preview.redd.it/yy6mpz4lu4b71.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=baf557f19b9a2c939b1dc4b6b2f66db4143f23d7)

We felt we had to try something else so we turned to Coinbase Commerce and were able to start receiving Bitcoin as payment within just 15 minutes!!!  It was super easy too and didn’t require any of the lengthy vetting processes associated with fiat based systems like Square.

This buying and selling of crypto currencies make it extremely volatile making it not a great asset for every day transactions. In the end fiat currencies win.

While the prices were in fact inflated, the sudden drop in prices went way beyond what a “correction” is supposed to be.

I think it’s the works of a couple major whales that wanted to capitalize on a price dip and thus created an initially artificial dump that then grew into an organic market panic (this would explain the individual dump that occurred right before the prices dropped)

Like I’ve always said, whales are a PLAGUE to this market in every way possible. And while removing them completely impossible, I’m glad to see some companies working against them. Some companies like GPool have a zero tolerance community and platform that makes it really hard for whales to single handedly control how the projects will perform.

A price correction would be the easy way to describe what happened. But I don’t think it’s that simple. We need more companies and platforms to form limits on the games whales are playing. If they don’t, regular people like you and I will have no chance in the market very soon…",1626724173,32,1

If not, here's a quick recap: The media told everyone that Apple was not a good stock to buy or hold and that everyone who owns it should sell it before it crashes and dies during its early days, all while at the same time Banks were adding it to their asset catalog, blocked a majority of their clients from being able to buy it, and only allowed their most wealthy clients to add it to their portfolios.

Sound familiar? It was some hell of what felt like an endless stream of FUD that they spread on Apple, which as you may know is only the most valuable company in the world today.

They scared my poor immigrant dad who came to this country with nothing and started investing in his youth, out of his Apple stock in the '97 for a small $40k profit with their endless stream of FUD news lies. That news stopped him from ever investing back into the market.

And that stock he was scared into selling would be worth millions today. I can only imagine how many other people they scared out of that stock and others like it, who could have greatly improved their lives with those internet tech stock assets.

Because of that experience, I'm never letting them scare me out of selling my Bitcoin. HODL'r for over a decade now, and I will HODL until my kids can inherit my fortune and become HODL'rs themselves",1626721609,164,1

opdee3,Black_Sky_Thinking,Shower Thought: Bitcoin is our first AI,"I was listening to a podcast on how life evolved, and it struck me that Bitcoin (or more accurately, functioning blockchains) fit the definition of a simple lifeform. 

Bitcoin self-replicates and self-moderates. It spreads, scales, matures and plateaus without human intervention. This separates it from simple software or algorithms (your computer's OS, for example), which will tend to have fixed lifespans and won't survive in the open without human intervention to remain operable, useful and resistant to attacks. 

Bitcoin also evolves with the help of external interactions. The bitcoin community has made modifications (forks, Lightning network etc) that allowed Bitcoin to evolve. I'd argue that it's similar to the way some lifeforms (fruits, vegetables, cats, dogs) have been selectively bred by humans. It's not completely organic evolution, but evolution nonetheless.

Lastly, I'd point out that Bitcoin survives because it's useful to us. It has monetary value to human society. I'd argue that it means it's now part of Earth's ecosystem. Plants expend energy growing fruits that will be eaten by animals, and the animals scatter the seeds of the fruit. The fruit and the animal exist in symbiosis, and bitcoin exists in a similar symbiosis with humans. We both inadvertently help each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

Those factors would put it in the same category as simple, single cell lifeforms. It stays alive by itself, grows and spreads, evolves and fits in with other creatures on Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

Most people imagine AI as a *Artificial Generalized Intelligence* \- Something like the Terminator, with all the faculties of a human, and we're quite far away from being able to do that. But AI engineers believe we're much closer to specialised AI, that have a much narrower existence.

Remember, about half of the history of life on Earth was just primordial soup - simple single cell lifeforms. More complex multi-cellular life is a very recent development. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd argue that we're at the ""primordial soup"" stage in AI, and Bitcoin represents genuine AI and a digital lifeform. I think we're a long way off AGI, but I think humanity's first artificial life was Bitcoin.",1626959034,5,1

opd5vm,SnooRevelations4687,"I Will Always Keep Buying, For You","Hello,  


I feel like I have something important to say. I dont mean to ""preach to the choir"". If you feel like I am, stop reading! I believe Bitcoin to be our best shot at fixing things. Its the best chance I know of achieving the things I want out of life, and hopefully the things you want too. I'm hoping that by sharing some of my thoughts, it helps you, and gives you some comfort knowing that at the very least, I have your back.  
Its too easy to get caught up in everything that surrounds bitcoin. The price action, the media, the analysts talking about charts and market cycles, the next big bull thing, the next big bear thing, the next big crab thing. It doesnt really ever stop.  
In the past I payed a lot of attention to these things.   
I tried to figure out how to time the market, when to allocate my capital and how much to allocate. 5%? 20% 50%?!  
I tried to figure out when I should sell my bitcoin and how to make as much money as possible so that I can get ahead in my life. Get ahead of what?   
What I want:  I believe my goals to be simple. I want to be able to afford to buy my own home. I want to have the freedom to study, maybe travel a little, and pursue things I find interesting in life. I want to know if the wheel stops spinning for a bit, its ok.  
What I dont want: I dont want to be in a position where I'm forced to trade my life energy doing something I dont love, for shit I dont need.  
Also, I want these exact same things for you. Well, at least the option of having, if you want it too.  
It makes me really sad to think about how fucked we are. Makes me sad to know how hard it is for a lot of people. It makes me sad to think about how good things could be, yet how far away from that we actually are.  


I don't subscribe to any particular religion, but thank god for Bitcoin. It gives me hope. It could easily empower individuals and allow them a shot at freedom, like it has with me. It makes me think there could be a way to unfuck many of the worlds problems by changing the incentive structures. Its complicated. Theres a lot to it. Theres a lot yet to be done and so much that I still dont understand.   
They say ""fix the money, fix the world"". Maybe I dont fully understand it, but I get it. In the worlds current financial/economic state, I see parasites embedded into a monetary system which suck the life energy out of value creators and transfer this energy to people who create little to no value. It seems these parasites actually create a lot of problems value creators must then go on and face. These problems are hard to detect in real time and are often very sneaky in how they manifest. They are hard for the average person to understand fully. They are hard for me to understand fully. It seems a lot of it has to do with incentives. These Parasites are incentivised to be parasites. Maybe if incentives changed, they wouldn't be. Wishful thinking? Well what if they couldnt be. The next best thing would be a pesticide that would allow value creators to fully reap the fuits of their labour. To be able to then allocate all of their energy in the direction they see fit, not have it syphoned away. I think Bitcoin is both the pesticide and the incentive changer. Thankfully it seems Bitcoin can do a lot of things.  


Enough rambling and to my point: For a while now I have been ""all in"" on Bitcoin. It's the only asset I own. I am now in a good position thanks to Bitcoin. I keep enough fiat to meet my living expenses. Everything else goes into purchasing bitcoin. I no longer care about the distractions. The next time I sell bitcoin - I hope it to be for a house (I dont own a house yet, but 1 house will be enough for me. Why would I want to contribute to increasing house prices by purchasing additional properties. All it would achieve is pricing others out of the real estate market and force them to rent from me. I dont want to be a parasite... I'll stop here).  
After that, maybe travel or take a shot at creating value for the world.   
While I continue to be productive in this world, and convert my life energy into monetary energy, I will store it only in bitcoin. Even after I get all the things I want. I will store it in bitcoin. I think this is the best shot we have of changing things for the better, at a large scale. So my vote goes to Bitcoin. My vote goes to you. Hoping that if/when things shift in your favour, that you will follow a different incentive system from the parasites. Maybe you will help fix the world, or at least make it better. I've got your back. I'll keep doing whatever I can do to help.  


tl;dr - Even after I get all the things I want in life, I'm still all in, hoping that it helps you (and all of us)",1626958184,1,1

Bitcoin, as we know it, has been called many names – a revolutionary idea, a bubble, a cult, a religion, and whatnot. One may agree with one or more names depending upon their knowledge about the subject. 

However, we can say for sure that for some of us, it is something beyond the illusion of names and something far more greater than just a get-rich-quick scheme. Bitcoin, for us, is a hope, a belief system, an ideology. **#TheBitcoinIdeology** **#Bitcoin**

other sites have small limits and when I upload numerous KUY stuff they said it isn't good enough. Tried localbitcoins and the couple of big ones said their bank was frozen.

oq6hjo,stardustwealth,Anyone know who Robinhood's Crypto Routing Counterparty is?,"Hey everyone,

I'm working on a fee exposé for the main crypto trading platforms and all of their hidden fees. I'm working on a deep dive right now with Robinhood. I know they route their order to a third counter party but am not exactly sure who their counter parties are or who's paying them for these crypto trades.

https://preview.redd.it/kihiohqrszc71.jpg?width=1728&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a3a61ab6f78815fe87ab63def509ba44a9f2fff

We've parsed through their 606 forms and their disclosures ([https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Q1%202021.pdf](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Q1%202021.pdf)) which tells us all of their counter parties for stocks and options but not their crypto counter parties.

We're trying to trace their crypto wallet to see if we can find any additional information but haven't found anything thus far. If anyone has any further insights into this please let me know!

Because crypto is unregulated we're trying to figure out if they're selling your trades to the big whales to front run or if they're selling to large hedge funds; we're just trying to figure out who the counter party is.

Thanks!!

P.S. If anyone has any crypto fee stories they want to share or things we should check out let us know!",1627059200,6,1

oq4wbi,CPAPrez,Crypto Margin Trading EXPOSED!,"If you are trading crypto with leverage on Bybit, Phemex, Bitmex, FTX, BINANCE futures or any other exchange that offers leverage, STOP right now, it is all RIGGED!!!

The exchanges pay big fees to the (CME) Chicago Mercantile exchange Globex and other financial institutional firms to use ""Hitmen"" (high frequency trading bots) that are programmed to hunt your stop-loss' and liquidate your positions with-in certain percentages from your entry. In turn, the CME and institutional firms steal your crypto and the exchanges make further billions in fees. \*CME charts are also delayed by 10mins unless you pay an additional Tradingview fee to unlock the live version.

There is also the exchange fine print which should be thoroughly studied before executing any margin trade, which most traders will never look into or find out about until it's too late.

A couple of examples: (Bybit)

1.) An order can be executed and closed by the exchange (LTP) ""Last traded price"", but can be liquidated by the ""Mark price"" (the price that reflects the real-time spot price, which is referenced from five other major exchanges: Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, Bittrex &amp; Kraken), even if the current candle did not reach your liquidation price. Furthermore, to see the live Mark price, you must set up the .MBTC, BYBIT indicator to it's correct settings of... Inputs: Low or High (depending if you are Long or Short), and Style: Precision: 4 , Override Min Tick: 1/1000. Failing to set this up correctly can get you stopped out or prematurely liquidated (especially for scalpers).

2.) You can get paid a maker rebate fee of -0.025% (of your trade value) by executing a limit trade, ticking the post only check box and closing that trade using the limit function. The catch is, when using the limit button to close a trade, you must priorly set a worse or better price depending if you are Long or Short. \*If you instantly close your trade using the limit button, the maker fee will be forfeited and you will be charged a market Taker fee of 0.075%. None of this is ever mentioned to retail traders in order to charge you the maximum in fees possible!

Other major concerns that I have noticed are paid YouTuber partnerships pushing margin trading on new traders that have absolutely no experience for a $10 per customer commission fee. Yes, ""The Moon, MMCrypto, Davincij15, Ivan, Bitboy"" and more... are all getting hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to them in affiliate commissions from each exchange for trapping innocent people. Bybit has also been seen monitoring and defending comments on The Moon and MMCrypto twitter pages as of recent when they went down from a possible DNS attack.

In summary: There is a reason that 98% of traders have lost more than they have made trading with Margin. The system is designed and stacked so far against the average retail trader, that you will end up losing everything you deposit.

Goodluck to you all, I hope this saves some of you in the future. HODL and win!",1627054540,208,1

or Ledger. For instance in the highly unlikely event that the Trezor site gets hacked or shutdown then I have to go buy a new hardware wallet to access my wallet. So in essence you aren’t completely in control. 
I know the risks of running a wallet on a live node… but let’s say I setup my node behind a very secure firewall that doesn’t allow outside connections. Thus my node can connect out, which allows it to stay connected to the BTC network but it doesn’t allow incoming connections, which protects my keys. I’ve tried it and it works.

oqh1nj,ThreeBarrelBluff,The emotional component of running your own node,"There is a debatable amount of financial value to running your own node from a pure economic point of view.  But my node was down after a power outage and resync for two days.  This is when I saw the emotional aspect to having my own node.

My node getting knocked out gave me the same feeling of disconnection as you get if your phone fails and you have a day or two while you are replacing it.

**The financial:**

About a month or two ago, I spent 0.00'39 BTC (130 USD) on the hardware for a Pi to run Umbrel.

I have about 0.15 BTC (5,200 USD) on it for lightning network (totally an unneeded expense)

**Labor:**

I probably screw around on the Pi about 30 minutes a day, checking stats, balancing channels, etc.  This is essentially a hobby since I will never have a node that generates any appreciable number of sats.  Hell, I probably lose sats because I burn them inefficiently to make sure the channels are balanced.

**Utility:**

I was surprised how quickly my little node became a major part of my bitcoin life.  In the days of the resync while it was down:

* I had to check balances of wallets, ugh, on someone else's copy of the chain.  It felt dirty.
* Wanted to send some sats around, I had to check the mempool on google instead of just looking in the window where I always have it displayed.
* My lightning channels were down for a few days, I worried about them.  Running a lightning node is a labor of love for me.
* I love watching the blocks roll in like the tides on my own node.

Running a node is addictive. I think I need to buy a UPS so that the frequent power outages here do not knock my node out for days like this.",1627093394,10,1

I was always in the small blocker size, especially because of the highly dubious way the big blockers tried to force people into a hard fork. UASF was a truly magical movement and it gave me a lot of confidence that Bitcoin is in the hands of its users and not some cartel making decisions for us.

That being said, trying to heal old wounds and approach things from a new and fresh perspective, I've been wondering whether there is any outlook for a size upgrade in the pipeline at all. Whether anyone puts this idea on the table anymore. I don't follow the dev github or mailing lists, /r/bitcoin is my main community, so I'm just asking you guys, what you think.

Back in the day, there were several proposals. 2MB, 8 MB etc. With SegWit this would be vMB today. What do you think? Personally, I don't think the solution to an exponential increase of user adoption, such as is the case with the Bitcoin network, can ever be solved by linear scaling solution, such as is the case with blocksize increases. However, obviously, when there is pressure on the network, a size increase would help, at least temporarily. The problem is really consensus. Without consensus, nothing is possible, so it's more of a social issue than a technical one (assuming that we're not considering gigabyte-sized blocks here).

I hope that asking this won't result in a big fight, but I am aware of the sensitive nature of this question, so I'm asking for forgiveness before you put my head under the guillotine. Not sure if the mods will leave this post up, but in the case they don't, I guess I just wasted fifteen minutes of my life typing this down.

Recently I got notification about the fox airdrop ( completely forgot the wallet deletion) I log into the Shapeshift account. I was prompted to register for a Portis wallet after that  I  used the eth address to get their airdrop, I had to send some money since you need to use gas to exchange (ETH) ...  So I sent couple hundred USD (ETH)  to my assigned address.. so I noticed my Portis wallet wasn't syncing up.. I was able to  received coins and  get the airdrop but I couldn't not trade or send funds so I logged out login in both Shapeshift and Portis as you were normally prompted.. then I started to see 2 Portis wallets  attached to my account.. so I did a test and sent some eth to that wallet other Portis wallet.. "" was thinking has to be  graphic glitch cause its not possible to have 2 Portis wallets attached to one Shapeshift account""

*\[Note: I didn't see the 2nd wallet  until I logged out and in \]*

So I did a forgot wallet in their settings... logged back in **Shapeshift** now I am showing 1 **Portis** wallet..

basically I lost everything in the other wallet.  I didn't keep any information on keys from the wallet I requested for them to delete last year since they have security leak issue, made no sense to keep that information. 

Contacted support - waited 2-3 days for a response , all i got was sorry we are in beta or the airdrop is finale  so we cant help you sorry.......

tbh I was hoping to get some compensation for the cash I sent since  I was being their beta tester Guinea pig - give a flying F about the airdrop.. yeah

ora8cf,_kr_saurabh,Strategist Mike McGlone Believes Bitcoin Can Jump to $60K Resistance vs. $20K Support,"**The senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, Mike McGlone, has been long on bitcoin for a while now and he said last month that bitcoin has a “bullish ace up its sleeve.” This week the strategist’s analysis notes that bitcoin prices will likely revert toward the $60K handle in contrast to the $20K support range.**

## ETF Analyst: ‘China Doesn’t Reject Bitcoin, Bitcoin Rejects China’

On July 23, Bloomberg’s senior exchange-traded fund (ETF) analyst Eric Balchunas shared a screenshot of Mike McGlone’s written statement concerning current bitcoin markets. After tapping a high of $35,960 on July 4, the leading crypto asset tumbled to a low of $29,300 per unit 19 days later. On July 24, bitcoin (BTC) managed to climb back toward the $34K region as there’s been a slight trend reversal during the last 48 hours.

“Our crypto analyst Mike McGlone says bitcoin \[is\] more likely to hit $60k than $20k based on historical price patterns,” Balchunas tweeted on Friday. “\[McGlone\] also says China’s rejection of open-source software crypto assets may mark \[a\] plateau in \[the\] country’s economic ascent,” Balchunas added. A few individuals responded to McGlone’s take and one person said:

"" ***That’s a hot take on China. Rejecting things like this typically shows a fear that something is better than your currency. Every Country that rejects Bitcoin is SCREAMING the same thing.*** ""

Balchunas replied to the comment and said it reminded him of some old jokes. “Reminds me of the Chuck Norris jokes for some reason. China doesn’t reject bitcoin, bitcoin rejects China,” Balchunas said.

## McGlone: ‘Bitcoin Market Akin to the 2018-2019 Consolidation Period’

As far as McGlone’s bitcoin (BTC) price forecast is concerned, the ETF analyst’s screenshot of McGlone’s outlook said:

"" ***Bitcoin is more likely to revert toward $60,000 resistance vs. $20,000 support if its history of recovering from similar too-cold conditions are any guide. Our graphic depicts the benchmark crypto akin to the 2018-2019 consolidation period of around $4,000, just before launching to the 2019 peak at about $14,000. The more tactical-trading-oriented bears seem to proliferate when Bitcoin sustains at about 30% threshold below its 20-week moving average, allowing the buy-and-hold types time to accumulate.*** ""

Besides China, regulators have been cracking down on cryptocurrency operations worldwide. Government officials in Europe want to ban anonymous transactions and the European Commission has proposed legislation to “ensure full traceability of crypto-asset transfers.”

"" ***Hey,*** ***#China******? Good Luck With That One –*** ***#Bitcoin******,*** ***#Dollar*** ***Dominance:***  
***China's rejection of open-source software crypto-assets may mark a plateau in the country's economic ascent, we believe while extolling the value of the U.S. dollar and Bitcoin.""***

 ***— Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11)*** ***July 23, 2021*** 

In addition to the regulatory climate, global markets, in general, are a touch shaken by the narrative surrounding the Covid Delta variant. While lots of people responding to Balchunas’ Twitter thread agreed with McGlone, one individual said he only agreed with one specific part of the statement where he said bitcoin is more likely to hit $60K than $20K.

This isn’t the first time McGlone has made such predictions concerning bitcoin‘s future price. Last month, the senior commodity strategist said “$40,000 appears more likely than $20,000” and the latest $60K call is a lot more optimistic.",1627214137,15,1

Although the hacker tried to obfuscate the origin  of bitcoin through hundreds of transfers, it is easy to prove that he  deposited 15.7 BTC after 207 transactions on the Binance exchange on  February 26, 2021. How is this possible?   


Manually created BTC  obfuscation transaction chains have a significantly different pattern  than chains created by natural transactions in the blockchain. And the  fraudster made the additional mistake of using the bitcoin in the 207th  step together with other unspent outputs from the heist in a common  transaction. The 207 obfuscation transactions were thus completely  useless for the scammer, only the miners enjoyed the transaction fees.   


This  is just one of many mistakes the fraudster made. The next logical step  for Exmo is to use the analysis results to freeze the fraudster's crypto  assets on the involved exchanges.",1627211378,4,1

Why would anyone want to shop on Amazon with BTC? Even Tesla, why would someone pay specifically with BTC for a car? It is like going to Walmart and paying with gold.

If someone doesn’t really care about BTC future etc. and simply wants to profit from its growth (just like any other stock), they can just exchange it back into dollars and pay for those goods with dollars. It is very easy to do today. 
If someone is long on it, then they obviously don’t even care about someone accepting it - they are just going to hold anyway. 

I’m not even going to mention that it’s inconvenient and insecure, at least today, to carry BTC around for daily purchases.

The only reason I could see for paying, for example, for Tesla with Bitcoin is if someone wants to circumvent taxation. I.e., I made $200,000 on BTC. If I exchange it for dollars, I’ll be taxed. If I pay directly with BTC, then no tax? - I’m not sure about this though. Can someone confirm?

In fact, if you are all about “Bitcoin life”, wouldn’t you want to get rid of dollars instead of BTC?",1627275267,19,1

What does this have to with Bitcoin you ask?,"It’s quite simple really. Forget real estate as a form of investment. Just rent the place you love and buy a place when it’s cheap enough to afford when you can use Bitcoin to buy it for cheap. In the meantime, Bitcoin is your truest form of investment that you don’t really have to worry overbidding for. In years to come, the returns (200% year over year) will obliterate any form of investment return on investment you otherwise would have if you invested it in real estate.

Also, if you were thinking of buying real estate simply for the sole reason of being able to build equity while have the ability to refinance and use leverage to your advantage, Bitcoin will offer loans that will be even more competitive than the housing refinance market in the future because it’s the most pristine collateral asset; no other collateral comes close to it.

The Winklevoss Twins attended Harvard University alongside Mark Zuckerberg. In 2002 the Winklevoss twins wanted to create a social media platform for fellow university students in the USA, resulting in the creation of HarvardConnection, 2 years later HarvardConnection was then re-named to ConnectU, months later filing a lawsuit against Facebook alleging that Mark Zuckerberg had broken a verbal contract with the twins. Zuckerberg had copied their idea and illegally used source code intended for the website he was hired to create, this lawsuit continued for another 4 years until it was settled that Facebook owed the Winklevoss Twins 65 Million dollars and shares in Facebook, the value of the Facebook shares were overvalued at $11 Million instead of $45 Million that Facebook presented at the settlement fee, this meant the real settlement value was $31 million, furthermore, the New York Times stated that Facebook shares were trading at just over $76 per share in the secondary market making the settlement value just under $120 Million.

**How did they splash the cash?**

In 2010 both brothers decided to invest $11 Million into Bitcoin, they believed in blockchain technology and the future of Bitcoin, they later created Geminin Cryptocurrency Exchange. It is unknown when or if the twins have sold all of their Bitcoin, an estimated $6 Billion in current holdings. Despite the fact, the Twins hold an amassed $6 Billion they both still live slightly above average lives, Cameron drives an SUV and Tyler doesn't have a car at all, they both have apartments in Manhattan and live normal lives. They both claim to be in life for the long-term, their mentality is to invest rather than spend money.

**Achievements for the Twins**

Besides being the only known Bitcoin Twins, the brothers have accomplished many other things. Back in 2007, both brothers attended the Pan American Games along with the 2008 Olympic Games and 2009 World Cup, finishing with their most recent race in 2010. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are both members of the United States Olympic Team. The Winklevoss twins started rowing at 15 years of age, they were encouraged by family friend Ethan Ayer who rowed at Harvard and Cambridge University. In 1999 both brothers were invited to the United States Junior National Rowing Team further competing in the World Rowing Junior Championships in Bulgaria. Along with physical talents the twins have immense mental strength, at the age of 14 the twins started a Website Design Business making thousands of dollars, however, they gave up on this idea and focused on education. ",1627268393,6,1

orw9qk,Bagger55,Huge performance on ECB CBDC blockchain test....,"It looks like the Estonian Central Bank together with the European Central Bank put out a paper today on their experiments with blockchain for a ECB CBDC.

The blockchain they tested sounds pretty crazy when compared to existing blockchains.  The highlights from the report:

\- 300,000 Payments (wallet-to-wallet transactions) per second (which corresponded to **2 million** updates per second on the blockchain) 

\- No constraints on further scaling (i.e. just add servers to go over 2 million/second)

\- Average settlement time of 0.6 seconds, with 99.56% of transactions settled in under 2 second.  What is interesting here is that means wallet-to-wallet settlement, including network latency, etc.  The actual settlement on the blockchain is within that timeframe and therefore even better.  

\- Tested on 100 million wallets

\- Carbon usage per transaction is 0.0001 g/CO2.  I have seen numbers for Bitcoin are around 300 KG/CO2 per transaction, and VISA around 0.45 g/CO2.  Apparently the carbon usage of just the blockchain (i.e. not wallet-to-wallet transaction) is actually about one-fifth of the 0.0001 g/CO2.  

\- The blockchain can be implemented so that privacy ranges from completely anonymous to fully transparent.  

The Press Release says the blockchain is the same one used by the Estonian government.  Doing some digging on Google seems this is called a KSI Blockchain, developed by a company called Guardtime. Now they’ve developed this “KSI Cash” which seems to be what the ECB tested.  

So, what do these performance figures mean for Bitcoin and existing Crypto in general?  If Guardtime puts out their own crypto with this kind if performance, what’s the impact to the existing crypto market?

Here’s the press release:  [https://www.eestipank.ee/en/press/experiment-central-banks-digital-euro-illustrated-new-possibilities-blockchain-technology-26072021](https://www.eestipank.ee/press/keskpanga-digieuro-uurimisprojekt-naitas-plokiahela-tehnoloogia-uusi-voimalusi-26072021)

orspcl,Altruistic-Fan-7792,bitmax accusation,"Hello.
I am GYEONG SEOP LEE living in South Korea.
I was not using Google Authenticator while using Bitmex. On March 24, 2020, I tried to withdraw Bitcoin, and I tried to apply for a withdrawal according to the withdrawal time provided by BitMEX.
 But suddenly the account was logged out and the coins were withdrawn before the time provided by BitMEX.
Bitmex held me responsible for not using google OTP and did not give me a proper answer or compensation. The coin I had at the time was 0.83btc.

There was something strange here.
At that time, I was logging in to withdraw money and I did not use Google OTP, but the withdrawal process was carried out only after authentication in the mail, but there was no change in the mail or no request for authentication.
However, during login, the login was suddenly released, so I could not log in again and only checked that the account was suspended.
Unless you're an insider, I couldn't forget how difficult it was to handle this suddenly.

It's been over a year, but I can't forget it. I wanted to make a accusation, but I didn't know how to make a accusation.
I'll post some of my earlier stuff everywhere I know.
It may be a small amount for you, but for me it was all.

I don't know how much this work I'm doing will affect BitMEX, but I won't stop until I get a reward.

I hope someone can help.",1627279311,5,1

I set up my mother up with the BTC in cashapp( I started her off really simplistic to avoid mishaps and confusion) and I shared the gameplan with my her it was simple. We were going to buy and hold with an emphasis on DCA. In times of price horizontal development (like what we’ve been seeing for the past 2 months) we would be aggressive with with out DCA-ing. 

Frankly, my dad(57M)has never understood nor has ever cared to understand the world of finance and investing. He was always in her ear with negative comments and opinions. We had an opportunity to have a big win out of the 2008 housing crisis and he shot that plan down too. 

My mom is enjoying retirement while my dad has served his time in the union and keeps pushing retirement back because all he knows is work. They have money in the bank so any money btc was making could have simply just stayed there til we felt it was time to lock in some gains.

This past Saturday(7/24) all the comments and nagging had pushed my mom over the edge. In order to get him to finally shut up, she sold all the BTC he had accumulated this past year. I don’t think she will ever get back into the Bitcoin.

She called me this morning raving about btc hitting 40k off the amazing catalyst and how she’s shouldn’t have listened to my dad. I was frustrated all weekend after she told me what she had done and honestly didn’t want to talk to her about Bitcoin anymore.

I feel frustrated. Not really sure how I should feel to be honest. A bit fed up with my dad and his outdated perspectives.

Today I have the 4hr time frame pulled up after a pretty  wild day yesterday... The bulls took us to a higher high. But will that  be enough? Lets get this party started...

Okay  so we all know Bitcoin did well yesterday. But after Amazon announced  they were NOT accepting Bitcoin we saw a pull back. Which is to be  expected. Fud is common in this market and yesterday was no exception.  The resistance that was broken yesterday was fantastic. But I think the  bulls still have some ground to retake before I am full bull... Another  reason for the pull back is the 4hr RSI is overbought. Which resulted in  a pull back which happens often in an overbought market. Especially  when FUD is on the table.

We are still in  decent shape this morning. You see we broke the trend yesterday and had a  nice surge. Now the top of that trend is support. Classic TA.  Resistance becomes support and vice versa. The daily looks okay. We beat  the cloud (bottom border) and the daily 50 MA. The 100 EMA was under us  for a bit but the FUD yesterday pushed us back below the resistance.  Hopefully this drop is just a retest of support before the bulls push us  out of the daily cloud. Then Im full bull.

If  you want to take a shot at a long set a stop loss. I'm certainly more  optimistic than I was last week but I am still cautious. Cmon Bulls!  WTFDIK??

TLDR: Bullish Monday. Still in good shape today. Set a stop loss.

“The art world is changing so fast in this digital world, so we thought, ‘Why not incorporate it into the house world?’ ” says Compass’ Aaron Kirman.

otgs04,Coinpls,Practical Bitcoin Trading Guide for Beginners (updated 2021.7),"Hello Everyone,

I recently started a new blog on [coinpls.com](https://coinpls.com), it is focusing on sharing information and knowledge to bitcoin traders and investors.

This is my first article in blog, which tries to help beginners understand basic knowledge before they can step into crypto exchanges.

Hope the content below is useful for you. And please give me some comments as support to me.

Thank you all

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the guide below, we are going to cover everything you need to know before starting bitcoin trading. This will be a practical guide you can directly take to trade. 

Below are the topics we covered in the articles

* Find an exchange suits you 
* Understand trading basics and terms
* Understand what move bitcoin’s price
* Find a strategy you are comfortable with
* Avoid some common mistakes

## Where can I trade Bitcoin?

The first step is finding an exchange that suits you.There’s some criteria for picking the exchanges.

## Trustability &amp; Safety

This is the priority in selecting exchanges, the exchanges should be in the field for years. And have a good reputation in crypto community.

Here are some biggest exchanges for your reference:

1. Binance (good liquidity, and all kinds cyrpto pairs to trade)
2. Coinbase (recommended for US user and Merchant users)
3. FTX (recommend for derivatives trading)
4. OKEx,Huobi (recommended only for Chinese users)

&amp;#x200B;

[exchange ranking made by Token insight](https://preview.redd.it/sssjj4iu40e71.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=370586eea22068468510b3bb78edcd405985ac6c)

## Deposit &amp; Withdraw

Depending on your residency and exchange policy, you may face different options for deposit and withdrawal.

* Deposit and Withdraw FIAT (USD,EUR,CAD,JPY,KRW etc..) directly from exchanges.

Apart from USD accounts, other FIAT deposits probably will only be available in localized exchanges. Such as Bithumb for South Korea users, and Bitflyer for Japanese users etc..

* P2P trading to get or sell stablecoin in exchanges

Due to regulations in some regions or countries, you may need to convert your local FIAT into stablecoins. (a type of cryptocurrency which always has a face value of 1usd).

The conversion process usually happens through the platform, the vendor (could be the exchange itself or other users in the exchanges) who sell you stablecoin will have the selling asset frozen and pledged. After you send them FIAT currency, the exchange will release the equivalent value of stablecoin to you.

Vice versa, when you cash out your crypto assets.You may also be involved in the P2P trading.

[p2p trading page on binance](https://preview.redd.it/apffh69w40e71.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=996c263c9f5c4abf1a08bb05acac8d3cbca71900)

\*Notes1: P2P trading means you are trading with an actual person or entity (which you can see their names and account numbers). And you may be facing some real world problem if there’s some problem with the guys you trade with. (Money Laundering,Drugs, etc..)

\*Notes2: Avoid trading bitcoin with P2P method. Especially when there’s fluctuation in the market.

 

### Comply with your region’s policy

Usually you are not allowed to register if the exchange does not comply with your region’s regulation &amp; policy.

However, you may need to keep an eye on the regulation changes, in some cases you may be asked to withdraw all your assets from the exchanges.

&amp;#x200B;

## Understand Bitcoin Trading Basics

The second step is to understand products and mechanisms that exchange work, and get prepare for bitcoin trading.

### Product Type (Spot,Contract,Options)

Usually there are 2 types of products you can trade in exchanges.

1. Spot Product  
This is “actual” coins that can be transferred on the blockchain network. And can be stored in your personal wallet.
2. Derivatives  
These are contract exchanges sold to you. You cannot transfer it on blockchain and you cannot withdraw it from exchange. Also when playing with derivatives, you have a risk of losing your coins.  
\*Beginners should stay away from these products before fully understanding them.

&amp;#x200B;

[ contract products listed on binance ](https://preview.redd.it/7q30xoqx40e71.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=364cb2f6545353130f9e220e8718bc96a683eeb5)

### Stablecoins

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to be pegged with a FIAT currency. (Usually USD).  
(\*Stablecoin In English : a type of Cryptocurrency sound like US Dollar that you can use to trade other cryptocurrencies in Exchanges)

When trading in crypto exchanges, most of the trading relies on these stablecoin as a medium of exchange. And you will see them very frequently when you start trading bitcoins. 

\*Note :a lot of traders will keep stablecoin in their accounts for convenience of bitcoin trading. Since bitcoin market is nonstop and volatile. Trading opportunity could disappear in minutes. FIAT deposit may take too long time for transferring.

And there are majorly 5 stablecoins people are using across different exchanges

1. USDC (26.8 Bn in circulation)
2. BUSD (11.2 Bn in circulation)
3. USDT (61.9 Bn in circulation)
4. DAI (5.46 Bn in circulation)
5. PAX (0.9 Bn in circulation)

[ major stablecoin supply in circulation ](https://preview.redd.it/xwotwkdz40e71.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeb3d4d536c77cbb70ff9d2209008d6eb8c6ebed)

Some of them are backed by real world assets and checked by accounting firms. And they can be redeemed back to dollars easily.(USDC,BUSD,PAX)

While some of them are not transparent. (USDT)

&amp;#x200B;

### CryptoPairs

Also named as trading symbols. It shows the relative price between two cryptos. And fungibility of a coin to others.  
(\*fungibility In English : How much a coin can be converted into another coin)

E.g : BTC/USD = 60000$ means a BTC can be sold for 60000$ in the market at the moment.

In order to trade anything, you first need to find crypto pairs. Here we use BTC as an example

&amp;#x200B;

[ Binance’s trading page for seraching crypto pair ](https://preview.redd.it/cjcdtym150e71.png?width=323&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b418c127edbad5803b88c9c621a1f2bcd062cb99)

 

Things may get a little bit confusing here , you may also see BTC/USDT,BTC/USDC as well. These crypto pairs are not equivalent.

Although the price could be very close, you are actually trading with different stablecoins. And the trading volume for each pair is also different. You should avoid crypto pairs with low trading volume.

&amp;#x200B;

[ comparison of 2 similar trading pairs \(1\)](https://preview.redd.it/ou9mviz350e71.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cc9d19ad1033b7b83969988eef4b93a2d0dcf43)

[ comparison of 2 similar trading pairs \(2\)](https://preview.redd.it/sjdj7je450e71.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faae583d21a3c3e92784e35c1dadac437257d583)

 \*In low trading volume pairs, you may never get your deal close. And you are more vulnerable to slippages. 

 

### How to Buy and Sell? (Understand order type)

After you find a crypto pair you want to trade with, you will be in the order pages.

There’s 2 type of order you may use for starting trade:

Market Order (Usually shown as Market) : when you place with this order type, your order will be fulfilled almost immediately. The price will be the lowest sold(Ask) price on the orderbook.

Pros : You do not need to wait for the order to get fulfilled, and it is almost a must to fulfill a deal.

Cons : You do not know what the exact price your order is dealt for, and you may pay a small commission for using market order.

&amp;#x200B;

[Market Order](https://preview.redd.it/wfl2pui850e71.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10ef79d27773dc07e643c91247c9f7afcad0781d)

 

Limit Order (Usually Shown as Limit) : You place an order with a price limit to buy or sell. The order will only be executed when the price level reaches the number you set.

Pros : You don’t need to pay for commission, and you can save some money or get a better deal if you know what you are doing.

Cons : Your order may never get fulfilled. Your order may be a signal for other traders.  
\* If you don’t know what it means, don’t worry about it. We will explain later.

[Limit Order](https://preview.redd.it/4q87y4ha50e71.png?width=317&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e7efcb7e1646383c9554fa310257d4fc1f54762)

I will suggest to play with both types of order by yourself. You can place some small order and understand how it is done.

Also, there’s a Stop-limit order you can use. But let’s keep it simple at the moment.

 

### Bitcoin Transfer &amp; Storage

After you purchase Bitcoin,Your bitcoin is actually stored in a wallet pool controlled by exchanges. Technically exchanges can do anything with your asset without your notice.

So, if you decide to hold it and are not going to trade for some time. (e.g 1 month or longer). It could be a good idea to transfer your bitcoin to a Cold wallet. (Which is totally control by yourself)

\*coldwallet in English : a USB like hardware for storing your bitcoin offline.

Also, all the exchanges have the possibility of being hacked and seized by the government. This is also a good reason to keep bitcoin by yourself.

You can find a cold wallet for you with below guide from bitcoin.org

[https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet)

 

## Understand Bitcoin Market

Next step, we are going to talk about what drives bitcoin prices, and some common factors behind it.

### How bitcoin’s price is made

Why are people trading bitcoin with a 60k prices? 

The answer is consensus of bitcoin users,  but wait… What is consensus?

To simplify the explanation, bitcoin’s consensus is how much people are willing to pay for it.

The “people” are not specified for anyone, it could be me, you or elon.

Here’s an example, let’s say you have created a Crypto called Loser Coin. Unfortunately due to technical reasons you can only issue one loser coin. And due to poor marketing you have only me as the Loser Coin follower.

So in this case, can you tell me what’s the price for a loser coin? 

It depends on 2 things :

* How much you want to sell me
* How much i am willing to pay you

Assume I am willing to pay no more than 15 usd, and you want to sell it at least for 5 usd. After a few rounds of bargain, we agreed the coin will be dealt at 10usd. 10usd will be the “market” price for the loser coin at the moment.

Later, I persuaded my dad to take the Loser Coin at 100 usd. My dad took it because I am the only child he got. And now the Market price is 100 usd per loser coin.

This is a simple model to show how the price is made in crypto space.

And below we are going to make it a bit more complicated, and introduce more real world factors that can have an impact on prices.

 

### Supply &amp; Demand

From law of supply and demand :  
1) When there’s more supply than demand, prices will drop, and fewer supply will be there in the future.

2) When there’s more demand than supply, prices will increase, and more supply will be there in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

[supply and demand](https://preview.redd.it/rphu49bf50e71.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97c035f3024d934617af70778f0985437a8b5454)

But what is the supply and what is the demand in the bitcoin market?

We can use a simple model to illustrate it roughly.

Supply =  Bitcoin Reserved in Exchanges,

Demand = Stablecoin Reserved in Exchanges

When you see there’s more stablecoin came in, and less bitcoin reserved in the exchange. You can say there’s more demand than supply. And vice versa.

[ stablecoin reversed in exchange from cryptoquant ](https://preview.redd.it/q0e7c4sh50e71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82361ff6074b1d24d23ca35c81575c1d1e59e3ad)

However, this is not sufficient to tell where the price will go. And this is a long term indicator, it doesn’t mean anything in a short time frame. 

 

### Mood &amp; Momentum

There’s always people in the market making decision by their mood. 

For example :

“I feel this can go to moon.”  
“The price is too high now, i have to run before it crash.”

These are common emotional thinking that can happen to anyone. And they will let you take some deal you originally doesn’t plan to.

When a lot of people think like this, the trend will reinforce itself. And make the price going up or down volatile.

Mood and Momentum is short term factors, which can last from hours to days. And the price movement caused by it could be corrected in minutes.

 

### Policy &amp; Regulations

When there’s new laws or regulation comes out, crypto will usually get hits. Below are some common events you could find:

1. Exchanges Crackdown
2. Mining Activity Suspension
3. Illegalize Bitcoin Holding
4. Ban on some products (Contract,ICO etc..)
5. Tax Related

The policy impact on bitcoin price could be long term, although people may over react at the first place. Then overlook it in the long term.

### Bitcoin Adoption Rate

Adoption rate refer to user bases of Bitcoin and infrastructure around bitcoin.

Userbases including factors like : User counts, Users Role (is there company or government using it), how sticky are these users etc…

And for infrastructure including things like : Bitcoin ATM, Coldwallet, Paypal, Square integration etc..

The more people and organization is using bitcoin, the higher possibility you can find someone willing to trade bitcoin with higher price.

## Choose your trading strategies

Below are some easy but working strategy you can use for your first few trades.

### Buy and Hold

Buy and hold means you purchase bitcoin at a price level and hold it for a longtime. In order to profit from this strategy, you need to set a entry price and exit price.

You will not need to trade bitcoin before price reach your entry level, and once price reaches the exit level, you can then sell it off.

For example, you set an entry of 29,000USD and exit of 35,000USD. This will make you profit of 6,000 USD 

Remember you need to set entry and exit at a reasonable level based on your understanding of the market. 

### Trend Following

In order to follow the trend and make profit by trading bitcoin, you need to understand what’s the reason cause the trend. And you probably need to leave once the market fully digest that reason.

And it will be better if you can use tools to track the trend. 

Google Trend will be quite handy for this task.

And lastly you probably need to have a stop-loss mechanism.  
For example : if price go down x% in a period of time, you will sell the asset you hold.

### Buy the dips

Buy the dips is the opposite side of trend following. You will entry when the market is crashing. But please do remember, the lower price you buy the higher potential profit there could be.

You don’t have to all in whenever you see a crash is coming, you can put your money gradually into buy order.

For example : Bitcoin drop from 40k to 30k, and you have 10000USD in hand.

You can do like this :

1. Open position with 2000USD(Bitcoin), when price drop to 37k.
2. Buy 3000USD (Bitcoin), when price drop to 35k.
3. Buy with the rest of 5000USD(Bitcoin), when price drop to 33k.

Please do control you buy size of each entry, since you will never know where the price can go.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid in Bitcoin Trading

* Do not have your own judgement  
You need to make decision always by yourself, if you listen to a friend’s or trading guru’s advice, you could lost everything when they want to do something bad to you.
* FOMO in  
When you have a feeling like,  
“if i am not trading right now, i will lost the opportunity forever”  
It will be better for you take a rest. Forget about the whole thing and come back later.

* Borrow money to buy bitcoin  
When you facing the pressure of repaying the debt you probably have to force yourself to sell all the position you are holding. Even it’s in a bad market condition.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ahcah6hm50e71.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a066ba049236b04aa158c910624245728a3e7aa

* Buy derivatives you don’t fully understand  
Derivatives including Options, Swap Contract, Future Contract, when you are buying these products you will actually lose your Coin. And you cannot cover the loss by just waiting. (While if you are buying Spot product, you can just sit and wait until the errors solved)  
Please do avoid derivatives before you fully understand them.

## Did I missed anything?

Now i’d be like to hear from you:

Are you going to hold bitcoin or trade it frequently?

And is there anything missing in the guide?

I've read many posts on this subreddit and had long conversations with friends who are more deeply invested in BTC than myself, and I persistently get held up on one issue.  I'm hoping you can help me see things more clearly.

First, a few things about me.  I own a very small amount of BTC.  I'm not a basher or FUD guy, I genuinely want to learn and gain more comfort around crypto and BTC.  

From my reading and conversations thus far, the two most prevalent discussed outcomes for BTC are 1) it becomes the best store of value to date, and 2) it becomes the preferred global currency.  No one can predict the future with 100% certainty, but I am not too close minded to think that either could occur.

Generally speaking, from my studies of economics and work in finance (I don't consider myself an expert by any stretch of the imagination), I've found a few assumptions to hold true in monetary systems/economies/societies:

1) People will act in their own self interest

2) A certain amount of wealth inequality is inevitable (the degree varies widely based on circumstances &amp; policies, yet the assumption holds true)

3) Without intervention, wealth inequality becomes more unequal over time because it is easier to acquire money and wealth the more money and wealth you have.

4) Booms and busts are a natural cycle of economies that allow for debt and capital investment.  Debt and capital investments are not inherently a bad thing.

5) Traditionally, the governments and central banks have the ability to combat (3) and lessen the negative effects felt by (4)'s busts through policies that can have effects on the distribution of wealth over time (taxes), as well as increasing supply and targeted spending.  PLEASE NOTE: I am in no way suggesting that our current governments/banks or any governments in my lifetime have done so perfectly, responsibly, or even effectively.  However, if managed properly, they are and can be powerful tools in our tool box.

Though experiment/ The Issue: 

For purposes of this thought experiment, I'm hoping to confine the discussion to the latter ""global currency"" scenario.  Let's take it to the furthest end of the spectrum where BTC is the preferred global currency and renders national fiat currencies relatively useless, or eliminates the need for them entirely. 

Given my listed assumptions, I worry that the limited and finite supply of BTC leaves us with no tools to combat the inevitable extreme wealth inequality that will persist, essentially painting ourselves into a corner with no means to remedy the situation.  Is there an aspect of BTC that I'm not seeing that remedies assumptions #3 and #4 above?  If a deep recession or depression occurs, do we just let the fire burn out of control until it dies, and rebuild from the ashes? What tools does BTC provide? 

Thank you in advance for helping me think through this.  What am I missing?",1627497713,11,1

otqdog,Jeremy625,Bitcoin needs a more efficient on-chain transaction solution.,"Don’t get me wrong, I am fully bullish on Bitcoin, but since Bitcoin is going to be the future currency of the world, the blockchain needs to keep up. The current transaction speed is about ~5 TPS, and with many people starting to adopt Bitcoin, this is too low.

I know that lightning network exists and all, and it’s a really good idea, but it needs better implementation as it’s been out for a while already. Or an on-chain improvement may not even be necessary if lightning will be easier for the average person to use. I’ve been doing Bitcoin for ~3 years now, and wallets have been slow to adopt lightning. If wallet adoption with lightning is more widespread, people will stop making fun of Bitcoin being old and slow (not from me). 

I run my own lightning node, and it’s a peace of mind I’m running my own “bank” in my living room, but for the average person to do this, it’s not economical. I know some wallets with a limited selection provide this functionality built in, but majority do not and make it difficult for average person to understand.

Take it from me I’m really bullish on Bitcoin and will continue to Hodl until it become accepted worldwide, but some improvements can be made to make it much better for everyone to use. I’m not talking a hard fork of the blockchain, just a soft-fork to make some things more efficient.",1627532678,9,1

ou8f9j,Ok_Department_9565,Michael Saylor confirms that MicroStrategy will continue to acquire bitcoin moving forward. This is the least surprising news of the day.," 

Business intelligence company MicroStrategy will continue investing in its “digital asset strategy,” the company’s CEO Michael Saylor said in its Q2 [earnings announcement](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/investor-relations/press/microstrategy-announces-second-quarter-2021-financial-results) Thursday.

* Saylor noted that the Tysons Corner, Va.-based company’s latest [funding](https://www.coindesk.com/capital-group-international-investors-microstrategy-bitcoin-exposure) had allowed the firm to increase its digital holdings to more than 105,000 bitcoins.
* “We continue to be pleased by the results of the implementation of our digital asset strategy,” he said, adding that “going forward, we intend to continue to deploy additional capital into our digital asset strategy.”
* The software firm has been purchasing enormous amounts of [bitcoin](https://finance.yahoo.com/price/bitcoin) since last August that it keeps in its treasury reserve.
* The non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) calculation of the market value of MicroStrategy’s current bitcoin holdings as of June 30 was $3.653 billion, reflecting bitcoin’s market price of $34,763 at the time. The non-GAAP digital asset cost basis was $2.741 billion or $26,080 per bitcoin.
* MicroStrategy reported $125.4 million in revenue for the quarter, a 13.4% increase over its performance for the same period a year ago.
* Shares of MicroStrategy were down 2.2% to $611.48 in after-hours trading Thursday following the release of its results.

oulx9m,sikeig,A security guide to keep your Bitcoins safe,"**General advice:** 
Don’t ever mention the amount of Bitcoin you hold. Never show or talk about how you store and secure your Bitcoins.

Even the FBI warns of the influx of cyber criminals that want steal your Bitcoins: https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/07/14/the-fbi-has-issued-a-serious-bitcoin-and-crypto-alert-warning/

**Exchanges:**

• Use a reputable exchange that has been a around for multiple years (make sure they follow your country’s regulations)

• Create a new email that you only use for the exchange

• Take all security measures possible (enable 2FA, whitelist your wallet addresses)

• Never hold any funds on exchanges long term; remember not your keys not your coins

**Email**

I would recommend email providers that use encryption but as long as it’s a reputable email provider that can enable 2FA it will do the job.

Trusted, private and free to use email providers that I would recommend are [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com) and [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com).

• Enable two factor authentication (This is more important than on exchanges)

• Use the email especially for the exchange; don’t use any keywords or personal information as the email name

• Be aware of phishing mails, always check the actual email adress of the sender (most exchanges verify emails on-site/in-app)

• Every few months you should check on [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com) if your email was victim to a database breach

**Passwords:**

• Don’t reuse a password; use a unique and long password that includes letters, numbers and special characters (Randomize it, don’t use any crypto keywords or any personal information)

• Your phone PIN is a password too, use a complicated and non guessable set of numbers 

• The use of a secure password manager is recommended (Don’t use a browser integrated manager)

The most trusted password manager that uses encryption and is open source is [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com).

**2 factor authentication / 2FA:**

• Enable it on everything possible ( Social media, emails, exchanges banks etc.)

• NEVER use 2FA SMS, ALWAYS use 2FA apps ([Sim swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam) attacks are more common than people think)

• Save the backup 2FA codes to your accounts, write them down on a piece of paper

**Wallets:**

Hardware/Cold wallets will always be the most secure method of storing Bitcoin. The most trusted hardware wallet providers are: [COLDCARD](https://coldcardwallet.com/), [BitBox (shiftcrypto)](https://shiftcrypto.ch/), [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com) and [Trezor](https://trezor.io/).

• Always order directly trough the official website, don’t use any third party retailers

• Request the deletion of your customer from their database (Ledger experienced a data breach in the past)

• Store your private key ONLY offline, never type it in anywhere except your hardware wallet

**Your private key is the most valuable string of text in this whole scenario. Only you should know it. Treat it like top secret classified information.**

**Private Key Backup**

You should always have a physical offline backup of your private key. It should be water, fire and earthquake resistant. 

Here is a good review of a variety of metal backup options: https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/

• Store your backup somewhere securely; It shouldn’t be found in case of a home invasion

• Bank deposit boxes are not recommended since they can be seized by law enforcement

• Splitting up your private key isn’t recommended either since it doesn’t increase security by 50% (Keep in mind most Bitcoin are lost due to the private key being lost, don’t make it more complicated than necessary)

• Memorizing your private key is a rarely used but good way to ensure the recovery of your funds under all physical circumstances (Don’t completely rely on this method it should just be used as additional security)",1627656133,1,1

Call Senators Sinema and Portman at 517-200-9518 and tell them to drop the cryptocurrency provision.","In the 11th hour, the Senate has [snuck](https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/coindesk-podcast-network/dangerous-28b-crypto-provision-infrastructure-bill) in an infrastructure bill provision that would dramatically expand financial surveillance of the crypto-economy. Policies that impact basic freedom and the future of the Internet should be debated carefully and should never be attached to must-pass bills.

As lead negotiators for their respective parties, it is critical that we strongly urge Senator Kyrsten Sinema and Senator Rob Portman to remove this vastly overreaching provision from the infrastructure bill as soon as possible. The Senate votes on this tomorrow, so we have to move fast!

**The most important thing you can do is to call their DC offices at 517-200-9518. We'll connect you to their offices and guide you through the process.**

**When a staff member answers, tell them:**

**“Hi, I’m calling to ask that you remove the cryptocurrency provision from the infrastructure bill. This provision would dramatically expand financial surveillance, harm innovation, and undermine human rights.

oul666,_kr_saurabh,Best Way To Research Bitcoin,"The bitcoin industry is an industry unlike any other.  There is a multitude of reasons why a person may want to invest in this market.  A few of those reasons might be for the technology, freedom, cheaper remittances, making money and much more.  As with most things in life, you will often find that the strongest motivator is caused by making money, which is also the case with bitcoin.  A large portion of the people in this industry are hoping to make profits that can eventually change their lives, and the great thing is that this is very possible with bitcoin.  Not only is it very possible, but I would argue that it is very likely.  While this may sound like a perfect scenario, there are still negatives that come along with this situation.  A shockingly large amount of people want instant gratification, and by that I mean they want the money as fast as they can get it; not caring about the process it takes to obtain those gains.  After you have been investing in bitcoin for quite a while, you will begin to see many of the same patterns.  History doesn't repeat, but it sure does seem to rhyme quite often.  The most dangerous or perhaps riskiest part of investing in bitcoin is the investor.  They are their own biggest weakness and get in the way of their success.  Not realizing it takes hundreds of hours of research or studying before you can even attempt to say that you know what bitcoin is. 

Today I will be going through the things that I did in the past, and continue to do up until now to stay on top of my toes in the bitcoin world.  All of which helps to give me the largest chance of success. 

But, before we talk about the things that I would recommend you to do, I think that it is perhaps even more essential to talk about the things that you shouldn't do.  As I mentioned above, most of the harm comes into play by someone taking the wrong actions.  If you can prevent yourself from doing those actions, you have just won half of the batter.

The most crucial advice I can give is to never take all your information and make opinions from just one source.  This is for all sources, but I would stress this fact even more from YouTube influencers. You always need to be aware that sources most likely have their motives.  It could be that they are getting paid by the coin founders to shill the coin.  It could be that they already have a large portfolio of said coin and are hoping to do a pump and dump.  It could be that they have biased opinions about their sponsors.  Or it could be that they are willing to say just about anything to have you sign up for their paid group.  There are a few good cryptocurrency YouTubers out there, but much less than you would think.  The shocking thing is how little some of the most popular channels know about cryptocurrency.  Just because they have a large channel, doesn't mean they know what they're talking about.  Be careful out there.

Taking all your information in from one source can make you quite biased and miss opportunities.  I always call myself somewhat of an ""open-minded bitcoin maximalist.""  While most bitcoin maxi can be closed-minded and swear off anything that isn't bitcoin.  I choose to be open-minded and always be on the lookout for new opportunities.  While 99% of the time I conclude that bitcoin is better and I would rather just invest in that.  If you only watch Defi YouTubers, then all you will know is Defi.  The same goes for bitcoin only content; you would only know bitcoin and nothing else.  While I will be honest that a majority of the content that I do watch is bitcoin only, I do watch/take in other information as well.  It's important to know the entire market to ensure your success. 

Okay, so now we have covered what you shouldn't do.  Now let's talk about what things that you can do to become knowledgeable, and prevent mistakes.  These are things that I do or have done and have helped me immensely.  It is by no means a perfect list, and there will be things missing that could help you a great deal as well.  But I do believe it is a good starter list.

Read the bitcoin white paper.  This might seem like a boring or basic choice to some, but it's essential to begin to understand bitcoin, its goal and what it hopes to achieve.  We have come a long way since then, but it still is the starer place that I would recommend to begin with.

After that, there are a variety of books that I would recommend reading.  Some of these books deal only with bitcoin, and others deal with finance.  For me, learning about bitcoin is extremely important.  But it is also very important to change your thinking about how finance and the world work as well to understand why it is so important.  You need to begin having a bitcoin mindset.  Books that I have read and found incredibly important in not only my bitcoin journey but also my financial journey have been the following;  The Bitcoin Standard, Rich Dad Poor Dad, The Price of Tomorrow, The Sovereign Individual and many more.  I would argue that these are a great starter guide to not only any bitcoiner but anyone who is wanting to change their life financially as well.  I highly recommend them.

Next, Podcasts.  I am an avid podcast listener.  I would much rather learn and listen to something I am passionate about rather than listening to music.  Just like I mentioned before, be careful not to take all your information from only one source.  Remember these podcasts can be just as biased as you'll find some YouTubers to be, and they can shill just as much.  I will listen to as many podcasts as I can, but at the end of the day, I make my own decisions.  Here are a few that I would recommend and the reason for them.  What Bitcoin Did, while the host isn't technically knowledgable about BTC, he does come at it from a beginner mindset and therefore it's a good point for new people to begin with.  Tales From the Crypt is a bitcoin podcast.  This podcast goes more into the technical and privacy side of things.  While this show is quite biased in the bitcoin maxi side of things, it is a nice option if you want to go more into the deeper side of bitcoin. We Study Billionaires podcast.  While this is a general investing podcast, that as you guessed studies billionaires.  They do have bitcoin featured episodes once a week.  I enjoy this podcast quite a bit.  To keep things balanced, I do listen to an ethereum podcast as well called, Bankless.  Which as you guessed, it covers all things ethereum.  While I enjoy learning about bitcoin the most, I also love learning about the entire market.  

Then we have YouTube.  I watch very little TV but instead find myself watching Youtube, and it almost always has to do with investing in bitcoin, and cryptocurrency.  I tend to think that people who have their channels are either very biased, paid shills or sometimes aren't knowledgeable about what they're talking about.  That is why I stay away from YouTuber's like Bit Boy Crypto, or Chico Crypto, JRNY Crypto or anyone like that.  I prefer channels that are either a daily news channel, interviews, or a learning channel.  For daily news, I like The Modern Investor.  While he can be quite biased or overly bullish; I find it entertaining to watch. Every once in a while we all need our entertainment.  For interviews, I scour all the channels, but I often like the Pomp Podcast channel and his new show The Best Business Show.  While the host is biased to bitcoin and you need to be careful that he is also extremely biased towards his advertisers and wanting to make money, I do find him quite knowledgeable and has good interviews.  As I mentioned above, taking information in from many sources and make your own decisions.

Lastly, using the internet.  This is perhaps my favourite of all of the things to do.  Scouring the internet, reading forums and message boards, reading all the latest information, learning about what is coming in the future.  There is no end to the power that is at your fingertips.  But again, always be careful out there.  One of my favourite news sources is Twitter, following the right users can be an extremely powerful tool.  Of course, I also go to a large number of crypto news sites and am a frequent user of Reddit as well.  If you search long enough, you will find the place that works for you.

As for me, I do everything listed above. There is no right answer that is the perfect way to learn or become successful.  But you will find out more often than not that the people who put in the most time and hours are often the ones that become successful.  In the beginning, I did these things because I wanted to become more knowledgeable about what I was investing in.  But it has since evolved into my greatest passion, and I look forward to doing them each day.  My journey in learning about bitcoin is never-ended, one that I am excited to see where it takes me.  We are on the edge of the greatest wealth transfer we have ever seen, I hope that you are taking the steps to be involved in that transfer.

How about you? What are your favourite ways to learn and research about bitcoin? Which things would you recommend people to avoid?",1627653690,0,1

ouj8ux,thedevilofcourse,I decided to move from Paypal and go towards Bitcoin for my chess coaching. Here's why!,"Exclusively, throughout the years I used to get paid out over via PayPal for my international students, which used to get me a hefty amount of risk. Including Account Limit, the fees and additionally obviously - the withdrawal time.

I travel around a lot, internationally and hence using BTC makes me get away from those hefty ATM Withdrawal fees and or the forex price. I can always use a Bitcoin ATM that I have over on the city I travel to. Sure, there are limited ones but there still are.

Additionally, I always have a backup option to transfer the fund to my bank if no other viable options shows. I can just use LocalCryptos or something similar!?

(Due note, I still earn through cash on some of my projects - mainly being due to the limited checkout options with BTC)

Paypal is a huge gamble for sellers in 2021, even worse than Bitcoin.

Bitcoin also added the ability to market internationally, its quite surprising how easy it is to buy bitcoin at this point throughout the world. A simple app will let it handle everything, no need to worry if you have a Visa Card or not, its a win:win

Any merchant who uses Paypal and sees this - Look at the risks of paypal, including the blatant mishandle of their limitations and ToS, I really urge people to start accepting BTC because it is now thay matters.",1627646439,11,1

Good morning  everyone! I have the daily for BTC pulled up and I can see the cloud is  serving its intended purpose and we are experiencing some troubles  finally escaping the cloud. We saw a rejection back to support (daily  100 EMA) which is pretty common in TA. But can it hold? I would  certainly set a stop loss if you are betting on the bulls. If we do lose  the daily 100 EMA I dont see much in terms of support til that daily 50  MA below us around 35k...  
Now we have a shot  to get a bounce off support. But that depends on how the western  hemisphere reacts as they wake up. Will they still be bullish after  seeing the small pullback to $38,800? I think it really could go either  way so don't leave home without risk management. RSI was pretty high  before the pullback as well so it was not like it was totally  unpredictable.   
Yesterday's close was a  doji and that is considered bearish especially in an uptrend like this.  And also especially when RSI is almost overbought. Those 2 factors can  be blamed for the recent pull back in my opinion. It's not like we are  tumbling back down to Earth or anything but I want you all to be ready.  If we catch a bounce maybe we get out of that pesky cloud. If not we  will likely revisit 34-35k. It may not be exciting folks but that is how  I see it.   
I hope you all enjoy this Friday. WTFDIK???  
TLDR: Slight pull back. Cmon bulls! Wake up!!!

“We’re thrilled that our organization has closed another transaction with Bitcoin. We made the decision in 2018 to start accepting Bitcoin payments, and we are glad that we did, given that consumers see the value and are taking advantage of this payment method.” shared Joe Curtis, COO of Glen Oaks Escrow.

Glen Oaks Escrow accepts Bitcoin payments through BitPay, which acts as the payment processor in the transaction and is used to verify the funds. The escrow company then sends out an invoice to the buyer, similar to wire instructions in a fiat currency transaction.

ocdos2,serhr792,I want to talk about Soros and Bitcoin.,"
I think we need to think about this problem from two aspects.

From a long-term perspective, Soros is quite tiny in front of Bitcoin. He cannot change the work of the blockchain or manipulate the price of Bitcoin forever.

In the short term, it is interesting to analyze this emergency.

In 1997, Thailand's GDP was 150.2 billion U.S. dollars. Almost everyone knows that Soros destroyed the price of the Thai baht by various ways. In other words, in 1997, Soros's money could affect an economy of US$150.2 billion. In 2020, Thailand’s GDP is about 500 billion U.S. dollars, so can Soros probably affect an economy of about 500 billion U.S. dollars? No matter what the answer is，bitcoin's current market value is about 4 trillion U.S. dollars, which seems to be much higher than the price Soros can influence. 

On the other hand, does Soros own Bitcoin? After experiencing a rapid increase in the first half of the year, the price of Bitcoin once exceeded $60,000, but now it is only $30,000. For Soros, this is a good time to buy Bitcoin. At present, many celebrities are optimistic that Bitcoin will break new highs at the end of the year or early next year. Buying Bitcoin at this time is a good choice.

This sounds very logical, but we all know that Soros is an investment master. Maybe he bought Bitcoin a long time ago, and this time just want to use his influence to push the price of Bitcoin to sell again. After all, as I mentioned earlier, many people will think that Soros will choose to buy Bitcoin at this point in time.

I prefer the first of these two possibilities. With Elon Musk as a precedent, Soros should realize that just tweeting or releasing news can no longer affect the price of Bitcoin in a large range. And I also think that Soros, as an old-school financial player, needs to take a certain amount of time to accept Bitcoin. It is unlikely to buy Bitcoin at a very low price before then choose to sell it at this short-term low Bitcoin price. And I think based on Soros’s knowledge of the financial market, if he chooses to sell Bitcoin, he will definitely be close to the high point of the Bitcoin price instead of now.

The conclusion is that I think Soros has discovered the potential of the cryptocurrency market and is ready to study how to buy it.

Please do not sell your bitcoin before its price reach 100000$",1625243334,6,1

Let me tell you something that you already know but that you need to hear again: you’re surprisingly one of the smartest human beings on the planet.

I bought my first BTC in 2014 for $400 and sold it for $500 in 2016, thinking I was a shrewd investor. I was wrong. 

In fact, I was a frustrated investor, thinking that my $400 investment should’ve made much, much more in my speculative investment I had made. Afterall, I was taking on a lot of risk and I’ve held for 2 years without much return, right?…

About a month after I sold my $500 BTC I was scrambling to buy as much $2k BTC as 
I could. Oops, now it’s 5 years later and that $500 BTC would be worth $36k. 

I’ve done well, despite not trading perfectly. You know what I’ve done. I’ve bought more and more all the way up and all the way down since my first market disappointment. Cycle after cycle after cycle.

And you know what? My net worth is way bigger than my Dads. 

The lesson is: you can’t fuck it up. You’re an early adopter, still. Buy BTC, it’s the greatest technological innovation of your lifetime. It could take years to get even, but you’re gonna be okay. 

I’m not shit.

\&gt;""I view bitcoin for what it actually is - the largest charitable movmement in human history. It literally fixes everything. You care about the whales? Not the financial whales - the mammals, the ones in the sea? Well, you donate to Greenpeace or whatever. You want to save the kids? You donate to like the kids charity. But, if you want to just save everything in one fell swoop, who do you donate to? You just donate to bitcoin.  
\&gt;It's one of the very few charities you can donate to who don't take custody of donations, completely decentralised, you get wealthy for donating and you fix the world. Like it's an extremely beautiful thing

\&gt;I like to say I hate saying money is wasted on charities because good charity is never a waste, but the literature shows that at least 40% of money donated to charity goes to overhead. So it's just wasted.

\&gt;The market will allocate capital efficiently. You have a look at how good charity will be once bitcoiners are properly rich for example. The main priority, and I know it's hard and I sound very heartless, but the kids have been starving for 50 years. So you've gotta just, i'm sorry, they've just gotta starve for 5 more years, you focus on bitcoin and bitcoin only and I promise you they won't starve anymore. That's all i'm trying ot say, we're giving moeny and still not fixing the problem and the problems only getting worse. The problem is structural and we're doing symptomatic treatment. Unless the fiat system goes, no charity can be 100% effective

og12wx,psfromjy,Specter Wallet failed to load.,"Hello everyone,

I am fairly new to the space of self-custody. I purchased a coldcard to attempt to take complete custody and learn more about the inner-workings of wallets and how they work.

I was successful in exporting skeleton wallet into specter and created the device, as well as the wallet, where I then transferred about .17 bitcoin over to the addresses on my wallet. Everything was good and all I needed to do was sign the transaction on my device, where I was getting confused and was going to reach out to a buddy for help to guide me through the process, since I dont want to plug my coldcard into my computer and sign it that way.

So I waited about a week, left as is, without signing the transaction on my coldcard. I revisited specter wallet today and now I am having a  trouble loading the the specter wallet I created for my coldcard.

This has me a bit worried, since the bitcoin is on the wallet that is ""failing to load."" hopefully I didnt do something wrong, but believe there might be away to recover this file I need, just not sure.   


Here is what I am seeing on my specter UI:

Bitcoin evangelist has always attributed Bitcoin to be a safe-haven asset, while extreme fanatics believe that Bitcoin is far better than gold. Bitcoin was born in the wake of the 2008 financial crash as a libertarian currency and as an instrument that could help cushion the event of a future financial crisis. 

Since Bitcoin is purely a speculative risk asset, many people have doubted its position as a purported safe-haven asset, I am not one of them anyways. However, since Bitcoin hasn't witnessed a global recession yet, I feel Bitcoin hasn't sufficiently defended its narrative as a safe-haven asset. 

As the possibility of a global recession intensifies, what's your take on the possible performance of Bitcoin? will it go down with the traditional market or will it defend its name? I am very much interested to know.",1625121235,9,1

obf7ae,Seddyx,A 3-fold question on compressed addresses,"Hi there, I recently got into managing my own keys and have some questions regarding the compressed versions of public keys (and therefore private keys).

1) So to test it out I made a paper wallet using a generator website. I sent a very low amount to my compressed address and then to my uncompressed address. I expected when I explore the blockchain either address of the two will show both amounts. My logic here was that both addresses lead to the same place but I quickly found out that each address displayed it's own balance. This is my first question - what's the point even of these compressed addresses? I know about how each transaction should be under a brand new address but that's kind of another thing. Is the compression really just so that there are more addresses out there and there is no random address collision - I don't get it.

2) So I also found that my private key doesn't work with both addresses (compressed and uncompressed) and I had to use a compressed priv key for my compressed address and uncompressed one for the uncompressed address respectively. This also confuses me immensely - why? Aren't they same the address? I guess the answer to my first question might explain also this one .

3) Can I somehow now move the amounts from both addresses (I do have the keys/control over them) at the same time for the same fee? I am trying to explore Exodus to control my keys and I can in theory move them but each transaction would cost me a separate network fee which will gut these two as they both have such little amounts in them. A follow-up on this same question - I also tested sending 3-4 small transactions to my Exodus wallet but each time I was using a separate address. Does this mean that if I ever want to get ALL of these out of there and to another wallet Exodus will treat each address separately and would the network charge me a network fee for moving the funds from each wallet or does Exodus handle this in a special way where the same (and hopefully smaller) fee is applied for moving the funds from 3-4 separate addresses to a new one?

Thanks so much for reading my questions, I hope I didn't lay it out very confusing.",1625117973,6,1

Someone told me not long ago: Bitcoin is a dangerous game. It is even possible for some people or groups to take over the blockchain through a majority and destroy the entire mechanism. People don't know they are playing these games.

For a long time buying Google at a high price, Amazon and Apple are both good choices for me.

Yes, there are a lot of stocks there, there are also cryptocurrencies, there are also many bonds and debt instruments.
In the US, there are obviously 9,600 mutual funds (quick Google search). The question is, which of the thousands is worth buying.

Just because some or many of the available options are not good investments, it does not mean that the entire asset class is bad.

The prosperity of encryption technology is just like the technological prosperity. They have got a lot of IPOs because of various stupid ideas. Most of these technology companies are stupid and not worth it.
Nowadays, there are many ICOs, most of them are stupid and not worth it.

However, there are still opportunities to realize value.

Also about digital assets. Digital assets have become a reality.

I have been receiving some very strange and random spam texts lately.  Kind of feels like Crimea before the invasion, not that we're about to be invaded of course.  Some of these are just nonsensical URLs that don't even look valid.  I looked up the owner of one of them.

https://www.facebook.com/campaignsyay

“campaigns R us”.  They have quite the Facebook page.  Just an address for a vacant office building in Arizona close to the service through which they anonymously registered the domain.

And two posts on this page.  One with a picture of a lady getting a massage with the caption, “Have you gotten your massage lately?” And another that just said “Don’t let your elph do this in the off season.”  Both posted on the same day Trump was inaugurated.  Very weird but I was like, all right.  Made no sense.

Then, the next day, the massage parlor shootings in Atlanta happened.  Saint Patrick’s Day.  Quite the coincidence.  I looked up what elph could mean, and I found this urban dictionary definition from a kind Internet user, also named elph.

https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=elph

one of the only people in the world who knows what theyre doing.

amazing
confident
and theres only one elph in the world. elph records
if theres ever anything wrong or happened with no one around then its elph.
by elph May 28, 2008

Year I graduated college.  Only to live out of my car.  Nine days after my birthday.  Elph defines elph.  Ape shall not kill ape.

I think it may be related to all these UFO sighting by the military lately.  Call me crazy.

One easy way to find out for sure.  Make an outrageous claim on a public platform that should be easily invalidated.  Just whoever owns the Satoshi wallets.  Call me an impostor on the blockchain like they did for Craig Wright.  I began realizing all this a bit after I remembered I mined a bunch of BTC back around 2010, crashed my computer, and forgot about it until now.  Practically repressed it, going back to the immigrant experience thing.  Like I'm not supposed to ever be anything.  Not what life is supposed to be about.

But then, the beauty of it.  I took an anagram of Satoshi Nakamoto.  Soho antimask Tao.  No one was talking about antimask stuff back in '09.  Tao, on the other hand, people have been talking about for a while.  And we all know Soho is where people go for the latest fashions.

So basically I'm thinking I might invent a time traveling modem one day based on a solution to unified field theory I've been cooking up.  The seven Millenium Prize problems.  The seven seals.  New name presented to me on a white stone known only to me.  Time will tell.  Literally.  Can you think of a better way to even the playing field?  So we don't destroy ourselves first.  He did say he did the whole thing backwards.

I emailed John McAfee for advice on this and on my lost Bitcoin.  The next morning he hanged himself.  Co-inki-dink?  You know what Peter Thiel says.  Everyone is full of shit.  Big or small.  And competition is for losers.  Lao Tzu the Old Master has said as much too.  It's like how Wall St execs used to trade based off of astrology magazines delivered to them in a brown paper bags instead of formal analysis because it tended to produce more accurate predictions.  Or how Putin, probably the world's biggest whale, has said he's deeply religious but doesn't like to talk about it because it's like a ""political striptease"" according to him.

All this time.  Still no one knows who Nakamoto is or what even Bitcoin really is beyond the white paper.  I think it might be a visual pun for unified field theory.  Waiting on NASA to get back to me (ha).",1625114312,24,1

My goal is to ruin scammers fraud activities that affecting us Freelancers and making our proffesion harder than ever before! 

Scammers: Toby Laurie, Tomasz Nowaczyk 

Scam company: Agra wood Polska

I was literaly one step before loosing money (unfortunetley they do have my ID and adress as I was blinded enough with their legit scam and signed on their scam bitcoin website).

Update on their scaming organization:

I was approached via Upwork platform as I am freelancing with them. The guy's who send me a proposal is Toby Laurie. This time it is about a polish company ""Agra Wood Poland"". (My research showed that this is their another scam as there are freelancers being approached by them, only using different names via LinkedIn)   Ha! Funny enough I am Polish based in UK, so I did a research and the company acctually exisist, so the whole thing seemed to be legit! He even passed me to talk details with a CEO of the company Tomasz Nowaczyk (which funny enough it is a real person and registerd as CEO of the fellow company in Polish FCA). ... I must admit they are on top of their game stilling people's identity or creating a content for a perfect scam.

Here it is the proposal (entry to scam you) I copied form Upwork posted by Toby Laurie:

""We are a Polish manufacturing company. We manufacture wooden pallets. Our product is in great demand in the B2B market. But we want to grow even more and capture new markets, for this we need a new visual shell. First, we need to draw a logo, we do not yet have a clear vision of what we want, but we have a clear idea and positioning of our company, so I think this is even better than just pictures. I will consider vacancies for a designer of any level, since in my opinion sometimes you should look at a business under a new, not spammed look. Therefore, if you are a hardworking and responsible designer. We will be glad to work with you.""

[https://www.upwork.com/ab/proposals/1399460237845106688](https://www.upwork.com/ab/proposals/1399460237845106688)

It is very disturbing as they seem to expand their ""business"" to the platforms that I thought would be safe for us freelancers. 

Now looking back I can see I've ignored so many red flags. After finding other frelancers posts I noticed they have the same pattern for approach, wich is a Frellance platform, than taking you to Telegram climing that is the only trust worth platform to comunicate to have long negotiations and consulations (erning trust), being so professional at all times (masters!), they will waste your time on creating contracts and questionaries to finally offer you a 10.000 euro for a logo and brand identity, and of course payment in bitcoin only. The only thing that might vairy is the country of the ""business"" and names of people involved in this.

Until the first main part everything seemed to be perfect. Contract was signed, the qestionaries explained and briefs sent. Basicly the payment was the only last step before kicking off with the project. 

I provided them with my BTC wallet and this is where things became shady.

I should of stop in the moment when Tomasz said he has limitations on withdrawing BTC to external wallets, so in order to proceed with the project I have to sign with [posbit.io](https://posbit.io/)(do not ever do it-its a scam). I did it and day after I gegreted it bit time!

This website is well done. I had to ask for help my friend who is trading cryptocurrency full time to verify them as there is almost nothing online. That moment I found out they are nowhere to be registered in FCA in UK and he never came accross them, which is obviously so odd if you are a real business!! 

To get y'all a bit more familiar with a fake trading crypto site, this what happens:

When you try to withdraw BTC they will tell you to trade it through their ""trusted exchange sites"" such as payeer or bestchange-please don't. They are fakes and will always ask you to put money in first in order to trade their fake bitcoin, to simply collect the missing puzzels and collect all your personal data (as they already have your ID and adress, da...).

 Let me paste the message from their ""support memeber"":

""Greetings! Our System has no commission for Withdrawal, and also performs fast transactions. However, it does not support fiat currencies, but only provides access to the work of these cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, USDT and Ethereum. In order to withdraw funds to a Bank Account or PayPal, you can, for example, use an online exchanger (you can find it here Bestchange.com) or a multi-currency Wallet (for example, Payeer.com). You need to use Withdraw Tab, where you need to specify an External Bitcoin Wallet (exchanger Wallet or your External Bitcoin Wallet). By withdrawing funds to an External Wallet in any way that we wrote about above, you can Withdraw your BTC to USD.""

And if you will try to tranfer a bitcoin to your external wallet (where real bitcoins are) they will pull out this thing with you having only 95/100 points on their website and in order to withdraw money you have to deposit 0,025 btc (another attempt to steal your credit card details to have a full set needed to trade your identity). Without this last missing puzzle they can't do much. However you still want to prevent the worse just incase and report a fraud with the gov insitutions in your country. Also just to be extra safe I would advice you to put an allert on your credit score apps to prevent a hacking attacks traight away. 

Quoted message from their ""support"" when asked how can I connect my trusted external wallet to reansfer BTC:

""Thanks for your waiting. We apologize for the delay in replying. Your account has been successfully verified, however according to clause 12.1 of our Terms &amp; Conditions, the System uses a scoring model for assessing the security quality of the User's account based on more than 170 internal and external publicly available behavior parameters, technical data and other internal corporate metrics. The maximum possible score for the security of the User's account is 100 points. Your account's security quality score is 95/100, which means that you have almost the maximum level. However, according to clause 12.3. of our User Agreement: ""Wallets whose balances have reached at least once the amount 0.15 BTC (or the same value in other currencies) can Transfer Funds from Posbit Account into an External Account and Internal Addresses only with an account security level of 100 (security level is an internal scoring model for assessing the security quality of Posbit system accounts)"".

I was lucky enough to step back from it in last minute but I know many of my fellow freelance designers weren't lucky enough and lost money with them identity thiefs...

Now I am on the process reporting a crypto fraud and hopping that my adress and ID won't be affected. However I will probably spend extra time making sure that it won't happen..

Dear Guys, I know it is tempting to get such a great deal from someone aspecialy during this unconvinient times and it is so easy to go with the flow as the great opportunity was offered, but please think and research a person/business three times before you find yourself in the corner!

Always ask second opinion, make sure your potential client is willing do zoom video chats and they have no problem with payments to your trusted wallets, a specially if you are taking payments with BTC.

Stay creative! Stay safe!

oo4x17,ZypherBro,What can we learn from catastrophe theory?,"Many people are chartists and chase trends. When too many chartists take part in the market, its often time to take profits (hence the cliche: when your cab driver starts talking about bitcoin, its time to sell). This is what initializes market corrections like the one we have seen. Fundamentalists start taking profits, and so the trends start reverting, and the chartists then exit the market, and so we get a correction. When fundamentalists start considering the asset underpriced again, they will re-enter. And once trend reversal is confirmed, the chartists start stepping back in. Rinse and repeat. Check out this paper by Zeeman (1974): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304406874900342 . You can read it without any deep insight to mathematics. I highly recommend this paper. It is a beautiful paper imho.

I guess the takeaway is that now is a good time to start investing in BTC through DCA. You stop your DCA scheme when trend is reversed to the upside and price steps back above your average price. Then you just hold for a while, and then you start taking profits gradually as things get more heated. Dont make the mistake of not taking profits along the way. You can use the profits that you now keep in cash to reinvest in the next correction. Not financial advice by the way…",1626796770,0,1

So I’ve been holding coin since Jan 2021 but I didn’t get into any BTC until it’s recent dip to $32k (it’s actually back in the $20’s as I write this) but that’s not what my post is about. I’ve been investing in general long enough to not panic during market fluctuations.

Anyhow, I’m in the US and I’ve been reading some stuff about the Biden administration, regulations regarding carbon footprints, govt fear of crypto, etc. It talks about the digital dollar which is the same direction yen &amp; the euro are going in but more important it talks about the strangulation by regulation of BTC. Kind of similar to how the govt punishes car manufacturers for not meeting certain emissions standards. Now considering there’s $21 mil BTC and less than $3 mil remaining to be mined, would it even matter at this point? My thinking would be it’s more than 3/4 mined and if it became more expensive to mine the remainder that would be a good thing for driving value up, if anything. Am I wrong there? 

My real question is, do you think a single or multiple government regulations by this and other countries could cripple the value or future values of BTC? Isn’t it the peoples currency?",1626795493,15,1

He works in tech (i didn’t ask the specifics) and was traveling to the city with coworkers to (i think) celebrate something that happened at work related to crypto and bitcoin. I just wanted to ask some people more informed than I if the things he said were true.

basically the gist was that right now, everybody that’s well off and has disposable income is investing in bitcoin because it’s going to be the next big thing. and they really really don’t want normal joes like me to come to this realization and invest (thereby taking their potential gains). he mentioned something vague about tying bitcoin to the american dollar that went right over my head. 

he went on to tell me every week when i get paid, invest whatever you have into their stock and absolutely do not touch it. “just forget about it” is what he said. his passion for bitcoin was readily apparent in how he spoke of it and part of the reason he was so convincing. 

he didn’t hard sell me too much on it, just the basics really. he was really pleasant and left a good tip. i don’t see any constructive reason for him to lie to a complete stranger.... but he is a stranger so here i am —asking for second opinions (from more strangers on the internet) lol.

i do have money i don’t need right now that i could potentially invest and “just forget about it”. but still you never know. also i know very little about crypto so if this is common knowledge in this sub i apologize.",1626795228,14,1

Hi Everyone, newbie here. There’s something I’m struggling to properly understand, if any of you could guide my thinking that’d be great. Here goes:

Nobody knows the fundamental value of bitcoin yet, so market moves on speculation. Everyone says that market is being manipulated by whales – they make the price go down, small investors panic and sell, and whales buy more at downward-moving prices. But, ultimately, when the whales have had their fill, how do they make the market go up again? Is it by just spreading hopeful news and hoping there is enough trade between whatever small investors are left in the game, to drive the prices up? Or is it by starting to sell from their own stash and hoping small investors pick it up at upward-moving prices now?

If it’s the latter, what’s the catch? Let’s say they bought 1 coin at 50K, 40K and 30K each earlier. Now thy sell 1 at 30K, 40K, 50K each? Or maybe 31K, 41K and 51K, if they play it well? But is that it? Marginal profits? Where are the big gains?

Where am I wrong?

Some of you may not know about Fibonacci ratios but that's ok. I will not overcomplicate this post and you don't need to be a TA expert to understand it.

Suffice to say, these ratios, particularly what's referred to as the golden ratio (1.618), aren't limited to TA, but ubiquitous in all nature and cosmos.

Fans of The Da Vinci Code will remember Professor Langton explaining how mathematics and art collide via the 'golden ratio.'

The golden ratio is sometimes called the ""divine proportion,"" because of its frequency in the natural world. Space-time itself is defined by this mathematical constant. Naturally, we humans, are somehow programmed to act in accordance with this ratio in everything we do.

**Golden Ratio in Bitcoin**

Bitcoin's price action right now is following the exact same pattern that it did in 2013 and 2017. Let's take a look. These charts are very easy to follow,

[First big run, new ATH and correction to 1.618 \(2011-2013\)](https://preview.redd.it/btz4233otdc71.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e202930c48f7ed3ac3e6a9c200fe3b47e3960f2)

[Same pattern \(2013-2017\)](https://preview.redd.it/0a89pscutdc71.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcf184dc809a8695e9202ff0749e9f92233ca02)

[Unerringly rhythmical \(2017-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/w443ztdxtdc71.png?width=1559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff4d1b5aeb6c793e396a177e9b95959452859c58)

When Steve Wozniak called Bitcoin a mathematical miracle, he wasn't kidding. Whatever makes the price action so unerringly rhythmical this way between halving cycles can be empirically analyzed by humans similar to the patterns in nature but never fully understood.

It once again begs the question if Mathematics was invented or discovered.

I was already super excited 3 years ago to observe whether the same pattern would play out again. To see it play out exactly the same way (so far) is nothing short of spine-chilling.

You can check out the two pinned posts on my profile.

In February 2018, when everyone was panicking, I pointed out that we would go back to 19k and beyond in the next cycle.

Back then, I hadn't yet analyzed the price action this closely but I knew the quadrennial cycles.

Then in December last year, I called for $100k before the end of 2021 which I still stand by.

Similar to my prediction in 2018, I understand that this may be too optimistic to imagine right at this moment.

In my personal opinion, it's very likely that 29k turns out to be the bottom for this correction phase.

But you should of course DYOR.",1626793314,181,1

oo2u8a,PhrygianGorilla,"I've been learning about crypto for about 6 months, is this a good description for what bitcoin is as a whole? Am I missing anything?","Bitcoin is a distributed ledger that is split into blocks which are sent to nodes who save it and store it. Each block is simply a bunch of transactions from wallets. A block is generated every 10 minutes by miners who perform hash functions to achieve the target difficulty. 

When the block is hashed by the miners it uses sha-256 encryption which is a 1 way cryptographic function which turns any length of data into a 64 digit hash key (256 bits). The hash of the previous block is also included in the header of the current block to allow you to go back and verify the order of blocks and to also make it increasingly harder for anyone to go back and change past transactions. 

The miners hash the contents of the block but if the resulting hash isn't equal or lower than the target they try again increasing the nonce. The nonce is simply a number used once which is added to the block to see if it matches the target, if it doesn't the miners try the next number. The first miner to hash the block with the correct nonce that results in a hash below or equal to the target is rewarded with bitcoins. The miner who wins is allowed to publish the block and all the other nodes on the network store it. 

The rewards are decreased every 4 years to maintain a stock to flow model similar to physical gold, by the year 2140 there will be no more rewards given out. The difficulty for mining is also increased (or decreased) every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks) to accommodate for changing total hash power of the entire bitcoin network, this is to ensure that a block is produced every 10 minutes on average. 

The changing of difficulty is simply the amount of 0's at the start of the hash target for miners. If you don't want to mine bitcoin to acquire it you must go to an exchange and buy it from someone who wants to sell it for fiat money. When you own bitcoins it is stored in a wallet on the network with the entire history of your bitcoins being traceable to when they were first mined.

Your wallet is only kept safe by only you knowing your keys to your wallet, if anyone else has access to them then they essentially have your bitcoins. You can own a hardware wallet which stores your keys offline and never leaves the device to ensure maximum safety.

Many people mistakingly think that bitcoin is anonymous but in reality it is pseudo anonymous as everything is public just without your real name. As long as you never share your wallet address online with identifying information like you name no one can know who owns your wallet, but they can still see your balance and every transaction you have made.

The original paper can be found at  [https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper)  

The most important line ""As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.""

&amp;#x200B;

There's something I noticed while going through hash rate data that I found quite concerning from a security of the blockchain perspective. I didn't even think to look into hash rates until another user mentioned the hash ribbon indicator on Tradingview.com

The hash rate estimated on 04/14/2021 peaked at 198.514 m TH/s. The hash rate estimated on 06/26/2021 hit a low of 58.461 m TH/s. This was found at blockchain.com using the raw values in the past year. That's a drop of 70.55% in 73 days. 

[https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, according to nature scientific journal, China made up a large percent (75%) of the mining capacity of the blockchain. If the ban was truly in effect and China miners actually shut down, the drop in hash rate would make sense.

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22256-3.pdf](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22256-3.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

With that large of a drop in miners, the possibility of a coordinated 51% attack because much easier, simply because the overwhelming majority of miners maintaining and building true blocks on the blockchain have been removed.

What are the short term and long term impacts if one were to occur to: price, trust in Bitcoin, trust in blockchain? 

&amp;#x200B;

It's also worth noting that #11 Calculations in the original paper goes through the probability of a successful attack and how they could be implemented. I will say that it may not be worth trying to do the attack unless the transaction was valued greater than the cost of ((current hashrate \* amount of time maintaining blockchain) + cost of equipment), unless they are willing to waste money to really screw with someone/entity/government.

I guess it's also worth noting that El Salvador was the first country to make it legal tender, so I would say they are at the greatest risk of an attack. Just my thoughts.",1626841446,7,1

Been DCAing since 2019 and other than Nov 2020, I've never felt more bullish on BTC. Just so cheap right now. Made a risky move taking some out my Roth IRA in Nov 2020 and it paid off. Thinking why not do it again?

ota8nu,RedGafferTape,"Why Lightning, ENS and Coinbase are so important. Why this is still the beginning and How you should Help Elon Musk. What you should do next.","Mass Adoption is what this is all about. It's going to give some of us what we want. Money, Freedom, NFT collections, Pokemon Cards and even Lamborghinis.

Right now we can buy the odd thing or just hold and use as a store of value. For mass adoption we need business to get involved. We need things for people to spend on easily with Bitcoin. But business won't join the revolution until its greener. Tesla and Elon Musk aiming for less than 50% fossil fuel usage before accepting BTC.

Right now if we all start using the lightning network this is possible.

So what else is slowing things down.

Trust is one issue.

ENS allows any crypto wallet to be named. For example Redgaffertape.eth is mine. 

The ENS system allows business to accept crypto and the Buyer be sure of who they are paying. It even correct the wallet if the wrong crypto is sent. This improves trust.

The system also allows for business to brand their crypto wallet. Meaning they can advertise Ford.cars or Richmond.Ford.Cars Decentralised websites using the same address linked via the security of the block chain.

Right now though business is slow. ENS will not have been on most businesses mind. Whilst Tesla and Elon Musk ruin crypto stability it's going to be a struggle. (more on Elon in a bit) 

So what can we do.

Well the first thing is to use the technolgy. Go get your name and attach it to your wallet. Get it first and without a premium. Just search ENS name service. You will need a browser with a meta wallet or Coinbase account plugin.

We need to start using lightning as its potential to reduce carbon is huge. This will help with adoption.

Remember when Tesla does jump in. Others will follow and we could have 99.9% of businesses with ENS addresses. Like they already have with eMail and Web addresses. 

Right now the market for ENS addresses is similar to the private number plate business. It could be so much bigger. 

I believe we are still at the beginning. 

So if Elon Musk knew about BTCs less than green credentials why did he invest. 

 TWO reasons. 

1. Publicity and a new forum. TESLA sent a car to the moon. They know how to market things. Jumping on Bitcoins bandwagon for attention alone though is not all though. Whales get listened to in this space and all it means is I have more than the next man. It says nothing about strategy or intention. Yet the community listens when whales speak. 

2. TESLA own power bank which is building batteries for homes. The batteries charge during the day and release back to the grid when full. Only really being used at night. 
Now we have smart contracts that could be used rather than store or sell back the electricity made. It could if more profitable run a mining rig. Reducing the homeowners bills even further.

There must be a financial benefit outside of Tesla cars and Bitcoin for Musk to be involved with. POWERBANK is it in my opinion. 

Musk is not a Car Designer he is a Energy consultant. He's changing the way we all live by bringing energy and efficiency to our homes. 

You may hate him but without him Crypto would be a quieter place. Let's utilise him by reducing carbon below the 50% level and switching to lightning when suitable. We need Tesla more than Tesla needs us. 

Now go and get that ENS address set up. Takes 10 mins. 

Keeping the security but losing the Anonymity is the only way forward for business. Trust and Transparency improves price.",1627480006,0,1

ot9xh4,EtTuBrute31544,Why Bitcoin is really a “threat”:,"I think what we are seeing is that Gov is grabbing on to control.

Which causes people - especially Americans in which FREEDOM has been engrained in our mindset - to resist against this control measure. I find no use in “government”. This does not mean we don’t have governance - just not an anointed group to tell us how to live.",1627478965,130,1
