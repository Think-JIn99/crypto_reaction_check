ANYWAY yesterday I set it up and moved the majority of my BTC, XRP and XLM over (can't bring myself to ditch the altcoins - went in hard Dec '17 and the losses would hurt my soul, so hanging on). All went well and it was super easy considering my knowledge is that of somebody that reads the daily's comments and not much more.

Three questions remain (last one split into two because I'm still immature enough to laugh when others say it after reading it 1000+ times... and I've never had an account):

1. What do I do with my ""dust""? A few thousand sats scattered over multiple exchanges; so small the exchanges wont let me withdraw... but my brain says when I'm old and wrinkly, that'll be a good chunk to give the grand kids!
2. Do I continue to buy (always DCA'ing) over exchanges or is there a better way, like finding real world humans... how would one even go about doing that??

3a. Are there any really stupid ways I could mess this up now? I plan to HODL &amp; stack until the things I actually WANT to buy are acceptably priced and available through pure crypto purchases and not by fiat conversion nonsense (so a long time).

I operate a small IT firm. The other partner and I want to invest in Bitcoin, but other than lurking here for a while, we haven't made any major decisions. On one of my personal computers, I installed the Bitcoin Core, and have made a few small test purchases via Coinbase &amp; Coinbase Pro, and have transferred them to my wallet (in the bitcoin core application) as prep for the Jan 3 keys thing.

We have found ourselves with a bit of an opportunity. We have about $4-6K USD that is available in the business, and we want to purchase Bitcoin with this, as an investment for the business.

Is the next step for us purchasing a hardware wallet, setting that up, and then creating a Coinbase/Pro account for the business? Does the business need its own account? or can we purchase it through my personal account and then send it to the business' hardware wallet? If we have encrypted redundant backups of a system that is running the core/wallet, do we need a hardware wallet?

I am very open to suggestions, so please feel free to let me know where we can improve/help the community.

I just rebuilt my full node in a glass ATX case and thought it might be a neat bit of flair to sit inside of it. I don't expect it to pull blocks directly from my node or anything crazy, just something that pulls from an API on any of many online countdowns. (I'll make an exception to ""don't trust, verify"" for a silly countdown clock.)

I'm guessing this could be done with a RasPi and little screen but I wanted to see if the solution already exists out there.",1578599441,5,1,0.0,0.0
emeugs,bannaples,Coinbase-Pro vs Kraken new fees and spread.,"I'm pretty new to crypto and have been Coinbase-Pro for the last 6 months. I'm well aware of the new fees but am only now beginning to realize how much spread they take on transactions (ie the difference between the market rate and the rate they actually give you). 

From their pricing/fee page ([https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2109597-coinbase-pricing-fees-disclosures](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2109597-coinbase-pricing-fees-disclosures)) they say that buying cyrpto with fiat will incur a trading fee but on top of that, the spread will be up to 0.5%. So say the trading fee is 0.5% (transation of &lt;10K), adding the spread on top of that and you're down a full 1% on the trade (ouch!).

&amp;#x200B;

But it goes even further...say you wanted to convert one digital currency to another (ie buy ETH using BTC). They don't charge a flat fee on this however, the spread can be up to 2%. This seems pretty similar to if you converted BTC to USD then used the USD to buy ETH as the fees (ie 0.5% fee + 0.5% spread x 2 orders = 2%). So you're not even saving anything by doing a direct crypto to crypto transaction. In my opinion, this is not cool.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've two questions:

1. How does the spread on Coinbase-Pro compare to Kraken? I have read the fee structure for Kraken which is better than Coinbase at lower trading volumes but worse at higher volumes ([https://www.kraken.com/en-us/features/fee-schedule](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/features/fee-schedule)). However, I can't find info on the spread that Kraken takes...does anyone know this and can give me a link?
2. It seems straightforward on how Coinbase-Pro can take a spread on a market order. That is, they give you a slightly lower price than the current market price (ie 0.5% lower) and pocket the difference. However, how can they charge a spread on limit orders? That is, you've told them to buy eg BTC at a specfic price. Taking into account the spread of 0.5% they say they charge, does this mean that the actual price they buy it at is 0.5% higher than your limit price and then they pocket the difference? For example, let's say you set a limit order to use $10K to buy BTC at a flat price of $10K per BTC. Do they then actually buy the BTC at $10,050 (ie $10K + 0.5%) then give you your $10K worth of BTC and take the $50 spread for themselves? Is this how it works? I've not included the flat fee in this example just to simplify things. 

Basically, is Kraken cheaper for trading and what are Krakens spread rates? Cheers for the info.",1578599312,9,1,0.0,0.4939

If I was to receive payment in bitcoin, what would I expect to pay to cash out to a USD account using an exchange such as Coinbase or Kraken? Both have fees listed, so on the order of about $25. Will my bank also pay a wire transfer fee? I'm guessing that's another $25 or so, so total should be &lt;$50?

Also can public keys associated to an xchange account be used to accept the initial transaction? I think this would avoid paying an extra bitcoin transaction fee if I for example accepted payment at an address generated by my wallet outside the exchange, and then transferred into an account held at the exchange and then wired that.

Look at the price of BTC compared to every other shitcoin out there and you'll see what's happening. 

Bitcoin has the perfect recipe. 


Top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. 

Bitcoin

Ethereum ETH

XRP

USDT Tether

Bitcoin Cash

Litecoin

EOS

Binance coin

Bitcoin SV

Monero


Bitcoin is unstoppable. It is the perfect money. The Bitcoin network belongs to the people of Earth. Up 97% from a year ago. Always bounces back to New highs. Bitcoin has the strongest hash rate of 120 million trillion hashes per second. 

ETH/BTC is down 53% on the year. That means ETH has lost half it's value relative to Bitcoin in the last year. Ethereum. Ethereum uses a cheaper and less secure proof of stake (POS), which is a POS (piece of shit). If proof of stake was superior to proof of work (POW), then that would be Bitcoin's consensus mechanism. Ethereum is dying relative to Bitcoin. 

XRP/BTC is down 73%. XRP, a fundamentally flawed imitation of Bitcoin, has lost 73% of its value relative to Bitcoin. XRP is a centralized, pre mined scam by the inventors who absolutely control that network. They call it distributed and then their world map shows 14 dots. Bitcoin has over 11,000 nodes. XRP is a shitcoin deluxe. XRP tries to imply that it is a value compared to Bitcoin by creating 100B XRP tokens compared to the 21M Bitcoin hard limit. It's deceptive. 

USDT Tether is a stable coin not meant for investing in. The Bitcoin exchange that runs it says it's backed by dollars, but you have to trust them, which completely breaks why you would want to buy a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is a trustless system. That's what you want. Don't hold any money in tether. 

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a hard fork of Bitcoin. That means they took the perfect recipe (Bitcoin) and they fucked it up by changing it. BCH is mainly supported by bad actors who are defrauding people by pretending it's Bitcoin when it is not. The hash rate is everything when it comes to cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Cash has only 1.6% the hash rate of Bitcoin. They registered the fake website bitcoin.com and have a fake Reddit and a fake Twitter that pretend to be the official Bitcoin. The real Bitcoin website is the .org domain. www.Bitcoin.org. Bitcoin Cash has lost 25% of its value relative to Bitcoin in the last year. Steer clear of this scam. 

Litecoin was a fork of Bitcoin. They changed the block reward from every 10 minutes to every 3 minutes. The founder has since sold his stake and has abandoned the project. LTC has lost 41% of its value relative to Bitcoin in the last year.

EOS is plagued by hacks. It's not even really a cryptocurrency. EOS has lost 52% of its value relative to Bitcoin in the last year. Terrible. 

Binance coin is a Bitcoin copycat invented by the Bitcoin exchange Binance. It's centralized, and controlled by greedy people. (Assume everyone is greedy and you'll never be let down). How is this different than having dollars in a bank? The difference is that Binance coin is a market driven asset, which means the price fluctuates. So it's even riskier than dollars in a bank. You could lose value, and you're relying on am institution instead of a decentralized open protocol like Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin SV is a hard fork of a hard fork of Bitcoin. It's problems are the same as BCH, from which it was formed. Bitcoin SV's hash rate is half of that of BCH and less than 1% of Bitcoin's hash rate. Bitcoin SV gas lost 33% of its value relative to Bitcoin in the last year. 

Monero is a privacy coin. It has lost 43% of its value relative to Bitcoin over the last year. 

The reason the 2017 Bitcoin bull run stopped is because investors got distracted by all of the shitcoins. 

But now there is a great unification taking place. People are understanding more and more than Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency worth investing in, especially long term. 

So when people say, ""if it's not Bitcoin it's a shitcoin,"" that's what we mean. 

Once this shitcoin noise settles down, people will be more focused on Bitcoin and the next halvening will bring on some serious fireworks.",1578579507,25,1,-0.0772,-0.3612
ema64v,MintyWallpaper,CryptoPixelWall,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share this project a friend and I have made show a fun way to use few different cryptocurrencies.

**#**[**CryptoPixelWall**](https://cryptopixelwall.com/)

We know others like this already exist but we have not been able to find one that has different choices like we have added.

The reason we added different choices of crypto was to demonstrate speed, fees to send and token options. We thought it was a good idea to add a choice of how long you want to display your image / link as you may just wish to try the service or want to buy an upcoming expiring slot.

This has been a really fun project and if anyone has any other ideas on how it can be improved or what other currencies we should add please tell me (it's pretty easy for me to add any token).

Please note that this is not running on a powerful server so speeds might not be brilliant please allow time for the page to load.  


If someone else selects the same slot as you which ever payment is received first will get the slot, the other payment will be refunded. 

Also I should add : This is on a screen in the classroom right now and will be for the rest of the day as I demonstrate how the different currencies work.

em4iww,toguythrow,Does anyone have experience with this (scam?),"So I have been recently getting into domain flipping. (Selling website names) I made one sale on this site called
Gecalcrypto.com (anyone know it)

The buyer requested we use it as it was an easier for him to get me the large sum for the domain he was buying. 
The reason I'm making this post is as an alert while I'm not sure this site is a scam I have reason to believe so 

1. At first they need a 0.02 deposit to verify my wallet (shakepay) then 0.05 to get premium status and now its claiming the last step is a 0.1 deposit that will be refunded so they claim. Reason is to prevent money laundering to anyone out the EU. (This one maybe a dumb question but didnt the uk (where the company is based) leave the eu?

2. Cant find them online (this one on me should've researched but I was eager to make my first sale!)

3. Online only company I can find that they registered in August via google and that the owner lives in Italy 

4. All while this is going on I was switching banks so I thought I'd be easier to transfer to btc then send it all to shakepay so now my funds are trapped and I could save up and do the deposit but idk if they are gonna have another trap for me to pay. 


So my question to you all is what do I do and what steps should I take? Do I bite the bullet and save to put the 0.1 in my account. Thanks for taking the time to read I'm still new and learning. Just really need another opinion. Was thinking of contacting uk authorities if it comes down to it.",1578543721,13,1,-0.657,-0.657

1. **[Not your keys, not your coins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F12lpqnug-0)**. If the wallet do not offer you the way to control your bitcoin keys, that is NOT your wallet. You are going back to relation ""master - slave"".  

2.  **SEGWIT**. If the wallet do not offer support for segwit BTC address (starting with bc1 or 3), that wallet do not deserve attention, is antiquated and will do more damage to you than good. Remember all new Bitcoin apps and protocols will include segwit support. so using an old legacy address will makes you excluding yourself.  

3. **Lightning**. Consider to use a wallet that is already supporting LN, aside with onchain. LN is the future, it will be much easier if you already have a wallet that use both ""chains"".  

If you respect these simple 3 rules, all the rest it's just a preference of features, functionalities that fit your necessities.

enl5tf,hmassive,r/Bitcoin makes me sad,"I hope it's the nature of this echo chamber, but it reading r/Bitcoin makes it seem like people who have no significant assets truly and honestly believe this is no way bitcoin could fail, and they read articles and watch youtube videos posted by people who share that opinion, because being wrong is no longer cognitively acceptable option.

Scarcity does not mean valuable. Bitcoin is not scarce, even if crypto currency becomes a thing it's hard to say it'll definitely be Bitcoin. 

Purpose of money is to present itself as abstraction of work, because exchanging work is cumbersome and complex (perhaps we could make some work solver today, where we'd always directly exact work, when I buy carton of milk, I'd use mobile phone to solve work-demand problem, so that I give my work to someone, where the chain ultimately leads to the grocery store  selling milk). But solving that complex problem of exchanging work is much easier with money, if money itself increases or decreases rapidly in value, that is a problem, I didn't receive or perform more work. 

Historically hyperinflation is about lack of availability of products, there is nothing to buy, so prices go up, it doesn't matter what assets you're holding, because there isn't enough goods the seller can ask as much as the richest people who want that good have. And this lack of goods to buy problem can happen very easily.

If fiat were to fail wholesale only valuable asset class are tools, technical clothing etc, because global supply chains are fragile, they would simply fail and we wouldn't have anything to spend our assets on. It is in everyone's best interest to keep fiat working, fiat failing won't be resolved to new crypto currency future in our lifetime, maybe our children's children could have working global economy based on something else.

There are no fundamentals supporting value of bitcoin in our lifetime, but getting rich is still in anyone's reach.

Because money is abstraction of work, being able to perform in-demand work is always very good investment, learn something that is highly compensated and no matter what medium of exchange is used, you can accumulate it more than you need. If you access to Internet you can in 3 years time, with 4-5h a day educate yourself with no monetary investment to a place where you can work remotely anywhere where you want and invoice at least 100kEUR/YRC, more once you gain experience and become recognised in your chosen industry. If you are not based in Brazil or US you can also entirely forego income, dividend and capital gains taxes by choosing where you live.

This method will get anyone from 0 to first million in less than decade, with assumption that market continues to return 8-9% average. Only hard investment you need, is to put in the 4-5k hours investment to learn to perform work someone wants to pay you for. The reason why this works, is because very few are willing to learn something that takes thousands of hours to learn.",1578818435,40,1,-0.4767,-0.0516

Greetings members of the r/Bitcoin community, a few months ago I made a post to this sub-Reddit (along with a few others) discussing my idea of utilizing a Semi-Submersible Rig or Large Barge, and constructing a Crypto Mining Farm on-top of it. Since then I have developed a more fleshed out plan regarding the project and would like to hear your input and also ask that you consider making a small contribution towards this project since getting a bank loan for something of this nature has not went well for others. I will update this post as things progress and attach supplementary materials and data points.

Regarding anyone running Windows 10 on their device.
The NSA has released an official, public statement urging everyone to update their Windows devices as soon as possible. An exploit has been identified in the current version of Windows 10 that can allow malicious software to be automatically installed on your computer, under the guise of approved Windows updates. 

This means that very soon, hackers will be developing tools to be able to take control of and install malicious software to over 900 million PCs worldwide, with little to nothing that can be done to stop or remove the infected software due to the system believing it is from an approved Windows Update.

The NSA and US Department of Defense urges everyone on Windows 10 to update their computer IMMEDIATELY, as a fix for the exploit has already been released. Again, failing to update now will put your machine at extreme risk in the future.

To update, click the windows logo in the bottom left, click the cog, go to ""update and security"" and press ""check for updates.""

I think it‚Äôs high time community and developers be prepared for such an event. I mean every gift has bunkers and all for possible nuke attacks even if it‚Äôs unlikely.

On same lines I think we as a community have a plan b or back up ready for such an attack just in case it happens.

My thought is we should be able to fork/ run bitcoin smoothly on POS for time being of the attack or come up something hybrid POW/POS to mitigate the attack. We need to keep testnet /protocol ready for such an event

Having such a mechanism first of all will make bitcoin 51% attack proof as only a fool will invest that much of money in attacking only to find out that we switched to POS and the attack will fail...

Second just in case a fool dies that anyways we simply switch and go on with life as usual.

Bitcoin is distributed better than any other coin with strong community so 51% POS would be nearly impossible unless state wants to buy all coins in which case it will moon af boosting the ecosystem further.

My boyfriend's grandmother died recently (RIP), and he is expecting to receive ¬£10,000 in inheritance.

He is dead set on spending the majority of this 10 grand on a miner.

Now, I won't try and make out I know much about these things. I do not. I don't even really understand bitcoin and the mining process. However, I do understand he's going to spend roughly 10 grand on a large machine that will earn him, according to some website he found on the internet, about ¬£10 a month or possibly a week (I can't quite recall now) after the cost of the vast amount of electricity used is covered - we live in a flat, we do not have solar panels and the energy isn't included in my rental agreement, I pay for that myself and therefore whatever energy the miner uses will have to be covered in it's entirety by whatever the miner earns.

I'm just extremely concerned.
At ¬£10-¬£40 profit monthly.... it will take years just to cover the cost of buying the miner.
My boyfriend then says he will add newer parts to it over time, upgrade it slowly but surely and 'before long' me and him (or him most specifically) will be raking in thousands. Just by letting a machine run.

This sounds fantastic, and very much like a get rich quick scheme that does however require an investment on my boyfriends part. But... what if it all goes wrong?

What if it never earns him more than ¬£40 a month? If that? He says he could simply sell the miner if it doesn't yield results, but I don't see him recovering all of his money, so this still stands to be a possible loss.

I'm a bit torn really.
It is his money and his choice.
But I really think he could be making a terrible mistake and I do believe if his grandmother was alive still she would also ask him to proceed into this with caution. Alas, she is not here, and i don't have any say in how he spends his money - I don't want to be that controlling girlfriend, but I don't want to watch him do something I suspect he will bitterly regret in the near future when I could say something.

I do not want to go into a discussion with him about this however when I am really very uneducated on the subject of both bitcoin in and of itself and mining. Hence why I'm here asking you guys.

TL;DR - My boyfriend is spending his inheritance on a miner. It stands to be earning only a maximum of ¬£40 a month initially. Is it worth it right now?",1579403170,20,1,-0.34,0.0772

I even emailed their parent company. No response.

I have a savings account that has several thousand dollars in it. It earns a few cents in interest each month, and I really don't do anything with it. It is reserve fund and house fund that hasn't really grown. I maintain this account at this bank because their Credit Cards and Mortgages are literally the best in the business. No joke.

I have another account that I do almost all of my business with. I have a checking account there, and they are one of the top 3 in the USA.

I decided recently that things have progressed far enough in my personal life, that my family and I will be buying a house in the next six months. As such, I'm cutting down on other expenses, and will be making deposits (for the first time in decades) into my savings account. Went to set it up through my Top3 bank. . . and the slowest version of a transfer to another bank is 3 day, $3 per transaction, regardless of transaction size.

This is beyond stupid. I want to set up bi-weekly transfers around $50-100. Why would I pay 3-6% per transaction? Those are literally Bitcoin ATM level fees.

I'll be upping my weekly Bitcoin buy instead, and will use some of that later this year as my deposit on a house.

Let's not give up before it even has a chance of passage. Your individual voice matters. Even if your representative doesn't read your email, their staff probably will, and helping to inform them is also important. Please feel welcome to adapt this language to fit your style.

""...

I write to you regarding the proposed bill entitled ""Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020."" I am in full support of this bill and hope you choose to be as well. Currently, capital is being driven out of the United States into foreign jurisdictions because we have not adopted a friendly posture toward new blockchain and crypto technologies. To the contrary, multiple agencies of the U.S. have taken a relatively hostile posture toward the promise of these new and significant technologies. For example, the IRS requires that even the smallest personal transactions (e.g., buying a cup of coffee) of a citizen must be tracked and reported (i.e., tax basis and tax gain/loss). This is not a fair way to tax people, and indeed, it is a cruel form of taxation. A $200 exemption is already in place for gains due to foreign currency fluctuations. What this bill does is level the playing field for crypto-related personal transactions. The current market cap of crypto exceeds $200 billion. That is money just waiting to be tapped into by the U.S. economy. Either we make a friendly environment in this country so that those savings can be injected into our local economies, or instead, that wealth ends up being injected into overseas economies. Using crypto for purchases is a much more sustainable benefit to the U.S. compared to scalping tiny capital gains from crypto trades, and imposing an onerous record-keeping requirement on the citizenry, even for personal transactions. I urge you to do what is within your power to see this bill progress forward.

If you get a message saying you've ""won"" some money or bitcoin, or see on social media that someone is ""giving away"" bitcoin. Report it, block the user, move on.

You will send money, either to pay for a ""withdrawal fee"" or to get the wallet up to a ""minimum balance"" and nothing will happen. You'll just lose your bitcoin that you sent. That's it.

Giveaways on social media are the same. You'll send bitcoin for the promise of bitcoin being ""sent back"" and nothing will happen. Bye bye Bitcoin. All those responses saying it's amazing and thanking the kind soul giving away the money? All fake. Every single one.

If you send any bitcoin to anyone on the promise of more bitcoin, you are being scammed and you WILL lose anything you send. Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed. The money is gone forever.

If you are an iOS Bitcoin wallet user, I'd love to get your answers to the following questions - as well as critical comments of any answers provided here. That will help a lot. 

Here are my questions:

1. What features do you look for when choosing a mobile iOS Bitcoin wallet?

2. Which feature omissions are deal breakers?

3. Which features are deal-MAKERS?

4. What is your preferred app?

5. What, if any, great or terrible experiences have you had with any particular iOS Bitcoin wallet?

I was using Bread App because it was the only thing that would work with my tech. set-up at the time. Also, it took my debit card to purchase BTC, which is desirable for me.

etcr53,Smithtechguru,Recovery lost or stolen bitcoin,"Bitcoin is a digital currency created in January 2009. It follows the ideas set out in a whitepaper by the mysterious and pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity has yet to be verified. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued currencies. Unlike fiat currency, Bitcoin is created, distributed, traded and stored with the use of a decentralized ledger system known as blockchain.


Bitcoin's history as a store of value has been turbulent; the cryptocurrency skyrocketed up to roughly $20,000 per coin in 2017, but as of two years later, is currency trading for less than half of that. As the earliest cryptocurrency to meet widespread popularity and success, Bitcoin has inspired a host of offshoot and imitators. 

Over the years, many many companies have created different cryptocurrencies and different wallets like coinbase, blockchain, binance etc and many trading platforms where you can invest,halve or trade your money for more . 

There‚Äôs as much as $10 billion in stolen crypto out there in the market, according to Pawel Kuskowski, CEO of blockchain sleuthing firm Coinfirm. And he wants to give victims a fighting chance at getting their funds back.

Exclusively revealed to CoinDesk, Coinfirm has teamed up with global investigations firm Kroll, a division of consulting firm Duff &amp; Phelps. The joint initiative being launched is called ReclaimCrypto, and combines the latest blockchain forensic techniques with the more established world of legal investigation and asset recovery. 

Kuskowski told CoinDesk: ‚ÄúSo far, there is no one place where victims can go and get help. It‚Äôs almost like they are pleading to get someone interested in their case. In the end, they have to work it out themselves; see about getting a lawyer, perhaps in some other jurisdiction.

After a long research with my colleagues at the University we found out a way to trace and recover stolen Bitcoin and so far we have had over 100 successful ones since we started 2019.

ev1454,KamiKazeKenji,Warning! beldextrade.com is a scam - another fake giveaway,"I wasn't too privy to this specific scam before today, and I searched for the website in question but found nothing. The red flags were everywhere the entire time I was going through this, but it initially seemed legitimate enough for people to be easily deceived. Hopefully any potential victims can find this post and save themselves from being scammed.

It all started when I got a message on Discord ([https://imgur.com/1fMZ3qS](https://imgur.com/1fMZ3qS)) from a guy (ironically) named ""Crooked"" telling me I won $69 of bitcoin in a random giveaway. This was the first red flag but I clicked through just to take a look. I went to the site, created an account, and tried to withdraw my 0.008 BTC... [https://imgur.com/s1J4D5u](https://imgur.com/s1J4D5u) I have to gamble some of it away to withdraw it? Second major red flag.

At this point I had nothing to lose so I went ahead and bet the minimum of $15 on the roulette. When the timer hit 0, I was greeted with this: [https://imgur.com/xtXt80t](https://imgur.com/xtXt80t). I won $2k in bitcoin!? Yeah, obviously this is too good to be true, but in the moment I just blinked at the screen. There's a ""live"" chat with the gamblers chatting away, so I asked if I really just won. Some of them quickly answered me with the affirmative. It all looked pretty convincing, but I wouldn't be surprised if these are paid actors or even AI chatbots.

Then I tried to withdraw again, but I got a message telling me I need to talk to support to activate a ""bot app"". So I do, and support linked me to a chrome extension:  [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/a%D1%80%D1%80-cr%D1%83%D1%80t%D0%BE/bhihlepfeofebhiafmidfeipambijdgl](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/a%D1%80%D1%80-cr%D1%83%D1%80t%D0%BE/bhihlepfeofebhiafmidfeipambijdgl). I need to install it and log into coinbase / binance / etc to ""verify I'm not a bot or money launderer."" I read the reviews on the extension and it's glaringly obvious. The extension steals the login info of the wallet and the scammers empty it out. At this point I was certain this is a scam, but I spun up a VM to install it so I can get to the bottom of this.

Sure enough, another attempt to withdraw was met with failure, and further talk with the support rep informed me that I need to have at least $500 of bitcoin in my online wallet in order to be verified. After all these red flags, I'd have to be an idiot to go through with that, so I finally called them out on it. Alas, the rep promptly disconnected from the live chat and banned me from the gambling chat for good measure.

I know enough about scams to not fall for stuff like this, but I can totally see how people can. There's some techniques used in order quell the doubts that pop up while going through the hoops. There's the low initial giveaway (&gt;$100 seems believable), the rush of gambling (ESPECIALLY for people who are prone to these addictive behaviors) and ""winning"" $2k in realtime. This all reminds me of the old ""sign up for x to unlock free y"" scams that were all over the internet a decade ago, but a lot more nuanced and sophisticated. There's probably dozens, if not hundreds of these sites out there, but I feel the more info is out there the less people will end up falling for it.

TL;DR: If you get a message on Discord saying you won a small amount of bitcoin, ignore it. It's a scam.",1580188915,19,1,-0.8588,-0.8777

As the title says,  I am wondering if there is a way to either use carrier-billing to either withdraw funds to bank account and then buy coins as usual,  or to directly buy bitcoins by charging it to the phone bill? 

I‚Äôve tried NETELLER and Skrill, but I can‚Äôt find the option to pay by mobile on either.

The only other way I can think of is by depositing with Boku into a gambling site, then withdrawing to bank,  But there are often limits you have to reach before withdrawing.

# 

# Why OTC broker (instead of a crypto exchange)?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Lack of liquidity** ‚Äî crypto exchanges have low liquidity. OTC desks are good for pushing through large trade orders searching for market liquidity.
* **Price protection, Anonymity** ‚Äî OTC is good for moving large orders which avoids impacting the price, e.g. 1,000 BTC. Order depth will not show up like it does on an exchange.
* **No fiat onramp** ‚Äî few crypto exchanges have a fiat onramp (though Binance is working on it and already have some solutions in place in Asia).
* **Avoid price ‚Äòslippage‚Äô** ‚Äî price slippage occurs on exchanges when the executed price is different to the expected price.
* **Avoid prohibitive crypto exchange limits** ‚Äî the majority of crypto exchanges have prohibitive trading limits. For example, Coinbase limits purchases to $25,000 per day. Kraken only lets you withdraw $2,500 per day and $20,000 per month. Circle imposes withdrawal limit of $3,000 per week.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Who are the main buyers and sellers?

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, the main buyers are hedge funds and the main sellers are miners. In Oct 2018, it was reported in [Reddit Rumours](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ksz6h/institutional_investors_are_secretly_buying/) that hedge funds were buying large volumes from miners. The main participants trading crypto OTC are:

* Hedge funds, smaller asset managers, family offices (buyers).
* Miners (sellers).
* Regulated broker-dealers (on account).
* Crypto exchange OTC desks (on account).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# What are the main problems?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Settlement risk** ‚Äî there is no guarantee the asset will be delivered, or cash will be paid. Coin transfer often happens much faster than the wire payment transfer (often by several hours).
* **No custody solution** ‚Äî most OTC brokers don‚Äôt provide a custody solution (or provide a very limited service), which can increase settlement and operational risk.
* **Multi-jurisdictional KYC issues** ‚Äî dealing with countries with poor KYC regulations can be a deal breaker.
* **If you execute through an OTC broker** you need, for example, to deliverthe ETH to the broker. There is no guarantee the broker's client will pay.

# What we do?

&amp;#x200B;

ROX Capital AG team is working on Decentralised Finance technology which brings fully trustless direct asset exchange tools to customers of OTC companies and crypto exchanges.

ROX is designed the platform that helps to build trust between exchange members based on a trustless technology which retains assets control by beneficiaries on any stage of a process.

The system of Smart Contracts provides a simple tool that help participants exchange Proof-of-Funds in seconds without moving funds to a broker or third party escrow until needed amount and price requirements achieved from both sides.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Features

&amp;#x200B;

* SaaS Provider for OTC and other Institutionals
* Trustless Smart Contract Network^(4)
* Impersonal Orders with Proof-of-Funds from KYC Verified Members
* Integration with third party OTC desk
* Referral program for Agents and Deal Merge Fee Trustee
* Onchain trustless deals initiate by manager or beneficiary
* Cross-chain^(5) Trustless DLT System

&amp;#x200B;

*4¬† Trustless Network is based on blockchain opportunities, the system provides manager or beneficiary to setup terms for each deal, including price, referral fee amount, choose exact whitelisted tokens for both sides of exchange, also minimum transaction volume or fix lot for change. The all details are transparent and available in blockchain comments and through the provided interface for both sides.*

*5¬† On the first stage we provide Ethereum ERC-20 based MVP which is demonstrate the concept and during the public Beta-test continue working with Bitcoin blockchain integration stability.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Two or more OTC brokers can merge any deal, set-up needed fee size and share it through built in partner program.

Time is saved for all market participants ‚Äî from agreement to transfer receipt both sides could spend less than 1 hour, instead of days or weeks.

Anonymity is protected ‚Äî large impersonal¬†reliable orders and no needed meetings anymore.

As the majority of brokers execute based on **Request for Quote** (RFQ) and **‚ÄòFill or Kill‚Äô** (FOK). That‚Äôs why we created four types of contracts:

1. FOK with two participants and fix lot order.
2. FOK with two participants and minimum order amount.
3. One side offer can be filled with unlimited transactions from second side and minimum order amount.
4. One side offer can be filled with unlimited transactions from second side with fix lot order.

*Contracts can be declined by initiator any time before lot or minimum order amount fulfilment. If declined, all funds returns to senders without any fees. Same as escrow but trustless.*

Options

ROXY provides:

1. Web app cabinet, where broker prepare a deal in three simple steps: choosing contract type, fill up details (tokens for buyer and seller, price, lot/minimum amount, fee, other additional details) and creates contract with transparent accepted by participants terms.
2. White label integration.

*The service is provided under an agreement B2B to a companies authorised to proceed exchanges of crypto assets for their customers according to regulatory agreements in the countries where entities operating.*

&amp;#x200B;

A transfer that should have taken a week, but has taken two because banks don't operate on holidays and for some reason, and Electronic Funds Transfer also stops working when the banks are closed, just to end up failing.

1. first of all the miners won't be as interested in mining Bitcoin once that supply has almost been met or the difficulty of the final bit coins are too high compared to the cost of electricity Etc. Mining will have to be done by people on a basis that they will be compensated by the fees paid.

2. Ultimately Bitcoin will fail as the demand for money is constantly increasing as economic activity increases. Especially if Bitcoin where to go mainstream the demand for it would keep going up and up. And I don't mean for the next 5 or 10 years but for the next 50 or 70 years...

3. 3rd and the one I'm most curious to hear people's opinions about dot-dot-dot losing Bitcoins. There is an unknown number of Bitcoins now which are lost. For example if somebody had the private keys on a hard drive or paper and lost Them. I'm not sure what the current estimates of lost Bitcoins are right now but I know there are significant amount of Bitcoin that are lost and can no longer be circulated if you assume that by human error people will lose private keys as it's an event that no doubt happens quite regularly, imagine how this will look like throughout the years... In 5 or 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years... not only is the supply of Bitcoin finite but also the Bitcoin in circulation will gradually decrease as people lose their private keys buy one way or another.",1578167719,15,0,-0.2263,-0.2263

I know, hundreds of posts like these have probably been written throughout crypto‚Äôs relatively short history: crypto is a fraud, a ponzi, etc.

I wasn't sure where to put this, but I ‚Äòd very much like to hear your opinions on my particular take on this matter. So Here it goes: 

Seeing how much the physical metals market has been and continues to be manipulated, the trillions of dollars conjured up by the fed the prop up the stock market, ‚Ä¶ and really, how the story of modern man has always been one characterised by an elite fleecing the proles at every step; doing everything they can to make sure they never get the chance to really build and safeguard capital for the long term, I wonder how the cryptomarket fits into to this story. 

At least to me, this notion that for the most part, the enormous run-up in prices until the last bubble popped, has been purely speculative, makes much sense to me. A bubble driven by the idea that there‚Äôs always a sucker somwhere down the line willing to buy a stash of coins preferably at much higher prices. I mean, was it really a question of user cases? Perhaps for BTC to some extent yes, with a few revolutionary minds thinking it will provide them a way of definitively escaping fiat, and the games central banks play. For the great majority however, it was and continues to be about hoping history repeats itself, in short, about an easy way to riches, about greed. 

Thinking of this little history, this reality I outlined here. It would make perfect sense for the FED to print a few billion dollars at no cost, and then use it to drive up the market by proxy, merely creating one more elaborate scheme to fleece the people. The few who got in early and took profits and got rich, well, I guess it is not that troublesome a thought to TPTB.

Anyway, I wonder where the money is going to come from this time around? Institutional investors? And with the world‚Äôs dwindling middle-class (please see Chris Hamilton‚Äôs blog - [https://econimica.blogspot.com/2019/07/how-this-plays-out-deceleration\_39.html](https://econimica.blogspot.com/2019/07/how-this-plays-out-deceleration_39.html)) subjected to ever more forms of financial repression, are there really that much people left willing to prop up this highly uncertain and volatile market with their hard earned cash? Then there are the one‚Äôs I hear of that bought in the green, near the top of some movement, only to get burned badly, shortly after. Do you think people like these - often still possesing enough capital to frivolously spend, will instead buy in when there‚Äôs fear in the market, when they should? No, I don‚Äôt think so. They got burned and are staying away for good. 

Ofc, it might turn out to be the classic Wall Street chart. Hopefully we‚Äôll see the disbelief phase soon, as a new bull market emerges. But I have my doubts. The manipulators of this market can keep this thing going for a long time, each time just draining away funds, giving hope and a bit of relief from time to time.

One of the things that still keeps me in, is the knowledge that as easy as it is for ‚Äúthem‚Äù to drain this market, they can pump it up in the same manner. Again, is it that implausible for certain parties buying and selling crypto with fiat provided by the FED? The money for these investors is free basically, just like it was for Blackrock or Blackstone buying tens of thousands of homes with FED money [https://wallstreetexaminer.com/2015/11/stench-freddie-mac-back-18-billion-crony-capitalist-thievery/](https://wallstreetexaminer.com/2015/11/stench-freddie-mac-back-18-billion-crony-capitalist-thievery/) Am I wrong in thinking that if they want to, they can just keep on pounding this market into oblivion? They don‚Äôt need it to succeed or even have a return, they need to see it fail, and for the time being, have it draw in as much capital and savings as possible, until a nice reset, with a date of their choosing. Until then everyone keeps on buying the ‚Äúdips‚Äù, and the suckers do it in reverse ofc.

They say the market is there to inflict as much pain as possible. Likewise I can also see a scenario play out, where they do pump it up again, but slowly at first, so those of a cautious nature, decide to just play it safe, and be content with a little profit, only for TPTB to then pump it up to new ATH‚Äôs. The story repeats itself, people buy in higher, their stash now smaller, and then the market turns again. But yeah, this sort of contradicts my story perhaps. But then what, after that? Rinse and repear, one boom and bust, parabolic rally after the other? 

Perhaps, if the FED just keeps on printing and the stock market continues hitting ATH‚Äôs, then maybe some of this money will splash into the cryptomarket, but then there‚Äôs the political aspect to this money printing, hence we get articles like [https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-07-05/blain-central-banks-will-keep-easing-until-parliaments-and-palaces-burn](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-07-05/blain-central-banks-will-keep-easing-until-parliaments-and-palaces-burn)

As far as XRP is concerned, because it is sometimes mentioned in regards to a coming liquidity crisis, and how XRP would be used to solve that. I just cannot see how any of the major banks will pay the small timers out there, holding Xk of XRP, a few or even tens of dollars or whatever per XRP. It would be such a break of this age old dynamic. This time the powerful somehow bowing to the weak. For once being in a position of subservience, of dependency. With J.P. Morgan or Goldman Sachs paying the little guy to please part with his XRP so they can use it. I just cannot see this scenario play out. 

This crypto history somehow also reminds me of the classic private business MO: governments and the taxpayer providing the funds for projects (universities, laboratories) which then down the road, get bought up by private business. So the cost of development is on our dime, and the rewards, the profits are syphoned off to a nice tax haven. 

Crypto feels a bit like that to me. Suckers funding it all, only for the big players to come afterwards (with a mature product) and buy it out or use the developed tech and stamp their name on it. If it succeeds and end up into something useful, great, if it turns out to be a dead-end, but somehow good lessons were learned, to improve on a next iteration, all is good. Isn‚Äôt this how things work often.

As Michael Parenti once wrote: 

&gt;*""They are not going to leave any little bit for you. There‚Äôs only one thing that the ruling circles throughout history have ever wanted-all the wealth, the treasures, and the profitable returns; all the choice lands and forests and game and herds and harvests and mineral deposits and precious metals of the earth; all the productive facilities and gainful inventiveness and technologies; all the control positions of the state and other major institutions; all public supports and subsidies, privileges and immunities; all the protections of the law and none of its constraints; all of the services and comforts and luxuries and advantages of civil society with none of the taxes and none of the costs. Every ruling class in history has wanted only this-all the rewards and none of the burdens.""*

I know, reality is often far more complex and ambiguous, nor is it captured in lineair, deterministic thinking, of which I‚Äôm guilty here perhaps. 

Some of you may be familiar with the writing of a certain J.C. Collins and his blog philosophyofmetrics. First it was the introduction/widespread adoption of the SDR that would fundamentally change the economy, then Collins started writing about crypto‚Äôs, and XRP in particular, replacing the SDR. With central banks having enabled the industrial revolution; this time around the crypto market would replace central banking to provide the world with the liquidity it needs to spur the new economics, and the enormous technological progress that is upon us. Something along those lines. About a year ago, he wrote how central banks would soon start to add crypto‚Äôs to their balance sheets, and how the crypto market would swallow the PMs market, etc. [https://philosophyofmetrics.com/crypto-market-will-swallow-gold-market-in-2019/](https://philosophyofmetrics.com/crypto-market-will-swallow-gold-market-in-2019/). Yet here we are now. 

Who knows, instead of a fortress world, or barbarization scenario, utopia (The Great Transition -  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_Transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Transition) \-  [https://greattransition.org/documents/Great\_Transition.pdf](https://greattransition.org/documents/Great_Transition.pdf) ) might really be around the corner, and we‚Äôll see the advent of the third industrial revolution, the internet of things, the sharing economy, where trust is currency, the demonization of all essentials as Peter Diamandis writes, and ‚Äúradical abundance.‚Äù All in all, a more humane system where, for example Collins writes at one point: *The onset of robotics and AI technologies will further release man from the long hours of labor.  This will fundamentally alter the existing relationship between capital and labor.  Capitalism and Communism, the diametric manifestations of capital and labor, will consolidate around a new form of socialism which is meant to accommodate the expansion of man‚Äôs creative and spiritual ‚Äúsovereignty‚Äù*. - [https://philosophyofmetrics.com/new-age-socialism-and-the-end-of-debt-based-money-creation-freepom/](https://philosophyofmetrics.com/new-age-socialism-and-the-end-of-debt-based-money-creation-freepom/)

I have my doubts though, more inclined to believe that it will be just more of the same and maybe a lot worse before it gets better. But what do I know.",1578668872,0,1,-0.5859,0.3612

You may be leery about investing on a cryptocurrency trading platform that only came on the scene once bitcoin and many altcoins are on the map. BigONE is one of those exchange startups, but it bills itself as the ‚Äúmost secure and convenient cryptocurrency exchange in the world.‚Äù That remains to be seen, however, as it‚Äôs still early days, considering the trading platform only launched in November 2017. The CEO is Eric Meltzer.

But global exchange BigONE is off to a good start and became a trader favorite with its wide access to coins, including newly issued tokens, and trading pairs not to mention sophisticated trading tools including interactive charting. As long as users have gone through the highest level of two-factor authentication, they shouldn‚Äôt have any trouble making withdrawals from the exchange. Otherwise there could be delays.

They also did a zero-fee promotion that ran until year-end 2017 to attract new users, which helps it to compete with the likes of Robinhood, whose trading platform doesn‚Äôt charge exchange fees. While the honeymoon may be over, many investors are hopeful that it‚Äôs just the beginning for BigONE and cryptocurrency traders.

BigONE is backed by blockchain investment firm INBlockchain, which in addition to BigONE is also an investor in EOS, steemit, Zcash, MobileCoin, EOS, Candy Box, Global Social Chain (GSC), among others. In fact, several INBlockchain‚Äôs portfolio companies are also cryptocurrencies that are supported on the BigONE platform, for instance Monaco and EOS, to name a couple.

BIgONE‚Äôs CEO Meltzer is also an advisor at INBlockchain, as is Xiaolai Li, an entrepreneur who is said to be the ‚Äúrichest bitcoin owner.‚Äù This bolsters their security profile, considering the financial stability of the exchange‚Äôs backers, despite the fact that BigONE is a startup.

Meanwhile, on Github, users say the prior version of BigONE was yunbi.com, which is based in Beijing. BigONE‚Äôs domicile isn‚Äôt readily apparent, but Github suggests they are British. Most of BigONE‚Äôs website visitors, however, are based in China, as per Alexa data.

BigONE is a user-friendly and trendy exchange that isn‚Äôt afraid to offer some of the newer coins, including bitcoin forked coins across Super Bitcoin, Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond. In fact, there‚Äôs no shortage of coins on the platform, ranging from top cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH and Zcash to ICO coins including EOS (EOS), Monaco (MCO), aelf (ELF) and ChainLink (LINK).

Competing exchange Bittrex, meanwhile, is known to remove coins with insufficient liquidity, so it will be interesting to see how the more the merrier approach pans out for BigONE.

BigONE is unique for several reasons, not the least of which it has its own cryptocurrency, BigONE, which trades on Coin Market Cap under the symbol BIG. They have allotted a maximum supply of 200 million BIG tokens.

The exchange‚Äôs high-tech graphics and trading tools including interactive charts are top notch compared to most other bitcoin exchanges. On social media, users tout the exchange as a ‚Äúnifty‚Äù and ‚Äúreliable‚Äù platform.

BigONE Pros
¬∑       Thorough security comprised of hot and cold wallets, multiple signatures, two-step verification, real-time monitoring and more.

¬∑       Supports multiple coins 33 cryptocurrencies, as of launch.

¬∑       Numerous trading pairs including the following BTC, BCH, EOS, ETH, ZEC against USDT

¬∑       Instant trading, real-time quotes

¬∑       Customer deposits are kept in reserves and not used by the exchange

¬∑       BIG token is backed by fees

¬∑       Zero deposit fees

¬∑       Sophisticated trading tools and charting capabilities

¬∑       Fast transaction times

¬∑       Web-based trading platform (no need for installation)

¬∑       Offers an API

¬∑       Mobile friendly

¬∑       Chat room for traders

¬∑       Security is a top priority, as evidenced by the company‚Äôs tagline, ‚ÄúThe most secure and convenient cryptocurrency exchange in the world.‚Äù

¬∑       Exchange may be pursuing a US launch

¬∑       They‚Äôre accessible on multiple messaging platforms including Telegram and Bee in addition to social media sites Facebook and Twitter.

BigONE Cons
¬∑       Users have described a problematic account verification process that leaves them unable to make withdrawals. Customer service appears to keep users waiting with no response for days.

¬∑       Users complain of high withdrawal fees

¬∑       Users have also complained early on that not all the wallets were working properly to accept deposits, only the main coins.

¬∑       Only accepts cryptocurrencies and not fiat money for deposits; as a result, can‚Äôt do bank or credit card transfers.

¬∑       Only supports spot trading, which is a common limitation to crypto exchanges

¬∑       Only available to non-US citizens

¬∑       The KYC process could take anywhere from hours to days

¬∑       Users don‚Äôt get the response they would like form support. Often the issues surround a stalled identity verification process that is due to an old photo or something of that nature.

BigONE only accepts deposits in cryptocurrencies. As a result, you can‚Äôt transfer from a checking account or credit or debit card, which makes it less competitive with an exchange such as Coinbase, for instance, which does allow checking account and debit-card transactions.

While BigONE chargers 0% deposit fees and a flat 0.1% trading fee, their withdrawal fees are on the high side, as outlined below ‚Äì

Updates on the exchange‚Äôs fee table can be accessed here.

BigONE Security
BigONE claims to be the safest cryptocurrency exchange around, though there‚Äôs not much historical data to back this claim up yet. But they do explain why security is so important to them as well as some of the steps they take to keep user accounts secure.

While the BigONE management team hasn‚Äôt taken much of the spotlight, they did explain that their motivation for launching BigONE was in response to the security breaches that were plaguing the bitcoin trading platforms around them.

They felt ‚Äúthe community deserved better,‚Äù which explains their focus on security. BigONE boasts what they describe as a ‚Äútrustworthy infrastructure‚Äù and a ‚Äúhigh-class trading experience‚Äù fueled by speed, accessibility and secure management of cryptocurrencies.  In its short trading history, there‚Äôs no evidence that BigONE has suffered any security breaches.

Website
According to Alexa.com, the majority of visitors to the BigONE site are from China, followed by Japan, the United States, Hong Kong and Vietnam. Interestingly, users visit BigONE after being on Coinbase as well as Candy.one and Binance.

BigONE is a sophisticated site and may seem intimidating to the novice trader. But there‚Äôs a lot of help out there, including from other traders on a dashboard chat room. One user was asking how to buy ether, and another user explained they should first transfer their BTC to BigONE and then they could use it to purchase ether.

The features on the exchange platform are pretty self-explanatory and easy to navigate, such as the buy and sell buttons illustrating the DGD trade placed prominently on the dashboard ‚Äì

Trading Pairs
BigONE supports numerous trading pairs and appears to add new options quite frequently. In a nutshell they offer dozens of trading pairs with the following currencies ‚Äì

¬∑       BTC

¬∑       ETH

¬∑       EOS

¬∑       QTUM

¬∑       USDT

¬∑       BITCNY

They also support numerous individual coins, as listed by Coin Market Cap here.

While BigONE is a bitcoin-fork friendly trading platform, ‚Äúeach forked coin goes through a strict licensing review process.‚Äù If all goes well with the hard fork in question, users will credited the forked coins afterward. So, there‚Äôs a bit of risk there to the user.

BigONE‚Äôs co-founder and CEO Eric Meltzer appears to keep a low profile. But when the exchange added the Monaco coin, he commented:

‚ÄúAdding the MCO Token to BigONE is a tremendous value add to our users. With our focus on security and innovative rewards and deals, we are keen support Monaco‚Äôs efforts of making cryptocurrency available to the masses.‚Äù

Traders appear to be enthused about the ability to trade Candy coin. There are several videos on You Tube explaining how to perform transactions with Candy on BigONE, such as the below tutorial ‚Äì

Signing Up
The sign-up process is straight forward to start. Begin by entering an email address followed by a password. Once you‚Äôve made it through the account verification process, you sign in with your email and password and will be promoted to enter a code that maybe generated by a Google authenticator app, for instance.

Considering that the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process could take an undetermined amount of time, ranging from hours to days, BigONE cautions its users not to make any deposits before the account is verified if they intend to trade.

Users who have activated two-factor authentication can deposit and trade on BigONE. Meanwhile, traders who have completed the identity verification process can perform withdrawals, which the company characterizes as a ‚Äúfast‚Äù process.

Traders who have having issues with withdrawals most likely haven‚Äôt gone through the identification verification process properly. They must go through a series of steps to prove their identity, including a photo ID as well as selfie holding a picture of the photo ID with the date and name of the exchange written across it.

User Reviews
On Facebook, user reviews are mixed, with users handing the exchange a rating of between one and five stars. One investor who gave the exchange a single star ran into problems trying to withdraw funds because of an old photo on her passport. She said the exchange asked too many questions, but that‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing, especially if they‚Äôre trying to remain secure.

Other users similarly had issues with their image not matching the picture on their ID, so there‚Äôs a pattern. And it wasn‚Äôt just on Facebook. A Telegram poster complained about not getting approved for the verification process because his image didn‚Äôt match his form of ID. The very same ID, however, worked on ‚Äúmany other exchanges‚Äù where he was approved.

One follower provided the following advice to traders: ‚ÄúIt is difficult to pass the application for authentication. You need to open Google‚Äôs 2-step verification Make sure to consider it before joining.‚Äù

In addition to investors, ICO issuers also expressed their inability to determine how to get their coins listed on the site, with one follower on Facebook saying ‚Äì

‚ÄúWhere at your site Listing Application Form? and some info about How to get listed a coin?!!!!!!‚Äù

On the plus side, traders applaud the platform for supporting their favorite coins early, such as on this Reddit thread when IOS (IOST) was launched on BigONE.

BigONE Mobile &amp; API
BigONE has a mobile app that‚Äôs available for both Android and iOS devices. User reviews weren‚Äôt readily available yet.

In addition to the mobile app, BigONE also offers an API via GitHub for developers, which is available here.  The API supports BigONE‚Äôs trading capabilities in other apps. It‚Äôs been assigned on GitHub as of Q1 2018 but there are no projects or milestones listed yet. While there‚Äôs not too much information available on the BigONE API, it may be possible to glean from its predecessor, Yunbi.

Yunbi was two pronged, comprised of a public API and a private API. The public API didn‚Äôt require verification, while the private version did in the form of a signature. It was available to individuals and merchants.

BigONE Token
BigONE is behind the ERC-20 BigONE token, and it‚Äôs got a cap of 200 million in circulation. BigONE is committed to repurchasing BIG tokens in the secondary market using a percentage of trading commission fees.

BigONE Verdict
BigONE is a newcomer, which means there isn‚Äôt much in the way of user numbers or trading volume yet, so it‚Äôs tough to make a call. But the fact that they use security in their tag line suggests this is the No. 1 priority for the exchange. Another thing they have going for them is the backing of INBlockchain and its management team.

Traders can get their choice of tokens on the platform and trading pairs are added frequently, which is lacking at many other exchanges. If you prefer to use an exchange that accepts fiat money deposits, there are plenty of other options, and if BigONE‚Äôs 0.1% trading fees have you down, head over to Robinhood for zero trading fees by the exchange.

While BigONE is a global exchange, it doesn‚Äôt support US residents, though they may be efforting an expansion into the US market.

I've been working on a sidechain protocol with no trusted third party. You can find the [whitepaper here](http://coins.github.io/coins.pdf).  


*Abstract. Coins is a Bitcoin extension designed for payments at scale.¬† We propose an efficient solution to the double-spending problem using a bitcoin-backed proof-of-stake.¬† Validators vote on sidechain blocks with one-time signatures, forming a record that cannot be changed without destroying their collateral. Every user can become a validator by locking bitcoins.¬†One-time signatures guarantee that validators loose their¬†stake¬†for¬†publishing¬†conflicting¬† histories. Checkpoints¬† can¬†be¬†additionally secured with a bitcoin-backed proof-of-burn.¬†Assuming a rational majority of validators, the sidechain provides safety and liveness. The sidechain‚Äôs footprint within bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain is minimal.¬† Spawning multiple, independent instances scales horizontally.*  


Feedback is highly appreciated!

It seems the question may open a person up to additional scrutiny, and there is a lot of political reasons for Cryptocurrency advocates to be under this additional scrutiny as many are affiliated with economic libertarian views (many similarities to the Tea Party targeting).

The answer to the question doesn't seem to affect the actual dollar amounts in any way. And a tax return is not a census or survey.

Is there some advocate organization that could help?

Is getting it wrong as simple as e.g. a finger-slip and removing 1 character out of the recipient address for the coins to be lost forever or sent to the wrong person? What are the barriers to such mistakes? 

Could there in theory ever be a way for coding something that serves as the function of ""middle-man"" that can take back a payment if the buyer/seller do not meet the mutual agreements (like the Ebay system e.g.)

eqymj1,TombStoneFaro,"If you knew that that BTC would be worth 50% of its current value in 10 years, would you still buy?","One of the biggest problems Jews immigrating from Germany had was that they were limit to taking 10 marks with them which was less than 5 bucks in the late 1930s -- given wages, it was probably about one-day's salary for, say, a teacher. It was probably enough to pay for one night in a hotel and food for one person. That is, it was practically nothing and people who did not have relatives or assets in a foreign country would not be allowed into most countries who did not want to admit paupers.

So this requirement resulted ultimately in deaths of many tens of thousands of people. 

So in the following artificial scenario:

1. You had to buy this year and could do so anonymously
2. You knew somehow that BTC would drop but would still remain at 50% of its current value against the dollar
3. You were pretty sure that you would need to leave the country at some point and all of your assets would be confiscated except for a nominal amount (as in nazi Germany) and no one knew you had crypto

Any person who was afraid of #3 would be thrilled to invest not all but a significant amount of their worth in BTC and would not even consider selling even if BTC went up 100 to 1.

This is sort of paradoxical -- an asset that would allow you the freedom to leave the USA or whatever country (probably there are countries way more like nazi Germany) and thereby let you sleep at night -- should keep increasing in value but I am saying even if it didn't, even if you knew it would drop, it would be about the best investment you could make.",1579452322,0,1,0.8519,-0.2023

erkl53,lyambaker,Bitcoin is not created out of thin air.,"Bitcoin is created through a process called mining. Blockchain, the technology that bitcoin is built on top of, is dependent on a network of nodes that ensures the integrity of transaction history by achieving consensus. (To understand more about blockchain, you can reference this article.) Validation is one part of the process. After validating a transaction, the nodes then need to race, using trial and error, to solve a difficult mathematical puzzle that requires heavy computing resources. The first computer in the network that solves the equation will be rewarded with bitcoins. This is known as ‚Äòmining bitcoins‚Äô. This protocol is referred to as Proof of Work (PoW).

Bitcoin mining serves two purposes: it allows for the creation of new coins and facilitates the processing of transactions in the network. Mining requires energy, hardware and bandwidth. If you try to mine bitcoins on your computer, you will find the cost of electricity will likely outweigh the value of bitcoins you can mine. Other cryptocurrencies also use PoW. Another emerging protocol is Proof of Stake (PoS) which does not need energy or hardware to achieve consensus, but rather uses staking or bonding tokens to determine the next block.",1579558102,11,1,-0.1877,0.067

ewc2kz,straightOuttaCrypto,"Showing '0' instead of ""N/A"" when data ain't available is the worst UI error ever","Hi all,

I post this in r/bitcoin as there are just soooo many wallets AND exchanges guilty of this misfeature. To me this has to be one the biggest UI/UX error ever and all the people I talked to do agree.

When you first connect your hardware wallet to this or that software or when you log into an exchange (or simply go to the ""balance"" page/tab/whatever), a huge number of badly conceived software are showing ""0"" instead of ""N/A"" or ""-"" or simply nothing when they don't have the info yet.

This is maddening. I've got a lot in crypto and a lot at some places (once again: hardware wallet or exchanges).

Heck, even some block explorer make this stupid mistake.

Every single time it nearly gives me a heart attack.

It is so bad I wrote my own little tool which queries balances and displays ""N/A"" instead of 0 when the info ain't available. But my little tool doesn't scale (it doesn't work for exchanges for example).

Now when things gets really bad is if there's some sort of network slowdown or anything really that make updating that ""0"" into your actual balance take some time (as, you know, a delay / lock up / whatever: the kind of delay that happens, well, on a daily basis?).

So to all the software devs out there: do not show ""0"" when the correct value is ""info not available yet"". Not only it makes you look like a clueless amateur:  it could also one day trigger a heart attack to someone thinking he's been hacked.

To all the non-software devs: upvote and let's cross fingers someone high up the chain can reign on these lazy devs and their very debatable practices? (oh, btw, I'm a software dev).

To all those who got it right and do not display ""0"" when there's no info yet: thank you so much, you get it.",1580417572,4,1,-0.7783,0.0

 One Bitcoin transaction is estimated to be 53,124 hours of YouTube videos.  
 Other applications of blockchain technology will essentially be much less efficient than YouTube.  
 Bitcoin and blockchain is the most destructive, and negligent technological movement that is occurring in the world today.

They really is no long term objective for most of you other than turning your Bitcoin into a large sum of fiat, so you can buy a lambo.   
 It's not the available and efficient Central systems that are the greediest, it's this social cult of wannabe rich crypto dystopian technos with 10 mining PC's running 24/7 at thier house wasting power from the grid, using natural resources.  
 Satoshi Nakamoto was smart he never intended for Bitcoin to be mainstream. It's was for discrete unlegislated transactions. Now it's about spreading lies and trying to get fiat rich from this crypto stock. 

I'm a computer scientist, I make open source applications. I am capable of remaking, info list applications (Facebook), or video bucket applications (YouTube). They really don't hold any other power other than they are the popular ones to use. The technology is not much different either way. I can encrypt anything with a strong 4096bit key with only a terminal. If I really had data that needed to be private I could make it happen. You can apply your own end to end encryption on ANY current platform you like. If that's something that you actually need or would spend 30 minutes learning how to do. People have a fear that thier data is being milked from them and used maliciously, even if they are unhesitatingly delightfully participants with these systems, with very little consciously malicious results over a long span of time. Ie. Thier fears are irrational and unfounded. Which is very similar to the fears, or delusions, of central banking systems. Are they perfect? Maybe no, but do they use 53k videos electrical use for single transactions? No.

I understand the math behind the blockchain, a solution to the double spending problem. That is all that is new. This solution incentives attacking the infrastructure, by brute Force computation. Any computation no matter how clean the energy is. Certain clean energies simply do not keep up with dirty ones. Solar, or wind, for instance would be very hard pressed to sustain the power consumption of 53k YouTube videos.

I hope we are at a shifting point of understanding climate change is a real problem, even if a bit late. We know we have to get in these clean energies. People's homes, and lives will have to transfer and be powered by these energies. However these energies currently cannot successfully support the grid, legitimate use or otherwise. People having crypto mining PC's running 24/7 does not help things, despite all of the smart ass bs you will hear on Reddit.   
 There is no guarantee that any of the energy used is clean, just with any other application of electricity. 

They will say that US central banking uses three times the electricity use of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has globally maybe around 6mil users the US population is 327mil. Let's just say that Bitcoin has 1/100th the amount of US users. If it became 100% used, that would make the energy usage 300x what the current US central banking system uses. 

Would clean energies even support that amount of use? It would be substantially more difficult transition to achieve. 

I would say this is what the entire blockchain movement is, it's not about more freedom, or actual beneficial systems for society. it's just about profit. You can see this phenomenon as this group, decentralized revolutionaries, that would normally utilize science, irrationally defend and slowly come to deny climate issues, when it conflicts with what they have investments in. They call the legitimate climate research FUD now... 

Now Reddit, I will let you commence your unscientific, economic jargon filled, bot like, social puppeterring, replies and down voting, just for me expressing my opinion and connecting truths and realities.

ejjrp9,SigmaInigma,I stupidly lost ~$3000 in a crypto currency scam.,"**I am an idiot.**

I was browsing Twitter and saw a post that appeared to be Elon Musk tweeting about a ""New Years Crypto Party Giveaway"". I navigated to the website in the tweet and it appeared that Elon Musk was giving away crypto and all you had to do was send in some crypto to verify your wallet address and they would send back what you sent plus up to double what you sent in back. In the moment everything looked legit to me and it seemed that there was a limited amount of time that this would last so **I stupidly and frantically rushed to my CoinBase account and sent 0.4BTC or around $3000 USD.** Immediately after I sent the money I got scared and regretted not doing more verification on my end to verify the giveaway. Low and behold after only a little digging it became very clear that I just got scammed.

Here was the tweet I saw: [https://twitter.com/Eric77461769/status/1213122989480271877?s=20](https://twitter.com/Eric77461769/status/1213122989480271877?s=20)

The website in the tweet was [https://muskfun.info/](https://muskfun.info/) and it appeared to redirect to a legit Medium Article by Elon Musk. I then clicked the Bitcoin giveaway link in the article and it took me here: [https://muskfun.info/btc/](https://muskfun.info/btc/)

The final site I went to is where I was instructed to send the Bitcoin. It looked legit to me at the time and there was a live log of transactions. But had I looked just a little deeper I would have realized so many signs that this was a scam.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I never checked Elon Musks Official Twitter Account to validate that he made this tweet. I just looked at the screenshot that someone else fabricated for this scam. Initially I was a little skeptical but figured I would checkout the website anyway. Elon has been known to do some crazy things.
2. The URL took me to a convincing clone of a Medium Article with Elon Musk as the author but it was actually not a redirect as the URL still said [https://muskfun.info/](https://muskfun.info/) which in its self is a suspicious website name that should have tipped me off. All the comments were raving about how this worked but they were obviously doctored as well.
3. The final website was the same as the Medium article except it had /btc at the end.
4. Countless other things I should have noticed but did not.

I'm upset that I lost my money but I could have lost a lot more. I'm mostly just embarrassed. I'm a Software Developer at a large tech company and even used to work at Geek Squad so I am very familiar with these kind of scams. I never thought something like this would happen to me because I consider myself very tech savvy consumer.

I did some Google searching to see if there was any way for me to get my money back through any legal means or by reporting fraud to Coinbase but as I guessed with Crytpo you are pretty much out of luck.

Thanks for listening to my story. **Feel free to laugh at my expense.** Learn from my mistake. If anyone knows how to give this scammer payback feel free to let me know how!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Here is the log of my transaction: [https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/e806b41205e82452768d1bd7fded2b7e2cfdcd976e469daf07d7a8520f98a930](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/e806b41205e82452768d1bd7fded2b7e2cfdcd976e469daf07d7a8520f98a930)

ek36n1,stickytablet,Recovering wallet from old hard drive?,"Hi.

Bit of background - I remember mining bitcoin on an old laptop.  I'm guessing it was 2010, all I remember is the coins were worth nothing and I thought it was pretty useless. Hence me stopping and forgetting all about it . I've been looking for the laptop for 2 years now and its finally turned up in a box, minus the battery and power adaptor. I have removed the drive and have a IDE hard drive adaptor being delivered tomorrow. What software should I use to recover the files? Can I still recover if the drive is dead? 

I have searched google images of old software and the only one it can be is Bitcoin Core.  Would a wallet of been automatically put on my computer? If I find the wallet file, is it a case of just saving it to my computer, opening it and the keys I need will be in the file? What if I deleted the software, will the wallet still be there? As you can tell I'm not really up to speed with this stuff.

I can't recall if I ever mined a single coin, it's been so long. I just vaguely remember being involved when it all kicked off. The laptop was a top spec Sony Vaio with geforce graphics card, so I could of mined a small percentage of a coin even if I had only ran it for short periods?

Could be a win for me, more than likely a big disappointment lol

First of some backstory and information about my issue.
I'm a swedish citizen that have been buying cryptos for some years but on later days I've been having some issues with depositing funds to crypto exchanges due to that our banks doesn't like this at all. 
They're blocking me out from exchanges bank accounts and claims it's due to the high risks of money laundering. This is my second bank that now have blocked me out from coinbase pro and kraken so I'm not able to buy cryptos. The banks that I'm talking about is 
Swedbank (who is currently under investigation of money laundering themself lol) and another bank called ICA banken.

Is there any other swedes or scandinavians that knows how or where to get your money in to the exchanges?

esspoh,SpockSays,Crazy to consider that the amount of bitcoin holders in the world is still so low.,"This might be a bit rambling, but I was thinking about this a lot very recently and i'm not sure what to make of it. Grateful for any insights you can share...

The global population is over 7 billion people. 

The minted supply of BTC is around/above 18 million.

It is estimated that at least a couple of million BTC are lost forever.

A small amount of individual holders possess vastly large BTC balances. (aka whales)

Most BTC hasn't moved on chain for over a year and is presumably ""not for sale"".

&amp;#x200B;

This is the part that baffles me though:

There are over 45 million ""millionaires"" world wide.

At past and current trading prices, buying just 1 BTC would be a minuscule purchase to this class of wealthy people.

Not to mention the many people world wide who aren't millionaires, but who could also easily afford 1 BTC at past and current trading prices.

&amp;#x200B;

Here we are 10 years after bitcoins launch and it seems as though everyone knows the word ""bitcoin"" even if they don't understand what it actually is or how it works. 

I just find it so surprising that amongst the vast population of humans on earth, so few humans possess any amount of BTC at all, at this point in time.

&amp;#x200B;

Given the fascinating speculative ""number go up"" phenomena of BTC we have witnessed in past growth cycles/bull runs, how is it possible that the global population of wealthy people still have no/little interest in participating in BTC at this stage of the game? 

The ticket to get on the roller coaster is relatively cheap (and divisible to any amount they choose to acquire as per their risk appetite). But again, even at all current and past trading prices, 1 BTC would be cheap for them. 

How are there not more holder in the world?

Let's imagine a perfect scenario- everyone knows for Bitcoin, volume is high, people are spending it and/ or stacking sats. Now, this is **not** a good thing for govs, reasons were mentioned thousands of times on the internet so I will not bother about mentioning all of that again. How to kill Bitcoin, you may ask? Declare it illegal, start the propaganda machine, prosecute people who are mining or using it, shut down mining farms under the accusation of supporting the system that is used by criminals- add a bit of human trafficking, drug dealing and money laundering to the headlines to make it look justifiable in the eyes of average Joe. After all of that, hashing power will probably go to 20% of what is now. Next step, seize the ASICS and conduct a 51% attack. Congrats, no more BTC. You may say that your rights are hurt, but CCP (Communist Party of China) doesn't give a fuck.

There is a cryptocurrency that could survive a ""mass extinction"" of that kind. It's called [Idena](https://idena.io/) and it's **truly** unstoppable. It's using a novel protocol called ""Proof of Person"". In order to mine it, you must prove (validate) that you are actually a human being, all **without** 3rd party or personally identifiable documents (aka KYC). How to prove that you're actually a human being? Currently, validation days happen a few times a month, and validations start at the same time all over the globe- New York is at 9:30AM, Berlin is at 3:30PM and Sydney is at 11:30PM. Validations involve solving a user-made flips- flips are user made captchas that are impossible to solve by machines- because they involve abstract thinking and emotions, which only humans have. Incentive to make flips is simple- to validate on next validation day you must make 3 flips which will be randomly distributed to other users on the next validation day. Idena introduces sybil resistance by limiting the time of validations, you can validate yourself on one node, it's almost impossible for one person to have two nodes. All mining rewards are split equally to every miner, so there is no concentration of hashing power, mining farms are impossible and stopping/ censoring is **impossible** because Idena can work on any 64bit OS- Windows, Linux, MacOS and even Raspberry Pi- Computing power is irrelevant and it will be irrelevant forever! To stop Idena, governments must ban computers, from all people who are running this most decentralized and democratic currency on the globe! Sounds like an impossible task to me.
