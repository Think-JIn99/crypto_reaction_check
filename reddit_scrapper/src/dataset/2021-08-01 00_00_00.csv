So if any one can answer my question below I would greatly appreciate it! Ok, no on to the million dollar question:

Why is it that when bitcoin dips, all other coins dip? But when Alt coin ""A"" dips, bitcoin does not dip? Many alt coins are complete shit and can lose all their value very quickly, however those events do not seem to have an impact on bitcoin. But, when bitcoin is down it seems like the majority of alt coins are also affected. This makes absolutely no sense to me. So lets just say the FUD from the Spring about China and Elon made prices plummet for Bitcoin and the altcoins. Why would Elon talking about Bitcoin and China banning Bitcoin mining affect other coin prices as well? Makes no fucking sense.

Does anyone have a good explanation for this or can point me to a good source to learn more about this?",1628787085,15,1

p78lat,throwaway29801A,I didn't know where to post this-am I going crazy?,"I am watching what is going on in Afghanistan. My ex's family lives in Taiwan. I ask my parents if they think Taiwan will be backed up by the US. In his heart, my dad says for sure. In his head, he's not sure (I ask him: If I lived in Taiwan with my ex, would you tell me to stay or go? He can't say). My mom says we will not back Taiwan.

I'm Jewish. I ask for my history. I've never asked too far. Both great grandparents came here in the early 1900s because of pogroms/anti-semitism. What's so scary is so many stayed. Even during the 30s, many stayed. We couldn't believe that our neighbors would really do what many ended up doing. Apparently distant relatives in Europe were put alive, in a well, and a big stone sealed on top, left to run out of water.

I'm prone to thinking the worst happens. On a scale of 1-10, I'm a 9. Maybe a 9.5. I have to be honest and tell myself it's not that bad. Am I crazy? Or is the United States, and in fact the world, a few misunderstandings away from ww3? I'm in california and I'm neither red nor blue but I think people here have lost their fucking marbles.

Is the economic system actually close to collapse, and due to the upcoming retirement crisis, and the fact that the average 32 year old has negative net worth, and the average 39 year old only having $100k of net worth, fortell a government that will never stop printing and rates to go negative. Are we setting ourselves up for a bubble so big even the government can't contain it (sometime between 2031-2040)?

Have our leaders become jokes? Does wall street rule this country now semi-officially?

Cryptography and hashing was used by the NSA in the late 90s and probably adopted technology to start blockchain technology.

Palantir, also backed heavily by Thiel recently bought gold, and not Bitcoin. He clearly knows something we don’t…

The way I see it, it's worth taking a look at why crypto is a rock-solid tool and why the same kinds of vulnerabilities don't apply to it.

It could be worth noting that centralised systems are chronically vulnerable to attacks and that decentralisation could be part of a solution (whatever shape or form that could take).

But alas the piece doesn't go there. It remains on the surface and reaches no meaningful conclusions.

Life is short-we think we will all live long. Tons of us die before 50. This doesn't mean live only for today. It means go after your dreams. Minimize regret.

Take controlled risk-this is probably my biggest mistake. I did great with real estate, but I took the ""big one"" too late. I'm glad that I did, but if I had done it earlier I would be way better off.  Not taking risk = risk. YOU WILL NOT BECOME WEALTHY BY PLAYING IT SAFE ALL THE TIME. YOU WILL ALSO BECOME POOR BY GAMBLING.

There won't be a meltdown. I like the idea of gold, but there won't be worldwide chaos. Instead, wealth gets transferred. Understand there is always money being made.

Tech and exponentially growing networks rule-I didn't understand exponential math when I was younger. Find an investment that has real upside. Investing in factories that make widgets doesn't work anymore.

Go on your computer right now and download your expenses from last month. How much did you spend? How much of it was nonsense. Reduce it 50% -challenge yourself-and put this money in bitcoin or something you want long term.

Consumption is overrated for the small items and underrated for the big items.

It's trite, but do NOT time the market. An investment is a 5 year term, minimum. Most people lose because they want big gains too fast.

Be able to explain 3 reasons that are bearish against your investment and also be able to explain why you think they are wrong. Example:

1. Bitcoin will be banned by governments. Surprise, I think this is actually true. I do believe China will outright ban btc within 5 years. However, Europe and the US cannot due to their structure (yellen and legarde would if they could).

2. Alt-coins will take away market share from bitcoin. Surprise! I agree. However, like gold, the need of a SOV will flow to bitcoin. I do not believe that multiple SOVs exist in any market. Dollar, gold, etc. There is usually one. I also see the crypto system using BTC as the settlement layer as it's rules are well established and in code.

3. Tether will bring down the entire system. I think tether has problems and the market share being taken by other stablecoins is telling. However, should Tether be found to be a fraud, all the money would flood as fast as possible to buying btc, not selling it. People get rid of bs assets as fast as possible before they become worthless.

I have no problem selling people on bitcoin nowadays when they’re willing to have an actual thoughtful conversation.  They also understand that running your own node is a solid guarantee to keep your coins safe, but most people don’t care to run a node.  The idea of having a bank account on a “flash drive” in your pocket is extremely sexy, but it sounds too good to be true without giving a highly technical explanation of how it’s safe.

This applies to any hardware wallet, not just Ledger.  That’s just the example I’m using.  When I ask people “how can you be certain your coins are safe on a hardware wallet from a centralized entity?” they usually can’t tell me.

- We have a novel and unproven business model.
- Masterworks issuers do not expect to generate revenue, so investors will only recognize a return on their investment if the painting is eventually sold at a profit
- No market exists for the shares and paintings are highly illiquid, so you must be prepared to hold your investment for an indefinite period.
- Each Issuer owns a single painting and this lack of diversification magnifies risk.
- Your ability to trade or sell your shares is highly uncertain.
- Paintings may be sold at a loss.
- Costs will diminish returns.
- Investing in art is subject to numerous risks, including (i) claims with respect to authenticity or provenance, (ii) physical damage, (iii) legal challenges to ownership, (iv) market risks, (v) economic risks and (vi) fraud.
- Issuers are totally reliant on Masterworks.
- Masterworks has potential conflicts of interest.
- Timing of sale of a painting is uncertain.
BEFORE INVESTING IN ANY MASTERWORKS OFFERING, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE “RISK FACTORS” SECTION OF THE APPLICABLE OFFERING CIRCULAR FILED WITH THE SEC AND AVAILABLE ON THE SITE OR AT WWW.SEC.GOV. In addition, you should consult your own counsel, accountant and other advisors as to legal, tax, business, financial, and related aspects of an investment in a Masterworks offering”.

It will trade as [$kBTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24kBTC&amp;src=cashtag_click) on the Kadenaswap Universal AMM infrastructure and the [@KaddeXofficial](https://twitter.com/KaddeXofficial) DEX.

Kadenaswap technology leverages Kadena’s scalable Proof-of-Work blockchain to ensure that the Kaddex DEX can handle extremely large amounts of trading volume.

This is done under a tenet that no matter how fast a layer-1 blockchain is today, if it can’t scale to multiple chains, it will inevitably hit a brick wall and face symptoms like slow performance and high transaction fees.

Kadena’s core decentralized technology parries this through a combination of security, scalability, and safety to bring an “industrial-scale” operation to crypto: fast performance and practically free gas fees.

We're excited to be working with Kadena to bring the most popular assets in the space to their network, starting with Wrapped Bitcoin.

But once I get up to size to be able and offer loans to people, I want to offer them a plan where they can pay back in Bitcoin. The plan would include the Bitcoin payments being locked and HODL’d in a yield earning payments account, with an option to pay off the entire loan should the paid Bitcoin grow enough to pay for the loans balance. Whatever the difference of the Bitcoin’s value is after after the loans principle balance and Interest is paid off will be sent back into their accounts to keep and do with what they may.

I'm confused because I can open open the Bitcoin Core desktop software and send a transaction that is expected to be confirmed within 20 minutes for 0.00001015 BTC which is  \~$0.45. I tested this several times and it is correct.

  
Bitcoinfees.earn.com tells me that the average price is calculated by  


current satoshis per byte transaction fee \* transaction size in bytes \* bitcoins per satoshi \* bitcoin per USD price

  
so for me that would be

102 satoshis per byte \* 141 byte transaction \* 0.00000001 bitcoin per satoshi \* $45,000 USD / bitcoin

ox6gx8,Danielpxp,Crypto-backed loan?,"Crypto backed loans are over-collateralized. That means you put up more collateral than the loan you take out. Fo example at BlockFi you can get a loan with an LTV of 30 or 50% or MyConstant with LTV of 67% (up to my research). That means if you put in 100k worth of bitcoin, you can take out a loan of up to 67k.

The upside of the overcollaterized loan is that your monthly payments are interest only and the principal is due back at the end of the loan. So, you put $100k in, and take out 67k to live on or buy a car with or whatever. Through the year you’re making interest payments. No taxes, no principal.

At the end of the year, bitcoin has gone up 100%. Your bitcoin collateral is now worth 200k. You refinance your loan (take out a new loan and pay off the old one) of 100k. That gives you a new 67k to do whatever with. Rinse and repeat. Towards the end of each loan, you take out more cash against your ever-appreciating bitcoin. Along the way you are only ever paying interest.

For bonus points, pay the interest with the borrowed money. As long as the price of bitcoin is always higher at the end of the period than at the start, you can do this forever and never have to sell your bitcoin (and incur the taxes) or pay back the principal on the loan.

This doesnt just work for bitcoin, you can do this with real estate, a stock portfolio, art, etc.

I have recently noticed the ETF isn't tracking the coin the same way. In the ETf, the price may go up by 7%, when the coin has gone up by 12 %. I understand the ETf is supposed to track the coin it holds and issues shares to the investors at a certain rate.. (it varies per ETF). 

Capital gains tax is something we don't pay if it's in the ETF (but you do pay MER which is usually 0.75 - 1.5 %) and you can choose unhedged versus hedged....so From purely an investment POV, which do you choose? Coin or ETF? Thoughts?",1628005382,2,1

These bonds would have to yield a coupon and interest to the lender at the end right ?

But unlike fiat, BTC has a limited supply - so then doesn't this all fall apart assuming everyone across the globe is borrowing BTC ? (as there will never be enough BTC to pay back the interest in BTC)

Correct me if I am wrong but the only way this can be squared is by the BTC value always going up. This would mean that really the borrower would just pay back the SAME amount of BTC which would now be worth more and act like as if interest was actually paid back to the lender.",1627993914,10,1

With Bitcoin’s current market price at $38,500, this means that a total of $3.85 billion worth of BTC are leaving centralized exchanges monthly.

The exchange net position change metric is an on-chain analytic metric used to map out the monthly rate of coins flowing in (green) or out (red) of all exchanges. The Bitcoin exchange net position change is used to measure the demand and supply of Bitcoin going in and out of centralized exchanges. If Bitcoin leaves centralized exchanges, it means there is an accumulation (Demand) of the flagship cryptocurrency but when there is more Bitcoin on centralized exchanges, it means there is a low demand for the coin.",1627990871,18,1

So, one more time for the folks in the back! Call and tweet at your Senators and tell them to support the cryptocurrency amendment to the infrastructure bill. Call 517-200-9518 and you will be connected to your Senators offices.  

**If you haven't called yet, do it now.** **If you already called your Senator to reject the Warner amendment CALL AGAIN to tell your Senators to support amending the current cryptocurrency provision!**

**When a staff member answers, tell them:**

“Hi, I’m calling to ask that you support amending the cryptocurrency provision of the infrastructure bill, and in the future protect the human rights and privacy potential of decentralized technologies. Policies that impact basic freedom and the future of the Internet should be debated carefully and should never be attached to must-pass bills. Thank you.”

ES no-coiners are still skeptical. At present, I’ve only done transactions in El Zonte (AKA BTC Beach). Outside of El Zonte, I haven’t done any BTC transactions. On September 7, I expect less than 1% of ES transactions will be BTC. That’s enough to sustain an exponential, parabolic growth. Media will call it a failure. 12 months later it will be amazing. One hotel charged me 5% for using my visa. They wouldn’t accept Bitcoin. My Sat transactions seem to be 10 to 30 basis points. (.1 of 1%) Salvadorans will not pass on that kind of savings. It’s just an education cycle. Sorry to say, but that will take time. A year after September 7 will be amazing.

p16gy0,cjwin1977,How you can help support the Bitcoin network (Hint: it's not by running a node),"I see a lot of posts about wanting to ‘support the network’ by running a node. In reality, your motivation to run a node should be to use Bitcoin in a more sovereign and private way, not to ‘support the network.’ Running a full node particularly in the configuration that projects like umbrel utilize, does almost nothing to support the network. 

There are, however, multiple ways you can support the network. What has been increasingly clear through the negotiations of the infrastructure bill is that the Treasury department explicitly wants very broad, open ended definitions of the term ‘broker.’ This is so they can have widespread and sweeping control if necessary on stopping certain areas of development and use. **Keep in mind this: Is it not the value or the price of Bitcoin that threatens the traditional banking and financial structure. It is the ability it affords individuals to be sovereign over their wealth.** If individuals can hold their wealth outside of banking institutions, not only does this pose a great threat to the commercial banks ability to profit from holding your money for near worthless interest rates, but more importantly, it completely undermines the ability of central banks to exercise capital controls. Whether it’s obvious or not yet, the government and regulators will fight, tooth and nail, for a world in which only regulated exchanges and banks can offer and hold Bitcoin and other digital assets. Bitcoin is nothing if it’s not permissionless, borderless and censorship resistant. 

If you really want to ‘support the network’ then contribute towards the sovereign, circular Bitcoin economy. Focus on making individual, non-custodial holding of bitcoin the standard so that the supply of Bitcoin is so widespread and so distributed that the genie cannot go back in the bottle. 

A few steps that EVERYONE should take: 

1. **Take all your money off exchanges.** At some point all exchanges will function like Robinhood where you can only buy and sell. Don’t be caught without the ability to control your wealth. 

2. **Coin-join your Bitcoin.** This is IMMENSELY important. The power the government and regulators have to exercise control over aspects of the protocol rely on the ability to have directly associated identities to addresses and transactions. This is a herd immunity situation. If a large percentage of on chain transaction are coin-joined, it will break the heuristics they use to follow and trace payments. I recommend Whirlpool or Join-market implementations. Hopefully I can recommend Wasabi once the details of their WabiSabi implementation is available. 

Here is a great series on understanding on chain privacy by the Samourai team: https://medium.com/oxt-research/understanding-bitcoin-privacy-with-oxt-part-1-4-8177a40a5923

3. **NEVER sell to an exchange.** If you want/need to sell your bitcoin then use a P2P platform such as Bisq OR find a friend/neighbor to sell to. Every satoshi you sell to an exchange is another satoshi that can, at anytime, be locked up and taken out of the Bitcoin circular economy. Don’t do it. 

Here is a good intro to using Bisq: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LyEKA5Iq9I

4. **Mine your own Bitcoin.** The trend towards institutionalized mining operations in the US is a dangerous one. More and more these miners are becoming regulated, publicly traded entities. Regulatory arbitrage mitigates this risk but the more we can create a network of off the grid, small time miners, no matter how small, the better. 

Here is a great resource by Diverter if anyone is interested: https://diverter.hostyourown.tools/mining-for-the-streets/

Keep in mind that all of the steps I’ve listed are perfectly legal ways of interacting with Bitcoin. This is the fight that was always coming. While shitcoins will incentivize 3rd party custody of their token to collect staking rewards, you can help to ensure that Bitcoin will always be a sovereign asset. 

Keep up the fight",1628531154,11,1

Here’s my logic: I’ve posted on it before but I think people are beginning to wake up and realize how they’ve been scammed and their wealth is taken away as the money printer purrs whenever a politician has a “good idea” and taps the federal reserve button (neither federal nor a reserve).

If the awakening continues and more people adopt Bitcoin than traditional bank accounts and fiat currency…. Eventually, some financial institutions will suffer. I’m wondering…

What happens to traditional debt instruments and/or debt financed assets?

Debt in usd itself?

Some considerations I have…
If I go full Bitcoin I can transact with whoever I want whenever I want and no one can stop me (well, at least that’s the goal)


However… let’s say, I see enough people doing that ^ enough to make me confident that I won’t need to pay off a car or house or whatever in terms of fiat currency. The banks come after me, maybe get gov to lock down traditional accounts. But I don’t care, I’m not even using those. If my place of residence/domicile/gov tries coming after me… I just shrug my shoulders and say I have nothing to pay with.

To be clear: I am not suggesting anyone to take on debt and with the intent to not pay it back. What I’m wondering is…. If enough fed up people tried to do something like this… what would be the result? What actions or extents would banks and governments go to?

p50hh0,throwaway29801A,Batman is trying to save Gotham,"If you are born in a first world country, your reality is normal. The reality is your reality is not normal compared to 90% of the population.

The people at the top do not give a flying rat's ass about society. They care about their rich friends and keeping the system afloat. They will do everything in their power to keep it this way. The big difference is the internet-it has allowed the lies and deception to be shared amongst the common person.

Here are my guesses over the next ten years-what do you think?

This will NOT be the last stimulus -ie direct money sent to people. Delta will slow down the economy and there will be another stimulus bill of $600 per person next year. There will be at least 3 more direct payments in the next decade.

You will start seeing mass migration out of cities like San Francisco and the bad parts of los angeles because car jackings and muggings will skyrocket. Most people still believe these cities have hope (ie Batman for gotham).

The stock market will NOT fall-any downturn that breaks 10% will be met by the cbs.

Debasement will continue but most people will accept it. You see most people are now addicts-their addictive phone allows them to order addictive substances that are delivered to them. Many 25-40 year old males spend more time on tinder/instagram/sports gambling then working. 9/10 people you know will accept not owning homes and that apartment life is fine.

Miami will DOUBLE in real estate value within 10 years. I intend to move there. 

By the end of 2022, 5 S&amp;P 500 companies will own bitcoin. I do believe bitcoin goes parabolic and crashes, but not as bad as before. By 2025 50 S&amp;P 30 companies will own it. Most will still refuse as their boards are comprised of very old people. Don't believe me? I know a bank that until two years ago sent paperwork with fax, not email. 

Bitcoin will be at least 250k by 2025. Many alternatives will exist because btc will be viewed as too expensive. Like it or not, people live in small condos because they can't afford to buy a home. The home on the water outperforms the condo in appreciation.

Real social unrest-like people shooting each other in standoffs in the street, attacking police, will be commonplace around 2030. It will take a while for the wealth inequality to truly blow up.

Panic buying won't really happen until bitcoin breaks and holds 100k. Then something truly insane happens.",1629057331,8,1

&gt; &gt; I never knew how this actually DOES make a difference.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;You don't even need to say the paragraph, you can say some simplified short sentence like ""I support this amendment to this act"". An intern answering your call will add a tally to ""support this amendment to this act"" to the call report that is sent to the congressional leader and their staffers. It is an email containing numbers of how many people called about what. We can really work together to make this staggering.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;True, there may be some senators that are being disgustingly lobbied out of their decisions. But there are also those who are genuinely interested/confused on cryptocurrency and this shows them the general public consensus to support.

The original bill submitted by Senators Portman and Sinema was terrible, and enabled mass-surveillance of the entire crypto-economy.

Fortunately, Senators Wyden, Toomey, and Lummis introduced an amendment that would fix the language and clarify that the expansion of the definition of a “broker” doesn’t apply to open source software developers or validators like miners or stakers. 

Unfortunately, last night Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema introduced a separate amendment that would make the original bill even worse! The White House has come out in support of this bad amendment, and many within the senate are hailing is as a ""compromise"", but in reality it's even worse than the original bill. Their amendment would kill off PoS validators, DEXs, DeFi, &amp; many other entities in the crypto-economy. Don't let this sneak attack slip through!

If you've already called in support of the Wyden amendment, CALL AGAIN to tell your Senators to REJECT the Warner amendment!","There is a massive fight going down in the Senate right now over which direction they will take in regards to cryptocurrencies. The original bill submitted by Senators Portman and Sinema was terrible, and enabled mass-surveillance of the entire crypto-economy. 

Fortunately, Senators Wyden, Toomey, and Lummis introduced an amendment that would fix the language and clarify that the expansion of the definition of a “broker” doesn’t apply to open source software developers or validators like miners or stakers. 

Unfortunately, last night Senators Warner, Portman, and Sinema introduced a separate amendment that would make the original bill even worse! The White House has come out in support of this bad amendment, and many within the senate are hailing is as a ""compromise"", but in reality it's even worse than the original bill. Their amendment would kill off PoS validators, DEXs, DeFi, &amp; many other entities in the crypto-economy. Don't let this sneak attack slip through!

**We must tell our senators to vote NO on the Warner-Portman-Sinema amendment and vote YES on the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment!** 

**If you already called in support of the Wyden amendment, CALL AGAIN to tell your Senators to REJECT the Warner amendment!**

**Call your Senators right now at 517-200-9518. We'll connect you to their offices and guide you through the process.**

**When a staff member answers, tell them:**

“Hi, I’m calling to ask that you support the Wyden-Toomey-Lummis amendment to the cryptocurrency provision of the infrastructure bill (H.R. 3684) .

Not only because of the anti-crypto legislation they sneakily slipped into it because they know it wouldn't pass on its own, but because the bill itself is nothing compared to what really needs to happen with infrastructure in America. Make no mistake, the entire bill is shit. It's a watered-down version of a much larger bill that was way more expansive and did more for Americans. The U.S. Senate, for all intents and purposes, is anti-democratic and representative democracy has been dead in the U.S. for a long time. This is part of a larger agenda nationwide to gut voting rights to make it harder to remove these sellouts and cartel henchmen from power.

The U.S. is a failed experiment and that becomes more and more clear every year. It doesn't matter who is in power, because they don't allow truth-tellers to get into power. They will lie incessantly about politicians who actually want to do right by the people and dumb fucks in America who don't do their own research will believe it.

So yes, they are scared shitless of crypto because THEY CAN'T CONTROL IT. The whole idea of decentralism terrifies them and they're afraid that as their system collapses (which it will), people will abandon it in droves for decentralized democracy and autonomous societies.

oz98up,xcryptogurux,Why proof of work is non-negotiable,"Now if you understood Bitcoin, if you REALLY understood Bitcoin, you understand why proof-of-work is fundamental to its design, you understand why it's indispensable for any public, permissionless blockchain that's serious about decentralization.

I could write all day as to why but I don't mean to waste anybody's time for something so rudimentary that there couldn't possibly be an argument about this. I'll keep this as clear and concise as possible.

**Fundamentally Flawed Fiat Money**

Let's take a first-principles approach to why we have Bitcoin.

What exactly was Satoshi trying to solve that he, as many cypherpunks who contributed to what eventually became Bitcoin, thought for decades was fundamentally broken about money? Trust.

Trust is a consequence of centralized, focused issuance and control of monetary supply, exacerbated by the trivial cost of issuance.

While issuance entails no cost, the money remains at the mercy of the basest of human qualities, self-seeking greed. All corruptive tendencies of fiat money are a direct consequence of the trivial cost to issue infinite money.

So the two fundamental flaws of the fiat system Bitcoin solved were trivial cost of issuance and centralized, focused injection of money aka Cantillon Effect.

**Satoshi's Ingenious Solution**

Satoshi's PoW algorithm solved for them by implementing an ingenious cost of creation/issuance algorithm that forever somehow scales in proportion with Bitcoin's value to humanity as a trustless global monetary network and ensuring that the cost incurred in creating money prohibited the recipients of the new injection of money from hoarding it all.

Nothing would prevent Bitcoin miners from hoarding the bitcoins they mine if they weren't required to cover recurring real-world costs. These costs also scale in perfect proportion with the network's value, would you believe it?

**A** **Fatal Compromise**

Proof-of-stake is a hermetic system abstracted from any interface with the real world that walks back on these two solutions. It is little more than a regression back to the fiat paradigm, if not worse.

Further, any proof-of-stake coin, even those that were not launched with an ICO and/or premine, would qualify as a yield generating asset, meaning that the SEC would have every authority to regulate proof-of-stake blockchains.

One man's momentary ingenuity, humanity's timeless inheritance.

Let's not be so foolish as a race to throw it all away to slake the self-seeking greed of private companies that launched unfairly and privately issued for themselves all the native tokens at launch and masquerade through crafty social engineering chicanery today as anything even remotely resembling Bitcoin.",1628264656,95,1

p93tip,BitcoinCanSaveUsAll,I guess it was only a matter of time...,"It would appear that the legacy finance / banksters crew have finally gotten in deep. Deep enough that they have now seemingly colluded with the major wallet manufacturers (hardware and now apparently software too) and have taken our ability to verify we have key ownership of bitcoin. Specifically, what I'm referring to the ability to perform P2PKH message signing and verification. 

This has been a major concern of mine now for many months however it really dawned on me just now as I just upgraded my ColdCard MK3 to the latest firmware and realized the ability to sign P2PKH messages has been removed (as far as I can tell anyway). Unfortunately, this is the third hardware wallet I know of that has removed this critical feature of sovereignty in the bitcoin realm after Ledger and then Trezor. 

Next I went into Mycelium and noticed it now only has the feature to verify but not to sign messages anymore! Well guys, let me tell you something, if we lose this then they truly can control the price of our bitcoin in USD / fiat because there is no other message signing standard that has true Non-repudiation besides the ECDSA based message signing for P2PKH legacy addresses.

The only way to beat them now is to go back to paper wallets you roll with your dice generated entropy. As long as they don't take this feature away from bitcoin core we still have a shot and this. 

It's truly disheartening to see that all of these major wallet producers are apparently in the banksters pockets. I can't see how it would be possible that all of the big hardware and software wallets mysteriously delete this critical feature otherwise. In fact I believe that with these wallet providers taking away the only Non-repudiation signing of messages that is quite likely an attack on the protocol so derivatives and paper trading can hijack the price of BTC. 

Either way if we are going to have our peaceful revolution with bitcoin then we need to have a more educated, informed, vocal, and active core of HODLers that puts in the time to do the work and HOLD in their own addresses and not relying on the mainstream wallets that remove these absolutely essential features. 

Between what I described above, and the new regulatory attacks in the US, it truly seems as though the ""Then they fight you"" stage has begun and is in full swing.  Let's all get to the ""Then you win!"" part together!",1629597087,36,1

I just took my new ColdCard (MK3) out and set it up as per the instructions on the website. All seemed good and I exported the newly generated wallet to the microsd card for PSBT operations. I should also note that the MK3 was never plugged into my computer and the only way it had power was via the cable that I ordered from coinkite and it was plugged into the wall from a charger. That said I see that after creating the exported file to my microsd, it now has the red LED lit up rather than the genuine green LED. Unfortunately I noticed this after sending a few bucks to one of the new addresses generated from the device. Either way I was hoping the community here could help me with a few questions:

1. Do you know why the LED would be red and state caution? I haven't updated any firmware and as noted above it was lit up as genuine initially. I probably should also note that when I first attempted to create a Electrum wallet it froze so I had to unplug it, then regenerate the file and it seemed to work perfectly.

2) How does one verify the backup BIP39 seed words on the MK3?

Note:  I should also mention that I tried something called secure logout under the advanced settings. I'm not sure exactly what this did and if perhaps it may have affected the led indication for some reason.

Thanks all.

p922bi,ml1978,"Prediction model from 2015. Bitcoin prices in 2027: $1M, 2034: $10M. 2045: $100M","There is an old prediction model/figure from 2015, you can find it at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqs-HP8rb5I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqs-HP8rb5I)

Also in 2014 at [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=831547.msg9293359#msg9293359](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=831547.msg9293359#msg9293359)

The numbers are of course very rough estimates. Still, quite impressive predictions. Today's estimated number is about $0.1M, for the sake of simplicity the following computations assume $0.1M in January  2022.

One can observe that the price makes 10x after a period of time, the length of this period increases by a factor of 1.41x in every new ""cycle"" (it does not necessarily correspond to a cycle).

According to this model, BTC is expected to be in order of $1M in 2026-2027. Then $10M in 2034 and $100M in 2045.

Because of the 1.41x multiplier, it will take about 5+ years from today's estimated $0.1M to $1M and then again about 7 years to $10M. In total, it will take about 12-13 years from now to go from $0.1M to $10M. However, due to the 1.41 multiplier, it will take about 25 years to make the next 100x. Eventually, the growth rate will stagnate. If we compute it for 2150, it will be about 6-7% per year.

Today's total world wealth is about $431 trillion or about $23M per bitcoin. Assuming the world wealth will grow at 7% (the old rate for money printing). According to the model above, bitcoin market cap would achieve the world wealth value in 2045. Instead, if the money printing will accelerate to say 10% per year, then the parity will be achieved in about 2070.

One should remember that that to achieve say $100 trillion market cap, bitcoin does not need $100 trillions invested in it. The actual number is of course unknown, but it might be in order of a few percent of the target market cap.

Even $10M in 2034 might seem astronomical. However, if the current trend will continue then $10M of 2034 will correspond to about $4M of today (given 7% ""true"" inflation of assets/stocks) or $3M of today (given 10% ""true"" inflation of assets/stocks).

Here, I am just writing about numbers if the price will follow the model created in 2014. Of course, I have no idea what will actually happen with BTC or $.",1629590147,0,3

p90mj5,DestructorEFX,What 3 years of buying Bitcoin looks like! - Data Analysis,"Hi guys! I’ve been buying and holding Bitcoin for almost 3 years now. I manage my Bitcoin investments in Excel and I really like to play around and analyze the data, since I’m currently studying statistical analysis. So I want to show you some interesting analysis and I hope it inspire you to do something similar!

A few things before starting:

*•	All the data that you’ll see here is with the price of 1 Bitcoin equals to* ***$ 49.000,00;***

*•	Everything is measured in percentage for privacy reasons;*

*•	In my country we use comma for the decimal separator and use period to separate groups of thousands;*

*•	English is not my main language, so it could have some misspelling;*

&amp;#x200B;

Let’s begin with the amount of money that I invested and the average price per Bitcoin in each year:

https://preview.redd.it/9r5mactecsi71.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef18af1cd09dfa7f4bda5244258d2f12dd00dcd5

In 2019 is where everything started, Bitcoin was my first investment ever. It only accounts for 4% of all the money with an average price of $ 6.345,69. In 2020 is when the pandemic hit and changed my perception, things started to click on my mind, understanding what money is, the true nature of Bitcoin and how it would impact my life and the life of others. It’s 4x more money than 2019, accounting for 16% of all the money at an average price of $ 14.783,91. Now 2021 I went completely bananas, not only I sold a lot of things that I didn’t needed (like my gaming chair and guitar) to buy more Bitcoin, I also got a fix job, meaning more money flowing into Bitcoin. It’s 5x more money than 2020 accounting for 80% of all the money at an average price of $ 40.962,99. Now to the juicy stuff, profit:

 

https://preview.redd.it/qixz1l3lcsi71.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7359120c4b687893bdadcb169c59fe5ca69f77f9

As expected, because 2019 has the lowest avg. price it has the biggest appreciation in price currently at 672%, followed by 2020 with 232%, and 2021 with only 20%. But let’s join both charts to get the full picture and compare those gains proportionally with the money invested:

 

https://preview.redd.it/xvw38zxvcsi71.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7283df792149a9d2e8f14b405df2fc269eeb8e49

Now things are starting to look beautiful, isn’t it? The most interesting data is the % in yellow above the columns: it’s the total amount of Bitcoin bought in each year. So even though 2019 I only invested 4% of my money, its responsible for 18% of all my Bitcoin! On the contrary, in 2021 I invested 80% of my money but it represents 53%. Adding the 2019 and 2020 equals to 47%. So, with only 20% of my money invested it represents almost half of my BTC! Another interesting chart to analyze is if you pick only the profits of each year and how much it is responsible for and compare it.

 

https://preview.redd.it/1njld6m7dsi71.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=858cb4d323a309e471b8464da823f7fed0a56892

Interestingly 2020 has the highest profit of all at 45%, followed by 2019 at 35% and 2021 at 20%. But of course, if the Bitcoin price keeps increasing, the % profits in 2021 will grow larger and surpass the other years because it has more money invested.

To finish this analysis, in total I bought at an avg. price of $27.153,88 per Bitcoin currently at 80,5% in profit as shown here: 

https://preview.redd.it/hu4xbzobdsi71.png?width=606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd8016c96ce2b8d3c909155d68edb9720799940c

In conclusion, if there’s one takeaway I believe this is the one: “Time in the market beats timing the market.” I never traded BTC, for me trading is astrology of investment. You can trade for years looking at price and charts patterns and learn nothing about Bitcoin. Patience is key, I holded for only 3 years but want to hold for much longer. I don’t even consider Bitcoin as an investment anymore, is more like saving account where I store my wealth. I hope you liked this analysis!

p8zc5b,WooWooParadise,What do you think of paying taxes on installment to stack more sats?,"I'm steadily self-employed and generally set aside about 20% of my gross revenue for taxes. I'm a long-term HODLer and am mighty inclined to request a tax installment agreement from the IRS, put that cash into stacking sats, and pay the monthly agreement amount out of income (or selling sats if absolutely necessary).

Any experts correct me if I'm wrong, but here's what I gather: the IRS offers no-questions-asked installment agreements to pretty much anyone who applies who owes &lt;$50K, on 72-month terms for .25% interest per month plus .25% late penalty per month (this works out to 6.16% per year compounded.) Additional tax years can be added as long as the total remains &lt;$50K. As far as I can tell this is not tax fraud- the IRS doesn't ask why you need the installment; you're just paying your tax over time by agreement, with an extra 6.16% to the IRS.

I feel confident that BTC will go up more than 6.16% annualized over any 6 year period (lol!). As long as I can make monthly payments from present income, there is no risk of liquidation if BTC tanks. If for some reason my present income can't cover monthly payments some months (not super common, as I have a wide, consistent client base that is relatively inelastic to the wider economy), I can sell small amounts of BTC each month. So worst-case scenario, it seems to me, is selling small amounts of BTC at 50-80% loss for some months if low income for a few months coincides with a big BTC drawdown.

Am I missing something? Why would this be a bad idea? Seems to me, if the IRS wants to offer me $50K of leverage at 6.16%, with low liquidation risk given my income, that's a good bet. Thoughts?",1629580092,11,1

pb7szg,virtuallymixed,My Bitcoin Story - OR: What to do with cash from sold real estate,"Hi guys! I'm in crypto technically since about 2011 and so normally you'd think I'm already a multiple millionaire, but no, my portfolio is quite modest for that amount of time. To give you the gist of it, I bought 15 BTC with 300€, bought a butterfly labs ASIC with more or less the full amount when it was around 100$ per BTC, it came shitloads of months later and I was able to re-mine just 4 BTC, sold some in the following crash and sit with around 20 currencies at pretty precisely 60k$ today. As said pretty modest. But this was just to kind of introduce myself and the dumbest financial decision of my lifetime (up until now). Now to the actual content of my question:

So completely separate from that we - my wife and I - bought a small house in 2015, without using a single Satoshi of crypto (which up until now we never really did cash in anyway because of that tremendous trauma of selling BTC at 100$..) and bought a new - big one, double the space, plus this time standalone - house this year and have still just today received 75k€ from the bank after paying off the complete mortgage of the old one. The housing prices here in Europe are just so insane at the moment that people offered to buy at near double the price of what the old house was worth in 2015.

So because the house paid well we have a very modest mortgage - even without putting the 75k$ in it and we both have relatively good and stable jobs. Not 10k per month good, but about half (before taxes, so around quarter ;|) so still without paying off the mortgage we have around 1000€ for pure living and even around 1000€ for saving per month. Anyway we figure we are really bad with crypto-decisions, we know that putting this kind of money in crypto is a good idea even medium term, but for us it's still so much money, it's so damn hard to pull the trigger - remember, up until now, our investment in crypto technically is 300€ - putting thousands, even 10s of thousands in it is unheard off for us. So I guess what I'm asking is, would you recommend putting a substantial - if not the whole amount of 75k€ in crypto right now and what currency? I don't follow it much but is there new good news/bad news from regulators? And which coin? I have around 0.85 in BTC which I am holding since a few years now so I'm tending towards ETH which we largely missed out on up until now. Reasons for this being a good/bad idea? And I know this is a ""crypto-nut"" space so I'm aware people here will be biased towards investment and I too really actually just wanna do it and watch my money grow but I'm also secretly hoping there will be - not too many just 1 or 2 - people who recommend against it with decent argumentation just for the balance :)",1629884057,20,1

Eventually at most only 21 million coins for 6.8 billion people in the world if it really gets huge.

But don't worry, there are another 6 decimal places that aren't shown, for a total of 8 decimal places internally. It shows 1.00 but internally it's 1.00000000. If there's massive deflation in the future, the software could show more decimal places.

If it gets tiresome working with small numbers, we could change where the display shows the decimal point.  Same amount of money, just different convention for where the "",""'s and "".""'s go.  e.g. moving the decimal place 3 places would mean if you had 1.00000 before, now it shows it as 1,000.00. “",1629850932,3,1

Get a secondary phone used only for cryptocurrency’s, don’t make any calls on it, text etc.


Download Bitdefender, McAfee, or LifeLock onto all your devices. Get the best yearly package possible, activate web protection, malware protection, VPN and identity protection for all of your devices. 



Buy a Yubikey to access all of your emails and exchanges, a Yubikey is like a little hard drive that you plug into your computer and or phone to access emails or exchanges which will generate a new authentic code every time you want to login. Virtually un-hackable. Much more secure than Google Authenticator. 



Keep all passwords written down in a fire proof bag hidden. Make a copy of them and put in safety deposit box. Never keep passwords on notes or pictures. 



And of course the most secure protection of all, keeping all of your coins on cold storage. Keep your 24 words hidden in a fireproof or metal wallet with a duplicate in safety deposit box that only you and a trusted family member know about.",1629850824,48,1

paz41r,BTCoinomics,Fungibility problem,"I recently have been diving into the ""fungibility"" of bitcoin. If you are unaware of the argument, bitcoins are not fungible because they all have separate public histories which could potentially separate the exchange value of coins. In practice, Bitcoin is fungible currently (ie there is one price per bitcoin), but this could change if large exchanges/participants value certain types of coins more than another, which would likely require a more efficient chain analysis than there is currently (this is potentially coming). This would in turn make the exchange value of bitcoin for nearly all participants inconsistent, as the utility of a coin without liquidity or of less value to a liquidity source (exchanges, merchants, any large participant) would be less valuable to any individual. If coins are inconsistently valuable, then bitcoin could never be a unit of account. Measuring an economy in varying (in value) units would not allow that unit to be universally accepted, as 1 btc  ≠ 1 btc, so things would not logically be priced in btc. Medium of exchange might be possible under a non-fungible unit, but it would be much more difficult to organize transactions.   


Privacy coins run into a verifiability issue, with potential inflation bugs being unnoticeable.   


From my perspective, the fungibility problem seems to be the most threatening issue to bitcoin dominating the global economy. Solving fungibility WHILE maintaining verifiability is the issue at hand, so privacy coins do not solve this.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin could still store value in this state, but it would likely never develop past this stage.

  
I would like any further opinions/perspectives and corrections on things I might be wrong on. Thanks

pd3gtj,mecoides,Where's the Meme? Thoughts on Cryptos as a comprehensive solution,"**Building the Machine**

As far as I can see, we are very much creating the infrastructure for each of us to contribute to a larger consciousness.  Information is moving at an astonishing rate through exponential technological growth.   This is resulting in larger and more robust networks, which we participate in through exchange of information with each other.  There is a trade-off that we face between the cost (including time) and quality of information exchanged.  Sometimes we exchange computationally expensive high-quality information and sometimes it is computationally inexpensive low quality information.

High quality information is deep and robust.  It's coherent and integrated.  Examples include Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, Bach's Fugues or Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem.  Low quality information is shallow and fragile.  It's muddled and disintegrated.  Examples include TikTok videos, Tweets, Insta Pics and Snaps.  These can be stillborn or spread like memes.

**Where's the Meme?**

Memes can appear innocuous: inspiring joy, laughter and a dopamine hit.  Memes can also be useful.  They can mask deeper higher quality information and signal to the recipient that greater computational investment is warranted.  Memes can also be downright cancerous to the network - offering a shallow yet plausible understanding of an idea that inhibits deeper analysis.  For example, political memes with superficial avatars of good and evil, which do little more than reinforce confirmation bias.

To optimize the machine that we are building, I would suggest that these memes, bad information packets, require decoding/decommissioning/defragging (or whatever other analogy inspires you) to prevent unwitting purveyors passing them through the network and confounding the computational outcomes.

There has always been one meme that I have found frustrating.  The meme about central banks printing money just so they can steal from you through inflation.  It's a simple story with a good guy and an ominous bad guy.  It's very juvenile - like a child crying that daddy won't let them go to a friend's house when there is a global pandemic on.  Sometimes daddy is a jerk because he's trying to protect you from something outside of everyone's control.  Some unwieldable natural force itself.

**Response to the Bitcoiner Book Club**

I recently endeavoured to air my frustrations after listening to Jordan Peterson's Podcast with the Bitcoiner Book Club (link below).  The response has been interesting but modest.  I'm genuinely interested in getting some deeper engagement to test my ideas and I thought serious users of this sub might be able to contribute some useful insights.

Before you read, I should highlight a few things.  Firstly, my goal is modest.  I don't have anything bad to say about Cryptos per se ( I have exposure to some myself).  I just don't foresee their use as a comprehensive solution (without government-backed fiat).  Not yet anyway.  This might change in time with some unforeseeable transformation in the way we do economics.  My hunch is that it won't unless we have a scientific break though that allows us to abstract out of time itself.

Secondly, I will readily admit that my knowledge of Cryptos is limited.  My point of view only requires understanding that supply is non-responsive to economic conditions - (1) supply is limited, and (2) there will be no regulation.  This means that explaining the novelty, the security features, the blockchain settling mechanism, or the general lack of necessity for human intervention will not address the issue that I am attempting to raise.

Finally, for context, a member of the Bitcoiner Book Club raised the issue of whether Bitcoin and an open market would be the best way to solve the complex task of finding a general equilibrium.  I address this in the piece below.  I would just add that I see the market as one of the possible algorithms that we can run to do complex computation.  As always, the answer is only ever as good as the algorithm and the inputs.

The world we currently live in is a complex thing to understand as it is.  There is not a person alive who is not relying on a series of memes and heuristics which cover deeper understanding.  I'm more than happy to acknowledge that I'm wrong but I won't know until I know.

pd2zph,findwildair,Another SIM Swap Disaster," I felt like I needed to reach out and say that if you don't remember if your phone is linked to your email, then you should check now! Also, 2FA SMS is not a good way to secure your accounts.

Yesterday I noticed my phone would not make calls or receive texts. I got on chat with my carrier Straight Talk and they could not sort it out so after two hours, I ended the chat and started a new one. The new tech told me that my number had been assigned to a new SIM around midnight the night before. The hacker didn't even use my name, but were able to answer some security questions so they accepted it. I will have to wait to see the transcripts before I know if they had the pin.

While on the chat I had noticed my emails were also not coming in on my phone, password was reset, so I proceeded to verify my identity and regain access to my email. In the old mail folder I found a nightmare that I have heard about before, password reset emails for crypto apps. So I sent messages to every financial app and had them locked immediately but I was far to late.

I found that the SIM was changed around midnight and a half hour later everything was withdrawn from one account and bank transfers were made, and withdrew from another.

So, if you haven't already started using an authenticator app, do it now. Tell your phone provider you must be in person with ID to make changes; this was not an option for me so I will change. Make sure your phone number is not connected to your email. Hell, use a separate email for each app. It seems like it is too easy for hackers to SIM swap; especially with the recent data breaches.

Transaction hash can be provided for verification if needed.

Hope this helps someone!",1630123878,115,1

The way it was explained to me was with rates being so low and with the dollar devaluing it makes a lot of sense. Interest rates are lower than the rate of inflation so your cash is going to be worth less later than what you get now. So why not use your equity and throw it at Bitcoin. 

You would have to have a strong conviction for Bitcoin and enough extra cash flow for the additional payment. I just think it could pay off big in the long run. 

In my situation I don’t have a house but a newer automobile that’s paid off. I heard some places offer equity loans on cars so it just made me think. Especially with the market for used cars right now. It’s worth more than what I bought it for two years ago. Not sure of the rates but worse comes to worse maybe I’ll just sell it and get something about half the price and throw the difference in.

pf6kb2,belcher_,Developments in JoinMarket and privacy: One month of fidelity bonds,"[JoinMarket](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/JoinMarket) is a bitcoin privacy solution, it creates coinjoin transactions which can improve the privacy and fungibility of bitcoin.

JoinMarket used to work by the user's wallet randomly choosing market makers out there to do a coinjoin with, but what if all those makers were actually controlled by the same person? That attacker could unmix all the coinjoins and spy on users, this is called a sybil attack.

Fidelity bonds are a mechanism for resistance against such sybil attacks. Honest makers in JoinMarket are now incentivized to lock up bitcoins using the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode. For a sybil attacker to be successful they have to lock up a huge amount of bitcoins

The JoinMarket software allows us to view all the fidelity bonds, and provides calculations telling us how strong or weak the sybil protection is.

Currently 264 BTC are locked up, including this one maker who locked up 124 coins for one year. Several other makers have locked up tens of bitcoins each some for multiple years.

https://imgur.com/a/GaJL8FK

Fidelity bond transactions must be published for all to see, so we can look at them ourselves, for example this is the 124 BTC locked coins transaction:

	$ bitcoin-cli decodescript 0400f60f63b1752102deb8ccadc36685c45389629831737387b3ae4bbf554e9d228c88bedec25e1f3cac
	{
	  ""asm"": ""1661990400 OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP 02deb8ccadc36685c45389629831737387b3ae4bbf554e9d228c88bedec25e1f3c OP_CHECKSIG"",
	   ....
	    ""addresses"": [
	      ""bc1qeqa9q9a75ks935323f58l9vmjtkp47xncpq6fyxqnf5exukpl2jshgaczk""
	    ],
	  }

In there we can see the unix timestamp of the locktime `1661990400` which corresponds to 1st September 2022. These 124 BTC are unspendable until that date.

In terms of sybil resistance, if a taker does a coinjoin with 10 other makers (the default value), then in order to successfully attack a sybil attacker would have to lock up over 128k BTC **(6.1 billion USD)** for one year, or destroy 160 BTC forever:

What if top fidelity bonds in the orderbook are actually controlled by the same person? They would be foregoing about 8.39 BTC² in sacrificed value, nearly twice as much as the total value right now which is 4.51 BTC². And their success rate would only be about 6% per coinjoin

pf4880,Jessie08301,Fixed Income — DeFi’s Next Frontier,"I recently have read an insightful article wirrten by an crypto expert, Terry. He predicts that fixed income will become DeFi's next frontier due to its intrinsic advantage of preserve wealth and diversify risk.

I excerpt the essence of the article for you to read. If you are interested in the original, you can click on the link to view the column of Terry.[https://medium.com/@terrycktse/fixed-income-defis-next-frontier-3673aab241a8](https://medium.com/@terrycktse/fixed-income-defis-next-frontier-3673aab241a8)

The cornerstone of fixed income markets is the benchmark interest rate. While the mechanics can confound outsiders, the core concept is intuitive. Market players assume bonds issued by governments of G7 sovereigns to be free of credit risk — that is, the full faith and credit of those governments will always redeem their debt. These governments borrow at a rate set by their central banks — the benchmark. Everyone else — including other governments — borrow with a spread on top of that benchmark, where that spread theoretically reflects the credit risk of those borrowers. For instance, if the benchmark is 2%, and one bond yields 5%. The 3% spread, theoretically, reflects its credit risk.

Such was taught in finance textbooks, and such was the way of the financial world for many decades before the crisis of 2008.

The story is now familiar. In order to resuscitate financial markets and to nurse the badly wounded economy back to health, benchmark interest rates effectively became zero for more than a decade since. Governments could borrow at virtually zero cost, so could highly-rated institutions.

And borrow they did. Ministries of Finance around the world effectively conspired with their central banks to print money, and highly rated institutions levered up to buy financial assets. Stock prices soared. Startup valuations soared. Bitcoin soared. Paradoxically, as governments printed more money, government debt piled up, and governments must print more money. The addiction slides further into the deep, and that assumption of no credit risk seems less and less secure. When some US politicians openly called for not paying back China for holding Treasuries, a US default has become a real plausibility.

And yet, the benchmark interest rate stays at zero. Not only is zero interest rate depressing yields of all other fixed income assets, it also fails to price sovereign credit risk. Suddenly, the strange land of DeFi, one where benchmark interest rate does not really exist, does not look so absurd anymore.

As mentioned in the previous article *On the Sustainability of Decentralized Finance*, DeFi must fulfill the need for fixed income in order to attract the vast swath of traditional capital, and pricing it without a benchmark interest rate will be its chief obstacle. There are two broad paths to overcome this:

\- Creation of synthetic fixed income assets through derivatives, for example, a total return swap on a portfolio of crypto assets

\- Introduction of real economy assets that generate cash flows

These paths can cross and combine. They both trace back to the first principles of finance: time value of money, regular payment schedule through economic production, risk and expectations. However, ultimately, no derivative can replace real assets.",1630410579,1,1

pf3l5n,Guigamuck,Digital inheritance and why it's important - guarantee access to your funds in case you die," 

Have you ever thought about what will happen to your bitcoin and other cryptos if you suddenly die?

Seriously. For the last couple of years, I've learned how to keep my crypto safe from hacking and scammers, ""hiding"" them on cold wallets (ledger, trezor) and not keeping my assets in exchanges and all that, but what if I die and my wife and kids have no access to these funds? All my effort in trading and building up a portfolio for them will be in vain!

Some people may say - go to a lawyer or a safe bank deposit and store your keys and ledger, and you're good.

But I want a more efficient way to guarantee that my family will have access to my crypto if something bad happens to me.

So I did extensive research and found out about Digital Inheritance and a specific app called Vault12 - which allows me to invite friends and family to be the ""guardians"" of my vault and therefore guarantee access to my funds in case I'm not here anymore.

I think this is a smart and fast solution to guarantee immediate access to the funds since Vault12 let me choose who will inherit my entire portfolio of digital assets stored in a secure Vault once the time comes, eliminating undue risk and the need to update an inventory or continually issue updated instructions.

My wife and my closest friends (people I can really trust) are not crypto versed, so I thought that teaching her how to use this app would be much simpler (and it actually was) and now I know that in case I'm not here anymore my kids are covered.

Do you guys use any other digital inheritance solutions? What other options do we have?",1630407806,9,1

After few months, owner asked them if he could pay them in BTC and everyone thought that he's scamming them. everyone refused except few (later most of them sold when they got 50% profit and bragged about it lol)

My brother was getting 5 BTC which he refused. Later came back Pakistan. He regrets to this day. back here he could have bought a house with today's value.

Last month he tried to contact the owner, Owner told him that at that time, he distributed 73 bitcoins and now he have only 5 of them left. Owner was ruing the days he was giving them cheap lol.",1630404945,54,1

p24tud,Darius-was-the-goody,"I think I understand why developers made bitcoin slow and not-scalable as a peer to peer currency, it has to do with the mempool.","While taking an MIT opencourseware class I learned that when Coinbase transactions become too small miners will depend purely on transaction fees. This is not bad since Bitcoin has a lot of demand and there are plenty of fees to go around. 

However, imagine a world where Bitcoin blocks are mined much faster or the blocks are bigger. In this world the mempool is drained very quickly as miners place all transactions into blocks. If there is ever a case where the mempool is empty or not enough fees are present then miners can start corrupting the network. 

For example, if the mempool is empty/small and the previously mined block has plenty of fees, then a miner is incentivized to just re-mine the previous block and broadcast it in order to create a fork where they earned the fees. Currently this does not happen since the next block has about the same profit as the last block, so there is no incentive to create a competing fork. But if the last block is much more lucrative than the next due to empty mempools, then this no longer holds. This would be terrible for Bitcoin since faster miners will always be able to snipe slower miner's blocks and out-fork them (explained better in video bellow). 

It seems to me like Bitcoin's success depends on being slow and having a huge backlog of unconfirmed transactions. To be blunt, Bitcoin depends on being a slow payment method to succeed. This is worrisome to me, and I would like to hear feedback on this.

The MIT class explains it way better: (timestamped)

p248ly,_526,Calling all my Runescape nerds. Bitcoin = Partyhat?,"Last night i had an epiphany. Bitcoin is the real world version of runescape party hats. 

For those unaware of this game, Runescape is an MMO game that has a fully functioning inflationary economy. Nearly two decades ago ""Party Hats"" of various colors were introduced to the game, and eventually were discontinued,  capping the supply and creating a scarce asset within the game. In this game due to its inflationary economy, the majority of valuable items in the game lose nominal value year after year due to ever increasing item and gold supply.

However, Party Hats have increased in value almost every single year since their creation. In fact, they have increased in value so much, the game is not even programmed to allow you to hold enough gold in your inventory to purchase one. The richest players in the game even purchase them to hedge against the declining value of their other items.

Have any you guys ever thought about this before?",1628649844,73,1

p23zp1,youbehasbeen,My explanation of bitcoin as a store of value,"I've spent the last three weeks obsessively learning about bitcoin, from saylor to breedlove to ammous.

I've taken their ideas and put them into my words like this:

You spend your time and energy in the present in exchange for money. If you hold on to that money and don’t spend it, you are transferring your current life’s energy into the future. It’s like putting it into a pipe that transports it to your future self to be spent on things later. But fiat money (money that can be printed) is like a pipe that’s leaking (through inflation). In fact, it’s leaking like crazy! A dollar you put into the pipe now won’t be worth as much on the other side in 10 years because it loses value. Bitcoin is like the perfect pipe without leaks, perfectly moving your life's energy through time all because it has an immutably fixed supply cap, making inflation impossible, ensuring your life’s time and energy is protected.

Bitcoin is “for the people” and that is something that the goverment of any country just cant stand so what if one day they just ban it, or tax it so heavily that it wont make sense to use. They order apple/samsung to delete wallet apps and poof its done.

I took it upon myself one recent week and went around my city in Czechia and asked 400 random people about crypto (all age groups). Most of them said they heard about crypto but dont understand it/dont care about it and would not invest in it. I know that its not a great sample size but it kinda paints the picture

I can imagine riots breaking out world wide but the crypto community is so so small. These riots would have no effect as the general public wouldnt care because the goverment  would say that crypto is for criminals who have something to hide. Your average joe just doesnt care about privacy or monetary policy. Hes just glad he got money from the goverment and thats it.

Do you have similar worries? If you think otherwise, please elaborate.

But in order to use it, onchain transaction needs to be performed from time to time. If Bitcoin becomes globally adopted by states and it's citizen, that is a lot of transaction per year. If I cout correctly:

BTC transactions per year = 4.6 \* 60 \* 60 \* 24 \* 365 = 145065600

Bitcoin's main strategy is to be the ""soundest"" money possible that is the best store of value that could last thousands of years.  It will not deviate from this plan.  Bitcoin maximalists see the strategies of all the other coins, which is not to be the soundest money, but instead to be packed with various features such as being Turing complete, being faster, etc.

If bitcoin's endgame is to be the hardest money, there is no need to deviate from that plan because it will win with its current strategy.  Altcoins are playing a different game that have nothing to do with sound money.  

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium): Suppose then that each player asks himself ""Knowing the strategies of the other players, and treating the strategies of the other players as set in stone, can I benefit by changing my strategy?""  If any player could answer ""Yes"", then that set of strategies is not a Nash equilibrium. 

Bitcoin's answer to this question is ""no"" because the game it wants to play is to be the soundest money.  Altcoins have no choice but to answer ""no"" because there is no strategy they can implement that can make their altcoin more sound. 

Bitcoin is the clear winner when it comes to being the soundest crypto currency.",1629196656,331,1

Video explanation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJDGE8Mg-uw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJDGE8Mg-uw)

Afaik NIM - which is a browser based p2p cryptocurrency - is one of the first blockchains to enable non-custodial EURO-BTC atomic swaps directly in their official web [wallet](https://wallet.nimiq.com/). And their plan is to increase fiat reach to USD in the future as well. Their official web wallet support BTC so you can use it as a regular BTC wallet.

Of course the technology is in it's infancy, therefore it is not very accesible worldwide at the very moment.  The way it works - you swap EURO via sepa instant bank transfer - through TEN31 German bank IBAN - linked to OASIS protocol - to buy NIM (nimiq ecosystem native currency), and then you make atomic swap between NIM-BTC directly in their wallet- unfortunatelly this swap costs 2x BTC transaction fee. It is a bit more costly than buying via coinbase, but hey - non-custodiality of it makes it worth! The OASIS fee is 1.25% + transaciton fees. The monthly limit without KYC at the moment is 1000$.

Launch press release: [https://www.nimiq.com/blog/nimiq-oasis-launch-press-release/](https://www.nimiq.com/blog/nimiq-oasis-launch-press-release/)

Technical side of the swaps: [https://www.nimiq.com/blog/what-actually-happens-when-you-swap-in-the-nimiq-wallet/](https://www.nimiq.com/blog/what-actually-happens-when-you-swap-in-the-nimiq-wallet/)

In my opinion, this inter-operability between FIAT and BTC in general, is much needed technology, even more so in fully decentralized non-custiodial way - meaning you won't lose access to your money at any point in the time. The swap is operated by HTLC smart-contract therefore if something fails, your funds are automatically send back to you. This combined with [cryptopayment links](https://cryptopayment.link/) \- nimiq's very simple invoicing feature - is a great way to start using crypto as a freelancer etc. 

The only downside at the moment for this are fees applied, monthly limits without KYC, and currently only SEPA INSTANT area is available for the BUY function (as HTLC contract expires in 90minutes, so you need very fast bank transfer to use it) . The sell function is not dependant on HTLC so you can get EURO's with regular SEPA transfers. Kinda cool huh?

Right now BTC is just below 50% fib retracement from its ATH to May's Bottom and it seems a pretty strong resistance. A lot more than any of the SMA / EMA, etc.

 For the Bullrun to re-start in full swing, money needs to flow to BTC and right now it's leaving it (in the percentage of the Total crypto market) into alts. A lot of them x2 x3 since May.

I have that theory, that may be stupid idk, that BTC crashes happen because of Alts-seasons. You cant have BTC bullrun + Alt season at the same time and it always end up the same way. BTC crash, alts tank, BTC dominance rise, BTC price pump.

But BTC dominance never hit 50% either since 29th of April. We actually never left alt-season in a way. We're still in the same trend that led to May's crash and until all the money is back into fiat/stable/BTC we won't have a proper months long bullrun...

Or maybe ""this time it's different"" and cryptos are mature enough to not need BTC to be over 80% of the market share for all of them to thrive.

Stablecoins have dominated mainstream… | by Terry | Jul, 2021 | Medium 3](https://medium.com/@terrycktse/the-conundrum-of-stablecoins-i-6d9ff2343151)

**Three Possible Types of “Stablecoins”**

Simply put, a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is usually pegged to one or a basket of assets, such as the U.S. dollar, gold, or some combination.

In the realm of financial economics, the word “pegged” comes laden with centuries of theory, history and painful memories from the debates on the gold standard in the 1920s to the design of the current financial system which positioned the United States as the global hegemon to China’s ambition to supplant the supremacy of the Dollar. *How a currency is pegged to what* determines its fundamental character, or whether it counts as money at all. It remains true for stablecoins.

A stablecoin could exist in at least three manners, depending on the peg:

* Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) — a crypto form of fiat
* Synthetic fiat — one that promises to exchange fiat at a fixed rate
* Basket backed — one that fixes itself to a basket of currencies at stable ratios

A *CDBC*, issued by a central bank and backed by the full faith and credit of a sovereign government, is essentially fiat currency in crypto form. It is pegged to a central bank. The prime example is the digital Renminbi by the Chinese central bank. One can think of it as the next logical advance from paper money, as the ancient Chinese once advanced from shells and bullion to paper.

However, while central banks will no doubt champion (or coerce) the use of CDBC in banking and payment systems, whether DeFi will adopt CDBC widely is far from certain, as DeFi players would not automatically accept CDBC as riskless. Once DeFi establishes a full-fledged derivatives market to price sovereign risk, the treatment of CDBC on DeFi will likely unfold in ways not anticipated by central banks.

A *synthetic fiat*, such as Tether, GUSD or USDC, essentially creates a synthetic exposure to a fiat currency in the DeFi world. Its initial raison d’être is to facilitate trading of other cryptocurrencies as trading with fiat on the blockchain entailed too much hassle. In other words, it brings fiat to the same context as other cryptocurrencies. Traders in the DeFi world use them as fiat proxies.

The contention concerning synthetic fiats very much lies in the promise to pay for the fiat one for one, and the issuer’s ability to fulfill that promise. In the case of Tether, it is pegged to a portfolio of reserve assets including US commercial paper, US Treasuries and other “cash equivalents”. Tether’s ability to fulfill that promise rests crucially on its proficiency in managing this portfolio. In this sense, Chairman Powell is technically correct that it behaves very much like a money market fund, but he may be missing the point. USDT users trust Tether to manage this portfolio. The New York Attorney General and other regulators do not. *The conundrum, like all matters monetary at the end, is trust.* And the trust in regulators, in finance ministries and even in the IMF to fulfill a promise can evaporate, as the episode in Greece ten years ago demonstrated.",1629190535,1,1

p5zyd8,Jessie08301,On the Sustainability of Decentralized Finance,"Today, I read a very interesting and insightful article. Terry, the author of the article, believes that DeFi is a solution to resist inflation and sovereign risk, but it still faces some structural challenges, which is worthy of our further exploration.

Here is the original link:[On the Sustainability of Decentralized Finance | by Terry | Coinmonks | Jul, 2021 | Medium](https://medium.com/coinmonks/on-the-sustainability-of-decentralized-finance-d9aa82dd2fcb)

Declining Sovereign Credibility

According to the Edelman Trust Barometer 2021, trust in government worldwide is declining\[5\], where governments in UK, US, Japan and France sit squarely in the “distrusted” category along with Mexico and Russia\[6\]. Even mighty China, whose citizens generally credit the government’s competence in handling the COVID-19 pandemic, is no exception\[7\]. Business is now more trusted and CEOs are expected to lead on long term social issues where government has fallen short\[8\]. As the wealth gap widens, and political demagoguery grips liberal democracies, and social media emboldens psychological echo chambers, this trend may yet last.

Competence in dealing with a health crisis aside, the economic consequences of government response has agitated long term holders of capital. Lawrence Summers, former Secretary of Treasury of the United States, has observed that President Biden’s stimulus bill is much larger than President Obama’s response to the Great Recession of 2009. In fact, “relative to the size of the gap being addressed, it is six times as large.”\[9\] Add to that the perennial political gridlock on budget debates in the US Congress, and the trillions of US national debt, and the seething feud between United States and China, and the fact that fiat money rests on the trust of sovereign governments to behave responsibly with the money printing press, long term holders of capital have good reasons to feel agitated.

But if all the world that you know is Roman, for the whole world was once practically Roman, far into strange lands you must venture to hedge the demise of Rome, however remote that might seem.

Structural Challenges

For those looking to diversify long term asset allocation and to hedge the cracks in the contours of geopolitics, the far and strange world of DeFi offers potential beyond the lure of high returns. The reasons are many, but that it is truly strange and different warrants more merit than it seems. In the world of globalized markets, where the correlation of nearly all asset classes collapses to one in extreme events, the one truly strange and different asset may save the day.

That said, DeFi must overcome a few structural challenges to continue to draw traditional capital:

* Volatility is too high.
* It is difficult to short.
* There is hardly any fixed income product.
* There is no lender of last resort.

There are more than 2,000 cryptocurrencies in the world of DeFi, and most are far more volatile than Bitcoin. Some could show 1000% *vega* (i.e. the change of value in a financial derivative relative to 1% of its implied volatility). Trading takes place 24/7, with rules governed by code. In other words, DeFi is always marked to market, with no closing period and little human mediation in actual trading. Arbitrageurs seeking to exploit mispricing, inefficiencies and information asymmetry could not ask for a more perfect market environment, so do gamblers who seek thrills and winnings in a game of chance. More traditional institutional investors, however, cannot tolerate the volatility of one asset that puts the portfolio net asset value into a manic-depressive ride, despite all the diversification benefits. While an open safari for courageous traders, DeFi still frightens long term holders of capital seeking to preserve wealth.

Closely related to volatility is the difficulty to short. When an asset trades at 1000% volatility, borrowing to short it is an easy path to poverty. The solution is financial derivatives, where one can create a risk profile to trade volatility, tone it down to desirable levels in exchange of giving up the opportunity of large gains, and express a short position in the form of optionality.

And DeFi has been offering derivatives, in fact, in the trillions. However, it will take time for the DeFi world to absorb decades of derivatives lessons from traditional financial markets. While not necessarily financial weapons of mass destruction, derivatives can be treacherous, and the management of derivatives trading even more so. Unlike stocks, the underlying crypto assets do not conform to standardized legal templates governed by jurisdictions. Standardized options and futures alone will not suffice.",1629190395,1,1

p5zxnl,Jessie08301,Whether the stablecoins can become a private money?,"Today, I read an interesting and insightful article. The author of the article, Terry, as an economist and crypto analyst, discussed whether the stablecoins can become a private money. It is very worth reading. I paste some of the essence of the article here. If you want to see the original text, you can click on the link.[https://wire.insiderfinance.io/the-conundrum-of-stablecoins-ii-2fa71e47cce2 4](https://wire.insiderfinance.io/the-conundrum-of-stablecoins-ii-2fa71e47cce2)

Are stablecoins private money?

As explained in the [first installment 1](https://medium.com/@terrycktse/the-conundrum-of-stablecoins-i-6d9ff2343151), stablecoins could manifest themselves in three variations and GZ only addresses *synthetic fiats*, i.e. those such as Tether, GUSD or USDC that essentially create a synthetic exposure to a fiat currency in the DeFi world. That money should adhere to the NQA principle is of no contention, but whether synthetic fiats are actually private money takes more thought.

Since real economic production on the blockchain remains rather muted, synthetic fiats do not circulate to fulfill quotidian transactional needs. Rather, since their inception, they mainly act as proxies to sovereign fiats to facilitate the trading of crypto assets. To fully satisfy the NQA principle, they must be redeemed at par, and typically are. If one must call such proxies *private money*, they are money of a rather narrow use.

As such, the parallel to private bank notes from the Free Banking Era appears rather stretched, as private banks notes were used and *intended* to be used in general economic transactions involving general economic actors such as merchants, blacksmiths, etc. The parallel becomes even more stretched when one considers that the chief complaint against private notes was actually fraud, as GZ itself noted. The issuers were supposed to back the notes with state bonds, but failed to do. Counterfeits also ran rampant. Synthetic fiats do not suffer from the same ills. In fact, the underlying blockchain technology would likely make counterfeit very difficult.

That said, if synthetic fiats were widely adopted in payment and real economic transactions on and off blockchain, they *could* become private money. Curiously, given the attitude of financial authorities such as the US SEC, they may choose not to.

Most importantly, for the purposes of DeFi, synthetic fiats need not become fully fledged private money to serve as efficient proxies. They just have to become more transparent.

Transparency runs in the blood of DeFi, but most issuers of stablecoins have not yet grasped out how since DeFi is still in its infancy. GZ insightfully observes that many synthetic fiats behave like money market funds, but also laments that the regulation of such funds is flawed as they posed systemic risks, most notably in the 2008 financial crisis. If one threatens to obliterate stablecoins because money market funds are poorly regulated, one could also threaten to ban risk scoring for loans because bond ratings perform poorly. GZ contends that money market funds are economically equivalent to demand deposits. One could also contend that loans are economically equivalent to bonds. But loans are not bonds, and money market funds are not demand deposits.

Still, GZ’s contention illuminates a path forward for synthetic fiats. A synthetic fiat issuer could simply manage a money market fund and tokenize it. The question of redemption at par is governed by the legal technicalities of the fund mandate and fund license, technicalities that depend on *jurisdiction*. For example, money market funds in Singapore are generally redeemed at market value very close to par, but not legally liable to redeem at par. The NAV determines the redemption value. The said issuer could even record all its assets and trades of the money market fund on a distributed ledger, making all the assets and liabilities transparent in real time. For the purposes of using synthetic fiat as value proxies to trade other crypto assets, this would suffice.",1629190290,2,1

Is Bitcoin still anonymous?,"On May 9, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, ""Colonial Pipeline"" attacked by the ransomware ""DarkSide"" delivered a ransom of 75 BTC (worth 5 million US dollars) to DarkSide. Initially, people thought it would become a clueless case again, and the company considered it unlucky. However, the reverse of it came. The US Department of Justice announced that it had recovered most of the ransom of 63.7 BTC in the case. According to the Affidavit, the FBI manages to get a main wallet's private key involved in the transfer process, but it didn't disclose how the FBI obtained the key. It is reported that the FBI may retrieve it through having a hacker to rent a cloud server.

As soon as the news came out, Bitcoin was also significantly affected, with the lowest falling to $31,700. Although for people in the currency circle always hope that Bitcoin can have more positive compliant and legal ecological applications, the reality is that for formal applications, the use of legal currency is often much more convenient than the use of Bitcoin. It can only be said that Bitcoin gives countries that are prone to inflation an expectation of currency appreciation. It is undeniable that the actual use of Bitcoin is often something within the gray area, such as blackmail, money laundering, and the dark web. For them, the natural anonymity and untraceability of Bitcoins provide great convenience. When Bitcoin is no longer safe for them, will these people still use Bitcoin? Or will they look for a new method?

Recently, Bitcoin is facing the impact of capital sell-offs and negative comments by various magnates. Since 519, when it fell below $30,000, many well-known analysts predicted that Bitcoin has a chance to fall back to $10,000. On June 7, former US President Trump criticized Bitcoin in an interview. He said that Bitcoin looks like a scam, and it isn't surprising if it falls below $6,000. Musk also speaks frequently on social media. Most of them are spreading negative comments on Bitcoin. A few days ago, Ruffer, a London wealth management company, announced that it had sold all bitcoins and made a profit of 1.1 billion US dollars and was worried by the ""speculative wave"" of cryptocurrencies. We have no way of knowing why the magnates who were optimistic about Bitcoin turned to sell Bitcoin and even made negative remarks. What we need to pay attention to is: do we need to restrain our frantic mood?

The development speed of the currency industry is much higher than that of other industries. Some people treat speculation as a career, record past market information, boldly make market forecasts, strictly formulate trading plans and position control, always have the opportunity to gain wealth and reflect on each failure and make corrections. Meanwhile, some regard speculation as luck, occasionally the god of luck brings wealth growth, but the pain of sudden liquidation often replaces the short-term excitement.

p5xnfx,fractal_dimension,An open letter to Larry Fink on Bitcoin and the Environment,"The dollar is a technology platform. It is a cobbled together patchwork of electronic protocols operated by financial and governmental institutions, each with their own perverse incentives. Because of this structure, each participant in the network is a potential point of informational vulnerability, an opportunity where noise can be introduced into the signal that the dollar is conveying. This signal, represented as our unit of account, is our collective computation of value.

Bitcoin is a digital network built upon the principles of evolutionary biology and mathematical proof. These properties allow it to expand and contract throughout time, adjusting its parameters while still flawlessly communicating its signal. These ideas suggest Bitcoin is the highest fidelity informational signal that we as humans can produce at scale. If we seek to communicate those things which we find valuable in one another and the world around us, we ought to do so with clarity and truth.

Take for example the property rights conferred by the dollar. You are entitled to a proportion of the net productivity of the economy as determined by market forces. However, as you know, this right is not a guarantee. The conferral of these rights is dependent upon the incentives of the creditors, who are competing with one another to engineer a greater supply of monetary value for themselves. As such, the claim on property held by the dollar degrades over time as new information (dollars) enters the system as noise.

This degradation of value across time incentivizes market participants to spend their wealth today with the knowledge that it is virtually guaranteed to degrade in the future. And you see that today: we are deeply levered into near infinite consumption of resources and unsecured public goods on a categorically finite planet. I ask you to consider: should the scarcity of our money represent the scarcity of our goods?

As you know, we are at the precipice of massive climatic shifts that will undoubtedly affect humanity across all domains. This ultimately comes down to our inability to value and plan for the future. As we use debt to fund our consumption today, we increasingly discount our future cash flows, essentially laying claim to the productivity of the future. Alongside this, we continue to harm our planet at all scales, causing its future productivity and value to decline further. This feedback loop of value destruction appears to go only one direction: down.

Operating on the bitcoin network, we can overcome this ruinous race to the bottom while building wealth and preserving value for the future. Bitcoin is the technology best enabled to firmly fit our financial system to the constraints of reality while securing incontrovertible property rights. No doubt, unwinding our collective debt will be chaotic, but this is seemingly our best opportunity to align humanity around the Schelling Point that is proof of work.

For yours, all our sakes, and the future of economic freedom, please take a long look at what is before you and consider joining us as we restore truth to our collective global value computation network.

If the future really is worth saving, Bitcoin will reflect that. Let’s find out.",1629178607,1,1

To my mind, the best answers so far have been: to circumvent the government in terms of both prohibition and taxes, discounts, to take advantage of what you think is a high bitcoin value that will soon be corrected, and to take and spend profits.

Less helpful answers so far seemed to assume or centre around the idea of a 100% bitcoin economy or lifestyle.

p6uuzd,MtnDewBadBoy_01,The Moderators Want You to Be Scammed -- I WILL NOT BE SILENCED,"Hello Everyone,

I come to you with grave news. This morning I posted on this subreddit about what I now realize was a scam sent to me. Luckily the fine people of this subreddit - such as yourselves - came to my aid to warn me of the inevitable scam and were able to dissuade me from falling victim to it - saving me $2500 in BTC in the process. After much fruitful debate, the moderators have determined that it was a post of ""low quality"" and removed it from the subreddit. Why would they do this? It could have served as a warning beacon to other people in my shoes, and yet they didn't want word of a bitcoin scam to be present on their page? I really and truly believe there are only a few reasons for this, and I have detailed them as follows:

1. The moderators only what positive outlooks on BTC on this subreddit because they own several thousands of dollars in it and only want its publicity to be positive - regardless of what truth is out there - to inflate and line their own pockets.
2. The moderators simply do not care about scams, and all else being equal, choose to allow people to be scammed due to lack of information.
3. The moderators themselves are scammers and don't want word of their schemes reaching the public - maybe that's why they started this page in the first place.

Whatever the reason, I felt you people should know who you really are dealing with in this page and warn you that anything negative about BTC, regardless of truth or sincerity, will be removed. The moderators prefer a half-truth one-sided page that only suits their best interest, and I find this despicable. Please everyone, I ask you, do not let the moderators forget that they are the few, and *we* are the many. If this page is run with any amount of ethics or regard for the people, they will see that they are here to serve us - and that silencing news of scams or negativity only damages their credibility.",1629304644,33,1

ow43f3,jspri,After 6+yrs Smartbit.com.au block explorer nd API is closing down tonight. Thank you. 👋 💗 #bitcoin,"Hi All,

As per post last month [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/o3w4q3/smartbitcomau\_block\_explorer\_is\_closing\_down/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/o3w4q3/smartbitcomau_block_explorer_is_closing_down/) Smartbit is closing down. We'll be turning off the block explorer API and server tonight and update the landing page with a offline notification and contact details.

Unfortunately we didn't find a suitable custodian or buyer to continue [smartbit.com.au](https://smartbit.com.au). We self funded smartbit and loved being part of the community and the early reddit bitcoin days. 

Potentially our last post didn't get enough upvotes for exposure. If anyone/company is interested and committed to taking it over please email [jarred@smartbit.com.au](mailto:jarred@smartbit.com.au) or upvote 👆 if keen for Smartbit to continue and for others to see the post.

Some milestones we're proud of:

* 5million+ page views
* 1million+ daily API requests
* low 7% bounce rate (meaning people enjoyed using the site), with an average duration of all users over 4minutes.
* Many 100's of free how to support emails for new Bitcoin users looking for their bitcoin 😀Patience, the block confirmation will come.
* Most of all proud of providing a service to help grow Bitcoin early when there weren't as many positive actors or accurate data providers (looking at you other blockexplorers 😎).

Feel free to also share our last tweet on this. [https://twitter.com/smartbithq/status/1406439048709742592](https://twitter.com/smartbithq/status/1406439048709742592) the message didn't recieve a lot of impressions, so a retweet/share would be appreciated.

I mean isn't the grand idea that Bitcoin would eventually become the dominant world currency, and if this happens people will be no longer swapping bitcoin for dollars or euros etc because they would be either largely worthless or non-existent. Therefore this price volatility would no longer exist, as Bitcoin will just be traded directly for goods rather than other currencies. In the hypothetical situation that Bitcoin does reach these heights, the volatility issue would surely be seen as just an artifact of an early adoption phase of Bitcoin. Or is there some other way that I've overlooked/don't understand that you could see price volatility persisting in this scenario?",1627850392,17,1

owykx0,menluo,Which crypto trading platform to use?,"Recently I have been thinking about investing in crypto, and hence I am choosing which crypto trading platform to use. Certainly there are the Coinbase, Huobi, Binance, etc., but there are also many smaller ones that seem okay too, like Matrixport, Zipmex, Kikitrade, etc.. Does anyone know what are the differences among all these platforms and how should I choose which one to use? 

If I am understanding correctly, something that crypto trading platforms differ from traditional stock trading platforms is that they all provide some sort of fixed rate return by putting down assets/money on their platform or invest in their so called 'fixed income' funds, and you can earn up to 10-15% for no risks. I think 10% is not bad considering the bear market in recent months. I find this quite attractive and I tend to look for similar type of returns when looking at a new crypto trading platform. 

However, I am not sure if this should be the main reason or factor when I decide which to use. Even though my argument is that all crypto trading platforms seem to collect minimal trading fee..

Does anyone have any idea or advice and would like to shre? Feel free to comment on your experience using crypto trading platforms!",1627976637,13,1

My thought is, if I can include other data in a lightning transaction, then I can create such assets, although I may have to link multiple transactions to include the full data.  

I'm willing and would like opinions on this. My ultimate goal though is understanding if lightning network can or could eventually support extra data in a transaction, and leveraging it, even if it is a series of off-chain transactions. You can call it colored coins on lightning.",1627968597,2,1

oww7vj,41Finance,Bitcoin's difficulty plummeted. Why did the income of miners rise by 50%?,"On July 2, the day before the adjustment of the difficulty of Bitcoin mining, the daily income of Bitcoin miners was about 20.7 million U.S. dollars. On July 6, the daily income of Bitcoin miners was about 31.9 million U.S. dollars, and the revenue of miners increased by 54%.

Unbelievable?

It is nothing more than many miners' hashing power that goes offline under high pressure. It's like when a place is crowded with 10,000 people and suddenly reduced by half. The remaining half naturally enjoy the dividends brought by the ""leftovers"", and natural income growth can increase to 50%. When a large number of miners are back online, their income levels will eventually level off.

The current situation is that small and medium-sized miners are looking at the miners' income now and start to think of ways to get the miners online. Even some of the new miners, looking at the miners' current income level, which is higher than 60,000 US dollars in Bitcoin, try their best to mine too. This situation leads to a ""see-saw"" among the miners. The miners who shut down before guarding the mining machines that cannot be turned on are helpless and try their best to change the mining machines in their hands at a low price or even sell bitcoins to recover the cost. On the other hand, the new miners continue to mine at maximum capacity and obtain the most significant dividends in the shortest event.

Are the mining machines worldwide absolutely safe? 

This is not necessarily true. Due to excessive power consumption, the Iranian Vice President stated that all Bitcoin mining operations must ""completely"" stop production to ensure that there will be no power outages in essential areas. In addition, residents of New York accused Bitcoin mining plants of heating the lake and possibly killing the creatures in the lake.

With the domestic prohibition in China, many mining machines have tried their best to go abroad. Before, the power consumption was not particularly obvious, but as the number of mining machines increased, the power consumption increased significantly. After conflicts with the leading business in the region, it is no surprise that the original supportive attitude has turned into opposition.

China's attitude towards Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related activities is rather apparent. In other words, this attitude never changes since 2013, but with the increase in the number of participants, the crackdown has become stronger.

The slight glimpse of hope for the users shattered again and again. In the new round of Bitcoin hashing power adjustment, the shuffling effect of the mining industry in the past is enormous enough, and the mining industry, especially in North America, is also showing signs of promotion. In the future, as more institutions invest in Bitcoin, Bitcoin mining methods may change.

Perhaps in the future, we can see that every Bitcoin is mined through clean and green energy to solve the environmental problems caused by bitcoin mining.

I figured out I’d try memorizing them with a song, so I sat down for what I expected was going to be a 2-hour session of intense memorization. After about 15 minutes, to my surprise, I had it nailed. I could recover the seed phrase using the song. It was waaaay easier than I expected. I’m not able to write out my seed phrase as a whole from memory but when I start reciting the song, each word comes perfectly one by one, in the correct order. Funny how memory works. I test myself every day or two.

I took a song that I already knew the lyrics to and simply changed the lyrics to fit the words of my seed phrase.The new lyrics have little meaning but it's still very easy to remember.  


Now I feel a lot more at peace knowing that I have this last backup if anything happens. I don’t recommend this as your only way to secure your seed phrase, but it could be used as a backup of the backup, etc.

## چگونه اتریوم استخراج کنم؟ 

**برای استخراج اتریوم باید مراحل زیر را طی کنید:**

**تهیه دستگاه‌های سخت افزاری** **ساخت کیف پول مناسب ارز اتر** **پیوستن به استخر‌های استخراج** 

## بهترین کیف پول‌های اتریوم در سال 2021 

**بهترین کیف پول‌های اتریوم در سال 2021 شامل موارد زیر هستند:**

**کیف پول تحت وب MyEtherWallet (**[**لینک دانلود کیف پول مای اتر ولت**](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)**)**

**کیف پول افزونه مرورگر MetaMask (**[**لینک دانلود کیف پول متامسک**](https://metamask.io/download)**)**

**کیف پول موبایل Trustwallet (**[**لینک دانلود کیف پول تراست والت**](https://trustwallet.com/deeplink/)**)**

**کیف پول سخت افزاری ledger** 

**کیف پول سخت افزاری  Trezor**

## چگونه اتریوم بخرم؟

**به منظور** [**خرید اتریوم**](https://morbit.trade/exchange/ETH-irt) **از موربیت، ابتدا در وبسایت morbit.trade ثبت نام و احراز هویت نموده و پس از باز شدن حساب توسط تیم پشتیبانی، به بازار اتریوم مراجعه نمایید. در نهایت اتریوم خریداری شده به کیف پول موربیت شما ارسال می‌گردد.**

## چگونه اتریوم بفروشم؟

**به منظور فروش اتریوم، پس از تکمیل فرایند احراز هویت در سایت موربیت، در قسمت بالا سربرگ فروش را انتخاب کرده، آدرس هش را وارد نموده و فرایند فروش را به انجام برسانید.** 

## آیا اتریوم کلاهبرداری است؟

**ارز دیجیتال اتریوم دومین ارز برتر بازار رمزارزها است و به این دلیل که روزانه میلیونها کاربر در حال استفاده و توسعه آن هستند، اتریوم کاملا غیرمتمرکز است و هیچ نهادی نمی‎تواند این بلاکچین را سانسور کند.**

## آیا اتریوم قانونی است؟ 

**چندی پیش کمیسیون بورس اوراق بهادار آمریکا اعلام کرد که به دلیل ماهیت غیرمتمرکز اتریوم، این ارز در حوزه اوراق بهادار قرار نگرفته و از این رو نمیتواند از سوی این سازمان غیرقانونی خوانده شود. با این حال قوانین کشورهای مختلف در رابطه با ارزهای دیجیتال بایکدیگر متفاوت است و هم‌اکنون در ایران، قانون خاصی برای خرید و فروش اتر به تصویب نرسیده است.** 

## کارمزد انتقال اتریوم چه‌قدر است؟

**کارمزد انتقال در شبکه اتریوم بستگی به عوامل مختلفی داشته و ثابت نیست. یکی از ویژگی‌های شبکه اتریوم این است که برای پرداخت کارمزد به شما قدرت انتخاب داده می‌شود و کاربر حتی میتواند کارمزد سفارشی خود را وارد کند، با این حال انتخاب کارمزد پایین در بلاکچین اتریوم حامل ریسک‎های فراوانی است، چراکه ماینرها در ابتدا تراکنش‌ها با کارمزدهای بالا را در اولویت قرار می‎دهند.**

## اتریوم 2.0 چیست؟

**اتریوم 2، درواقع آپدیتی است که بر روی شبکه فعلی اتریوم در حال توسعه است. هدف از این به روزرسانی بهبود سرعت، هزینه کارمزدها و مقیاس پذیری تراکنش‌ها است که در نتیجه این موارد، تعداد تراکنش‌ها در شبکه اتریوم افزایش خواهد یافت. جالب است بدانید که نام مستعار اتریوم 2، سرنیتی (Serenity) است.** **اتریوم 2 نسبت به شبکه فعلی، حامل تفاوت‌های ساختاری زیادی است. دو تا از مهمترین تفاوت‌های آن شامل الگوریتم اثبات سهام (POS) . فرایند شاردینگ است که در ادامه به بررسی این دو خواهیم پرداخت.**

## الگوریتم اثبات سهام (POS) چیست؟

**در طی الگوریتم اجماع اثبات سهام (POS)، به جای ماینرها، اعتبارسنجان وجود دارند. دلیل این که نام این الگوریتم اثبات سهام است این است که کاربران با سپرده گذاری اتریوم 2 در شبکه، حق رای دریافت کرده و درست مانند ماینرها، با اعتبارسنجی تراکنش‎ها، از شبکه پاداش دریافت می‎کنند.** **هم‌اکنون در شبکه فعلی اتریوم، الگوریتم اثبات کار اجرا می‎شود، و ماینرها با ارائه قدرت کامپیوتری، از شبکه پاداش دریافت کرده و به اصطلاح اتریوم ماین می‌کنند.** 

## شاردیگ چیست؟

**شاردیگ فرایندی است که در طی آن یک بلاکچین، به بلاکچین‌های کوچکتری به نام شارد تقسیم می‌شود. در چنین حالتی، از آنجایی که اعتبارسنجان نیازی به به روزرسانی کل شبکه نخواهند داشت، کارایی شبکه بالاتر رفته و سرعت تراکنش‌ها نیز بهبود می‌یابد.** 

## استخراج اتریوم چه ‌قدر طول می‎کشد؟

**براساس گزارش وبسایت be(in)crypto، ماین اتریوم کار دشواری نیست با این حال به طور میانگین، استخراج هر واحد از ارز دیجیتال اتریوم 63 روز به طول می‎ انجامد.** 

&amp;#x200B;

## فرق بین اتریوم و بیت کوین چیست؟

## عرضه کلی

**ارز دیجیتال اتر، دومین رمزارز بزرگ، از نظر ارزش بازار در دنیاست. بیت کوین برای اولین بار در تاریخ 3 ژانویه سال 2009 وارد بازار شد و بلاکچین اتریوم در تاریخ 30 جولای سال 2015 فعالیت خود را آغاز کرد. برخلاف بیت کوین که تنها 21 میلیون از آن در نیا وجود دارد، عرضه اتریوم نامشخص است و بر اساس میزان تقاضا، اتر در شبکه تزریق می‌شود.** 

## بلاکچین 

**از دیگر تفاوت‌های مهم بیت کوین و اتریوم این است که بلاکچین بیت کوین فقط دفترچه‌ ی تغییرناپذیری از اطلاعات است. این درحالی است که برنامه نویسان بلاکچین اتریوم قادرند تا کدها را وارد تراکنش‌ها نموده و قراردادهای هوشمند را توسعه دهند. به عبارت دیگر، شبکه اتریوم حاوی کدهایی است که هرکدام کار خاصی را انجام می‎دهند و شبکه بیت کوین تنها به منظور نگه داری داده‌های مالی به کار می‎روند.** 

## زمان ساخت بلاک

**زمان ساخت بلاک نیز در دو بلاکچین بیت کوین و اتریوم متفاوت است. بلاک‌های جدید در بلاکچین اتریوم در طی چند ثانیه تولید می‌شوند و این درحالی است که بلاک جدید در شبکه بیت کوین تا چندین دقیقه به طول می‌انجامد.** 

## هدف پروژه 

**یکی از مهمترین تفاوت‌های بین شبکه‌های بیت کوین و اتریوم در هدف پروژه آن‌ها است. بیت کوین یک شبکه همتا به همتا غیرمتمرکز است که با هدف توسعه خدمات پرداخت، بدون نیاز به واسطه‌هایی چون بانک‌ها به وجود آمده است. از طرف دیگر، هدف از توسعه شبکه اتریوم، تسهیل صدور قراردادها و برنامه‌های غیرمتمرکز است. منظور از برنامه‌های غیرمتمرکز، توکن‌هایی است که توسعه دهندگان بر روی بلاکچین اتریوم، و عموما با استاندارد erc20 ایجاد می‎کنند. به عبارت دیگر، اگر بیت کوین، بانک اینترنت باشد، اتریوم، وکیل اینترنت است.**

## جذب سرمایه گذار 

**از نظر تئوری، این دو تکنولوژی نباید رقابت خاصی با یکدیگر داشته باشند چرا که هریک، هدف متفاوتی را دنبال می‎کنند. با این حال به دلیل تفاوت در کارکرد شبکه‌های بیت کوین و اتریوم، هریک گروه خاصی از سرمایه گذاران را به سمت خود جذب کرده‌اند. بنابراین می‌توان گفت که تنها رقابت دو پروژه مذکور، در جذب سرمایه از سمت کاربران و کمپانی‌ها است.** 

## پیشبینی قیمت اتریوم در سال 2021

**پیشبینی دقیق قیمت ارزهای دیجیتال کار دشواری است و هیچ کس نمی‎تواند به صورت دقیق، آینده را پیشبینی کند. با این حال اتریوم ارز پرکاربردی است و توسط کمپانی‌های بزرگ از جمله مایکروسافت پذیرفته شده است. بدین ترتیب با افزایش تعداد کاربران شبکه اتریوم و پذیرش عمومی ارز تر، می‌توان آینده روشنی را برای این  رمزارز پیشبینی کرد.** ",1628403476,0,1

Instead of dollar cost averaging a set dollar amount I averaged buying .08 Bitcoin per week.(I know talking specifics is dangerous but I wanted other business owners to see the power of investing in BTC). I have accumulated .81 BTC in just under 3 months for $28,000. Today that investment sits at $36,000. Regardless of the current price, letting my money sit in a bank account was no longer an option. And luckily my partner agreed. 

I learned about business’ investing in BTC after talking with a proprietor of a dispensary in Colorado. He was not given the option to bank under American federal law. Like so many in the third world who are unbanked, he found Bitcoin.

If even one Senator objects, all we get is the garbage text that brought us here in the first place. CALL NOW - 517-200-9518","Last week, Senators Wyden, Toomey, and Lummis introduced an amendment that would have fixed the language and clarified that the expansion of the definition of a “broker” doesn’t apply to open source software developers or validators like miners. 

But late Sunday night, Senate Majority Leader Schumer decided he would not allow votes on amendments. **We have one final chance to fight another day: a new compromise that will be proposed by unanimous consent this Monday afternoon.**

This compromise solves many of the problems with the original text, although according to [Senator Wyden](https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1424731514147938304?s=20) there are still some harms to privacy and security. But without the compromise, all we get is the garbage text of the original bill. **If even one Senator objects to the compromise, it fails.** With over 40,000 calls to legislators in support of crypto already, we need to remind our Senators once again that we will not be ignored!  

So, one more time for the folks in the back! Call and tweet at your Senators and tell them to let crypto be heard. Tell them to support the cryptocurrency amendment to the infrastructure bill. Call 517-200-9518 and you will be connected to your Senators offices.  

**If you haven't called yet, do it now.** **If you already called your Senator to reject the Warner amendment CALL AGAIN to tell your Senators to support amending the current cryptocurrency provision!**

**Call your Senators right now at 517-200-9518. We'll connect you to their offices and guide you through the process.**

**When a staff member answers, tell them:**

“Hi, I’m calling to ask that you support amending the cryptocurrency provision of the infrastructure bill, and in the future protect the human rights and privacy potential of decentralized technologies. Policies that impact basic freedom and the future of the Internet should be debated carefully and should never be attached to must-pass bills. Thank you.”

p15p5l,OnMyWayc,A $5 million gift today may be worth $3 million or $7 million next week,"&gt;The University of Pennsylvania recently announced a $5 million gift to Wharton, its business school. The donation was not one of its largest, but the university announced the gift with the type of fanfare it usually lavishes on gifts many times its size.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The gift, from an anonymous donor, was [in Bitcoin](https://news.wharton.upenn.edu/press-releases/2021/05/university-of-pennsylvania-receives-largest-cryptocurrency-gift-in-the-universitys-history-to-support-innovation-in-finance-at-the-wharton-school/). The announcement, therefore, was a trial balloon — a signal that cryptocurrencies are now as acceptable for donations as stocks, bonds, real estate and other investments.  


From my view point, it's damn good.

The hilarious thing about a bull trap is that the more people it catches, the harder it dumps. That means if we go up to $50k and it's a bull trap, the chart might nuke below $29k down into the low $20ks or even the teens. Easily. Although the dollar is total crap, it is strengthening in the short term with gold and silver both tanking today.

We won't get into the TA around this, but just know that the Perma bulls could be leading you into a trap. The Bitboys, the Moons, the Martini Guys — these guys will kill your portfolio if you're a trader. If you're investing for 5 years or whatever, this doesn't apply to you. If you're trying to make your crypto, you should pay attention to this kind of stuff.

You don't have to sell everything now, but you shouldn't have to take 90% losses because you're listening to Perma bulls, either. Please understand these big crypto channels got big from accepting sponsorships from projects. Bitboy or Elliotrades pumping single projects for an hour means nothing. 

If we get to BTC$50k, I will be selling a good bit of my crypto into stablecoins. Then I wait. If we catch $52.5k and hold, then I buy back in. If we fall, I have plenty of stablecoins to buy what will likely be a substantial dip.

I will never sell all of my cryptos, and I think it's a good idea to hold onto a bag of bitcoin that doesn't get touched for any reason. But I'm not going to let these godforsaken shillers knock me out of profitability because they're getting crypto under the table. The price of freedom is constant vigilance.",1628520557,1,1

My name is Alex and I have an awesome product built that brings an emerging opportunity to the masses.

**So what is the project?**

We make decentralized financial betting platform. Financial betting has quickly become a popular and rather a lucrative pastime. In fact, more and more people are enjoying betting on the outcome of currency markets. Traditional financial betting is illegal in the United States, but a decentralized can be used by anyone, anywhere.

Traders will cross-bet (put/call) on the Bitcoin market movement (day/week/month). It will be a 100% decentralized, fully automated platform where smart contracts on the Ethereum network will be in charge of all processes. We use oracles to get the BTC price. Each feed report the median of Coinbase, Kraken, Gemeni, and Binance.

Bets are accepted in USDT or ETH. Potential loss/profit is always equivalent, up to 100% (depends on pool's ratio).

🚀 Launch is scheduled for late September.

**How to become a co-owner?**

We give 1% for 1 BTC + you should have strong marketing background in crypto industry.

We take 3% of the total betting pool (service fee). 2% will always go to developers, 1% to you. ETH addresses will be placed in smart contracts and cannot be changed!

**Who we are?**

We're international team of traders and smart contract developers with 5 year of experience on bleeding edge blockchain technology. We also conduct a security audit of smart contracts for various projects. Therefore, we are always responsible for safety.

This is an experimental side project for us, but with huge potential. Expected platform income 10+ ETH per month, 100% automated and lifelong...

The truth is: You would have sold long before BTC reached even its 2017 ATH of 20k USD.","Seeing things in hindsight makes you feel dumb, but the real truth is that back then nobody saw it coming. Only a few people really believed in BTC as a store of value or whatever. If you could go back in time and told people in 2010 that in 2021 hedge funds, S&amp;P500 companies and even insurance companies are buying billions worth of BTC at 40k+ USD and using it as a store of value, everybody would just see you as the tin-foil hat person, laugh at you and call you mad and delusional.

This is the reason why I generally feel bad for those ""two pizzas are now worth X millions"" posts as if the people who traded BTC for goods in the old days could predict the future. As such, the moment your holdings were at 10x your initial investment, very, very likely you would have sold as well, or just bought that awesome thing you could suddenly acquire with magic internet money.

I had a dream last night, that someone sent me over 100 BTC, and I started calling everyone I love  


to tell them, so that I can help them fix their problems and help get them out of poverty.  


When I called my mom, she was so happy for me, I told her that I was going to get her a new heart,   


her heart has been flooding with water occasionally which has sent her straight to the hospital  


on multiple occasions, and this has been happening more frequently as of late, she's been racking up   


hospital bills, and a heart transplant is very expensive, but this had to be real, then I woke up, in this  


same reality, I called my mom, she is currently in the hospital recovering very slowly, this time it's   


taking 2 weeks instead of 2 days, and the doctors don't know what is wrong, I don't know what to do.  


I also have my own life to deal with, I'm starting to feel like I'm drowning in sadness, I'm starting to  


lose hope, I wish I could have told my younger self to invest in Bitcoin, I'm sure we all would have if  


given the chance, and I fear that by the time I am able to afford to help her it will be too late,   


sorry if this is an inappropriate post, I woke up this morning feeling extremely depressed because the   


dream felt so real, but it was just a dream.",1629048955,2,1

Once the BTC is in Muun, you can send it via regular on-chain transaction to your ledger (Muun wallet is interchangeable between lightning and regular wallet).

p4u6sv,Fittiboy,Lightning Addresses are a thing now!,"Zebedee CTO André Neves has built [a spec](https://github.com/andrerfneves/lightning-address) for [lightning addresses](https://lightningaddress.com).

For example, I can now receive payments not only at [fittiboy@lntxbot.com](mailto:fittiboy@lntxbot.com), and [fitti@zbd.gg](mailto:fitti@zbd.gg), but also at my own domain, [tips@fitti.io](mailto:tips@fitti.io). There are many ways to set this up, from fully custodial (lntxbot and zebedee), to fully self-hosted (my [fitti.io](https://fitti.io) domain). There are also steps in between.

You can set up some DNS records and use fiatjaf's [bridge server](https://bridgeaddr.fiatjaf.com/) to use your own domain and node, but have the server handle the requests.

You can also use fiatjaf's [satdress](https://github.com/fiatjaf/satdress) server and either self-host – using your own domain and node – or  use someone else's instance (like [ln.fitti.io](https://ln.fitti.io)). In the latter case, you use their domain, but your own node.

This builds on top of lnurl's lnurl-pay subprotocol, which makes it very easy to implement.

The amazing part about this is that it seamlessly opens up the ability for sats to flow between different platforms. You could use your Zebedee wallet to send [jack@twitter.com](mailto:jack@twitter.com) some sats because he retweeted you and you gained some followers. You could send sats to [someone@strike.me](mailto:someone@strike.me), instead of having to go to [strike.me/someone](https://strike.me/someone) first, and generating an invoice. Like what ""username"" said in a Telegram group? [username@lntxbot.com](mailto:username@lntxbot.com) is already a thing, you can already send to that from lntxbot and LNbits!

I can easily see this gaining a lot of traction, especially since ""Paying to static internet identifiers"" (the *sending* part of this protocol) is part of the [lnurl-rfc](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/luds/16.md) now, and Zebedee is immediately implementing it.

Let me actually demonstrate how trivial this is for services to implement.

Sending to [username@example.org](mailto:username@example.org):

1. Look up [https://***example.org***/.well-known/lnurlp/***username***](https://example.org/.well-known/lnurlp/username)
2. Pay to the lnurl-pay link you found in step 2

Receiving at [username@example.org](mailto:username@example.org):

1. Serve your lnurl-pay link at [https://***example.org***/.well-known/lnurlp/***username***](https://example.org/.well-known/lnurlp/username)

Since I already had lnurl-pay links set up on [fitti.io](https://fitti.io) via [LNbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits), it took *me less than 10 minutes* to read the spec and implement it.",1629036691,46,1

p4rtir,bitcoin-sam,Bitcoin Is The Ethical Choice,"Below is a snippet from Hülsmann Jörg Guido's conclusion in his 2008 book, *The Ethics of Money Production* (pages 239-255). I felt it wonderfully emphasized the need to examine morality in money production. In the realm of ethics, it is indeed interesting we hold engineers and businesses to a moral standard punishable by loss of professional license, but not our politicians and monetary-policy decision makers whose impact can sometimes be more severe than a poorly built bridge or business deal.

**TL;DR:** Controlling and gaming the production of money is only permissible in a broken, unsound monetary system like fiat. There are ethical implications involving how money's production is dictated and decided. We need a sound money and anything less would be immoral.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Ethics of Money Production*** (pages 239-255)

We have argued that these monetary institutions have not come into existence out of any economic necessity. They have been created because they allow an alliance of politicians and bankers to enrich themselves at the expense of all other strata of society. This alliance emerged rather spontaneously in the seventeenth century; it developed in multifarious ways up to the present day, and in the course of its development it created the current monetary institutions.

Let us emphasize that this alliance is, and has always been, an ad hoc alliance. We do not claim that our monetary institutions have resulted from a three-hundred-year-old conspiracy between bankers and politicians. It is certainly naïve to assume that no such conspiracy has ever been concocted, or is not presently concocted. But, as our analysis has shown, the conspiracy question is only of secondary importance. The driving force that propelled the development of central banks and paper money was the reckless determination of governments, both aristocratic and democratic, to increase their revenue, if necessary in violation of good faith and of all established rules of commerce.^(1) On this point we find, again, fundamental agreement between our economic analysis and the ethical concerns of the Church:

&gt;This concentration of power and might, the characteristic mark, as it were, of contemporary economic life, is the fruit that the unlimited freedom of struggle among competitors has of its own nature produced, and which lets only the strongest survive; and this is often the same as saying, those who fight the most violently, those who give least heed to their conscience.^(2)

Notice again that our present study does not purport to provide a full discussion of all considerations that have been brought up on the subject. We have presented a broad picture and dealt with details only where appropriate. The point was to show that the evidence for our case is sufficiently clear and sufficiently important to warrant closer examination. The serious student must still acquaint himself with the discussions that can be found in other works on our subject.

MONETARY REFORM

The monetary institutions of our time are in dire need of reform for many reasons. Present-day discussion of monetary reform, insofar as it takes place at all, however, suffers from an amazing intellectual narrowness. It is of course impossible to provide the antidote in a short study, but our exposition might nevertheless be useful in pointing out the directions where alternatives might be found. One such alternative is the natural production of money, even though it presently plays no practical role.^(3) It is a significant fact that one cannot get around the natural order even in theory, because it alone provides a solid starting point for any serious analysis of monetary institutions. And in monetary policy too, as we have argued, it is something like the optimum optimorum.

Notice that we do not recommend simply turning back the clock. A natural monetary order in our day is certainly not identical with what a natural monetary order would have looked like in the sixteenth century. We do not advocate abolishing credit cards, checking deposits, and whatever other viable financial institutions might originate on the market. **The point is to return to a universal respect for property rights**. We need not change instruments such as banknotes, paper money, and the organization of central banks; but the legal rules under which central banks operate and under which paper money is produced. We need to abolish the legal privileges of central banks and monetary authorities. There is no tenable rationale for preventing the citizens from using the best monies and money substitutes. Quite to the contrary, a reform in this direction is necessary for many reasons. Immediate and vigorous action is called for.

Many will object that it is impossible to bring about such a return, now that we have progressed so far on the way toward a global paper money. This is a thoroughly defeatist point of view because it takes the coming disaster (hyperinflation or global tyranny) for granted. Most importantly, however, it is morally wrong. As we have argued, we face a problem of the human will; but this is after all only a problem of the will. In 1258, King Louis IX of France began a monetary reform that would eventually restore the currency of his realm on natural metallic bases. He seems to have been the last ruler so far of his country who fulfilled God’s promise:

&gt;In place of bronze I will bring gold, instead of iron, silver; In place of wood, bronze, instead of stones, iron; I will appoint peace your governor, and justice your ruler. (Isaiah 60:17) 

 It might be argued that Saint Louis had a comparatively easy job. After all, he just needed to clean up the mess in what was still basically a metallic monetary system. By contrast, fractional-reserve banking and paper money have been with us for quite a while, and they have changed habits and even our mentality. Yet consider that China ran through various experiments with fractional-reserve banking and paper money for five hundred years (from about 960 to about 1455 of our time) and in this epoch repeatedly suffered from hyperinflations and other problems that we have analyzed in this volume. Then the country returned to monetary sanity when the political leadership no longer suppressed the circulation of silver and copper coins. And consider that the makers of the American Revolution, the Founding Fathers of the U.S. Constitution gloriously cut the legal ground from under the century-long tradition of colonial paper money. Consider that President Andrew Jackson, against the frantic resistance of vested interests in banking and financial circles, withdrew the legal privileges from all fractional-reserve banks and cut back the public debt to an amount that could have been paid by any individual wealthy citizen. There is no reason why today we should be unable to accomplish such things, or something even better.

&amp;#x200B;

**Footnotes**

1. We do not of course claim that every single government betrayed the public faith; only that several of them in the past three hundred years did this. Their decisions gave us our present-day monetary institutions. The alliance with the banking industry resulted merely from the technical superiority of banknotes and paper money as vehicles of that illicit increase of revenue

Hey guys. I trade crypto lightly, and normally just invest into Bitcoin. I think I've made a few comments here.

However, recently, I've fallen into hard times. Bills are catching up, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep my job, due to covid.

I'm still not sure how all this stuff works, but if you could drop a guy a few dollars in bitcoin, it'd mean a lot. Right now, I'm going to sell any bitcoin I have, and anything I can keep saving, I will. I hope I can get out of  this debt soon, and if I can, I'll pay all of you back, in full.

p3znri,D2YDT2,Thanks to Bitcoin I'm a millionaire,"I invested a few thousand in 2015 and now have a net worth of $1.5m after I pay my taxes on sales.  I'm 32.

I diversified out mostly in the 40s this year (still holding 2.5) which feels really dumb imho and I'm kicking myself for it. I was having a hard time sleeping with all my money in one thing and I have a career now where I can earn $200k/year that I want to do well at.

When I first bought in, I was basically living in a converted basement apartment to save and invest after learning about early retirement from Mr. Money Mustache's blog after realizing that doing this out of a normal apartment would be a pipe dream.  I told a few people what I was doing then stopped because I started getting tagged as a crazy person like I was buying videogame coins or participating in drug dealing.  Not that that stopped me, I just stopped telling people.

Do I think bitcoin will keep going up?  Yes, but slower than most others think.  A lot are calling for $100k in 2021, but they might have to wait for 2022.  What we have here might be a breakout, but it might also turn into a bull trap and a bear market (that we'll inevitably recover from).  The long term trend is obviously going to be positive in reference to USD because there are only 21m bitcoins while the fed can print infinitely.  That math is easy.

I encourage the people who read this to look into defi or decentralized finance.  You can easily double your money in bitcoin.  You can easily 100x your money by working on a small defi project that hits it big.

p3yxkh,Yung-Split,Bitcoin is Freedom,"  

In a fiat money system the value of human labor is stolen through an invisible tax called inflation, which is effectuated through currency debasement and money printing. The system has dug itself so far into a debt hole that we cannot stop or the whole system will collapse. 

In an inflationary money system, the value of your labor goes down every year. The position this puts you in as an employee, is an endless cycle of trying to figure out how to work more, work longer hours,  and earn more literally just so you can maintain the EXACT SAME standard of living that you had the year prior. You have to go to your corporate overlords and BEG them to pretty please give you a higher wage, because you automatically get a wage cut every year due to money printing stealing your purchasing power. 

This brings us to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a fixed supply monetary system that cannot be debased at-will by self-interested monetary overlords. It cannot be debased, and because of the natural growth of technological innovation which is a strong deflationary force in the modern world, under a Bitcoin based money system, we would enter into a deflationary economic environment, that favors the middle and lower classes.

No longer do you have to beg for a raise, you automatically get a raise in purchasing power every year. Because goods and services are allowed to benefit from the deflationary forces of technological innovation, groceries become cheaper, housing becomes cheaper. 

Everything you need to survive becomes more affordable, because no longer is your surplus value and the innovation of technology being siphoned and stolen from you through endless money printing by centralized entities and used for inefficient central planning.

Under a deflationary Bitcoin monetary system, you could work less and have more time to pursue your interests and spend time with your loved ones, because you would be more financially free.

Bitcoin is financial freedom from an economic system designed to exploit you for your value. Bitcoin is freedom from financial slavery.",1628905355,19,1

Fast forward to today and I still have the same amount as I did when I bought back in. I didn’t sell at 60K and I for sure learned my lesson and didn’t sell as it tumbled to 29k. That being said, I learned my lesson. When I look back on posts of people that had BTC at 1$ a coin and others respond saying you would have sold at XX that might be true.

I want to close many of my long positions but Binance has suspended GBP transactions in UK (top work Binance bell-ends..pardon my French)

Would anyone be so kind as to give me a detailed step-by-step guide (the more detail the better) on the safest and cheapest way (ideally both criteria can be met!) to cash out and reap fiat rewards...

I have read that you can convert positions to a coin with lowest transaction fees on Binance (whatever that may be), transfer to another exchange (ideally, centralised as not gained enough confidence/ experience with DEXs) such as coinbase pro, convert to GBP and withdraw to my bank

If you're happy to answer the above and itching to share more knowledge, please help a newbie out with:

- Best hot wallet (have a cold - trezor model t) and basic tutorial

- DEXs 

- best place to trade 

- any other wisdom deemed too vital to keep to oneself 

I have a 1st class honours degree in economics and finance (and, ashamed to say, worked for a multinational devil investment bank who has never manipulated markets....ha....please don't judge...I feel  dirty enough) - not a boast (anyone can do it providing you're willing to work hard at cheating), I just feel confident with the trading/financial aspect so not looking for such lessons/advice ...just need to know how I can put into practice 

Thank you in advance you kind folks - I can compensate your efforts with beers or nudes (I would choose the beers) - or anyone doing economics degree can repay in coursework, exams (providing you look like a hobbit on crack) etc

PS: as a traditional economist/trader I was sceptical of crypto for many years, believing bitcoin to be a ponzi scheme (expensive lesson in naivety). However, after scratching the surface I saw the light, and converted faster than a ISIS bride...Just think what crypto demand is going to look like in 20 years when the tech phobic generation has been replaced by a more annoying yet digital savvy one 🤑",1628900286,1,1

Many people thought Bitcoin was going to the low $20ks, yet its looking like Bitcoin will leave them behind. Those people failed to look at the on-chain data . It clearly was showing more coins becoming illiquid as HODLers were buying the dip and storing the coins for long term. There have been other factors as well but I think this will be the one to shine. As more people remove coins from circulation is creates a supply squeeze that will ultimately send the price up. Hope you're prepared for this squeeze.

I'm interested in buying a hardware wallet. Therefore, I've been reading and trying to understand how they work before I make my final decision. After my research, and knowing how software wallets work (I guess), I've come with an interesting thought.

Imagine that I format an old laptop and install a software wallet such as exodus or trust in it without ever turning on the internet (through a USB stick for example). After that, I create my wallet, I save my seed phrase somewhere save and now I can send any crypto that I have to that wallet address. 

Some years go by, BTC is now 200k and I want to sell it. I turn on the old laptop internet for a few seconds, send my crypto to my exchange wallet address and I turn the internet off again. 

How different is this from a hardware wallet? I know there is those few seconds where the internet is turned on and there is the possibility of my old laptop being hacked but besides that isn't the concept similar? Another question that I have is how long would take the wallet to sync after some years offline?

I'm sorry if I said something stupid, I'm still learning.",1628117300,19,1

I am new to Bitcoin and have a technical question. Maybe you could help me. I am trying to understand the mechanisms behind Bitcoin and can't get my head around one topic: Node discovery. Now, if you set up a node, you basically become a member of the Bitcoin network. Other nodes have to discover you and you have to discover other nodes. As far as I understand there is no virtual private networking involved, no tunneling etc. Just plain HTTPS connections to public IP addresses of nodes routable on the internet. But how do you know these addresses? How do other nodes discover your node's public IP address? Is there a central entity or several central entities where you first have to ""register"" your node?

oy202j,Imaginary-Friendship,US politicians and Bitcoin (pro vs anti),"I wanted to make a list of politicians that are pro- and anti- bitcoin based on party affiliation. The following is that list. The anti-bitcoin list is a little tricky since I’m not always sure if a person is against it or just wants regulations. That being said, I think we know how anti-bitcoin Elizabeth Warren and Brad Sherman are and I didn’t want to hide that since I think they should be held accountable for their position.

The list was also tricky because do I add presidential candidates or not? I mean, they don’t necessarily have power right now. Similarly, do I include Trump as anti-bitcoin since he no longer has power? If I add trump shouldn’t I include White House staff under Trump? Further, I didn’t include all the folks running for congress, or as governors, mayors, etc. - there have been a bunch but it’s hard to know if they’re doing it to get funding or if they really believe in it. And, I only added other organizations (SEC) when it was pretty obvious that the person was for or against bitcoin. I did add Gary Gensler because of his MIT classes - I don’t remember him being for or against it, but I got the feeling he liked it so I added him as pro-bitcoin.

Anyway, let me know if I missed anyone or got something wrong. I went fairly fast and I feel like I must have missed some folks since I would have expected it to be a bit more even. I would like to list more democrats as pro-bitcoin (regardless of your political party we should want more politicians on both sides to be pro-bitcoin).

I want to pop some BTC into Binance from Bitcoin Core for the first time and I am incredibly confused by transaction fees.

So simple question: I just want to transfer my Bitcoin, I don't care if it takes several days - what do I set the fee to, in sats per kilobyte. This twitter feed seems to suggest I should set it to just 1000? https://twitter.com/CoreFeeHelper

1. I started out with the BRD wallet app (mainly because it was recommended in the FAQs here). Created a wallet, noted / remembered the 12-word recovery phrase, and bought a few BTC using different methods/exchanges. They showed up in my wallet just fine.

2. Now I wanted to experiment with other wallet apps (BRD is quite buggy), so I installed the coinbase wallet app, and chose to restore my wallet. I entered the 12 words, the wallet got created just fine... But empty. 

3. I then transferred some BTC from the old BRD wallet to the new coinbase wallet... So far so good, my funds are now split between the two wallets.

4. Next, I wanted to try another wallet, so I installed the one from Bitcoin.com. Again, chose to import an existing wallet, provided the same passphrase, and again ended up with an empty wallet.

What am I doing wrong, or where is my misunderstanding? Shouldn't restoring a wallet from a passphrase also restore my balance and transactions? Thanks in advance for any insight.",1629452161,18,1

p7wjw9,SlugFunkE,Afghanistan and Decentralization," 

I stumbled upon a video on why Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. In the pre-modern world the Persians, Greeks, Arabs, and Mongols have all tried and failed. With that failure came the demise of their empires. In the modern world the British, Soviets and now the United States of America have tried and failed.

1. British 1938-1842
2. Soviets 1979-1989
3. United States 2001-2021

But why is it so hard to conquer?

No central authority, too many tribes, and horrible terrain. The Taliban just had to wait the United States out, to play the long game, to box 12 rounds and they did and succeeded. The reward vs cost wasn't worth it. Trillions of dollars spent and no real exit strategy forced the mighty country to cut their losses and leave.

The truth is Bitcoin is Afghanistan and the Taliban is every person running a node. Government's around the world can try to stop it, China today, maybe USA tomorrow but it wont work. Too many tribes and too many nodes, and most importantly no person or organization to conquer.

I have a diverse portfolio and some on my coins are more profitable than Bitcoin but the only coin that matters is Bitcoin. If you hold any Bitcoin no matter how small just know you are placing a bet against your currency. We might be from different countries, religions, or genders, but we are unconsciously fighting a battle that many of us can't even conceive.

Good luck and I'll leave you with a quote from Alexander the Great,

I have several friends on the ground in country. Funds would go directly to communities in need of food, water, shelter and medical treatment. 

Tax exempt receipts will be given by end of Aug.

I want to stay as close to the chest as possible. I know this involves running your own node and somehow buying directly from miners(?). 

Can someone give me the sparknotes to getting started?

Is it better to mine my own coin or just run a node. What about selling? How do you sell without using an exchange and being marked. 

I'm very new to these concepts so I would appreciate if anyone has the time to lay out some groundwork so I can get started researching and learning further on my own without taking up too much of your time!

p8y1km,balthazar_d,Can Bitcoin offer substantial value to individuals if fiat doesn't collapse?,"Many investors I respect specifically advise against making investment decision based on macro trends. Accurately predicting inflation or analyzing the impact of sound money on the economy is arguably beyond anyone's ability, let alone that of an average person like me. And although the economic argument sounds convincing and I buy into Bitcoin's store of value narrative, I'd like to know how the self-interest of the individual will drive bitcoin's adoption.

So instead of the top-down approach (e.g. governments debase currency -&gt; individuals lose trust in fiat savings -&gt; they turn to bitcoin en masse), I'd like to hear some bottom-up reasons for bitcoin's adoption (bitcoin adoption benefits me -&gt; I tell my friends and family -&gt; they tell their friends -&gt; network effect ). But please exclude expectation of future appreciation as a growth driver - in the absence of other tangible benefits this reduces bitcoin to a pyramid scheme. 

Some of the things that I thought of:

   1) instant settlement via lightning.   
\-But when looking at it from an average person's perspective, we already have that via Venmo &amp; wise.com, credit cards &amp; many others. The USP isn't clear.   
\- the exception to this is privacy concerns. But unless you're involved in shady stuff, the vast majority of people really don't care, especially if selling user data makes products cheaper or free. Plus bitcoin isn't the best currency for privacy anyway.

   2) fast 24/7 settlements on the base layer will benefit corporations   
\-  only if bitcoin's price stabilizes and after it's out of the woods with regulators.   
   3)  benefits in the developing world (though many of these include macro-arguments)

I struggle to find others... Yes Bitcoin is a protocol like the tci/ip on top of which other apps can emerge. But the Internet isn't ubiquitous because it can topple dictatorships &amp; promote free speech. It's ubiquitous because every one of us couldn't live without streaming videos, music, porn, books etc. People saw this in the 90's before most of these were realized. How or why will I be unable to live without bitcoin if the fiat collapse doesn't happen? 

P.S. The title is purposefully contentious since this is my first Reddit post ever and I'd really love to learn from someone more knowledge. Thanks!",1629575443,40,0

The people who bought Amazon in 2000.

How about the crazy woman who put $5,000 into netflix in the beginning?

How about that friend who has half his IRA in Tesla?

That guy who took his sales commissions and kept buying real estate in 2014,2015,2016,2017?

That family friend who bought gold in the early 70s (no joke my dad's friend did this-he sold and even borrowed to buy as much gold as possible in the early 70s).

Most of society doesn't want to invest. We could state that most cannot invest due to wages. FAIR point. However, I know tons of people who could invest-they have the disposable income. They don't want to. I repeat -they do NOT want to. They don't want to learn. They want to just roll with it. Maybe they put some money into what their advisor recommends. And why does he recommend it? His boss told him it's a good investment.

If you are buying bitcoin, unless you are trying to be a quick trader (hint: most traders lose money), you have done something different. Bitcoin is not close to on the radar for most people. You have accepted volatility in exchange for a long term vision. Best of luck!",1629574264,267,31

Luckily i didn't throw away the pc i used then but i had forgotten my passkey so it was still accessible, moving to early last year during the pandemic when the news of crypto hit all social media, i got to see that the price of bitcoin has increased! I felt so happy, i was $48k rich....i started searching for my Pc and found it in my kids room, it turned out that they had started using it to play video games when they notice that i no longer needed the pc, i hurriedly grabbed it and checked if my Bitcoins were still intact, of course yes! They were still intact, i was so happy i decided to send some to my new trustwallet but i was asked for my recovery phrase due to it has been a while i logged in, i couldn't offer it and sadly, i lost my 4 bitcoins. I still see them intact in my wallet but cannot access them due to recovery key phrase, i had to spend $12k just to get one when i heard it was still on the rise.

# Axis Technologies Group, Inc. (OTC: AXTG) ('AXTG' or the 'Company') has announced a groundbreaking strategic partnership with O-Power LLC to provide the world's first truly 'green' cryptocurrency. The envisaged system will be capable of producing any desired cryptocurrency using crypto-mining computers and peripherals that are powered verifiably by electricity produced by O-Power's patented 100% zero-emissions electricity generators that offer scalable, portable, constant (24/7/365) power production that does not use solar, geothermal, hydroelectric or wind-turbine technologies to produce electrical power.

# The generators produce no toxic waste and they can be deployed in any environment regardless of climate, weather, seasonal conditions, proximity to bodies of water, or the availability of wind or sunshine, to produce constant electricity that is beyond 'eco-friendly' for as little as 1.5¢ per kilowatt.

# About O-Power

I want to say that I have never been so proud and so anxious of a podcast release. On the one hand, this serves as a campaign against a gigantic unregulated and deceptive exchange. On the other hand, I have put a target on my head.

Let's fucking go buddies.

[https://anchor.fm/when-the-music-stops/episodes/Exposing-Binance-w-Francis-Kim-e16b0jo](https://anchor.fm/when-the-music-stops/episodes/Exposing-Binance-w-Francis-Kim-e16b0jo)

It all started on May 19th of 2021 when Francis Kim made the perfect call to short Bitcoin on the Binance exchange. While the markets tanked, he saw over a 100 thousand USD of profits, but he would soon realize that Binance was not like the exchanges he was familiar with in legacy finance.

A power outage, an exchange that banned the closing of orders... and POOF, all of his 171 thousand dollars vanished.

What started as a simple quest to get what he deserves turned into a rabbit hole of red flags. Francis Kim soon realized that this was not the only issue with Binance. His tweet from August 6th, just a month and a half later, went viral when he revealed the findings of his dive into the largest crypto exchange in the world.

Join me in the (August 11, 2021) conversation with a man who has risked everything to find the truth, uncover the lies and get justice.

*Up to 100 players will pay entry fees and engage in different game modes of elimination until there are 10 left. Those 10 players will split the crypto. For example, a mario game level where 10 bags of crypto are scattered around for players to fight over and find. Each bag represents a 10x of their initial deposit. Or a race to the finish line of a level, where NFT based powers ups slow down your opponents.*

pay6tb,Mountain_Ad8844,Beware of SIM swap hacks! My story,"I would like to remind everyone to check with their phone carriers on what is required to swap your number to another SIM card and to make sure your phone provider account has a very strong password.

I was recently SIM swapped via Straight Talk. Straight Talk only required my name, phone number, and the last four digits of my SIM card's serial number (which was easily accessible to the hacker due to already being in my account) in order to move forward with a SIM swap. I was then notified via my Yahoo account of someone accessing my email using 2FA and they sent a text message to my phone to authenticate with. I found it odd because I never received a text message. I figured maybe it was a scammer trying to get me to change my password.

The next morning I realized I had no phone service and spent over 8 hours with Straight Talk support. One of the representatives noticed the SIM card serial number was different than the one I had. I swapped my SIM card back and had service again. Changed the passwords on my email accounts and deleted the app passwords they generated because that was all I thought they did. Two days later, I get a bunch of emails from Coinbase saying my transfer funds were not approved. TWO WHOLE DAYS. Called my bank and am in the process of getting a new account.

This is the first time in three months that the coin has touched $50,000. 

**What happened?** The cryptocurrency market has been a roller coaster ride of emotions over the past few months. Bitcoin reached an all-time high around mid-April when it reached $64,000. Soon after, the coin experienced a large sell-off causing the total price to nosedive. It finally stopped at a price point of $29,608. Since then, however, the coin has jumped back in price by 70%. Thanks to some retail investors accepting bitcoin, it has given some investors more confidence in the cryptocurrency.  

**What is a bear market?** The term is used to describe the market when its price drops. In order for it to be a bear market, the price of certain securities needs to be dropped for a prolonged period of time. This term is commonly used for cryptocurrencies because the coins are constantly seeing periods of highs and lows thanks to massive sell-offs and overall volatility within the space. Be warned when investing in any cryptocurrency and be aware of its volatility.

pavps5,Duran_naruD,Where is the future of Bitcoin?,"Hi guys, 

Question from me:  


How does bitcoin have a future when:  
**1. it relies on ""old"" POW technology?**

As we know, modern cryptocurrencies work on POS system, while BTC cannot adopt it.

POW system as we know is not environmentally friendly, so where is the future of bitcoin?

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is:  
**2. speed**   


Bitcoin does 4 transactions per second, while Visa does as much as 25,000.

&amp;#x200B;

This allows Visa card users to just tap the card on the machine while shopping in the store and after just a few seconds transaction is done and users can leave the store.  


Now, if bitcoin becomes an accepted payment, how can Bitcoin users do the same?

If I buy groceries with bitcoin, how can I leave the store when I have to wait for the slow transaction?

Do I have to wait 5 min for a transaction to be done?  


**3. DIGITAL GOLD?**

People tend to believe in the future of bitcoin by comparing it to gold.  


And the only reason for that comparison is: Bitcoin has a limited supply.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok cool, but as far as we are concerned:

\- Gold is tangible

\- Gold is beautiful

\- Gold can be worn

\- Gold has uses in technology

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin has nothing from that list (except uses in technology), so my question remains:

**How does bitcoin have a future?**",1629837338,17,1

Of course the government can't stop you from having bitcoin, but what they can do is ban businesses from accepting or holding bitcoin.  And the businesses would follow that law.  I believe they will try to ban bitcoin because the last thing that the government wants is for the people to have a deflationary currency.  If something costs 100 sats now but would cost 90 sats in a week, people will hold off buying things as long as they can and this will bring the economy to a halt.

patifu,Particular_Sun_4589,This is how the Chivo wallet app will work,"Hi everyone, My name is Guillermo, just a Salvadoran guy that wants to give out information about the Chivo wallet app in case you didn't know.


As you know Bitcoin will become legal tender in El Salvador, the law passed Congress and will go into effect on September 7. The government of El Salvador has created the Chivo wallet app, this is how it's supposed to work, let me know what you think.


Implementation: 

The government will give to every Salvadoran the equivalent of $30 in BTC, all you need to do is open an account using the Chivo wallet. Yes, it will ask for you government issued ID, facial recognition, etc. 

You will have 2 different balances: USD balance and BTC balance, in the same app. 

You will see your BTC balance fluctuate as the price of BTC goes up or down. 

Your USD balance will NOT change. 

You can transfer money between your 2 balances. 

Every merchant is mandated to accept BTC if the customer wants to pay in BTC, but since the app has 2 balances, you as a merchant can receive it in USD and keep it that way. In other words, it's totally optional if you receive Bitcoin or USD in your app, the customer paid in BTC though. 

El Salvador citizens can convert the cryptocurrency to USD and withdraw it in cash at Chivo ATMs. 

Fees: neither the sender nor the receiver will pay any fees when buying something,  receiving a payment or withdrawing USD using the Chivo wallet app. 

You can use whatever wallet you like, Chivo wallet is just the most convenient way to make and receive exact payments, withdraw USD from an ATM, or convert BTC to USD, commission free. 

The government will assume price variations, they have created a $150,000,000 fund to back BTC to USD conversions (like a liquidity pool I think). 

More than 200 Chivo ATMs and 50 kiosks are now being installed in the country, they will open on September 7. 

The initial amount of $30 deposited in BTC after opening your account is to incentivize the use of BTC. 

Chivo wallet does not consume your mobile data, you just need to have internet signal from your provider. 

As a Salvadoran I really wish this to be successfully implemented, if so, we may see huge economic growth. 

I'm just concerned about one thing. If you pay attention, you can keep ""USD"" in your Chivo wallet account, these dollars didn't make it into the formal El Salvador economy bank system, part of that is in reality BTC that was transferred from abroad and converted into USD inside the app.


If my people don't learn the true value of BTC and it's convenience to make payments using the lightning network, and decide to use the app only to receive remittances and withdraw dollars, we may face a USD shortage. 

But the other side of the coin is interesting too. Some economists think that the real reason the government wants to do all of this is because they want to reduce the USD in circulation in our economy (to protect the country in case anything happens to the USD, you know in case the bubble explodes lol) and to do so, they are making Bitcoin legal tender, so they can make everyone use the Chivo wallet app and use the USD that won't be circulating in the traditional system to create a government e-coin pegged to our USD reserves. Think about it, seriously, read that again, that's possible, by reducing the USD in circulation you can use it to back a different asset legally to pay short term debt, El Salvador desperately needs to pay foreign debt, if the government creates a new coin they may have more control over its own debt or mint more coins if they need it. 

This could be genius, but also a catastrophe, let me know what you think",1629830735,91,1

Last summer, I purchased a new phone and activated it using a backup from my Apple account. When I did this, MyCelium required me to use my seed phrase to access my wallet. I did this successfully, and proceeded to use that MyCelium application for ~100 Bitcoin transactions between July 2020 and July 2021. That wallet had a balance of 1.05 BTC on it. Last week, that phone died, and I was required to restore my profile from a back-up onto a new iPhone. I did that today, and when I proceeded to use my seed phrase to access my Bitcoin wallet, I'm seeing my last transaction listed from July 2020, and a balance of 0.002 BTC on it.

I'm certain that I was using the same MyCelium wallet over the different iPhone versions. This is a shot in the dark but is there a way, using transaction ID's, to determine if separate transactions are being sent to the same wallet? What I mean by that is: I received Bitcoin on my wallet (which I thought was the same wallet the entire time) from the same source a number of times, both before last summer and over the last year. Is there a way to verify if these transactions were indeed sent to the same wallet, or if I mistakenly had been using a different wallet version over the past year and never wrote down the seed phrase.

Sorry if that's a bit confusing, I'm trying to be as clear as I can. More then willing to sign a contract promising someone 20% of this wallet if they can help me recover it. I've been speaking to recovery services for the past day but haven't proceeded with one yet. Any assistance would be much appreciated",1629998821,30,1

Bitcoin could then be an NFT of all the gold in the world, and the physical gold asset is more of a nostalgic memorabilia than actually worth any utility. People who buy and sell real assets can then just revert to the value of goods to gold, get a BTC value, and other cryptos are simply relative to BTC

pbzpee,Everydayfeelsthesame,Victim of sim swap coinbase question," Reposting here because [r/coinbase](https://www.reddit.com/r/coinbase/) just auto removes my post every time.

Hello,

I recently was a victim of a sim swap. Using SMS verification, the person got access into my email, [crpyto.com](https://crpyto.com/) account and bank account.

The person in question converted my current coins to BTC and then purchased about $10,000 USD of BTC through my stored debit card on the account. Both were then transferred to 2 different coin base wallets and then appear to have been a transferred several more times.

I have been a big battle with my bank and [crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) and neither has been very helpful in the matter.

My bank is insisting that all the charges are showing as verified on their end, due to them ""confirming"" the purchases through a phone call and sms. They are refusing to re-open the case. [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) is saying that the money was lost due to my poor security, they are also refusing to look into it.

So I've been trying to do some research on the matter. I've already filed a police report and attempted to contact the FBI. I looked at the transactions on [https://oxt.me/](https://oxt.me/) and the BTC was transferred to 2 different coin base accounts.

I believe a coin base accounts are attached to a name and I D. I have the addresses of the coin base wallets that it were transferred to. What are the odds that I could find this persons name using this information? How easy is it for someone to fake an identity in this case?

I have reached out to coin base support on the matter and FBI. But I'm not sure how likely it is that these are simply fake accounts and a dead end.",1629985136,88,1
pbzk0r,MrComedy325,Why SEC Might Grant Bitcoin Futures ETF By October,"A pair of Bloomberg analytics speculated this week that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could approve of a Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) by October.

Definition: Similar to other commodities, a Bitcoin futures ETF allows investors to speculate on the future price of the cryptocurrency.

Fine Print: The analysts, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, say that the SEC is looking into a Bitcoin ETF after the recent withdrawals of Ether futures ETFs last week. This includes a timeline of 75 days later, which goes until the end of October.

Financial Institutions: A report this week indicated that Citigroup (NYSE: C) wants to launch a Bitcoin Futures ETF. Valkyrie Investments is also looking into this.

Final Thoughts: With a futures ETF, investors can bet on Bitcoin without actually buying any cryptocurrency.

So, just got a ""potentially suspicious login attempt to your account"" e-mail from Binance and I'm taking this as a clear and final sign that I need a cold wallet. Pulled the trigger and bought a Ledger and am really looking forward to getting my coins off the exchange and complete into my ""hands"". I'm unfamiliar with how to set it up or with how to even transfer the coins from the exchange to the wallet but I'm sure there are youtube videos that offer step-by-step tutorials so I should be OK on that front.

My question is, what should I be on the lookout for before I start to set up the wallet? I've read countless posts about fraudulent wallets, pre-set seed phrases, etc., and want to make sure that I am covering my ass as much as possible. I've taken the first safe step by ordering directly from Ledger France and not through a reseller like Amazon but beyond that, I'm looking for help on what other red flags I should look out for or what precautionary steps I should be taking.

pbxvpf,Prudent_Plum_7644,Good bye Bitcoin dream...life savings gone for good,"I completely messed up guys, my life savings are gone for good, I have learned a devastating hard lesson.

That's my story:

I strongly believe in Bitcoin becoming the world biggest store of value, it's not an IF anymore, is just a matter of WHEN.

During the last years me and my wife have put in Bitcoins everything we had and slowly managed to reach 1.7 BTC, our entire life savings, 10 years of grinding and accepting odd jobs trying to save every dollar possible and buying every BTC amount we could.

When BTC started recently raising from 30k to 40k I made the biggest mistake ever: trying to earn more than just HODLING (spoiler: it doesn't end well).

I started looking at YouTube videos explaining how to leverage, how to earn more, how to trade futures, etc.

In matter of hours my YouTube feed was completely flooded by videos of Michael Saylor, one of the world top CEOs betting hard on BTC by doubling and tripling down his BTC holdings and claiming it would easily go to a million each BTC, I was HOOKED.

For one time in this life I wanted to be a ""hero"" in my wife's eyes, I wanted to make a bold move and save her and us from a life of odd and low wages jobs, I saw an opportunity and I went for it without even knowing what I was doing.

I have put all ours 2.1 BTCs on a leveraged future for BTC going to 100k $ and I was already envisioning the 21 BTCs in profit. I saw this as a gateway to exit our mediocre life. It was our chance and I had to go for it. Of course she didn't know that and still doesn't know...

Of course it didn't play out, BTC went from touching 50k $ down to 47k $ and our whole life savings have been wiped out.

I still haven't say anything to my wife, she doesn't know that and this is killing me from the inside. I just don't know what to say to her, I'm simply devastated. I barely can watch myself in the mirror. These funds were supposed to be our small treasure, something that would have help us in the future.

Please follow my advice, don't trade guys, don't fall into these marketing traps like I did.

Just HODL, BTC is the best thing ever happened to humanity, just HODL and don't risk your beloved BTCs like I did.

Peace.",1629978542,2181,1

In other words, how great is that 0.38% of wallet are in control of 85.74% of bitcoin? 

Are we aware of these people obviously move the market uptrend in long term? 

how can we sure that these people someday would not mass dump the market and they will never move it uptrend again? 

how much are these people coordinated?

pe2frp,vladusatii,Is Hal Finney Satoshi Nakamoto? Evidence thusfar:,"**Note**: NSA and other very talented investigators/engineers have concluded that Satoshi Nakamoto hid his tracks too well. The only remaining way to know who created Bitcoin is stylometry (using writing style to compare two like-minded entities in hopes of discovering a better version of a person's fingerprint). 

OpenPGP has online documentation, found from Google Scholar, that was authored by PGP's old lead developer Hal Finney. If you find any paragraph in the article or in Bitcoin's original whitepaper, you notice two things in common that are 100% stylistic choices:

1. Both have a double-space after every sentence.
2. Both are written, according to AI, the *same exact* way. All of it, everything, is written in the same tone, sentence structure, etc.
   1. This was determined using *I Write Like.* This site uses statistical analysis to say who you write most like. If you paste Hal's sentences or Satoshi's sentences, both times, you'll receive the same person: H. P. Lovecraft. This author died in the 1900's, but it is still shocking that both compare to the same person. Every time.

More evidence that might help:

* Dorian Nakamoto lived on the same street as Hal. He picked his last name in addition to a Japanese first name to look anonymous.
* Hal writes in British English quite often. So does Satoshi.
* Hal got immobile from Lou Gehrig's Disease and stopped contributing to the internet at the exact time that Satoshi said goodbye. Hal died and we haven't seen Satoshi since.
* Hal had two IP's connected to his house through a PRISM analysis. One was connected to an 'internet freedom' forum and one posted on the same one only 'twice' -- so did Satoshi.
* Hal's IP and Satoshi's are on the same street. Satoshi didn't use a VPN for a POST request to a forum. Neither did Hal.",1630266985,318,1

pe27zm,ministryofme,How tightly should Microstrategy or BTC mining companies’ share price track BTC value?,"With Microstrategy’s large holdings, if BTC doubles, would that mean their share price would pretty much roughly double? Or is it a little more complicated? I’m sure there are ways that their share price could drop based on many other factors, but I’d like to try and gauge how safe it would be when attempting to latch on to the inevitable BTC rise over the next 10+ years via shares. This is something I’m researching for my UK self-invested pension where sadly BTC ETFs aren’t available but UK and US stocks are. 

Similar question for large mining companies too (Marathon, Argo, etc), and if that would be a wise choice? Or if there’s anything that might make it a bad idea?",1630266308,8,1
pe24ec,next_rounds_on_me,"Because of my girlfriend, I lost over 3 whole BTC. Long rant incoming...","We have been dating over three years. I met her in Uni when I did a semester in Scotland. Some people search a lifetime to find someone like her. Our paths collided at the exact right moment for us both and we quickly became inseparable. Truth be told its a cosmic anomaly that I landed a girl like her. I am gangly and goofy; a real nerd. She is a beauty with a swimmer's body. But I digress.

 I have never had a ton of money. But I was VERY early to BTC and accumulated almost 3 coins by the time we met. My first purchase was at $909, so it was a lot easier to stack back then. 

Does she understand BTC? Not really. She barely understands money at all TBH. She looks at it as a hobby of mine. I see it as the keys to my (our?) financial future. 

So COVID comes along and totally wrecks her career (she is in tourism) and my income is down as well. We are borderline struggling financially but I was still DCA monthly. Not as much as I before, but still working my way towards my goal of 4 BTC. With prices at $48k, my $500 DCA wasn't much but it was steps in the right direction.

Here is where she doesn't understand money. With this economic uncertainty, and prices going up (HELLO INFLATION!), she wants to save CASH to make her feel more secure. She wants $$ in the bank. I have shown her websites, papers, and so much data about how BTC is deflationary and where we need to be positioned. She tunes me  out, and if I press the issue it turns into a verbal row and she ends up skwawking at me and disappearing. Believe me if she doesn't want to be found, she won't be. 

I had to make a decision. Do I want 4.0 and no GF, or 3.5 and the love of my life? After a few days she came back but she was acting very strange. She did sleep in the bed with me, which I didn't expect. I watched her sleep. I snuggled up behind her and nuzzled her slender neck, admiring her smooth skin in the moonlight. She pulled away from me. 

I turned on the light. It was time to clear the air. ""I have decided to not buy any more BTC until we are financially more stable. I am sorry I didn't respect your wishes. These are decisions we should make together.""

I immediately knew something was wrong. She then gave me the bad news...

She had taken my Trezor and thrown it in the lake. 

I RAGED. I am not violent but damn my fists were clenched in rage. HOW DARE SHE?!?!? I threw things. I literally flipped a table. I am not proud of how I reacted but there were YEARS of my labor in that device. At some point she slipped away.

I heard the safe clank open in the other room. My mother fucking keys are in there! There she stood in the door with the paper holding my 12 words in her mouth. Her eyes were full of tears. ""I am so sorry. Here, you need this"". She had just climbed out of the lake and was dripping wet. The water rolled off of her and onto the paper, leaching the ink off the paper and destroying my only copy of my backup phrase.

YOU BITCH! HOW COULD YOU?!?!?!?!??!??!

DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH THAT WAS WORTH?

I saw anger flash in her eyes as she lifted herself to her full height (about 15 feet tall). She issued a low guttural growl, bared her teeth and said ""About tree fiddy"".

It was then I saw her for what she was; a plesiosaur from the Jurassic Period.",1630265985,66,1

Can someone recommend me an app to track crypto portfolio that has a widget?

I've been using Bitrift, but it has a couple of annoyances, first it doesn't sync across devices, and second you have to record each currency on a transaction basis, i.e. you can't simply enter your balance and exchange. Also it would be nice if you could edit the app from your PC and it would sync across all devices.

I am not sure whether it's my country or not, but me and my father live separately. We both oddly have the same amount of land. He constructed a pool and numerous concrete slabs over the entire property, which in terms of materials summed up as 7500$. I bought the same materials to conduct the same EXACTLY construction project, but with a 2 year delay after my father, and I had to spend 12000$.

Cycle 1 = 50 BTC / block, will be 50% of all BTC mined.

Cycle 2 = 25 BTC / block, will be 25% of all BTC mined.

Cycle 3 = 12.5 BTC/ block, will be 12.5% of all BTC mined.

Cycle 4 = 6.25 BTC / block, will be 6.25% of all BTC mined.

Can't believe I didn't see it before, makes total sense now after the product of Blocks per Cycle (210,000 ) by the reward per block when compared to terminal BTC (21,000,000). I love math.

I'm sure many of you were already aware but for those who weren't wanted to share it.

With Bitcoin rising again, miners have been in a tailwind. Given high valuations of MARA and RIOT, I've been looking at under-the-radar companies operating in miners industry.

I found out that MKTY was pretty interesting. They don't operate as RIOT and MARA.

**MKTY Edge:**

* Operates at lower cost than MARA, and 4x cheaper than RIOT
* Managed by a PE firm
* Is more likely to be resilient to volality, since they sell their the currency mined
* Currently operating a 2.6 MW Facility in Washington State, and plans to expand to 53MW by end of the year. All their equipment has been bought from another miner bankruptcy from a few years ago (→ not subject to shortage equipment as opposed to any other competitor)  

* **Unconscionably low valuation – 3.5x EV/EBITDA and 28% FCF yield based on 1Q’22 run-rate**
* **1Q’22 run-rate guidance may be highly conservative based on recent developments**
* **Aligned and incentivized CEO with an impressive background in Private Equity**
* **Significant embedded upside optionality (ESG, SOTP, BTC price and strategic alternatives)**
* **Several catalysts to potentially make excess returns in the very near term (&lt; 3 month*****s)***

**Cost to mine**

* **MKTY energy cost: 0.024$ / KwH**
* Mara energy cost: 0.028$ / KwH
* Riot energy cost: 0.08$ / KwH (historial energy cost)

**Currently trading at an heavy discount compared to MARA and RIOT**

* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of RIOT : 423x
* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MARA: 995x
* **Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MKTY: 12x**

**Why is MKTY under-the-radar?**

* Recently uplisted on the Nasdaq
* Small Market Cap ($120mm)
* Management team focussing on execution rather than PR
* Low float &amp; high insider ownership (40%)
* Low volume (about 90k shares / day)

**Conclusion** MKTY sounds like a company to keep an eye on given all these reasons.

pcsc1w,TheForgetfulOptimist,The Never Too Late Fallacy,"So over the past several months I've seen this concept of its never too late to invest in BTC posted in countless posts and comments. Please also add the caveat that I personally don't know shit really, so take my ramblings with that in consideration. Regardless it seems appropriate to outline the reality, as I see it today, regarding the truth of BTC investment.

First, the obvious asymmetry of investing in BTC in 2010-11 and 2021 is so far from comparable it’s ridiculous. $1000 in the first months would have yielded 12,500 BTC or $750,000,000 at the 2021 peak. $1000 today buys you 2% of a single damn coin. Ok, so BTC hits $1 million. Early adopter investment $12.5B, 2021 investor $20K.

Investing in BTC today is equivalent to saying investing in Netflix or Amazon today is good as you haven’t missed the boat. Yes, yes you indeed have missed the boat. The boat left the port years ago. You missed tens of thousands to millions of percent growth. With the compounding effect a person could buy $1 million/year over years of those stocks and not match the person that put in $10K at IPO.

I see posts daily about people wrapping their entire life savings into BTC, what do they get in return? .5, .8, or maybe 1.5 BTC. Even in the event that BTC reaches $1 million, that investor will have at best a small nest egg. To be completely financially secure with BTC a person is going to need at least 30+ coins most likely, which is absolutely out of sight expensive for anybody not in the upper 1/4 of 1% of net worth class.

I’m not by any means saying investing in BTC now is totally bad (I still DCA in), quite contrary it’s still a good choice and will appreciate most likely. In the long term it could yield a sizeable return. The narrative of ""it's never too late"" needs to stop though. The difference is investors in 2010-2014 have complete fuck you money with wallets capable of being worth $1 billion easily if they held the coins they bought for literal pennies on the dollar. For an investor to match that today they would need to invest $50K weekly for years. Investors today will make great gains sure, but will never match the early adopters (2015 and before). With the probability of BTC ever dipping below even $20K again being quite small, the boat of MASSIVE gains has since set sail awhile ago. 

TLDR; Investing in BTC today still has upside potential for sure, but don't delude people/yourself into believing that the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars wrapped in today will even touch a fraction of a fraction of the gains reaped by people that bought in 6-10 years ago for 1% or less what you are putting in today. If you started investing in 2021 you are so far behind the curve that you will need to invest 100x or more today than you would have needed to 6-8 years ago to reach the same returns.",1630086554,43,1

My only advice would be make sure you are hedging by either futures or inverse leveraged tokens.

Hi everyone my name is Arbin and I am 17 years old. My father used to work in WiFi and LAN network repairs for foreign aid companies in Afghanistan. My father was killed on 21 Aug because he refused to serve the Taliban on a full time basis.

Over the last 2 years my father taught me a song which he made up (and makes no sense) however the song has 12 words which he emphasized on every time we sang. Whenever we were alone he would make me repeat this song and emphasize on these 12 particular words, always ensuring that I had the order of them correct.

He told me that if something were to happen to him, that I would be able to recover cryptocurrency that he had saved, and the only way to do this was using the 12 words. He told me never to give these 12 words to anyone and never to type them on the internet.

Can someone please advice me how I can recover these funds without giving these 12 words out to anyone or typing them out on any computer?",1630378575,44,1

Bitcoin gets into the mortgage ecosystem when home owner wants Bitcoin and not fiat in exchange for their house. Housing newbie who does not have Bitcoin will have to borrow Bitcoin from banks (or Nexo, or defi), to buy their dream house and repay the Bitcoin later.

Now here is where it gets tricky: Bitcoin appreciates in value over time (thats the founding reason why we are all here on this sub reddit), meaning the Bitcoin debt would not be inflated away, if not appreciate in value, making it more and more difficult for the borrower to repay the Bitcoin loan in the future.

Or look at it this way: Bitcoin price rise has been (and most likely will continue to) outpace property price rise……so who would borrow Bitcoin to buy property?

Conclusion: For the people who does not own enough Bitcoin to buy a property (eg. Say $500k worth), then most likely they will not borrow Bitcoin to pay for a property. It is much more beneficial for them to HODL Bitcoin instead because it is the best performing asset.

1. Firstly, do I have to use a third party app like Electrum on my phone?  Why doesn't Trezor have this built into their app?

&amp;#x200B;

2. Is there a tutorial somewhere I can watch on how to use the phone Electrum app?  It seems all the tutorials are using the desktop client (no thanks!).

&amp;#x200B;

3. I clearly messed up the first time because I never got prompted for the private key of the paper wallet or the password.  This is why a tutorial would be nice.  I find the Electrum app on the phone pretty terrible, but it is trusted, which is what counts.

&amp;#x200B;

4. I swear when I used  Mycelium or another sweeper in the past I was able to never use a  Mycelium  private key, it allowed me to transfer directly from the paper to the exchange (in this case Trezor).  Can the Electrum phone app do this?  Or do I have to do two transfers?  (One to the phone Electrum app wallet, and then another to my Trezor)

pep2pi,throwaway29801A,Drop your pride and listen,"I consider myself very lucky. I bought several properties over the last 8 years. I did NOT understand the money supply going up, but I did understand that the low rates made payments affordable (while many argued bubble I knew the payment is what mattered).

I remember a condo I looked at (and ended up buying) was bought at the bottom by the seller who had an all in payment of $1300 (hoa, taxes, principle/interest). That condo was renting for $1500. Literally the condo paid for itself AND generated cash flow. The market for that condo rent is now $2100 a month.

While I got lucky, I will tell you that I had many friends that had a chance to buy and didn't. Their general response was ""it's going to a crash"". What the truth is that they put in little research and were frustrated because they thought they missed out. Life was fine for them, and it still is-but they missed out on massive financial gains. Many of the highest educated and also some of the highest IQ people I know have way less wealth than people I think are dufuses.  Why did the dufus get rich? The dufus was willing to listen. Just like I missed out on bitcoin in 2015, and many of my friends missed out on housing, I implore you to listen. 

The moral: Don't be jealous. Put in the work and make a decision. Don't make a decision off one post, one article. Read, listen, ask questions.

The reason I write this is because it helps me make sense. If you are not buying bitcoin, I hope you have a very good reason. I hope you have a reason to believe rates will normalize, a reason to believe the fed will stop supporting markets, a reason to believe worldwide adoption will slow down/go stagnant/reverse course, a reason to believe the fed's balance sheet will get paid down, a reason to believe debt to gdp won't keep climbing. 

I hope you have a reason to believe that it will stop at 1 S&amp;P 500 company. I hope you have a reason to believe wealth inequality goes from widening to lessening (that the increased taxes really stop this-ha!). I hope you have a reason to believe that more billionaires will not join, and a reason to believe wealth management firms throughout America, including ones in the heartland and very conservative, will stop dipping their toes into GBTC. I hope you have a reason to believe our world is not going to continue to go digital, and a reason to believe that governments in the first world will outlaw it even though the trend is strongly showing adoption/regulation/acceptance. 

I hope you have a reason to believe that most new cell phones in the next 3-5 years will NOT come with digital wallets, and a reason to believe that the large banks will not offer bitcoin services to their customers even as they see coinbase lighting up bank statements. I hope you have a reason to believe the world will go back to the way it was, though history shows this never happens. 

The reason most will miss this is pride. People think they are smarter than they are and better than they are. As I reflect back on housing-DROP YOUR PRIDE AND LISTEN.",1630351206,68,1

A Hardware wallet will always be the safest method of accessing your funds. It’s a device that stores your 24 word seed offline on a chip. The private key won’t be exposed even if your computer is compromised. Note that no Bitcoins are ever stored on the device itself but on the Blockchain.

The most trusted hardware wallets by the community are: [BitBox02](https://shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox02/), [Coldcard](https://coldcardwallet.com), [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com) &amp; [Trezor](https://trezor.io)

Every device has their upsides and downsides, do a comparison yourself to find out which device fits you the best. Make sure to only order from the official website and no third party source. Also request the deletion of your customer data, Ledger was victim to a data breach that revealed personal information.

**SEED BACKUP**

You should always back up your 24 words that are the keys to your Bitcoin address. The most common methods are either a plain sheet of paper or a metal plate. I would recommend a metal plate since they are resistant to water, fire and earthquakes.

[Here](https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/) is a good overview of metal backups, rated and stress tested.

Only store your keys offline. Never ever type them in any device other than your hardware wallet. There is numerous malware out there that targets this information.

**USE COMMON SENSE**

• If it’s too good to be true, it’s too good to be true.

• Never share your Bitcoin balance anywhere, you’ll be targeted by scammers, hackers and other individuals.

• Don’t hand out your keys to anyone. Not to official exchange support, friends, invesment bankers etc. (With the key your Bitcoin can be stolen from anywhere in the world.)

• Most Bitcoin are lost because they lose their private keys. Be responsible, don’t make it overly complicated by splitting the seed. Just store it somewhere securely.",1628259189,321,1

oz747e,6u2m4n79,"My Bank, Bnp Paribas Polska, blocked 3 accounts of mine because of “strange activities”.","Hi there e1. Let me tell you a story.

5 days ago I received a call from my accounts executive at the bank, BNP Paribas, to inform me that because of “strange activities” involving 3 accounts of mine, Polish Złotych, USD and EURO, these Accounts had been blocked, without any heads up, until I could go physically to the offices and answered some questions.   
Debit cards, Credit cards, withdrawals, deposits and transactions were all blocked.  
Turns out that “strange activities” meant, for them, that the transactions I’d made during the last 6 months from my accounts to Exchanges, Binance and Kraken, were being “investigated”and as a result those accounts were to remain blocked because (quote) “usually and historically”, whatever dafäck that means, (quote) “…crypto currencies were used to finance terrorist and/or narco activities.”  

I went down to the bank, sat down with the Manager of the branch and he produced a couple of A4 printed sheets of paper with some questions on them. These ranged from: name of my extended family members to where did the money come from? 
What kind of companies do I own?Where are they located?
Which other banks do I operate with?What is Binance? 
What is Kraken? 
Why did I transferred to banks in USA 🇺🇸(SWIFT USD) and Estonia 🇪🇪 (SEPA EUR) so often ? …(every 2 weeks cause I’ve been DCA-ing like a MF 😉) and many more questions. 

Needless to say. I closed the accounts and terminated my business with said bank immediately.   

I’m looking into REVOLUT and other options atm.  

Hope this helps put into perspective the incoming war. The Legacy Mafia Banking System is flailing desperately. We are the battering ram knocking on their weakened ass gates. We are the tip of the spear. We are the first in line.  We ARE the Victors, they just haven’t realized it yet.

Subject: Bitcoin/H.R. 3684

My Senator,

You ought to support Senator Wyden, Toomey, and Lummis’s amendment to the cryptocurrency provision of the infrastructure bill (H.R. 3684). 

This amendment will ensure that the provision does not dramatically expand financial surveillance, harm innovation, or undermine human rights. Policies that impact basic freedom and the future of the Internet should be debated carefully and should never be attached to must-pass bills. 

**How do you even vote on thousands of pages of spending?**

The federal government should not consider legislating technology it does not understand, especially after destroying the value of our dollar. What do you want to be remembered for?

Want to know more? Ask Senator Lummis' aide. He will be happy to break it down and make it easily understandable.""

oz4sk3,TimmoJarer,The Moment of Truth Has Arrived,"I’ve been listening to History of Rome podcast(by Mike Duncan) recently and I can’t help but feel like what’s happening with the new infrastructure bill proposed in the US is eerily similar to Hamilcar Barca(Hannibal Barca’s father) crossing the strait of Gibraltar and subjugating the Iberian tribes. This was made lot easier by the disunity among them.

I’ve read several posts and watched the video posted by Charles Hoskinson, However, I can’t help but feel like we should be indifferent despite the usual historical precedence for indifference in these kind of scenarios. Now why do I say this? The answer is simple, the whole point of Bitcoin was to create an alternative financial system for those who had no choice but see their hard work devalued year after year, for those who simply grew tired of fattening ungrateful middlemen that instead of working for us, kept leaching off us. 

The answer was decentralisation and fairness. No pre-mining, no kowtowing to VCs or governments for that matter, as demonstrated by Satoshi himself. Now what did all these alt coin founders do? The exact opposite, they pre-mined, they setup foundations, ICOs, chose POS and hardforked with impunity. And now they come running back to us when they feel so vulnerable. Our answer should be firm, YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW.

As for those who of you who are worried about Bitcoin itself getting regulated out of existence, the whole point of it was to be resilient in the face of this exact scenario and others like it. If Bitcoin and Lightning by extension cannot survive this, we should let them die and search for something better.",1628249524,11,1
oz4rnd,Braiins_mining,Centralized VS decentralized pools. Our perspective as the oldest mining pool operator.,"There’s **growing interest** recently in the idea of decentralized mining pools, **especially with the possibility of miners &amp; pools being considered “brokers” based on the latest US infrastructure bill.** About time we share our perspective on all of this (we run the oldest mining pool Slush Pool).

https://preview.redd.it/sqlx7kzawpf71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eef3787b8ab23a0ce7b0707696148ecba3dc59ca

*First, for those who missed it, here’s a great thread summarizing the relevant parts of the* ***infrastructure bill*** [https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1421150344051048451](https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1421150344051048451)

**The core idea of a decentralized mining pool** is that there is no custodian of funds. Miners get paid directly from the coinbase transaction and don’t have to trust a 3rd party with their payouts. This has some pros &amp; cons. 

Pros:

* \+ More difficult to regulate or shut down the pool
* \+ More trustless than current model

Cons:

* \- Doesn’t scale
* \- Doesn’t work for the smallest miners
* \- Less space for non-miner txs (lower fee revenue)
* \- Prevents integration of value adds (e.g. financial services) 

For smaller miners, the issue is UTXO size. Take our pool for example. There are over 11k active users on Slush Pool, for an average of 460 TH/s per user. However, many of these users have &lt; 100 TH/s, so their rewards per block would be &lt; 0.0001 BTC (&amp; going📉 as ndiff 📈)

[Slush Pool system stats.](https://preview.redd.it/ct30o4egzpf71.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b6981560b1b33c99bb6aab920943de1322d0e7a)

Pools help these smaller miners by enabling them to accumulate BTC off-chain (in their pool accounts) so that they can receive larger but less frequent payouts that are more cost effective. Direct **coinbase payouts for garage miners don't scale**. 

There’s also a **limit on the number of participants** in a decentralized pool because the coinbase tx cannot contain thousands of outputs. Each output in the coinbase tx consumes block space that could have been used to earn more revenue by including a user’s tx instead. 

Since miners in a pool accumulate rewards off-chain &amp; receive payouts when their BTC threshold has been met or on a regular schedule (e.g. 1x/day), the total number of on-chain txs paying miners is greatly reduced and thus there is more room for user txs that earn revenue.

Perhaps pools will offer Lightning payouts so that smaller miners can receive their funds more frequently without paying high fees. However, we’re not aware of a way to implement LN in a decentralized way using the coinbase tx. Any LN experts out there that can weigh in? 

Another point for non-miners to understand is that **most pools today are no longer just pools.** For example, many offer financial services to help miners with things like custody and earning interest on their sats. Decentralized pools cannot vertically integrate. 

Other technical issues:

* Larger coinbase tx = heavier block template, leading to less efficient job distribution and higher probability of orphan blocks
* Some ASIC firmwares don’t support larger coinbase sizes

**In summary**, it’s just not feasible to have large decentralized pools. But wouldn’t many smaller pools be way better for decentralization anyway? Well, sure. But this requires miners to accept much higher variance and less frequent payouts than they get today.

There may be creative solutions to address some of these problems (e.g. Braidpool), but there’s little to be done about the drastically poorer UX of small decentralized pools vs. today’s pools. But that doesn’t mean that all hope is lost for more decentralization. 

&gt;Btw UX is not just features and graphical interfaces. It's primarily how much and how often miners get paid.

Once fully implemented, **Stratum V2** will enable miners to continue benefiting from the UX offered by today’s cost-effective &amp; vertically-integrated pools without trusting them to construct blocks.

&gt;Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization by Karim Helmy: [https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/)

**Stratum V2 TL;DR:** As demand for block space increases &amp; transaction fees become increasingly important for miner revenue, we may see a rise in out-of-band payments (users pay miners tx fees off-chain).  This is a risk for miners who rely on on-chain fees for part of their revenue.

Stratum V2 does not change the fact that pools act as temporary custodians. Even in a future scenario with widespread V2 adoption, it would still be healthy to have a wide geographic distribution of pools.

That said, pool infrastructure is already spread out across the world to improve robustness &amp; reduce latency for geographically distributed miners. As long as some countries remain friendly, pools can act like sovereign individuals, relocating to wherever they're welcome.

**Conclusion:** the idea of decentralized mining pools sounds great and can even look great on paper, but in reality there are few miners who will sacrifice UX to cut out pools as temporary custodians of their mining rewards.

Stepping up efforts to minimize the inherent risk of trading  cryptocurrency, major crypto exchange Binance announced restricting  access to derivatives products to Hong Kong users. The official [announcement](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/25a2571392a24367a7d927bd37ab2b86) reads:

However,  Binance’s proactive means to restrict Hong Kong users was not supported  by a date when the restrictions will be imposed. To provide clarity  behind Binance’s latest restrictions, CEO Changpeng Zhao [said](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1423571123967602689) the move is aimed to be a “proactive measure” for establishing “crypto compliance best practices worldwide.”",1628249230,3,1

If a car is used as a getaway vehicle in a crime, should the vehicle manufacturer be held responsible for tracking who was driving the vehicle at the time?  How about the gas station that sold the gas used to power the vehicle during the crime?  What about the neighborhood kid that washed the car last weekend?

If this sounds like complete nonsense, it is. No rational human would think laws like this would make any sense or genuinely protect anybody. They would just be a huge burden on society and stifle all kinds of innovation that would otherwise benefit people’s lives in unimaginable ways.

And yet, that appears to be the road we’re on with this dumpster fire of competing amendments to the Infrastructure Bill around cryptocurrencies. It should be evident by now that this is a complicated and nuanced topic that needs to be debated on it’s own, leading to rational, educated and well thought out legislation that in the future will benefit all American’s, rather than harm them or hold them back while the rest of the world reaps the benefits from new emerging technologies.

All of the ill conceived cryptocurrency amendments must be dropped from the Infrastructure Bill so that the issue of cryptocurrency legislation can receive the proper attention it needs, so that Congress has time to hear from industry experts and educate themselves, and so that the public can properly weigh in on the topic.

Please push to have all cryptocurrency amendments removed from the Infrastructure Bill.  If that is not possible, then at a bare minimum please support the Wyden/Lummis/Toomey amendment.",1628247486,27,1

It took me 3 minutes to contact my local senator and voice my support for the pro-innovation stance of the amendment. Definitely 3 minutes I am not going to regret spending.

The current infrastructure amendment AFFECTS each and everyone of us.

The current amendment categorizes validators of stake pools as ""brokers"" and requires them with comply with impossible-to-implement KYC procedures. VERY VERY VERY INGORANT.

This is not only limited to POS systems of the present but will also affect POW systems in the future if such an amendment is allowed to pass with no opposition. This is absolutely ridiculous.

This is not about taxes. This is about uninformed/malicious law makers trying to regulate the markets in AN EXTREMELY ignorant manner. **They are purely targeting the developers and validators.**

This is a very anti-innovation move with absolutely no upside.

Use this [link](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/actions/stop-the-senate-from-sneaking-through-total-surveillance-of-the-crypto-economy/)

to find the contact details of your local representatives and support the "" Wyden, Toomey, and Lummis stance"" which supports better phrasing of the amendment and recognizes the difference between brokers and developers/validators.

EDIT : In the link given, you can see how you can relay your message in the most pleasant and straight forward manner.

*“Hi, I’m calling to ask that you support Senator Wyden, Toomey, and Lummis’s amendment to the cryptocurrency provision of the infrastructure bill (H.R. 3684) .

A few things that need to be looked at are the capital gains tax laws around how digital currency is classified in Iowa, and the need for laws to make it easier for companies to buy and hold. We also need to look at how income is classified with proof of stake coins, as those become more popular.

So...I remember setting up my Ledger Nano S years ago...but one thing I did NOT do, was test out the recovery phrase.

Well...here recently, i was updating all my wallets...ive got a collection of em...ledger nano s, nano X (still havent used), ColdCard (Still setting up), Trezor ONE (Brand new, gave it away) and Trezor Model T (Holds all of my alts unless they are staked).

But my Nano S, holds ALL of my BTC since 2017.

So I decide today to test my recovery phrase....FOUR YEARS later...and guess what.  
It did NOT WORK!

Scared the living SHIT out of me.

Luckily i had access to all the funds and i still have like 2 other ledgers that i dont use so I used one of them and first checked the recovery phrase TWICE and both times were successful, and then sent all my BTC (Nerve Wracking as FUCK!) to my other Ledger...and was pretty shocked at how cheap it was to move all of that but while waiting I was literally sweating bullets and shitting bricks.

So i want to tell ALL of you, DO YOUR RECOVERY CHECKS ON YOUR HW WALLETS RIGHT AFTER YOU SET IT UP!!

p1s9s5,Crypto_Family,Opinions On The Crypto Family Bridge Punishment Fee," 

The Crypto Family Bridge is a decentralized, open, cheap, and almost instant bridge being developed by the Crypto Family to link blockchains such as Etehreum, BSC, Polygon, VeChain, xDAI, Harmony,etc...

In its first few prototypes the Bridge had a punishment mechanism for false transfers made by nodes, the nodes would have to pay that fee when they vote on that transfer and they get it back once the transfer has enough votes, if that transfer never gets enough votes, that fee is burned.

In later porotypes this was removed for two main reasons :  
1.Lack on consensus across nodes resulting in some nodes voting on transfers while others ignoring them due to differences in accepting fees (main)  
2.The punishment mechanism resulted in higher fees, and removing it helped reduce those fee (backing)

In the recent prototype, consensus has been achieved, which made us wonder, should we bring the punishment module back to punish any attempts of fake transfers or tests in preparation for a 51% attack on the Bridge, or should we leave it out to maintain the lowest fees possible on the Bridge.

Note : The bridge doesn't charge a fee in %, it charges a transaction fee similar to that of a blockchain

Without the punishment module the fees on the Bridge are as following :  
Transfer from any blockchain to Polygon, max fee : 0.001 MATIC \~ 0.001 $  
Transfer from any blockchain to BSC, max fee : 0.005 BNB \~ 1.75 $  
Transfer from any blockchain to ETH, max fee : 0.01 ETH \~ 30$

With the addition of the punishment fees, the transfer fees can increase up to 21%

p1rq2r,Joe_Mamr,What Comes Next for Crypto in the House?,"I wanted to open a discussion so that the crypto community can continue its outreach and public lobbying campaign in a proactive and coordinated fashion.

Given the bipartisan infrastructure bill will pass the Senate today (or already has, depending on your time of reading) while still including overly-broad language for a crypto tax-reporting provision, what comes next for the legislation in the House of Representatives?

[From Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/state-of-crypto-what-just-happened-in-the-us-senate):

&gt;Now, all eyes turn to the House of Representatives. There’s already bipartisan support for amending the bill, but the question is how. Any changes will need to be reconciled with the Senate version, meaning if there’s a substantial difference in the pay-fors, House lawmakers will have to find a way to fill that hole.  

In the spirit of discussion, here are a few questions that come to mind for me:

* Which reps are poised to take a leadership role on the crypto provision?
* What related issues can be leveraged by the crypto community while demonstrating support for a revision?
* What measures do we anticipate could be adopted to fill the gap for funding the overall legislation?
* How should our language used when calling elected officials adjust now that the focus has shifted to the House?",1628610010,12,1

With Bitcoin being a finite resource it will be impossible to treat an entire coin as anything less than a treasure chest or a gold mine. Satoshis are not only going to help onboard more new retail users, but also serve as the future average transaction value for commodities and services. I think it will only benefit the community and the value of BTC if we start encouraging more visibility and start supporting the usage/nomenclature of Sats.

This makes the Bitcoin price go up more and more over time. The halvings really multiply this effect. 

Meanwhile less and less money is invested in stock markets. Stocks go down. So governments print more money to get the stock market up again. But this just makes people put more of their net worth into Bitcoin.

I am looking into different consensus algorithms, and have come up with one myself. It would be great if people could give me some feedback, and point out any possible flaws in it.

Effectively, we have a PoS system, with no 'coin time' aspect, where the next forger is picked randomly and proportional to the total amount of the currency staked. We also have 100 validators, randomly selected each time proportional to their stake, who validate the forger's block by forging their own block (and checking the transactions, previous hash etc. are the same). If there is any differences between the block from any validator and the forger, we select a new 100 validators and repeat until they all match. Once this happens, the block is forged, the next forger is randomly selected form the 100 validators and the 100 new validators are randomly selected from the staking pool, as before. If the forger and validators can not agree on a block after 3 attempts, if the most common block created by the validators in these 5 attempts is shared by &gt;90% of the validators, it is the new block. If not, then the whole system of stakers is required to create the block, and the most common block is the new block. To prevent 51% attacks, there is a cap on staking, such that each wallet can only stake up to 1% of the total staking pool.

Yet the numbers speak for themselves if we look at the 10-year returns:

* Gold: -2.2%
* S&amp;P 500: +295
* Bitcoin: +390,000%

An illustration is available just here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/InBitcoinWeTrust/comments/p1kc4g/investing\_your\_money\_is\_a\_necessity\_but\_you\_have/](https://www.reddit.com/r/InBitcoinWeTrust/comments/p1kc4g/investing_your_money_is_a_necessity_but_you_have/)

Some will argue that most people who owned Bitcoin ten years ago ended up selling it or losing it. This is true.

However, that doesn't negate the fact that Bitcoin is the best solution to protect your money from the great monetary inflation we are experiencing.

Bitcoin also gives you incredible guarantees. Over twelve years of existence with an uptime of over 99.98%. This is phenomenal when you consider that Bitcoin is only supported by the will of its users to build a better world for the future.

The key with Bitcoin is to understand its revolution to achieve the level of trust that is needed to be patient over the years.

This will prevent you from selling your Bitcoin in the middle of the road like those who did that in 2013 when its price first reached $1,000 for example.

Being a no matter what HODLer is the key to protecting your future regarding money. In 10 to 20 years, you won't regret making this decision that changed your life forever.",1628581194,7,1

For those that never heard of me, my name is Theo Chino and I am a bitcoiner that have been documenting the political corruption that led to the creation of the Bitlicense. 

I was a candidate for New York City Public Advocate. [I sued the State of New York](https://newyork.abolishthebitlicense.org/press.php)  and built the website [https://AbolishTheBitlicense.org](https://AbolishTheBitlicense.org) to keep track of all the criminal bitcoin prosecutions in the United States.

My fight has been like Russian doll or like the movie Inception where each time I think I am done, there is something new underneath.

I went after the NYDFS that invented laws, then went the lawmakers that did not repeal the Bitlicense when they said they did and today I created a website called [RepMyBlock](https://repmyblock.nyc) to replace 17,000 small politicians that are supposed to keep tap on the Lawmaker that are supposed to oversee the Bitlicense. The position is called County Committee and it's unique to New York City.

By replacing the County Committee, it will lead to the replacement of corrupt lawmakers like Ron Kim *(*[*https://www.coindesk.com/the-queens-politician-who-wants-to-give-new-yorkers-their-own-crypto*](https://www.coindesk.com/the-queens-politician-who-wants-to-give-new-yorkers-their-own-crypto)*)* who has lied to us to make himself a name.

To replace Ron Kim, I need to replace the County Committee; and to do that, I need visual help and a student is doing a documentary on the County Committee and need help to fund it.   
Watch the preview, it's me going crazy around New York telling people to run for the position to replace the dead people running. **https://twitter.com/RepMyBlock/status/1424903974709256193?s=20**

Please share the information because this is another documentary that need to make to the Oscars like Abacus, too small to jail: [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/abacus](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/abacus/)

**And if you are a New York City Bitcoiner, you need to run for that position.** *(I have talked about it before.)*

Watch the preview, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5PMTccc1k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5PMTccc1k) and help the student director to make the movie by following this twitter link: [**https://twitter.com/RepMyBlock/status/1424903974709256193?s=20**](https://twitter.com/RepMyBlock/status/1424903974709256193?s=20)

If I can make a dent on those politicians, then everything will start to fall like dominos and we will be able to have the discussion we were supposed to have in 2013.  


Regards,

**Theo Chino**

Alts: I sum all alts the same way (***personal not factual***) as a gamble. This is my investment in hopes I can actually turn short term investments into large 'quick flips'.

p2jx6a,Imaginary-Friendship,"Spend bitcoin at stores that accept it, please!","I see a lot of folks that think they should never spend any Bitcoin - they’re going to save it forever. Cool, HODL your stack. But, please realize there is a difference between ""taking profits"" and ""growing the network.""

When buying stuff with Bitcoin, you can either ""spend and replace"" or you can use something like Strike. The latter being better. It seems like so many people in comments here have never heard of Strike or lightning, or they don't know what they do. Granted, some countries don't have access to Strike yet but I see plenty of negative comments coming from folks that could be using it.

For those that don't know about it, let me explain. You can connect your bank account and then deposit your dirty fiat into Strike. Whenever you want to send someone BTC (main chain or lightning) you just click “pay” and scan the QR code. Strike deducts your fiat and then Strike pays with BTC. Let me repeat: *Strike pays with BTC*. You never hold that BTC and so therefore you never have any capital gain issues. In other words, Strike lets you use the BTC network without holding BTC.

So, if Strike is available in your country, please do yourself a favor and figure out how it works before you crap on people's joy when a new store starts accepting bitcoin. If people will spend bitcoin then there's no reason for stores not to accept bitcoin - and there's no reason you can't keep HODLing your stack if you use something like Strike.

Finally, I see some folks that seem to think it's pointless for a store to accept bitcoin. I mean....is it not obvious why a store should? Sure, maybe a store instantly converts BTC to fiat, but (1) having them accept it is advertising for Bitcoin, (2) don't you think stores will start to realize that lightning is cheaper than merchant fees, and (3) who's more likely to HODL bitcoin - a business that accepts it or one that doesn't? And, as a bonus point, please realize there are people that would like to live on bitcoin (get paid in bitcoin) that would love to not convert it to fiat.",1628709187,150,1

This isn't such a bad deal in theory, since those dollars are now backed by the life energy you put into earning them. In principle, this is what gives money it's value - it represents the time it took to earn it. 

Except there's one catch - what about when money is created? How does each dollar get value in the first place? This is where our current system breaks down. In our current ""fiat"" currency system the government prints money for free - it doesn't take any human sacrifice of time or energy to print a dollar. So what are those dollars worth? Nothing. They don't represent any human investment of time, so why should they be worth any amount of human time to earn them? They shouldn't. Which is why when they enter the money supply, they dilute the store of human energy it represents, causing inflation and lowering the value of each dollar. 

But if all dollars were printed at some point, how did they ever start with any value in the first place? They originally had value because they represented an equivalent amount of gold. And since gold takes real human time and energy to mine, each piece of gold holds the human energy it took to bring it into the world. And when the dollar was backed by gold, it held that same value by association. On the day we got off the gold standard the currency supply was still pure - it still fully represented the human time and energy put into mining the gold. But since then, we've printed dollars unbacked by any human investment or sacrifice and we've seen the dollar lose purchasing power as a result.

True money, like gold or bitcoin, is a mechanism of converting human life energy into a material object that can be exchanged for other things. This human investment gives money it's value. 

Bitcoin solves this modern free-money printing problem because it takes real human time, energy, capital and opportunity cost to mint a bitcoin. This gives each coin real-world value, just like gold used to have and just like the dollar used to have when backed by gold. Bitcoin also absorbs value when people buy it with currency because whatever human capital is still represented in currency is then converted into bitcoin.

And since the supply of bitcoins is capped at 21 million, the supply cannot be diluted at all - meaning all the human energy taken to mine them is preserved. Combined with distributed blockchain security and cryptographic protection, bitcoin holds this value - the storage of the work taken to produce it - over time.

p5cfpx,Nasty_slutX,Why bitcion is the best cryptocurrency to buy this August,"1. Returns are unprecedented and unrivaled:
Bitcoin has risen from a fraction of a penny to a five-figure asset class since its debut in 2009. This equates to millions of percentage points in returns. As a result, an increasing number of people are interested in learning more about Bitcoin. Bitcoin has beaten nearly every financial marketplace in recent years. The S&amp;P 500 Index, for example, has risen from 2,090 to 3,629 points, or a 73 percent increase. Sure, investors will profit handsomely from this. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has risen from USD 387 to USD 62,400 in the same 5-year period. In actual terms, that’s a 16,000 percent gain in five years. As a result, if you had put USD 500 into Bitcoin back then, it would today be worth almost USD 80,620.
2. Returns that are not capped:
Bitcoin is digital money, which means that it may be used to pay for products and services. It’s also known as a store of value, similar to gold, which we’ll discuss momentarily. Overall, Bitcoin’s long-term potential is practically infinite because it is a borderless phenomenon.

 3. Store of Value:
Bitcoin is an excellent store of value. After all, with just 21 million coins available, its supply is limited. In the year 2140, it is predicted to reach this level. There will be no more Bitcoin created after that. This assures that, in principle, the value of Bitcoin will continue to grow eternally, similar to gold.",1629105067,2,1

**You Have No Clue About Technology""**

**The surprising** **wealth-building secret** **of a**  
**globe-trotting vagabond**

**D**ear Investor,

I’m writing this letter to dispel a popular myth: Many investors believe it’s already too late to make a lot of money with Bitcoin.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

Here's why:

**The incredible story of how I missed the boat on Bitcoin,**  
**still got rich, and how you can do the same...**

The year is 2009.

I am sitting in my office in Asunción, Paraguay.

📷

My office in Paraguay where I made a life-changing discovery

An intriguing document has just crossed my desk.

It was talking about a new kind of digital money called “Bitcoin”. As I read it, I immediately realized what a potential breakthrough this new technology could be.

But of course I was skeptical. Unsure if it would really work in practice.

I decided to buy a few bitcoins just in case it was for real and would go on to become successful.

**After all, one bitcoin was** **worth just a few cents...**

So I went online to see where I could buy some.

**But there was a problem.**

There was no marketplace to buy or sell bitcoin. Bitcoin was too new. Such exchanges simply didn’t exist yet.

I knew there was a process for “mining” bitcoin.

But I didn’t want to spend days setting up an extra computer. And then install the software, figure out how it actually worked and keep watching over my mining computer.

It was too much of a hassle just to get my hands on some bitcoin that were worth almost nothing at the time.

So I decided to keep an eye on Bitcoin and monitor its progress.

Fast forward to February 2011.

I had gotten busy with other projects and suddenly remembered to check on Bitcoin.

**I was shocked to see that the price was** **over $1.**

**I had missed the boat**

Bitcoin had sykrocketed up well **over 1,000%**.

I instantly regretted that I didn’t take it more seriously right away and didn’t go through the effort to acquire some coins when I first heard about the technology.

**Then I had an epiphany.**

The new Bitcoin technology was keeping its promise. Unless it got hacked or someone would find a fatal vulnerability in its software code it would probably continue to do well.

So I took the plunge and bought a small amount of bitcoin at around $2-3.

Bitcoin kept rising higher and by March 2013 I decided to take some first profits and sold 180 bitcoin at $37.

It seemed like a prudent move at the time.

After all, the price of bitcoin was up over 1,000% from where I bought it and had risen a crazy amount from its early days in 2009/2010.

I was also still worried that the Bitcoin network might get hacked.

So I pocketed a few thousand dollars only to watch Bitcoin shoot up to $181.

Meanwhile, the average person hearing about Bitcoin thought they had missed the boat too!

They looked at Bitcoin and saw a strange new form of money that went from mere pennies to well over a hundred dollars.

Clearly the big money had already been made. It’s too late to get in now... or so they thought.

That same year Bitcoin continued its relentless rise breaking $1,000.

In those early days I always thought of a thousand dollars per bitcoin as a magic round number and probably a good time to take some more profits of the table.

That’s why I sold another 148 bitcoin from my stash for close to one thousand dollars each.

And that was...

**My first six figure crypto payday**

And once again, the average person thought they had already missed the boat because bitcoin came from nothing and was now valued at over $1,000.

This spectacular rise to over one thousand dollars turned out to be too much too fast.

Bitcoin crashed over 80% all the way back down to $200.

Proof! For the average person... Bitcoin was done.

**Dead.**

A scam.

But nothing could be further from the truth.

**Markets move in cycles.** Nothing goes up or down in a straight line.

And this new asset class cryptocurrencies - is still tiny. And its volatility is still much higher than volatility for a mature asset class like bonds, stocks or commodities.

When the pendulum reached its extreme the bitcoin market once again changed direction.

In January 2017 Bitcoin was back at $1,000. (Keep in mind that was only 4 years ago.)

Once again the average person thought they had missed the boat.

We all know what came next.

**Bitcoin shot up to $20,000.**

Bitcoin was all over the mainstream media and millions of people learned about this new form of money for the very first time.

And as you can probably guess, the average person who had just heard about Bitcoin thought they had already missed the boat.

**Do you see a pattern here?**

The bitcoin story is far from over...

In fact, it is only just beginning.

And right now, Bitcoin is starting its next bull run.

How high will we go this time?

Your guess is as good as mine.

But I think **$200,000** to **$500,000** is a reasonable target for this cycle.

Especially because there are many investment funds, banks, high net worth individuals and professional money managers with deep pockets about to get in.

This all but guarantees that this bull market will be one for the record books.

**This is your chance!**

**You too can** **make hundreds of thousands even millions of dollars** **with Bitcoin if you don’t miss the boat.**

If you are new to Bitcoin the time to get in is now.

Bitcoin is a new, better form of money.

Cryptocurrencies come with proven advantages. And you need to know what they are - because you could make a fortune just by discovering what other wealthy crypto investors like me figured out a few years ago.

I’m going to tell you what those advantages are in just a moment.

All fiat currencies worldwide are valued at around $107 trillion.

This number is so big it’s hard to grasp.

That’s $107,000,000,000,000.

Compare that to Bitcoin’s current value of just over $1 trillion.

**For Bitcoin to reach only** **5%** **the size of outdated fiat currencies its price has rise to** **$286,527.**

**And for Bitcoin to replace a mere** **10%** **of fiat currencies its price has to rise to** **over half a million dollars.**

Of course, that doesn’t happen overnight.

Bitcoin’s rise from a few pennies to $60,000 took over 8 years.

At first, I was sure I had missed the boat with Bitcoin. I got in when I was sure it must already be too late.

But, I still made so much money... I was able to retire in my 30’s and travel the world carefree with my wife for 5 full years.",1629104312,1,1
p5c9eq,wintermute-89,Protocol for crossing borders with hardware wallets.,"I've seeing few posts here about some dark sports to hide your hardware wallets during cross border flights, etc...

That got me thinking if there are safer and less painful ways of keeping your seed phrase, just for fun.  
I'm software engineer, and I use this method to store some less sensitive info for easy access even if I loose all my devices.   
I'm using apple machines and services for this example, feel free to use anything else.  


So curious what you guys think about this mental exercise:

1. On a machine with no internet connection create an encrypted, writable DMG (use a Mac VM / Bootable ubuntu usb if you are extra paranoid )
2. Write your seed in a text file and put it inside the image
3. Create memorable, but strong and long encryption key (password) for your DMG / image. This will be a weak link, so might get creative with it.  
Might use some combination of info on your ticket/etc that will be available to you after travel is done.   
Do not name the file MYCRYPTOKEYS.dmg
4. Send it to your iCloud drive (or other cloud storage if you trust any) and log out. Best to use a ""burner"" cloud account, and not your usual one.
5. Reset your hardware wallets.
6. After you feel being safe again, immediately login to your cloud storage, restore hardware wallets from seed phrases and delete the image. 
7. For extra paranoid: send your crypto to a new address.

Unless you are actively tracked by someone, it will be pretty difficult to obtain both, your cloud service password and image password during the time of border crossing.

Worst thing that can happen: some one can get access to the encrypted DMG. While in theory it is possible to brute force it, it's pretty unrealistic:

They lived through that and the decline of the dollar, all the wars, etc. My oldest uncle was literally the oldest; born 1921 and he checked out early 2019 just before shit started really hitting the fan.

I have more money saved than they ever have, and I can't even afford a down payment on anything. I took out a 5 year loan for a car, and paid it off in 3. I have no credit card debt. I stack BTC and collect gold and silver as a hedge. They did NONE of that shit and had two cars, and even after being foreclosed, could still afford a place to rent after the fact. 

I feel like that's not an option in 2021.

My point is not envy or jealousy; it's proof of the erosion of purchasing power in the last 30 years, which requires experience of being 30+ to now see plain as day. My parents were my age back then (1991). That'll rock your shit; it did mine all day.

Bitcoin (and to a degree, gold and silver) is literally THE fucking ticket up and out of whatever class you're stuck in income wise.

They had the market and retirement and higher purchasing power back then, but now we have a huge opportunity to do the same with BTC to a moderate degree.

I trust the power and wisdom of the elders to fuel my spirit going forward. Weak minds will never last. Stack, hodl, love unconditionally.

If this resonates with anyone for any stupid reason, PM me. We need more like minds at this time!",1629093176,4,1

The dollar *was* effectively an IOU for an amount of gold. The reason we used a dollar was because gold is heavy, a target for physical theft, difficult to split up, and challeging to transport for larger transactions. Therefore it was easier to give someone a slip to transfer the ownership of that gold for transactions, ie the dollar. Then Nixon came and made the dollar monopoly fiat money.

Bitcoin IS the game changer of money because you dont need the dollar anymore. It solves every single problem that the gold standard had. It can be divided into satoshi, physical theft (bank robbery, mugging, government garnish, etc) cannot be done and security is completely up to you, logistically it can be transported almost instantly anywhere (even interplanetary) in any quanitity and is weightless.

Bitcoin is the future of not only gold, but money itself. These arent tulips, and bear no resemblance.

For fees, it gives me the option between slow (3 sats/byte), medium (4 sats/byte), fast (5 sats/byte) and finally a custom option.

I don’t need to send this bitcoin urgently and I would like to minimize my fees. What’s the best way to do this?

p5rn4w,StatementPristine381,Bitcoin gaming is the future?," 

You know that bitcoin is proof of work right? What if the XP you earn in games is instead coins/tokens that would make it ""proof of play"", players could create new blocks as they play. Crypto gaming has the potential to make ready player one a reality.

Crypto gaming is the future my friends, it doesn't matter if you don't see it yet, teams are working on it right now like Project Quantum - QBIT : a Destiny 2 like First person shooter Looting game, where the guns and equipments you find are NFTs and the economy of the game runs on QBIT token. There will be trade station where you buy/sell/exchange what you loot in the game.

It is a win-win-win situation between Devs-investor-player.

Devs to get funding to create their project and invest in it. The devs team will get a cut on every transactions made in the game. That's how they make their money.

Investors can buy the token as if they were shares of the game. Way better than investing in a kickstarter because you can withdraw you're investment any time you want if you don't like what direction the team is taking.

Players get rewarded as they play. Human nature makes it that it is very addictive. There is high possibility that players will buy more equipment to earn even faster. Better equipment = more token earned later.

Automatic tournaments:

Tournaments could be programmed in the game and streamed on Twitch.

Instead of USD the winners get tokens or very valuable unique equipment (NFT) in the game.

Tournaments makes the game more popular and very competitive, which in turn attracts more players and investors.

I can also see a future where anyone can earn bitcoin as they play games.

 Would it be possible to earn bitcoin with a layer 2 solution?

p5r88n,brianddk,How to check the checksum of the blk_____.dat files?,"I noticed that during initial block download (IBD) the blocks can arrive out of order and will hence be stored out of order.  I'm maintaining a few nodes and, although it is busy work, I'd like to store the blocks in the blk_____.dat files sequentially.  My main goal of this is to allow me to have a reproducible SHA checksum for the blk_____.dat files.  I do my IBD on fast machines and run the live nodes on slow machines.  Doing this process on the ""slow"" machines would take forever, hence the need for checking files at rest with an off the shelf checksum utility.

My best guess to get this done would be:

1. Perform an IBD on some node.
2. Use the [linearize script](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v0.21.1/contrib/linearize) to create a `bootstrap.dat` file.
3. On a ""fresh"" install of 0.21.1, import bootstrap.dat using the `-loadblock` switch
4. Checksum all the `blk_____.dat` files I wish

Once done, any node created using step \#3 should have matching checksums for ""old"" `blk_____.dat` files.  Obviously `blk_____.dat` files created after the `loadblock` event have the potential to have out of order blocks again.

Is this correct?",1629154518,13,1

Now I have learned that hardware wallet derive a private key from a seed. The probability of guessing this Private Key would be 2²⁵⁶ possibilities.

What happens now with a seed + passphrase. Does this increase the possibility and how high would it be? Or is the seed + passphrase included in the 2²⁵⁶ possibilities?

If a seed + passphrase does not increase the possibility, then what benefit does a seed + passphrase have except that if the seed is compromised and the passphrase is not, you still have time to send the bitcoins to another address?

p5mhu0,xzclusiv3,Bitcoin Rabbit Hole: My personal journey.,"I personally have a hard time explaining my thoughts when it comes to bitcoin. I see so many people posting online about going down the ""bitcoin rabbit hole"" but I’ve never seen anyone try to break it down and explain their journey. There are so many fragmented pieces to the entire bitcoin concept as a whole and it takes time for anyone to start to see the bigger picture. I think I finally found a way to break down the major concepts and how they all come together. Or maybe this will make no sense to others, I’m really not sure. I’m sure this journey is unique for everyone but this is my personal experience with bitcoin and why I think it is much bigger than anything we’ve ever known before. It’s both difficult to understand and especially difficult to explain. Hopefully this will help others understand why I see bitcoin as the biggest and best thing to ever be gifted to humanity.

The curiosity stage:

First you learn about what bitcoin is in general you brush it off because from the outside it does look like it’s too good to be true scenario. Then you keep hearing about it here and there and eventually curiosity takes over. You start to actually google and understand the concept of bitcoin as a currency, payment network and protocol. You also start to learn about decentralization and why it matters. Before long you get hooked and start reading about bitcoin mining and bitcoins issuance policy (halvings). You will start to realize that this asset is very likely to appreciate in the future and you begin to invest in some. You also start to wonder about how fiat works and you go down that rabbit hole... Once you climb out of the fiat rabbit hole you realize that fiat is the scam and bitcoin is the solution. At this point you are hooked, but let me tell you, it’s way bigger than you think.

This is much bigger that I thought stage:

If you're anything like me you will start to think about what all good this system brings to the world. You feel like you just started scratching the surface of all the great things that can be built onto bitcoin. After each time you learn about a new possibility like the ones mentioned above you invest more time learning about bitcoin. You typically start increasing your bitcoin portfolio exposure more and more. You start to realize that bitcoin is bigger than just gaining wealth. You start to realize this could be an entire revolution. A humanitarian gift to the world. You dream about all the benefits bitcoin can bring to you, your family, your friends, people who are well off today, people who are poor, literally everyone. The entire concept of bitcoin ends up becoming hope for a better future. It becomes a bit of an addiction. Bitcoin becomes faith for some people. Bitcoin can be viewed as the light at the end of the tunnel. A new beginning. You start to dig into this revolution concept deeper,

The humanitarian benefits stage:

    -Global access to banking and how much that can actually help humanity as a whole. You realize just how unfair it is to those living in third world countries that don’t have access to traditional banking. Bitcoin fixes this.
    -You start to realize the power of a truly decentralized system. You realize this is a way to balance the power between everyone in a fair way. Like the founding fathers of America tried to do, but this system does not require trust in politicians.  You start to realize people will trust code/math instead and that this new system will win in the long run.
    -You begin to realize the benefits of smart contracts and just how much they can bring to the world. You start to see that programmable money makes sense in a digital world. The legacy system required people and institutions to verify just about any transaction. This is no longer needed. Programmable money will be chosen over the legacy system because code and math is less expensive than paying people/institutions/governments. It is also easier to trust code and math over people/institutions/governments so you realize this system will be adopted.
    -You start to realize that bitcoin is hitting all time highs in other countries whose local fiat currencies are failing from inflation. You realize just how sad it would be to live in a country where you have no access to savings at all. There are people out there that at no fault of their own lose their savings because they have no other options. You start to realize the humanitarian benefits bitcoin offers to these people. It gives them an opportunity to save and preserve their wealth. You realize that bitcoin is a life raft for millions of people due to its natural properties (hard cap on total supply, censorship proof, resistant to confiscation, etc)



Nostalgic for the future stage:

-You realize that this is indeed a revolution. You start to care less about the possible monetary gains and focus on all the humanitarian benefits for the world.
-You dream of a great future, you see that this system can do so much more for people than the fiat standard can. You dream about freedom for all, equality and even a future without wars.
-You realize this system would allow people to unite and innovate in ways not possible before.
-You see how a bitcoin standard would foster an environment where people will unite. 
-You start to see why the fiat standard promotes hate and tension among different races/ethnicities/cultures.
-You see a world where automation takes over all work and the concept of needing a job to support your family diminishes. It's not about being unemployed as a negative, it's about being freed from having to work at all. Everyone gets more time to spend doing what they love.
-You believe people will unite and drive technology forward for the better of humanity.
-You see a world where people who do work do it just for the benefit of humanity. Simply out of charity.
-You believe the worlds smartest will lead the way towards better products that last, are made using automation and very affordable for everyone. With the goal of allowing everyone access to these products for basically free to improve humanity.
-You realize patents will no longer be relevant because people will not need monetary gains from the ideas. This will help us get to the next level of innovation. Being able to create without permission. People will realize if there’s no incentive in holding back ideas from the market that it will be better to let people share and use these ideas freely since the goal is to help everyone/humanity go further.

That has been in general my journey down the bitcoin rabbit hole thus far. There have been many distractions along the way as well. I believe just like the universe is ever-expanding so will humanity, bitcoin and innovation in general. This might just be the beginning of the next era that could change humanity as we know it. At least, that is the way I see it. What do you see?",1629140041,10,1
p5mhcs,Gatoradesoverrated,"For all the people that don’t trust MSM on financial news, why do you trust them on anything else?","We claim that the news is fake when it comes to financial news. They’re bought out by the top who own MSM, and they just push the narratives they want you to see. DYOR, because if you see it on the news it’s too late or a fake pump/dump by market makers. 

This is the philosophy of many investors nowadays. Motley Fool is a scam, etc..

Well, I have a serious question: if that is indeed the case, why do you still trust the MSM on other topics like war, medicine, and politics? Why are SOME topics not “fake”? I mean, if they are bought out, they are fully bought out right? The narrative is coming from a top man, right? Why do you not trust them on financial, but then trust them on politics, vaccines, war, etc?

Serious question. No I’m not anti-vax, and yes I do believe that the media lies about the state of financials globally to enrich those who “own” the MSM, either directly or indirectly.

p6du73,Atlantean120,"I'm a professional psychic who predicted the July Bitcoin run up. Today, I'm predicting the next (and last) one.","\*THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE\*

&amp;#x200B;

You’re skeptical. And you should be. There are a ton of frauds in my line of work. But some of us are genuine. I’ll make it as short and sweet as possible:

In late 2019, after many years of spiritual practice, I had a mystical experience which allowed me to be accurate with tarot cards. I immediately began reading for others, and now, less than two years and 4,000 readings later, fully support myself as a professional psychic dude.

The easiest way to explain it, is by comparing a tarot deck to a book of life, only the pages are cards. Shuffling the cards, mixes up the story, and when I lay them out, it’s like looking at a unique picture book of my client’s life. I can see the recent past, the present, and about 6 months ahead.

I read for people all over the world, and because of this, I realized I am able to see global events. For instance, back in February I started to see people getting out and being more social (the Hermit card, reversed) around May and June. Using logic, this told me that things with covid were going to start getting better around that time. I posted about this publicly on my instagram in February.

Then, in April, I started to see certain clients getting money around July (the Nine of Pentacles, reversed). So much so, that I made note of it on my phone with voice memos, and started asking these clients if they had any investments. Some had stocks, some had real estate, but the one thing they all had in common? Bitcoin. So in June, I again made a public post, sharing this information.

As July went by, I started to worry. Maybe I was wrong? But sure enough, as you all know, things took a turn for the better around week 3. And here we are, back in the bull run, feeling good.

But what happens next? Aside from some alt coins, the market seems to be pretty much going sideways. If my past predictions serve me, then I don’t think this is the end.

Recently, I began seeing the pattern again, of certain clients feeling fortunate. The time frame? Between September and October, especially October. I know at least two of them have Bitcoin. So, can I say for sure that this is the next big run up? No. But from what happened in July, I certainly believe it could be. And based on a dream months back, I believe Bitcoin could get to at least $95,000, if not higher. Once that occurs, I believe it will mark the end of this bull run, and I’ll be taking profits.

For those of you who are still skeptical, I welcome you to check my IG: sleepwlkrr

I recommend starting at the February post. It’s the picture of me holding my cards. From there, you will see various testimonials and audio recordings, to provide evidence of my accuracy. I’ve also been streaming here on r/pan from time to time. You’re welcome to check those out, and read the feedback from clients in the chat.

And of course, feel free to ask me anything here, and I’ll try to respond. But maybe….just maybe…you should remember this post.

See you in October :)",1629238341,10,1

I am all for HODLing in the long term and dollar cost averaging but having been in this market for more than a year now and having seen upside and downswings (also having accumulated some crypto ;) ), I think changing your cryptos to stablecoin and vice versa and parking your stablecoins into high yield savings accounts has given me the best returns so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have experimented with the following platforms, below are the pros and cons. Usually these platforms give out gains on crypto + on their native tokens. I am just putting out how much gains do they give flat out on crypto (also called in-kind rewards) and not on their native tokens

p68fnt,birdman332,We Need To Talk About ESG,"It's no secret that the environmental impact FUD has been full force for most of 2021. This has sprung the idea of sustainably mined BTC, and it is severely flawed.  There are censorship issues with this idea, but I'd like to focus on the environmental impact understanding.

I think the general public outside of the crypto world doesn't understand how mining a PoW coin such as BTC works. Every miner in the world is competing to solve for the nonce that brings the block hash under the target value.

It is NOT true that ONLY the miner that won the block spent energy to mine that block. EVERY miner in the world used different energy sources to compete for that block, it just so happened that the one miner got it first.

In other words, ALL of the energy miners use around the world is spent each block to produce that block. It is not limited to the total enegery or energy type used just by the miner who wins the block.

Thus, if there are 20% of miners that use coal power, EVERY BTC is mined using 20% coal power. This makes any EGS guidelines or requirements strictly virtue signaling unless ALL mining worldwide uses sustainable energy.

I'm definitely not saying this should be the case, but I just want to make sure people understand this. People like Kevin O'Leary don't seem to grasp it.",1629221760,8,1
p68dxl,Joezerdavid20,"6 questions to understand the largest of cryptocurrencies, how it works and why it is dangerous","When Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced in a February tweet that he had bought $ 1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and planned to accept it as a form of payment, the price of the cryptocurrency skyrocketed.

&amp;#x200B;

And when Musk himself said in a tweet on Wednesday that he will not accept bitcoins from those who want to buy his cars, his price plummeted to 15%.

&amp;#x200B;

If a single tweet can make its price rise or fall suddenly, it is surely a volatile asset that its detractors liken to a grand ponzi scheme and see a bubble on the verge of bursting.

&amp;#x200B;

But bitcoin has historically only scaled, according to its proponents, in four-year cycles. The last of these cycles peaked in December 2017, when it reached $ 19,600. A year later it bottomed out at $ 3,000.

&amp;#x200B;

This 2021 is the fourth year of the next cycle and that explains, according to its followers, the spectacular rise that, not without strong surprises, has made it the most profitable investment: it reached US $ 64,800 in April.

1. What is

Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency, that is, a digital currency that can function as a medium of exchange and that its promoters use as a store of value.

&amp;#x200B;

It does not exist physically, nor is it controlled by any country. It is virtual money whose price is constantly changing, as occurs with other currencies such as the dollar or the euro.

&amp;#x200B;

The big difference is that the price of cryptocurrencies is much more volatile and, since there is no body that controls them, it goes up and down in relation to how the market moves.

It can be used to buy products or as an investment instrument, although it is not available in all countries.

Like all cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is used to make quick payments and avoid transaction fees.

2. How it works

Each bitcoin contains a code that is stored in a ""digital wallet"" or digital wallet, on a cell phone or on a computer, with ""private keys"".

&amp;#x200B;

People can send or receive bitcoins (or parts of a bitcoin) from other individuals or companies.

&amp;#x200B;

In general, cryptocurrencies are based on a decentralized network of computers that has nodes spread all over the world with copies of all the transactions that have been carried out.

This network is called a ""blockchain"" or chain of blocks. These blocks or nodes are linked and secured using cryptography.

When you make a transaction, its data is recorded in a block, and it is automatically replicated in the rest.

Bitcoin and each of the digital currencies work with their own algorithm, which allows managing the number of new units that are issued each year.

&amp;#x200B;

3. How to get a bitcoin

There are three great ways:

\- You can buy a bitcoin (or a portion of the currency) using money. Many people download applications on their phones that allow them to buy bitcoin using the funds in their bank account.

\- You can sell things and allow people to pay you with bitcoins.

\- Or you can create them through a process known as bitcoin mining. Those who engage in these activities are called miners.

The miners work with very powerful computers that operate through an automatic reward system that rewards people who confirm the transactions of the users that make up the network.

&amp;#x200B;

4. What is the origin

In early 2009, an anonymous programmer or group of programmers under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published an article referring to bitcoin as a new decentralized transaction system.

&amp;#x200B;

After developing the necessary technology to make bitcoin transactions possible, in 2011 the cryptocurrency code and the domains of the web pages were distributed among several members of the new community created around the digital currency.

&amp;#x200B;

However, there is little information about the events that allowed the development of the currency and what is available does not come from reliable sources.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is recognized as the first digital currency on the market and the one with the highest price in the market.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Why is there a boom

&amp;#x200B;

The growing interest of large investors and individuals in buying bitcoin has accelerated in the last couple of years.

&amp;#x200B;

Before, cryptocurrencies were considered platforms used exclusively by organizations linked to international crime to carry out their illegal transactions anonymously.

&amp;#x200B;

Governments, central banks, economists and a good part of investors have opposed a network that is not under the control and supervision of any kind of authority.

&amp;#x200B;

However, as large companies have opened their doors to it, as well as venture capital funds are investing in the currency, the rest of the investors and the common people have begun to lose distrust.

&amp;#x200B;

And with the development of applications that allow buying and selling bitcoin in a couple of minutes from the cell phone, the adoption of the cryptocurrency has intensified.

&amp;#x200B;

So far in 2021, the price of bitcoin has followed an upward curve, despite permanent warnings from authorities who assure that the currency is a bubble that will burst at any moment.

&amp;#x200B;

6. What is the risk

The main risk is that it is a financial bubble that ends up ruining all those who deposited their ""real money"" in a virtual currency that is not backed by any institution.

&amp;#x200B;

In the same way that no one ""owns bitcoin"", neither is anyone responsible.

&amp;#x200B;

That is why the presidents of the central banks of the great powers constantly tell people not to invest their funds in cryptocurrencies because they will end up ""losing all their money"".

&amp;#x200B;

Its detractors say that it has no intrinsic value, but those who defend it say that its value is determined by a social consensus, as is the case with paper bills.

&amp;#x200B;

One of its staunchest critics is the renowned economist Nouriel Roubini, who refers to bitcoin as ""shitcoin"" (a kind of shit coin).

&amp;#x200B;

There are also reports of scammers who prefer to carry out their operations using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies because the payments are irreversible.

&amp;#x200B;

And if the company that stores bitcoin closes its operations or suffers a cyber attack, the money will most likely disappear like smoke.

&amp;#x200B;

There are no guarantees. Therefore, experts say, whoever invests in bitcoin must be willing to lose their money in case things go wrong.",1629221522,1,1

China was once the main hub for mining, with over half of the world’s mining taking place in the country, precisely because its electricity is cheap. But earlier this summer, local governments in China began to shut down bitcoin mines as the country works to develop its own, better-controlled digital currency. The bitcoin hashrate – the processing power used to produce bitcoin – halved after the crackdown.

Miners have since been scouring the globe for places where electricity is cheap, and many have settled on Texas as their destination.

Bitcoin is designed as safe money and comparable to gold, as well as a diversifier in an investors portfolio, by that logic should the market crash, why would Bitcoin follow? It’s not over inflated in the same way as the stock market which is propped up by quantitive easing, and it’s fundamentals have become more sound with Bitcoin being adopted by more countries, institutions and individuals as whole. To have the same global cap as gold one Bitcoin would need to be worth USD500k, so currently it’s undervalued based one what it has the potential to become. 

Either or, should a crash come, keep some capital back to just buy more.

To further strengthen its hold, the creators have assured to allocate resources to bring in more developers to BSC. 
In terms of technicality and usage, firstly, the transaction fees of BSC costs a few cents every few seconds. It also has a much shorter block time. If we draw a comparison, Ethereum has a block-time of 30 seconds, while it is just 3 seconds on BSC. This means it is ten times faster and ten times more efficient. Data is updated every 3 seconds, instead of 30, providing more accuracy as it's more frequent. 
Furthermore, BSC has a considerably lower gas price.

ovl9ev,pabloescagains,"A long arduous road, but it's only the beginning","I bought my first bit of Bitcoin back in December which was 250 dollars worth. I was learning about it from watching Youtube videos from Ark Invest, Lyn Alden, and Michael Saylor which lead me to want to invest my money into it. Since then I've read the Bitcoin White Paper, the paper written by Ark Invest and Square: Bitcoin is Key to an Abundant, Clean Energy Future and whatever else I could learn about Bitcoin. After almost 8 months of working and doing overtime at my job and racking up a total of 1890.5 hours, I own a whole Bitcoin and it's stored in my private wallet. I'm pretty happy to say the least and it was tough to work so many hours and days where I had very little sleep and didn't see my family or friends. What pushed me through those days was a future where working for someone else won't be an obligation and I will be able to freely live my life the way I want to do the things I want to do and see the people I want to see. Those days of achieving financial freedom through my investing in an asset I have a strong conviction in is coming. I'll be holding through the crashes and the bull markets. I'll be working on my second Bitcoin and there will be more I will accumulate from then after!

 I want to do more in the Bitcoin community and perhaps get into mining and setting up a node. I don't think it's enough to simply accumulate Bitcoin but also be apart of it's development and security. I hope more of us step up and do what it takes to keep this asset a decentralized monetary system that requires no permission from any government, private institutions, or person. The printing of our money to devalue the time spent on our labor to acquire that money will have to stop. Where our time working no longer becomes a liability but an asset, and that is what Bitcoin means. Our time and labor that was spent in the past appreciates with time. The future is never guaranteed and it would be a mistake to believe anything that is here now will stay that way. Therefore, we must do what we can to preserve the system for not just for me, but for all of us, the future adopters of Bitcoin and the generations after us.

ovkl6t,asapamoney,Lots of fiat to invest.. should I time this?,"
I’m a big believer in Bitcoin and want to invest. My goal is to accumulate 5-10 Bitcoin by the next half-ing cycle.

I naively thought the price could drop even lower than ~30K (into low 20s), so I waited on investing approximately 80K in USD fiat. Now as it seems to be surging, I do not want to miss out especially given the fact that I am only a year out of college. I recognize that in the long term there is no difference between 42K and 35K, but I don’t want to buy at a short-term high regardless. 

Do you think 35K will be tested again and a good time for me to buy 2 whole coins (and then DCA an affordable portion of my weekly salary afterwards), or should I just go ahead and invest everything that I am willing to now because it’s only up from here?

I do not want to buy due to FOMO but I also do not want to miss out on a potentially huge bull-run. 

Thanks.",1627787405,24,1

Up until 2015 I would have agreed, but now there are many new cryptocurrencies which have proven themselves over the years and can now do everything Bitcoin can do plus more with less effort. 

For me, it really boils down to Bitcoin being unable to continue to improve with all the technological advancement and research that has occurred over the last decade. Everyone knows the steam engine vs electric motor analogy, and I believe it's accurate. History has shown that if you cannot innovate and adapt, then someone else will. This happens very fast in emerging technology.

**Security:** I see proof of stake winning against proof of work every time. Would you prefer mercenaries protecting Rome or Romans protecting Rome? Proof of stake is also far more efficient for the amount of power it uses.

**Scalability:** Lightning network is a step in the right direction, however, many other cryptocurrencies are working on layer two technology as a solution to scalability, so how will Bitcoin compete once the scalability playing field is level again?

I know many cryptocurrencies can succeed together as fiat comes to an end, but surely in the digital economy of the future, a more advanced cryptocurrency with more functionality (ie. smart contracts &amp; NFTs, governance, POS) will be the primary currency of the world.

It is for these reasons that I think Bitcoin shouldn't be held for the long term, when cryptocurrency is adopted entirely.

ovjqol,dikgumdur,Another good one with Breedlove (Blockworks interview),"Just a solid talk on all our favourite Bitcoin-related topics like inflation and whatnot. The parts I found most interesting are how people are actually second-order effects from their incentive environment. And he basically predicts Zimbabwe-style hyperinflation by 2040 at the latest if we continue along this path undisturbed, so it's likely to actually be sooner than that. The USD is basically the nicest turd.

ovihg7,TyMySh0e32,Missing Bitcoin,"First of all, apologies if asking for technical help isn't allowed on this sub (I didn't see anything on the sidebar indicating otherwise). r/Electrum wasn't particularly helpful.

I bought Bitcoin for the first time today to use in online transactions. I bought some on Coinbase, and transferred it to Electrum. While using Electrum, I ran into a problem.

I sent \~$26 in BTC from Electrum to a website, and only \~$6 ended up arriving. I contacted the website's support service, and they notified me that they had only received .00014402 bitcoin (currently $6.02). Normally I would suspect the site of foul play, but it's a pretty reputable site. Also, an error I was given in Electrum leads me to believe that it wasn't the website's fault.

While I was inputting into Electrum the amount I to be sent, I got an error that read, ""not enough funds."" This was strange to me, as I had input an amount of about .00061, and my Electrum balance was around .00064. Also, fees seemed to be only about 0.4%, and I even tried lowering the amount to .0006, .0005, .0004, etc. -- no luck. I instead clicked the ""max"" button, and the amount was changed to .0001-something (I don't remember the exact amount, but I assume it was .00014402, because that was what was received by the website).

I decided to send it anyway (probably a poor decision in hindsight), and the transaction details showed that I had sent .00064402 (I checked the blockchain as well, which confirms I sent .00064402). This is the amount I wanted to send in the first place, but only .00014402 ended up going through to the website. It seems as if .0005 BTC just vanished.

My Electrum balance now reads 0., and my balance on said website is now $6.02 (.00014402 BTC). My Coinbase balance also reads 0.

Any help on locating this missing .0005 BTC or helping me understand what happened would be greatly appreciated.",1627778448,14,1

There is heavy resistance between 49%-50.5% zone and dominance need to stay below it to get rally in altcoins. If Bitcoin Dominance break above this resistance zone then the best option is to stay out from alt positions. Dominance need to reject from this level and if it happens we will see a good rally in altcoins. The support zone for Dominance are 48% and 46%. We may see some recovery in altcoins once BTC stable in a range again. Now BTC is too volatile.

But he then goes off the rails and shits on anything NOT bitcoin, like he knows shit about fuck. It's so obvious he's not read anything about the work being done by anyone else to improve crypto and is just salty about having to share the market.

He's like a Nintendo investor telling everyone in the 80s that Nintendo is the shit and it's the ONLY video game company that ever was or ever will be and everyone else is an idiot not worth wasting your time or money on.

And then people with more nuanced opinions try and talk to him like, ""Bruh. Check out PlayStation. And Xbox. They're doing some really good work with...""

And before they can finish that sentence, he cuts them off and proceeds to shit on them.

Fucking idiot. The market and this space is big enough for more innovation. And he's talking other people into missing out on massive opportunities and potential gains.

Also found on LinkedIn as a follow up:

&gt; ""Why frame Bitcoin as a nuclear deterrence mechanism for your thesis?""
&gt; 
&gt; You know how 99% of the computer networks we use today enjoy free, atomic-level precision navigation &amp; timing from a constellation of space-born atomic clocks called GPS? Ever wonder how/why that started? Nuclear deterrence. US needed a way to deliver a credible second strike against Moscow in case USSR shot first (mutually assured destruction). The solution was to hide submarines in the ocean to shoot back if our homeland was destroyed (we still do this). But we had a problem: no way for submarine-launched ballistic missiles, sitting underwater for more than a month, to know where they were in relation to Moscow if we needed to shoot (inertial navigation was only accurate for a few hours). No credible threat of second strike because we were 90% likely to miss the shot. So we finally got the approval to build GPS constellation because of nuclear deterrence. Only *after* did we realize how useful GPS is at other stuff besides nuking Moscow with nuclear-tipped tridents.
&gt; 
&gt; Ever wonder how/why we eventually got to TCP/IP? Nuclear deterrence. We needed a different way for different computer networks to preserve comms, particularly in case of nuclear strike, so we could mutually assure the destruction of USSR. Eventually, DoD literally forced everyone to use TCP/IP. Only *after* did we realize how useful TCP/IP is at other stuff besides preserving nuclear comms.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin is reverse. Commercial figured out its utility first (well done!), now DoD needs to understand how useful/inevitable it is as a nuclear deterrence mechanism because of new doctrine I call mutually assured preservation.
&gt; 
&gt; No need for kinetic warfare when we finally have a perfect 1-for-1 functional surrogate to war where nation states can hash it out (pun intended). Bitcoin is digital violence. It obsoletes messy, analog physical violence and is the ultimate ""peacekeeper"" missile.
&gt; 
&gt; If bitcoin becomes base-layer collateral for all global currencies (which game theory says is in the best interest of all countries to do, even authoritarian ones) and western allies mass adopts it first (which we now have the lead on, thanks China!), we benefit disproportionately AND we get the built-in strategic deterrent benefits of mutually assured preservation.
&gt; 
&gt; A war between two bitcoin-anchored nations is a war without winners. It would be a ""kinetic 51% attack"" that everyone would be incentivized NOT to do. Plus the winner has no ability to steal/co-opt reserve currency, no ability to cheat global btc node network to gain illegitimate claim to chain of custody, and very little to gain if the loser can (for the first time ever) can no-kidding take their wealth to the grave. Schelling point becomes to preserve your opponent, compete your values in the free market &amp; through your bitcoin digital army of miners.

What's your take on Liquid sidechain concerning that?

Seems that Liquid is taking off, recently I saw several posts about Defi built there - with the latest being https://www.itchysats.network/ posting on Twitter yesterday. They do Bitcoin collateralized loans on Liquid. They are not live yet, but look promising.

p2o2rp,SimplyShred,I believe it’s possible that Bitcoin was delivered to us by aliens or travellers to free humanity,"2013 crypto discoverer here. Let’s have some fun and a discussion.

Bitcoin is arguably the greatest creation and invention of human history - or certainly yet to be fully realized by most of humanity.

Bitcoin is the greatest invention of money - completely decentralized and free from crony capitalism and the fiat slavery that has imposed and destructed on humans since imperialist China adopted fiat.

One theory is that certain organizations or governments have been in contact with alien species (and have benefitted with technological advantages - radar, night vision, laser, stealth, chips, etc) starting as early as 1947 in Roswell.

What if in an ironic twist - the same aliens that have helped governments have also secretly dropped or kickstarted bitcoin and the blockchain in 2008? Completing a project that the cyperpunks came close to solving.

Could Satoshi Nakamoto be an alien? Or perhaps was he helped by aliens or a vision?

Society needed to be ready to adapt to hyper bitcoinization, away from the governments watch. Certainly Bitcoin cannot be shut down - unless you shut down the internet. Bitcoin couldn’t have been a technology yet in the 20th century - without cell phones, internet, developers and miners. The infrastructure wasn’t simply there.


To be able to free society from this constrains they have planted a seed to free us. If aliens did indeed become part of secret government society in the 40’s to present, it’s possible they have witnessed how destructive capitalism/elitism has been globally. The ability that governments can manipulate the money supply - print money, start wars, taxation, greed, corruption, inequality - the list goes on.

In order to give balance and peace back to humanity, it can be argued bitcoin was given to us, and shared by us.

It’s a possibility then a time traveller or alien would use an anonymous technology like Bitcoin for humanities prosperity. Governments would seize to have power and influence. They would need bit-coiners vote through the blockchain and voting on projects and funding. It would be a much better democracy and peaceful world. A global monetary base system that is unhackable, immutable, transferable and divisible.

Unlike fiat money that has failed, and reserve currencies roughly every 100 years - Bitcoin is infinite, it’ll be here way past our human lifespans.

A monetary system that would be ideal for space and interplanetary endeavours. Bitcoin is perfect mathematical sequences - we know block rewards, block timings, hash rates, bitcoins mined to date and of course 21m supply. An universal language of 1’s and 0’s through time and space. Property rights that can be stored in your head or in your palm. Rights that governments can’t take away.

Bitcoin is a perfect system and a symbiosis ecosystem - one that cannot be shut down but rather is living, breathing and growing forever.

Why were we born? To witness this revolution. To have a more prosperous, peaceful society. Planting our flag on the monetization on the base layer of bitcoinization. Bitcoin is the best form of property rights the world has ever seen. Bitcoin is freedom for the people by the people. A technology that aliens may have gifted us as the ultimate revolution of our time.",1628721880,30,1

I started using bitcoin in 2012.  I discovered the Silk Road and since then I’ve been involved with crypto.  I started saving around 2019 when I had a lot of extra money from my job not doing anything for me.  Instead of stocks, I started buying bitcoin for the next two years.  

Now, the next part isn’t pretty and I am not proud in anyway of actions.  My work started going into overdrive the past 6 months, I was working 60 hours a week of very strenuous labor.  I started picking up habits I shouldn’t have.  Eventually it got to the point where I woke up in the hospital with a breathing tube and many tubes IVd into my flesh.

Don't expect instant riches, expect to lose money in fact, just want to learn the whole process of mining with hands-on attempt. 

I'm more tech savvy than most, if that matters, hopefully not.

The amount of information out there, and the numerous hardware alternatives people are using, are staggeringly large.  

I just want to learn the simplest shit to start with.  Old school to start.  Assume maybe a pentium box configured as some old LINUX and an internet connection without a static IP address I guess.

Please, guys, any advice on that good first step would be greatly appreciated.  Read one book on it and the info is still too generic.

Is there a place to download freeware, a place to join up that's free or nearly free, monitoring software on the cheap, that kind of stuff?

ovv8lx,ExpandYourMind304,How do you secure your crypto keys? LastPass vs BitWarden vs Standard Notes,"I've found three that I can actually say that even qualifies as an encrypted note taking application. 

One is dedicated specifically for notes and the other two have other use cases besides notes. 

Here we go...

1. Standard Notes - this is a dedicated note taking app that is password protected and encrypted

2. BitWarden - this is my personal favorite, even though it's more of a Password Manager, there is an option to store notes. It uses AES 256 bit encryption. 

3. LastPass - this is my second favorite app to use to take notes that are secured and encrypted. I use this as a backup to BitWarden. It also uses AES 256 encryption. 

When I was a noob I would store sensitive information such as private crypto keys in Google Keep Notes, which is probably the worst thing to do. 

Dedicated note taking apps very rarely have encryption, let alone even a password protection feature, so it's basically a free-for-all. 

Past 5 years I've gotten smarter...

I'm curious what this sub uses to secure their notes?

Anyone use LastPass, BitWarden or Standard Notes? If so, which one would you feel more secure in to protect information and sensitive notes like crypto keys and banking login passwords.",1627835247,14,1

It seems to me that for this to happen, the VAST majority of Bitcoin users will never interact with the base chain directly and their interactions will be limited to Lightning and other scaling solutions. What will base chain transactions look like at that point? Only million dollar moves with thousand dollar fees? Why would you need to have your BTC on the main chain?

SHA-256 shouldn't be *that* hard to implement at the lowest level, it involves bit shifting, mod 32 rotation, XOR, Choice, Majority, and mod 32 addition for the most part, the hardest part would be breaking the message into blocks first and padding, but the question is what all else would go into an ASIC?  

Seems like you could get the message, break it up into blocks, and pad in software, since that's all pre-processing, then just have tons of homemade SHA-256 circuits ready to chomp through it on different sections of the nonce space in parallel, then if you got at a hash have an interrupt and software takes back over from there.

I understand that many people say Bitcoin is more like digital gold and you don't need to use it as a currency etc, but many others see Bitcoin in some way becoming the main currency of the world. I might be wrong but I think there is a lot of resistance to any fundamental changes to Bitcoin, including ones that would increase speed. So if changes can't be made to the code, is there a way for Bitcoin to interact with another blockchain to somehow allow more transactions to occur per second?

Set up a $99.50 lightning transaction on Muun, copied the address, pasted it in Strike, hit send and instantly got a notification from Muun I’d received 0.0024xxx BTC. 

The transaction on both sides fees totaled 31 cents.

Then, I sent the last 19 cents, by setting up an 18 cent transaction in Muun, so the total fee for a 19 cent transaction was 1 penny.

ovt1eh,_kr_saurabh,Don’t Listen to the Experts Saying Bitcoin Price Can Drop to $15K or Reach $100K. Do This Instead.,"The price of Bitcoin is currently facing what is called a dead cat bounce and will soon fall to $20K and then $15K. This is not my opinion, but it is what Bitcoin Bears have been saying ever since the price of Bitcoin rebounded to around $40K.

Others will tell you that the price of Bitcoin can only go up from here and that it will reach $100,000 in the next few months.

I have to admit that I am in this second category of people. I even wrote an article recently listing **10 major reasons why the price of Bitcoin will reach $100K in the coming months**.

### No one can give you any guarantees on the price of Bitcoin

As I explained in my article, I have no guarantees to give you. I can't give you any, and neither can anyone else. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar. The truth is that this is just my personal opinion as I explain to you every time.

It's the same for every person you read or watch videos for.

No one can tell you what the price of Bitcoin will do in the short term. We all try to give you our view based on our personal view which is by definition biased. **It is more or less biased depending on the person**. Those who tell you that they only share an opinion are less biased than others.

However, everyone is likely to be biased by their interests.

### Your interests are not necessarily the same as those who make these predictions

People who want to accumulate Bitcoin at a lower price will tell you that we are experiencing a dead cat bounce. Perhaps they are hoping to create some sort of self-fulfilling prophecy that will serve their interests.

In any case, you should not blindly listen to people who give you predictions for the price of Bitcoin. Instead, you should use everything you read or hear to form your own opinion on the matter.

When I share with you an article about why the price of Bitcoin will rise to $100K in the coming months, you should simply read my arguments and add them to your overall thinking.

Take each other's arguments, and then make up your mind. Do your technical analysis. It's not that hard to master these types of tools if you want to. In short, make the effort on your side so that you don't depend on anyone else exclusively.

### Use each other's arguments to inform your thought process

Great experts or gurus who are always right do not exist in life.

You are the only master of your destiny, because at the end of the day, never forget that it is your money that is at stake. If you blindly follow an expert and you get rekt, you will only have yourself to blame. You are the one who chose to blindly follow this expert.

Blindly following without checking yourself goes against what Bitcoin teaches you:

 ***""Don't Trust, Verify"".***  

 Taking care of your money the best way possible is to verify everything before you decide. Then you can make the best decisions for your future regarding money.

### Learning to make your own decisions will make all the difference to your Bitcoin journey

You will probably make mistakes, but we all make them at one time or another. The key is to use those mistakes to learn from them so that you can do better in the future. As you move forward, you'll quickly be able to forge your destiny in the Bitcoin world.

Better yet, you'll be able to step back when you read articles announcing a Bitcoin price of $10K or $250K. Your knowledge and logical reasoning will allow you to position yourself to act in your own best interests.

I thought this reminder was necessary as I see more and more people making price predictions and some telling me in comments that I have no proof that Bitcoin will reach $100K.

As you understand, I have no proof of that, and I am only sharing my opinion on the subject with you. So this is a feeling that should only be used as food for your thoughts on Bitcoin.

It is up to you to decide because you are the only one in charge of Bitcoin, whose main goal remains the same: **to give you the power over your money and your life**.",1627827895,9,1

Please don't use this garbage BitPay I'm very salty about it, how this private corperation can control many merchant's payment systems and have these shameful ID policies. (It's NOT law in the EU to require ID for customers, it's BitPay bulls%*t)

No restrictions yet, but the email states that there will be temp restrictions next month.","I received this vague email last week, like many other users. The email comes from [info@cb.email.coinbase.com](mailto:info@cb.email.coinbase.com) . The email states I can use my account for the next month, but after that, it will be temporarily restricted from bringing in funds or trading. This is very vague because:

1. No reason or explanation is given for this future temporarily restriction. I have been using coinbase for years without problems and my account is fully verified.
2. It doesn't state whether this temporarily restriction will apply to trading on Coinbase Pro as well.
3. It doesn't state the length of the temporarily restriction.
4. Why will my account be restricted one month from now and not immediately? This doesn't make sense.
5. All the above indicate that this may be a phishing attempt and that this is just the first ""prepping"" email as part of a social engineering attempt.

[This is last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/oqrt6s/we_are_reviewing_your_account/) where someone mentioned that this may be a phishing email/attempt.

/u/coinbasesupport can you please look into this and expedite the case if possible? I am not worried about the account review, I am worried about this being a phishing attempt, but especially worried about the upcoming unclear temporarily trading restrictions.

Pretty new to Bitcoin, ive invested some savings into it and plan on hodling for a few years or so. Im not super savvy on it yet so i was just wondering if anyone could help explain 1 or 2 things

Im basically trying to decide where to store my coins long term, currently they are on a Swissborg account but i was considering moving them to a Bitcoin Core wallet. I dont hear many people on here talk about Bitcoin Core, is it a decent place to store coins? more secure than Swissborg?

The other thing im not sure about is the Yield Wallet on Swissborg, Ive tried to read about what it is but it all goes over my head. I understand its a potential way to earn interest on your coins but i dont understand how... Does the Yield wallet make it worth leaving your coins in a Swissborg account? Or are there better options for storing your coin?

**Source: woodbull charts**

The Bitcoin Hash Ribbon (the ribbon consists of simple moving averages of Bitcoin network difficulty so the rate of change of difficulty can be easily seen) tracks the expansion and loss of hash rate on the network. Miners which were banned from China are slowly restarting their operations as they find new land to set up, and with it the recovery of Bitcoin hashrate (Bitcoin hashrate is the computing power contributed by specialized machines to solving Bitcoin’s mathematical problems for rewards of newly minted BTC , and by doing so, secures the blockchain) .

Ribbon recovery events spell the end of miners' sell-off (which is what they do when they are driven out of business). Typically a recovery of the ribbon opens the way for a multi-month period of bullish price action. This indicator did a very good job of locating the price bottom (as highlighted in late 2018).",1627894593,0,1

1-Most people, especially those in the developed world, have zero clue what bitcoin is. This is true among higher income earners. My average friend and colleague makes between $150-$250k as a single income earner with no kids (think high disposable income). Maybe 5% have any serious allocation relative to net worth in bitcoin. 2 out of 60 people I know actually understand to a decent degree what bitcoin is.

2. We are getting close to the older folks participating in bitcoin. It will be very, very small, but they are starting to join. This is especially true for very wealthy people-they don't talk about it, but I know several that own a few hundred grand worth of bitcoin. 

3. The people I refuse to listen to our those with income wealth, not investment wealth. Be wary of your suburban dad with the leased e class amg who works as a sales manager pulling in $200k a year. These people know how to play the office game and are income rich. They have zero clue what is going on. They THINK they do.

4. I think maximalists will be disappointed in how this roles out. Digital wallets will be common place in the next 3-5 years. Many who own  bitcoin will have very little clue how it works.

5. The same people who were calling housing market tops in 2017 just bought homes. Not making fun of them, observing -I still think housing goes higher. These same people have little to no bitcoin, or sold it and think it's going to 10k. It's just like housing-people say things that they want to happen.",1627882477,63,1

ow7x5d,Hygieian,A question to BTC veterans..,"Hi. I have not been in this space for long.. and I've had a question brewing ever since I got in. I've watched people on bothsides of the fence talking about what's bullish and bearish for the last few months. Of course most people used charts over their opinions and they also referred to metrics on the BTC blockchain - as in the graphs showing how BTC is transferring to strong hands and how ""whales"" with the most BTC are accumulating as people with less are either undecided or dumping. 

I just wanted to ask..  have ""whales"" always been the market makers? Do they always accumulate without mistake? Do these whales always see the future and sell on bearish signals and accumulate on bullish signs?",1627880724,12,1

ow78es,crypto_pro585,Why does Bitcoin community seem to underestimate the possibility that the USA could have founded Bitcoin?,"Since we don't know who created Bitcoin, it is fair to reason about it.

A lot of Bitcoin community's theories and ideas are based on the failures of the current financial system, government control etc. Some people believe it is the future currency (used for daily purchases), some believe it will be the world's reserve currency and so on. All of this implies that ""someone"" (i.e., Satoshi Nakomoto) or perhaps a group of people decided that current government systems are inadequate, inappropriate, unfair or whatever you want to call it, and they need to do something about it. Well, we all think that Satoshi is a regular person who was just coding for fun in their garage or basement while eating ramen and came up with this great invention - this a great storyline for Netflix by the way.

You already hear anti-Bitcoiners talk about how Russia or China invented it and how we should run away from it because it will go down to $0 and so forth. You already hear pro-Bitcoiners talk about its utopian genesis whereby Satoshi blessed \~7.5 billion people with financial salvation and freedom and soon, the whole universe will realize that and Bitcoin will go to $1,000,000.

Nonetheless, you rarely hear either of the sides mention USA, which is logically though counterintuitively, a more likely candidate of such invention. Fun fact: anti-Bitcoiners don't realize that there is no need to use countries such as Russia or China to ""scare"" Bitcoin community; it is enough to mention ""USA"" and it might have the same effect since Bitcoin has more to do with the USA government, dollar, FED, etc., not Putin or yen or ruble.

Here are some of my reasons (not really in order of importance):

* First of all, let's start with the basics. If US DoD (Department of Defense) could implement Internet, why couldn't they implement 1 decentralized application on this Internet? If USA can fly to the moon, who said they can’t use cryptographic functions to create a simple app, relatively speaking? CIA could well have founded it. Military could do it as well. In other words, there is a bunch of organizations in the USA with sufficient resources and skills to implement such thing.
* If we all understand that dollar and inflation etc. are not sustainable, what makes us think that the government didn’t understand it way before any of us did? Oh and by the way, how about the timing of Bitcoin creation? 2009? We all know what happened in 2008, right? Sounds like a pretty good time to experiment with new financial tools to replace the old ones that have failed us so many times before and will fail again. So while we are all becoming smart and great economists in 2021, these folks might have envisioned all the fiat problems way before - 2008 facilitated their understanding. There is this talk about all kinds of monetary/fiscal policies involving paper money or gold or silver... Then (in 2008 or even before) they realized that this world is now or will be soon fully running on technology, why not utilize it? ""Why do we have to keep going to all these old age economic theories? Let's use technology to create a new financial world. We are the world's largest economy and everyone depends on our economy. We should not lose this power so we have to think 21,000,000 steps ahead of everyone.""
* Well, now, if USA government is so great and smart, why would not they come out and get all the flowers in the world for coming up with such a great idea? Because we, people, would think that “Oh, it is another thing created by these same people who ruined our financial system. Bitcoin is trash, we don’t believe them. Screw them. We won’t fall for another trick.” So they go like “Hold on, why not create an intriguing mystery of this and make people believe that it is going to solve all these financial problems and government has nothing to do with it?! Great idea, John, let’s do it. Oh sorry, Satoshi, I meant Satoshi, can’t get used to it yet...my bad”.
* Then, one would also say, ""Governments love control. They actually need control. Why would they create a monster that they cannot fully control like they can control dollar for example?"" Well, every initiative has its pros and cons. They can’t fully control Internet either yet its advantages outweigh its disadvantages such as lack of total control. ""Sure, BTC will be abused by rogue governments and criminals, but so what? We are going to benefit from it much more significantly. Criminals will still be criminals whether BTC exists or not.""

To conclude, I just think it has to be a possibility. We can’t just blindly say, “No, it is impossible.”. By the way, their goal would be to have people absolutely disbelieving that they had a hand in it. So, has their project been successful then? Only time will show.

TL;DR:

* USA has a bunch of resources and skills to create something like Blockchain/Bitcoin: Military, DoD, CIA etc.
* Previous economic disasters and technological progress might have inspired the USA government to think differently and look for new financial solutions. Also, fear of losing the power of being the world's #1 country might have even pushed them to do this.
* Realizing that people are losing their trust in government's ability to care for their financial well-being, they decided to remain anonymous and create a mystery around it. I.e, ""Satoshi Nakomoto"" created Bitcoin.
* If government loves control, why would they create something that they can't control? Just like Internet and land borders secured by military - they can't fully control them either. But if invention's advantages outweigh its disadvantages, then...

ozpag7,_kr_saurabh,Bitcoin: The Last Cycle,"We all have our own ideas on what the future of bitcoin holds and how high the price will eventually go.  For people who are bullish about bitcoin, usually, their price predictions can become quite high, with the sky being the actual limit.  There are a lot of factors that come into play when determining this question.  You need to take into account the strength of the dollar and other currencies, the world situation, inflation if bitcoin has been accepted as legal tender of other countries, if it has surpassed gold as a store of value, and finally if it has been the world reserve currency.  The list goes on and on, but I'm sure you are getting the point.  Each day that bitcoin survives, it becomes stronger, and those price predictions become much more of a reality.  I am about as bullish as a person can be for the future of bitcoin.  So if you are anything like me; it becomes more a question of not the price going up, but will these four-year cycles continue?  The four-year cycle is centred around the bitcoin halving, which cuts the bitcoin mining reward in half approximately every four years.

Throughout bitcoin's short history, the price has been directly correlated to this event.  About seven months after each halving, the price of bitcoin begins to shoot up rapidly, thus beginning the bull run.  This usually lasts for around 18 months will extreme volatility towards the end of this time and a large price blow off the top.  And then prices drop drastically.  Sometimes more than 80%.  And this last for another 18 months, until the next bitcoin halving takes place.  This cycle has been repeated and repeated throughout bitcoin's history.  But will this always be the case?

My answer for this is no, and it is coming to an end very soon.  In fact, I would even claim that I believe this will be the last bitcoin cycle. Now don't take this the wrong way, I do believe there will still be drastic price drops in the future, similar to what we have been experiencing the last few months.  But just like this time period, they will continue to get bought up quickly and the ""bear markets"" will become much shorter.  The price will of course be affected by the bitcoin halving, as the new BTC being minted will be cut in half, thus causing a supply shock.  But the cycle will not only go up after the halving takes place.

Let me explain this thought more.

 At this point, a large majority of people in the world know very little about bitcoin, let alone invest in it.  Then, even fewer people know what bitcoin halving is, and how important it is.  All they know is that the price of bitcoin is either going up or going down.  This won't always be the case.  But before we get to that point, corporations, hedge funds, and countries are now getting into the bitcoin game.  These groups definitely know about halving and how finite bitcoin actually is.  They also can see how the value of the US dollar is quickly depreciating and may not be the currency of the future.  These groups are going to game the system.  If you know that the bitcoin halving takes place every four years, and the price goes up drastically because of the supply shock that it causes; why would you then wait to buy until after the halving?  

You wouldn't. 

These organizations will begin buying before the halving in anticipation of that halving taking place.  So while technically the price will be going up as a result of the halving.  It will just now be happening before and after the halving takes place.  Thus, changing the cycles forever.  Unfortunately for the regular people; there will be hardships that occur.  With bitcoin, the everyday person had a real opportunity to buy a once-in-a-lifetime asset, and do it before the big guys.  The sad thing is, and I see this every day when I try to get the people around me or at my job interested in bitcoin or investing.  They just aren't interested.  They don't know what money really is, how they are losing it each year even when they think they are saving it.  And they definitely aren't aware of the direction that the world is heading towards.  These people will become aware of the bitcoin halving down the line, but by then their golden opportunity will be gone.

So now that the four-year cycles will be gone, what will happen to the price of bitcoin, and how will it look?  Like I mentioned above, there will always be drops, but generally, the price will look a lot like the Stock-to-Flow chart from PlanB.  Meaning that it will look like an upwards diagonal line from the left to the right.

A lot has to happen for this to become a reality.  Bitcoin will need to swallow up gold's value, and many other assets. If this dream is to become a reality, we could see bitcoin's price reach $1 million by 2024 and that is just the start of this mania.  If the dollar's value continues to decrease, what does the price of that even mean?  By that time, things will begin to be priced in bitcoin or sats.  

Always remember that the name of the game is to get as much bitcoin as you possibly can.  I don't think people are ready for the tsunami that is heading towards everyone.  It is crazy to think, but bitcoin at $40,000, is still extremely cheap.  

How about you? Do you think this is the last bitcoin 4-year cycle?  Do you have enough bitcoin yet?

 As always, thank you for reading!",1628323398,11,1

ozof4y,Popbob420kush,Can someone explain to me the stock2flow formula?,"According to [this](https://stats.buybitcoinworldwide.com/stock-to-flow/) website is the stock2flow formula

&gt;Model price (USD) = exp(-1,84) * SF ^ 3,36

but

&gt; If we put current Bitcoin stock to flow value (27) into this formula we get value of 10.750 USD. This is the price which is indicated by the model. But, there is one more component that we include in this calculation. It is estimated that during first year of bitcoin (2009) Satoshi Nakamoto (Bitcoin creator) mined around 1 million Bitcoins and did not move them until today. It can be debated if those coins might be lost or Satoshi is just waiting still to sell them but the fact is that they are not moving at all ever since. That is why we make correction in stock to flow model calculation. We simply decrease stock amount for 1 million BTC so stock to flow value would be:

&gt;17.000.000 / 657.000 = 25,8

with this applied the new formula is 

&gt; exp(-1,84) * SF ^ 3,36 = 8.789 USD

More recently there was also a pretty intense shock on electrical grids around 1850 (Carrington Event), although this would be considered mild as compared to the end of the ice age.

I've heard suggestions that the sun is showing signs of increased activity again, and while we would certainly have other things to worry about if this were to occur now, I'm wondering if the bitcoin blockchain would survive something like this?

I like to think I have a pretty good grasp on how the world works. I got many lessons from the school of hard knocks early on in life, never met my dad, mom smoked crack and killed herself in my teens, I joined the army for 6 months out of highschool and quit cause it wasn't for me, then pipelined for a couple years, then used that money to put myself through school to become a paramedic, and had the opportunity to see humanity in it's most raw forms. 


I've always enjoyed reading, and love learning things. It's probably my saving grace, paired with an observational nature towards life. I've learned many lessons, I always do my best to keep my eyes open.



For a long time, the way we have structured civilization for the past few hundred years has blown my mind. People get caught up on the day to day, and don't put much thought into it, but the way we have set things up is truly insane. Our model since the industrial revolution is based around compound infinite growth, year over year, *forever*.  Maybe it will change eventually, but I doubt it will happen in our lifetimes. 


You can have a company that makes a 100 million dollars a year profit, which is good, but next year if it makes 100 million dollars in profit (which is still pretty awesome), the stock will tank.  People talk about bull markets, and bear markets, but it's all bullshit. Compound infinite growth forever, there is no such thing as a ""bear market"", only ""bear speedbumps"". 


When I was a kid, I remember being able to buy 3 subway sandwiches on a sunday with their special for 9.99, now you can buy 1 subway sandwich and a cookie for 9.99 assuming it isn't a premium sub.  That took 17 years.......


And that's the funny thing about inflation, it's also tied to the compound infinite growth forever model. Anyone that remembers high school math, exponents get pretty wild. They are flat with moderate growth for a long period, and radically turn into hockey sticks. Even with a 2% multiple (inflation is usually 2-3%), over 100 times it starts to get insane.  If you take 100$ and compound it with 2% 100 times you get 724$, and if you compound that 100 times you get 5248$, and if you compound that 100 times you get 38,203$, and then you get 275,466$, and then you get 1,995,656$ and then you get 14,457,828.....  It escalates fucking QUICKLY. 


It's ok though, because banks can just keep printing out money. Fun fact, banks produce more fiat through loans than governments do. 


Anyways, I think we are at the start of a hockey stick over the next 20-40 years due to wild nature of exponential growth, and where bitcoin becomes fucking beautiful... Is that there can only ever be 21 million of them. We are at 18.8 million of them currently. 



I don't understand how the economy truly works, I don't understand how governments and social movements truly work, I don't understand how currency truly works. I try my best but it's too fucking confusion, but I 10000000% understand how compound exponential growth works, and  it's what we have 100% structured civilization on since the 1800's.

ozn0gn,stefan_news,Who the $&amp;*@ is Satoshi Nakamoto?! The greatest mystery (IMO) of the 21st century,"What do UFO’s, Sasquatch, the Loch Ness Monster, and bitcoin all have in common? If you said nothing, you’re wrong! All of them are shrouded in mystery, but only one of them has made lots of people overnight millionaires. And it’s not the producers of Finding Bigfoot. No, we’re talking about bitcoin!

There’s nothing truly mysterious about bitcoin itself; you can go buy one on Coinbase right now. Or more realistically you could probably only buy, like, 0.01 bitcoins, since the price has skyrocketed tens of thousands of dollars since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

No, the mystery I’m talking about is the one surrounding bitcoin’s creator. He (or her, or them, nobody really knows) was named Satoshi Nakamoto, and in 2008 he published an obscure white paper called ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"", which outlined blockchain technology and started the whole crazy cryptocurrency ball rolling.

These days, everyone is talking about bitcoin. The price of bitcoin even passed 50,000 dollars recently. “To the moon!” as Elon Musk would say. At its peak earlier in 2021, bitcoin commanded more than a one trillion dollar market capitalization. Not bad for something invented by an anonymous person.

Wait, what do you mean, anonymous person? How can we not know who created bitcoin? I mean, someone invented it, right?

But get this: to this day, nobody knows who (or what) Satoshi Nakamoto is. Turns out, whoever wrote the white paper was probably using a pseudonym. He, she, or they have never revealed their true identity, and nobody has ever proven who Nakamoto actually is. And while I can’t prove anything either, I’m putting my detective hat on and gathering up all the evidence, to try and solve the greatest mystery of the 21st century: who the %$&amp;# is Satoshi Nakamoto?!

Y'all should really think of moving all crypto to a different wallet ASAP

No Chief Exec  just ups and quits withing 3 months after his appointment 
Things are most definitely going on that we won't know about until it's too late 

Brooks, who was acting U.S. Comptroller of the Currency from May 2020 to January 2021, joined Binance U.S. as chief executive officer at the beginning of May. Prior to joining the regulator, Brooks had been Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase Global. During his time as acting Comptroller, Brooks led efforts to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins and digital asset custody.

Binance has long been suspected of running an unlicensed exchange, facilitating no KYC trades, assisting in Tether manipulation schemes etc. Just look at what happened to BitMEX founders, all of them got into legal shit and arrest warrants were issued for them too. 

People with life savings in Binance should tread carefully now. Binance has been great to crypto, but we cant stay in denial about the regulatory enforcement against Binance getting into overdrive mode in the last couple of months. Its just been one bad news after another. Multiple countries have issued warnings against Binance, and there is speculation those are just the early shots before a global crackdown led by US Government. 

Their US CEO quitting is quite telling, by doing so Brooks can escape prosecution if it is brought on Binance, since he was really not an employee for long. The chances of getting another high profile CEO right now seem bleak, as all the attention and regulatory scrutiny seems to be on Binance right now",1628304878,14,1

ozj4ig,Greengo_CL,"Chile: inflation indexed everything, argument for BTC"," Imagine earning your salary in USD but having to pay your rent, mortgage and health insurance in BTC every month, (welcome to Chile).

It’s not very well known outside of Chile but the price of almost everything is linked inflation and increasing every day.

While the official currency is the peso chileno ($ clp), in 1967, the Unidad de Fomento (UF) was created to combat hyperinflation and soon after banks and other private/public institutions started using it for every loan and contract.

The value of the UF is adjusted daily by the central bank based in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Mortgages are in UF and not pesos which means your interest rate is currently UF+ 3.5%. Every month the mortgage payment, aside from the interest rate, also increases by the monthly inflation. The fire/earthquake insurance premium also increases per month. But salaries are not adjusted for inflation which means every month it’s harder and harder for the average family to pay their bills. Basically banks have no inflationary risks in their products. Rent contracts are generally UF linked and everything month you have to recalculate the amount to send in pesos.

On top of the inflationary price increases business increase the price of health insurance every year due to vague “increases in operational costs” with impunity while reporting stellar years to their shareholders. And we have the same issue with the central bank printing their way our of the COVID crisis.

Savings accounts are only giving 0.1% per year and the 12 month inflation increased 4%.

Bitcoin is generally considered deflationary, in that the price should keep increasing due to reduced supply and increased demand so I’m putting as much as I can every month in BTC. As being paid in UF is not possible , some day I’m hoping to get paid in cryptocurrency.

ozic2l,Apart_Distribution13,Bitcoin markets for August and September set by Illuminati,"Hi, I hope you understand because my English is not good.

I wrote last time that the Illuminati singer""s albums number 1 through 10 represent the future of Bitcoin.(but i think etereum)


If anyone is watching my writing, you can ignore it, but please pay attention to my writing for your precious money. 

In Korea, there is a singer who singed schedule of Bitcoin. .

I was convinced in the singer's interview that she had to make this album with The first people she sees.




 I want you to look at my past writing.

There are fewer expected schedules for cryptocurrency from January to October.

 It""s a way to rise for two weeks and fall for two weeks, and the cycle is about two weeks faster. 



For example, if it goes up in May, it will start to signal from April 15-25. 

In fact, as expected, Elon Musk""s words fell from mid-May, and only bad news was released in June and July.

This was also 100 per cent in line with my expectations.

This would have been an easy task for them. 



And now, August,  the singer""s 8th album title, ""the sea of a kid""

  I thought sea is a many blue stick of drop.

But if you look closely at the lyrics.

{ I don't think it's going to get any better now. }

☞ {I don't close my eyes to the darkness anymore!}

It changes from a gloomy song to a hopeful song.

It's also been rising against expectations that it'll fall from July 20th to the present.


I don't seriously believe in this superstition. When I first saw this guess, I remember ignoring it in 10 seconds. But I think this album is too weird to ignore anymore. Is it really going to give you a glimpse of the schedule of Bitcoin (Ethereum rather than Bitcoin) that has already been decided?

The scary thing is, when I wrote that seven weeks ago, I wasn't sure, but I'm finally convinced.




If you look at the lyrics for the ninth time (September), 


{ the highest wave ride on it! }

☞

{I decide when to break with the tsunami}


{ the highest wave ride on it! }8

☞

{I'm the one who decides when to break!}


 and the last lyrics 

{will disappear like bubbles.}


The most probable scenario will be in September (starting August 15-25 to be precise) the highest waves will start. But because of something very big news, will eventually drop like May (in mid-September)


And this will lead to the 10th (October) song, which means goodbye. 

I encourage you to start investing in mid-August and, if you go up high in September, run away without hesitation.


I hope this is wrong. Because if this is consistent, we're playing like dolls on the palm of unknown forces that transcend money.

Controlling Bitcoin means that it has already manipulated other things. Also, singing this album is the most famous singers in Korea, and they have the power to control even the small amount of kpop.


i have also collected various charts and information, all suggesting a vertical rise in September. But always be careful. Like last May, there's going to be a lot of bad news coming out of nowhere that we can't be expected.



8th- https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZOQCQDxeiQ&amp;feature=youtu.be

9th-https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xIYb8VbT4J4


10th- https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MEkB_fpN8k8



Lastly, compare the cloud shape of the picture I uploaded with the bitcoin chart. Even this matches the number and shape of the stairs.

ozib9h,throwaway29801A,Don't be that 40 year old guy who blows millions on dumb stuff,"Many conversations focus on the potential of bitcoin, the future wealth, tech, etc. This is NOT about this. This is about what I think to do and not to do.

When I was 27, I met a guy at my apartment complex in 2011. He had made millions -yes, millions, in the mortgage market. He was making $800,000 a year-during 2007-that's like 1,200,000 today. And from what I understood, he was doing some shady ass stuff. He had the music video lifestyle-had a lambo, a house with an insane backyard, and god knows where he ate and what he did for fun. He had it all.

The key word is HAD. He was in his early 40s. He said all he ended up with was a watch. He lost everything. 

The point I'm trying to get across is this-twitter/instagram/etc is filled with traders making tons of $-the cars, the watches, clothes, boats, etc. 99% of this is for show. Most wealthy people don't do this stuff. Nothing wrong with nice stuff, I'm saying what I know.

Whether you love bitcoin or NOT, I hope you make tons of $. I hope you have a plan.

1. The way to get ahead is to make money like a rich person and live like a poor person for 3 years. The way to get rich is to do this for 5years. The way to get wealthy is to do this for 10 years. I know plenty of people who make $20k a month and are flat broke. 
2. Pick a vice. If you make more money, it's perfectly normal and healthy to reward yourself. Pick one-trips, partying, a cool car, dining out, etc. And know it's a reward. Where people get into trouble is car + clothes + partying.
3. The more you make, the more you will get leeched on. This sounds shit, but it's true. I was a generous person and my generosity got taken advantage of. Do not be an unnecessary target.
4. Create an income stream. I don't care if it's $100 month. Create an income stream.
5. Understand there are 100 people at party. 95 send checks. 5 collect them. You want to be in that 5.
6. If you buy real estate, buy the shittiest house in the nicest neighborhood. Rich people want to live around other rich people. 
7. Don't tell your bosses/coworkers how much btc you have. Your boss will hate you if you are richer than she/he.
8. Stay away from drugs and escorts. I've seen people ruin their lives over this. Just say no.
9. Don't be an asshole. Bad karma.

What it says

This amendment changes the “broker” definition slightly,  reports The Washington Post. (CNBC does not have a copy of the proposed amendment.) However, the changes are not to the extent deemed necessary by many within the crypto space.

Imagine that there was a fake website that promised you 20% returns or whatever on your bitcoin that you deposit with them. 

This fake site would then give you a wallet address for you to send them your bitcoin. But in reality, this address is another wallet that you have full control over the keys and full custody. So you send your bitcoin between these two wallets that you own, but it looks like you are sending your bitcoin to this fake site. Maybe the site could even issue a receipt or something to make it look more real.

Then 6 months later, the fake site announces bankruptcy or says it's closing down and is keeping all the “bitcoin is has accumulated” (in reality, of course it never had anything). At that point, maybe you could move your bitcoin in the second wallet to a tumbler so that it looks like the scammers are pooling together their funds and running off with them.

Then, when the taxman comes around and says where is that bitcoin you bought from exchange ABC, you simply say, with a tear in your eye, “I lost it all in that famous crypto scam [fakesite.com](https://fakesite.com), I have no bitcoin no more.”

(Of course, you would have to secretly be able to communication to the fake webstie the public address of your second wallet so that they can put it in their frontend as the address of  your account on that the fake website).

He had a separate Linux computer that he always messed around on, showing us random stuff he would find on the deep web. A typical kinda nerdy dude in his 20s that obsessively played WOW and drove a Saab, his nickname was Pukey (he puked everytime he smoked anything bigger than a tiny hit off a bowl) just to give you a further idea about his unique character. He would go on rants about how Bitcoin was the future, I remember him telling us that all the bitcoins he has bought has already more than 1000x in value, he was practically begging us in excitement to put even $50 in so we could see what happens. That's when I started to question stuff. Without him really having an explanation of what I could actually do with these ""internet coins"" if I did buy them, besides trust some sketchy 1995 looking websites he would browse on an entirely different computer and never actually bought anything from... I was not sold on the idea. I remember questioning why he was buying these when he couldn't even use them for anything. Nothing changed in his head even after the joking criticism that it was all worth nothing, he kept buying them. Pukey had a lot of fucking Bitcoin, easily $1000's of dollars in what we thought was wasted money. Later the next year I moved away and never really kept in touch with these old roommates besides briefly on Facebook for about a year. Years go by and around 2018 when bitcoin had a price of like 8k my brother was telling me about a crazy story of someone he knew years ago that started mining Bitcoin and how much money they have now. This made me think about my old roommate Pukey and his ""fake internet money"" he went on and on about back in 2011. Naturally crazy numbers started going through my head on how much I could have made and how I should have listened to that crazy bastard that sounded like a stoned lunatic burning his money. I don't know exactly what price Pukey got in at or how long he continued to buy after I moved away, but he didn't stop buying even when he was telling me it had already 1000x in 2011. I went on to try and reach out to him just to congratulate him on his likely success and so he could give me a much overdue I told you so. I tried to find him on his Facebook but it no longer exists, reached out to old mutual friends from years ago that we worked with and have come up with nothing. I've tried contacting him through his old phone number that I still had but it's no longer his number. Pukey if you're still out there and you see this, I wish the best for you, you son of a bitch you were right!!

I see bitcoin as the ultimate bet against “the system”, (whether it be overreaching authoritarian governments, reckless central bankers who are printing endless money and conducting new monetary experiments almost daily with too much hubris to consider how risky it is, inflation, social unrest, etc).  Things are obviously going downhill (record wealth inequality, inflation, inability to handle covid, increasing tension with new crazy superpower China, etc).  However, low information (and even some high information) voters on both sides have decided to attribute all of the above to a particular boogeyman on the other side (Trump, Hillary, etc).  A lot of them still inherently believe in “the system” and just think of the boogeyman went away things would be normal.  This inability to see that the entire system is doomed is what is preventing so many people from dumping their money into bitcoin IMO.  Do you really think someone who gets all their information from CNN would connect the dots and put their money into something like bitcoin?  Over time, it will become apparent to everyone that society’s vast underlying problems cannot be pinned onto boogeymen and people WILL realize that bitcoin is the soundest safe haven investment, but for now this incredible and delusional political divide we have is allowing us to stack sats on the cheap.

ozuqwl,Cryptolution,The insanity of contrarian action in crypto markets.,"I would just like to take a moment to point out how irrational are marketplaces are in the last few months. 

A few months ago one of the biggest events in the last decade happened - a entire country decided to make a cryptocurrency legal tender (El Salvador and Bitcoin). This was literally the first step of the holy Grail - countries positioning themselves to finally add cryptocurrencies to their reserve asset basket.

Now this event is so monumentous that it should have sent the market into a fresh Bullrun skyrocketing in price. Instead it did the opposite. Not only did it not move the price upwards the market went down.

Now we have an opposite situation. The largest economic powerhouse country in the world is setting up legislation to make activities related to cryptocurrencies regulated in a way that makes it impossible for a normal person to contribute to the network. You have yellen and the US Treasury as well as the White House lobbying for the worst amendment that would make activities like staking equivalent to that of a financial broker.

And the market is rallying upwards.

I learned over 5 years ago that often in cryptocurrencies contrarians win. You would think that you could trade on news but you really can't. You never know when the market is going to go in the complete opposite direction in the face of all logic and rationality.

When this legislation gets passed is the market going to continue rallying? Or will people finally wake up and smell the coffee?

I know that this is a global system and that the United States does not represent the rest of the world. But it is a trend setter and the rest of the world is watching. Corrupt authoritarian regimes are looking for any way to stifle dissent and threats to their power structures. Crippling the security of a network that bypasses traditional financial systems is one way to do that. I'm just surprised it's not coming from the usual means - by using the fear of terrorism and child pornography. Instead it's just coming through typical overburdensome regulation.

I think I see where this is going. Promotion of CBDCs and overburdensome regulation of decentralized cryptocurrencies. Governments have learned that if you come out swinging with orwellian like actions you can have a Streisand effect.

I hope they can make the distinction that this is the first time I know of that we're trying a non-trust-based system.*

Satoshi:  
*I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party gets cold feet.*    
*It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points, donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult sites.  Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications for services that could almost be free but not quite.*    
*It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail.  The send dialog is resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like. It's sent directly when it connects.  The recipient doubleclicks on the transaction to see the full message.  If someone famous is getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and give out the IP address on their website.  ""Send X bitcoins to my priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally.""*    
*Subscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their free trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge bitcoins for the trial.*    
***It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.***  *If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

1. Does running a node help me maintain privacy? If so, how?
2. Is running a node expensive?
3. Is running a node tedious? (Will I have to ""nurse"" it?)
4. What happens if I run a node, and the node breaks, gets outdated, confiscated, etc?

Memorizing your 24 words to your Bitcoin wallet is fairly underrated by the community. You should always have a physical offline backup such as a sheet of paper or a metal plate. But being able to access your funds from anywhere in the world without having to rely on physical backups is very important.

It can also save your funds some day if your seed backup is destroyed by unexpected circumstances. Just think about the recent floods in Belgium, Germany and China.

p0iybe,Jessicaraven100,The profitability and wealth of liquidity providers,"My friend is currently doing his PhD in a crypto-related topic and stumbled upon an extremely interesting [research paper](https://research.paradigm.xyz/uniswaps-alchemy), that I want to share with you.  The central question is the following: Is providing liquidity in a DEX more or less profitable than just hodling the currencies?  Now intuitively, I would say, it has to be less profitable. Sure, liquidity providers earn fees which are between 0,05% and 0,3% on Uniswap for example. But there is one disadvantage: A liquidity provider has to engage in trades that follow the market. He has to trade against arbitrageurs, which is always a bad trade.  Imagine the following situation on ETH/DAI which is currently at 3,000$ flat in a hypothetical situation. Let‘s imagine it dips to 2,700$ on other exchanges. There would be a massive arbitrage opportunity to buy on an exchange and sell on Uniswap (or another DEX) until the price reaches an equilibrium. —&gt; 2,700$ on Uniswap.  From a LP perspective: The LP buys ETH at 3,000$ which is currently only valued 2,700$. He loses money on every trade until it reaches 2,700$. Can 0,3% fees really make up for this?  That‘s when I stumbled upon the paper. They came to the following conclusion which is theoritcal, but makes a lot of sense to me:  Liquidity providing is ALWAYS more profitable than holding the assets, as long as there is any kind of fee involved.  And here is why: It‘s true that the LP has to engage in unfortunate trades, but it seems that this has some kind of effect thats similar to anticyclical portfolio rebalancing. If the price of one asset rises, the LP is effectively reducing his position and vice versa. Over a long time horizon and a reasonable amount of volatility, this leads to higher profitability than holding the coins.  This was a question which was unclear to me for a long time, so it‘s quite nice to have a first answer to it. Though, I think the topic has to be explored in more depth.  What do you  think about this?",1628443900,1,1

p0gio5,CowPerson1,The Complete List of Every Reason Why Bitcoin is Amazing,"Bitcoin is incorruptable money. The first. The only. The only one possible. 

Bitcoin is the hardest money ever. It doubles its hardness every 4 years. Buckle up. Never sell. 

Bitcoin is the only asset with no dilution risk. Bitcoin is also the only asset with no counterparty risk. This makes for a pretty amazing combo. This synergy is reflected in Bitcoin's spectacular unbeatable price appreciation. The only investment that beats Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, and those are all doomed. 

Bitcoin is the people's money. Nobody controls Bitcoin. Bitcoin had no premine. I believe Bitcoin is the purest form of money ever. 

Bitcoin is unhackable at the protocol level, now and into the future. Bitcoin is capable of holding infinite value, or stated differently, Bitcoin will someday be the only monetary system anybody on Earth uses. 

The true value is Bitcoin is infinity (the entire wealth of Earth) split 14,000,000 ways. We're still extremely early. 

Nothing can stop Bitcoin. Bitcoin is antifragile. If going from $1000 to $13 didn't stop Bitcoin, then Bitcoin is going to a million and beyond. 

Bitcoin is inevitable. And perfectly balanced.

A valid Bitcoin transaction cannot be stopped. It's literally impossible. This is extremely powerful technology.

p0f3xy,Vollverzinkt,A few questions on the technical side of bitcoin,"This has zero to do with investing and more with the technical side of bitcoin

I have a few questions how bitcoins work and I have read a few sources about it but after googling for a while I still have questions.

First off, what I know:

-&gt; How asymmetrical encryption works (see: RSA, although here the ""public key"" is derived from the ""private key"")

-&gt; How Message Authentication Codes (MAC) works - and therefore digital signatures and hashing functions in general

-&gt; A wallet is ""just"" a private key. We can derive a public key and from that the bitcoin address

-&gt; The blockchain has a header and the data itself. There is two entries in the header: 1. The hash of the previous chain 2. The hash of the data of the block

-&gt; Every transaction has to be signed. That's what we use Message Authentication Codes for:
Let M be the message of the transaction and sk the private key of the user (assume the hash function is already determined by the system). Such a signature would then be generated by using the hash function, with M being the data and sk being the key. 
This means that without private key transactions dont apply

My Questions:

1. What does a transaction look like simplified? Let's say A transfers X Bitcoins to B. 
What is used to identify A and B? The public key (alternatively address)

2. While the blockchain stores like every transaction ever, how does one actually know his balance? 

Is the balance stored somewhere? I mean if it is, I think the 
bitcoin address/public key would be a good idea 

3. Where are the ""bitcoins"" actually stored? I mean bitcoins are awarded to the first person who creates a block but are they really just entries of people transferring ""units of bitcoin""? 

3.1 Like - does bitcoin not actually exist except for ""A is awarded 6.25 BtC for creating a block"" and ""B transfers C n bitcoin""? (I'll just assume a transaction looks like this, see question 1) - and where are those bitcoins kept - if they exist at all?

3.2 So if 3.1 is correct, is bitcoin really just the signed transfers?

4. Is the BtC-Protocol responsible from ""preventing"" you from spending more bitcoin than is tied to the private key you have access to?

5. What if a user ""tried"" to broadcast a transaction that is not signed (like not at all or without the appropriate private key)",1628431099,11,1

p0eysh,TheFutureofMoney,"Why the banksters are right, and wrong, to attack Bitcoin in the Infrastructure Bill","If I am a central bankster, and I have lobbyist buying off and blackmailing Washington, I would take shots at Bitcoin every chance I get, because I'm selfish,  I can't stand competition, or freedom of choice, and I'm afraid of losing my power over the masses.  Bitcoin decentralizes economic power, and the world is starting to figure this is a better way forward, slowly, but surely.

What attacking American miners and developers would do is it would take the technological base out of the US, and the laws that protect them.  The rule of law in the US are far better than most countries, and Bitcoin becoming a true American power source could be the death knell for my totally corrupt, destructive and anti-American system.   

China moves Bitcoin out because they don't want competition for their digital yuan.  The same GLOBAL group that moved them out of China is working to move Bitcoin's power sources out of the US.  This is not a coincidence that China just moved Bitcoin out, so the infrastructure moves to the US, and the banksters are right on top of them almost immediately.  This attack is global, and coordinated.  it is not national.

IMO, the real plan is to push Bitcoin to smaller and weaker nations, who can be more easily controlled by economic sanctions, the military industrial complex, and general government corruption, found in every nation. 

The best counter to this plan would be to not have miners move, en masse, to just one nation, being centralized in China, or the US.  Decentralization is Bitcoin's strength. Use it!  Moving in a group to one location is just not smart. Spread out!  There's a whole world out there of almost 200 nations.  Be the virus of economic freedom the world needs, and spread out, like a virus. We should have figured out by now that we are not good at stopping viruses. Bitcoin is the virus of global economic freedom. 

Maybe set it up so you physically don't have to be in a nation you do not wish to live, but your node/mining rig/operation can be held in a safer foreign land?

p10e71,KingTimKap,A short view into the future: How blockchains will change our lives,"Most people here still don't realize how blockchain will fundamentally change how we live our lives.

We argue whether we are early or late. I believe both are right. In terms of cryptocurrencies, we're not really early, but we're also not late. In terms of blockchain integration into our lives, we are super early. And that's much more exciting than cryptocurrencies.

We haven't even begun to scratch the surface. In 30 years from now, young teenagers won't be able to even comprehend how humans were able to survive without blockchain. Just like the young generation of today can't understand how we survived thousands of years without the internet or mobile phones. Blockchains will not only make our lives easier, but they will also exponentially accelerate the evolution of humanity.

For example, right now, in order to profit from our assets or buy new assets, we need to either have the resources to purchase them and then again having a way to sell them. Moving all the world's assets onto the blockchain will give us possibilities that we've never before had. Small businesses that need extra cash flow can just put shares for sale on the blockchain. You could easily own part of a restaurant or store within minutes without having to go through lengthy negotiations.

If you quickly need some extra cash because you have to pay an emergency medical bill, you could borrow money within minutes because your home's value and ownership are on the blockchain. You can use it as a guarantee and immediately see and accept the interest rates. You could even sell a fraction of your home to someone who wants to invest in it. No need to sell the entire house.

Elections will eventually move to the blockchain, eliminating voter fraud, provide transparency and real-time results for everyone to see. And perhaps most importantly, when we finally become an inter-planetary species, blockchain will be one of our most important tools. There is no way we are taking the paperwork, money-printing machines or coins with us to Mars.

As I said, the possibilities are endless. We haven't even begun to scratch the possibilities of how blockchain can and will change the way we live our daily lives.",1628511816,1,1

The “card trick” you just tried to play on cryptocurrency didn’t slip past the American people.  In the name of improving infrastructure, you tried to slip dozens of non-relevant regulations into the bill in order to further your control and tyranny.  One of which was a weak attempt to kill crypto, largely Bitcoin.

As I type this message, we are pushing toward $46k/Bitcoin and have risen 7% in the last 12 hours after Chuck blocked senate voting on a critical amendment.  You see, you cannot kill Bitcoin.  You may slow down broader crypto industry growth on U.S. soil.  But Bitcoin itself is at a point where it cannot be stopped.  The more you try to block it, the stronger it will get. 

This “problem” that the Federal Reserve and Treasury now have on their hands was created in response to decades of mismanaged fiat currency, corrupt central banking, and Wall Street puppetry.  And now the problem you created is fighting back.

Even if this bill passes in it’s current language, what you will see over the next 1-2 years before it becomes law is millions of people buying MORE Bitcoin, storing their coins privately, and “holding on for dear life”.

p0xop3,Echowonghuiting,How to Get the Best Return in Phantom's Launchpool Mining Campaign?,"Disclaimer: This article is intended solely as a sharing of my earnings, not as financial advice, and is not a recommendation or basis for any investment.

I've been a Hodler since 2013. And apart from collecting more bitcoin and high-quality crypto assets, I also invest in DeFi projects &amp; trade stocks.

I began experimenting with synthetic asset projects a few years ago (mainly Synthetix and Mirror, UMA), sharpened my investment mindset throughout the process to implement strategies to maximize returns or minimize risks.

I recently started mining Phantom's mainnet launch pool after a Conflux AMA and reading the code audit report. (This is one of Conflux's invested projects) After a few days of mining, I want to share with you all some of my earning results and my mining experience. Hope this helps those who are thinking about joining the event.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **What exactly is a ""synthetic asset""?**

As far as I can tell, synthetic assets are a ""cross-market"" investment vehicle. For example, if I had the majority of my assets in digital coins and wanted to invest in Tesla stock, I would have to transfer my assets, open a USD stock account, and wait a few days before trading without a synthetic asset platform. In contrast, the DeFi synthetic asset program allows investors to use cryptocurrencies to invest in other asset classes.

For Phantom, the supported pAsset categories are cryptocurrencies and commodities. Stocks and NFT will also be available on the official website in the near future.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/xl9zk9mmoag71.png?width=2302&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e071ffc8d9781a5a0e9f9892d1759d1a2844f8e3)

By clicking the build button, you can begin creating synthetic assets that can then be traded or used in liquidity mining. Phantoms reward liquidity providers with PHM tokens.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. How to estimate the price of PHM?**

Phantoms reward liquidity providers with PHM tokens. The APY (Annual Percentage Yield)  is the most important consideration for anyone investing in DeFi projects. The APY calculation in this article is based on the estimated PHM price methodology described below.

 

https://preview.redd.it/hygtqpsuoag71.png?width=2230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcf761668448c8a225cfa8c0cc8dda306bb08992

Currently, there is no public price for PHM before IDO. When estimating the price, I used Coinmarketcap data to compare the market cap of other synthetic asset projects.

* Synthetix market cap: $2 billion +
* Mirror market cap: $1 billion +
* Lina: $400 million +

Phantom is in the same league with well-known investors such as Conflux, NGC, and Open DeFi. Using the most conservative estimate of a total market capitalization of $100M, **a PHM calculated value of 0.01 USDT.**

&amp;#x200B;

**3.What is the APY of Launch Pool?**

Phantom previously announced a total reward of 21 million PHM for 6 coin pairs during 30 days of the Launch Pool liquidity mining period, accounting for 0.21% of total circulation.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/z7y4ltohpag71.png?width=1492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=422175d03d040da8ac7d16ccf849950ffe65a94b)

Based on previous experience, I decided to invest the majority of my funds in cUSDT-pETH. The reason for this is that the average user is hesitant to participate, so the earnings share should be higher.

Based on the revenue figures, it appears that my estimate is correct.

&amp;#x200B;

**Highest yield: cUSDT-pETH, followed by cUSDT-pBTC**

&amp;#x200B;

I used 30,000 u of LP to get a total of over 29,000 PHM in 22 hours. The APY at PHM 0.01u is **approximately 389%.**

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/i0a8sb15qag71.png?width=1836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8036e54350215db6adc4c657da0ecf5ac0996028)

The returns on cUSDT-pBTC are slightly lower than those on cUSDT-pETH, with an APY of around 362 %.

The rest of the gold and silver gains are similar with a lower minimum collateral rate, implying that the use of funds will be efficient. It is best for everyone to choose a pair with a large reward pool and fewer total assets according to the current share.

The pAsset ratio can be found at [https://cfx.phm.finance/.](https://cfx.phm.finance/)

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/s1w3qgt7qag71.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a85a0093b78c0718765c197d4256175a2b150516)

**Low risk options: CFX-pCFX and cMOON-pMOON** 

&amp;#x200B;

These two community-reward token pairs have no risk of being liquidated, making them almost free (except for transaction fees) and suitable for users with a low-risk appetite. Because there are fewer people holding cMoon, it is expected to receive a larger share of the reward.

**More advice:**

1. In fact, returns depend on the number of participants. Phantom's home page will display the current pAsset asset distribution; choose a trading pair with a lower asset distribution for a higher yield.
2. Invest early: The above-mentioned APY is the current situation, and it will fall as more liquidity is pledged.
3. To avoid unnecessary retrievals, think before you act. The withdrawal of collateral (withdraw and close) will incur a fee of 1%.
4. Don't use all of your assets to build assets. Reserve some or matching pairs and some for gas. For example, If you have 30,000 cUSDT, you should probably use 20,000 to build pAssets and the remaining 10,000 to create LP token pairs &amp; pay the gas fee.

&amp;#x200B;

**How do I get involved in Launch Pool liquidity mining?**

&amp;#x200B;

I follow the [official Medium step-by-step guide](https://phantomdefi.medium.com/phantom-mainnet-reward-mining-instructions-c7e35a1c98c8), you may find it here [https://phantomdefi.medium.com/phantom-mainnet-reward-mining-instructions-c7e35a1c98c8](https://phantomdefi.medium.com/phantom-mainnet-reward-mining-instructions-c7e35a1c98c8).

Someone in Telegram mentioned that there are two ways to participate in mining: ""create pAsset"" and ""buy pAsset,"" here are my thoughts.

1. Directly build pAsset: Suitable for those with a large amount of money; the absolute return is higher. The direct purchase pAsset on DEX will have a lot of slippages because moonswap is generally liquid.
2. Buy pAsset from moonswap and pair it (be careful not to buy all assets as p-assets as I mentioned above), suitable for small-scale assets investors, the capital utilization rate is higher, but the absolute return may be lower.

&amp;#x200B;

**Advanced Play on Synthetic Assets: Using crypto assets to indirectly invest in other market assets.**

In fact, the creation of pAssets and the mining of liquidity are not the main goals of the synthetic assets project. The greatest value of DeFi synthetic assets is that they make it easier for people to trade traditional financial assets. 

For example, you can invest in London gold and silver by constructing pXAU and pXAG and profit from price fluctuations in gold and silver, and I am currently investigating this strategy. Also, I hope Phantom will soon go live with stock assets.

Wish you all a prosperous mining experience.",1628499558,2,1

p0ws0f,Abhisingh9916,A Few Tips To Guide You With Your First Cryptocurrency Investment..,"A cryptocurrency exchange is a platform that enables you to buy or sell all types of cryptocurrencies. Unlike the stock market, the cryptocurrency market operates 24/7 and is self-regulated. Here are a few tips to start crypto trading:

1) Picking A Crypto Exchange

The first step is to choose a suitable trading platform to open an account. In India, there are a number of platforms such as Coinbase, Binance etc

2) Uploading Documents And KYC

Like any regular bank account, cryptocurrency exchange accounts also require documents such as address proof, identity proof, PAN card etc. This will ensure your account is legitimate and protect you from any fraud. Along with your personal information, you will also have to provide payment options. The specified payment option will be used for all your trading activities related to withdrawals and deposits

3) Trade Orders

Usually, you won't be able to begin trade soon after depositing money and uploading documents. The exchange takes some time to verify your credentials. It notifies users after the process is complete. Since the crypto market is open 24/7, you can trade any time you please. You can either store the cryptocurrency you have bought in a digital wallet or choose to withdraw it as money

4) Begin With Small Investments

As the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, it is wise if you begin with small investments. Do adequate research. Increase your investment once you have familiarised yourself with the market

5) Pick One Crypto

Initially, approach the market with caution and buy the coin you feel most sure about. Stick to your decision and monitor your progress before expanding your portfolio

&gt; 1. First, we’ve been able to have very productive conversations with senators on all sides of this issue, and if we could vote on amendments I think the digital asset community would be pleased with the outcome.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Right now, we need an agreement on allowing amendments, which is being held up because of conflict between senators over the 30-hour rule, which allows the Senate to consider/read/review a bill for up to 30 hours before voting on it.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Some senators want to keep focusing on the infrastructure bill for 30 hours to raise awareness about its price tag. Senator Schumer wants to quickly vote in order to focus on other legislation, and won’t allow amendment votes unless that happens.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. So we’re at an impasse. I understand my colleagues’ positions. But real people are going to be hurt if we do not change the language in this bill. Tomorrow we’ll be back in session and again work to convince our colleagues and Senator Schumer that our amendment deserves a vote.
&gt;

Once you decide to store your wealth in Bitcoin, the decisions don't end there. I've spent the last year debating the merits of the above strategies. Here's my thinking-

When you invest in Bitcoin you are risking \~$10,000 for a chance at \~$500,000. That's an asymmetrical bet to the upside. A great risk to take! We could go more educated or in depth, but this is the basic principle of what makes it a great store of wealth. It's not a 1 to 1 risk, it's 1 to 10 or 1 to 50 depending on how you measure it.

When you put your Bitcoin in an interest bearing account you are risking \~$10,000 for $500. That's an asymmetrical bet to the downside. Not worth it, for the same reason buying and hodling is a great bet. When interest bearing accounts become FDIC insured this math could change, but especially in such a nascent industry it's not a good risk. A 1 to .04 risk is not a good risk.

When you put up $10,000 of your Bitcoin as collateral for a 50% LTV loan, you are risking \~$5,000 to save \~$3,000 (30% taxes) + the \~200% annual appreciation on your Bitcoin you would lose if you sold it. This one is a little harder to calculate but seems like a good risk reward payoff. The worst case isn't too bad, there's a possibility for a high payoff, and the result is relatively low variance. This could be calculated generously as a 1 to 3.8 risk. Solid!

&amp;#x200B;

My Conclusions

\- Buy and hodl Bitcoin is a good risk reward

\- Storing your Bitcoin in interest bearing accounts is not a good risk reward

\- Taking collateralized loans against your Bitcoin instead of selling it is a good risk reward

&amp;#x200B;

BONUS!

Blockfi vs Celsius

In my studies I also spent time trying to decide between the two market leaders in these products. Celsius has better rates, but if you look up his tweet exchanges with Peter McCormack you'll find that the CEO of Celsius seemed to be weirdly lying about being on Peter's podcast. If you're going to store your wealth with someone you have to be able to trust them 100% and even finding one incidence of dishonesty should be a no go when you have other options. People lie for your money all the time. If he's lying about whether a podcast happened or not, how can we trust him about why their custodial relationship ended, how they're rehypothecating your collateral, and so on. 

Haven't yet found a reason to count out Blockfi but that doesn't mean there isn't. The sloppiness over promotion giveaways giving out BTC instead of USDC is a red flag but not nearly as bad as public dishonesty.

Conclusion

Public address is a QR that can be used if I would like someone to send me bitcoin, although a public key can be used if I would like someone to send me bitcoin as well? 

Also, a wallet generates a new public address for each time I receive a payment. Can my public address be used to find my balance on the blockchain?  Can my public key be determined from a public address?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

According to a Bloomberg report, cryptocurrency insurance is poised to become a “big opportunity.” A spokesman from Allianz, one of the world’s biggest insurers, told the news publication that the company was exploring product and coverage options in the space because cryptocurrencies were “becoming more relevant, important and prevalent on the real economy.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't know much about crypto-currency, business, insurance, or anything really but I do know one thing, that this is a once-in-a-lifetime lucrative business venture. I hope to find investors, crypto-experts, and someone with knowledge of business and the insurance agency. I particularly think the best way to go about it is an aggressive marking campaign much like you see with State Farm or Geico (everyone remembers Jake from Statefarm or the Hump-day Camel).

It seems kind of obvious at first but when you realize that the only way to be sure you possess these keys is through ECDSA message signing with P2PKH addresses (legacy addresses) and unfortunately  more and more wallets are not allowing their users to use legacy addresses and most of those who do are removing the signing / verification options.  This to all of us should be a huge red flag letting us know that there's a serious issue afoot. 

I personally believe that it's time that we as a community start educating the masses of this issue and how to create safe P2PKH paper wallet addresses.  Specifically by using  offline computers and rolling dice to ensure true entropy while also adding BIP0038 passwords and storing a few copies in geographically diverse locations.

This is the only way (that I know of) that we can be sure we have our own private keys. Leaving them on exchanges or keeping them on wallets that don't allow you message signing /verification with P2PKH addresses means you can't be sure if you even have the keys or not. Especially when most of these wallets won't let you use your own nodes to send /receive bitcoin.

p4kk0l,BunzillaX,How to help a little old lady to not get scammed.,"Don't post much, and am a new person in crypto/ 4 months or so. I live in a very small Midwest town and we recently got a coincloud machine installed at our gas station. I saw an elderly lady 80s or 90s putting in 100 follar bills in it. I was excited to see an older person that was into crypto so I waited for her to finish and asked her how she got started. She told me she was giving 1k usd a day in btc to an orphanage. I told her that's great, but aroused my suspicions. I asked if she had a wallet to donate to or if she used an exchange or just the coin cloud. She told me she just uses the machine and sends it to a gentleman that's helping her set it up. I again am questioning the legitimacy of this. She has me help her type her phone number into the machine to send more. I ask her If she ever met the guy. She says she has once. I am hopeful its true and watch her send her deposit to another wallet immediately after the transaction. I give her my number and tell her to call me if she needs help again. She calls me the next day and says she wants to send more. I meet her at the store, and the coin cloud says she met her limit and needs kyc stuff to do more. I suggest to her to go to an exchange for this, and offer to help her set it up. She agrees and came to my house. I get her all good and going and she is now waiting on her proof of address clearance from the exchange. I'm curious should I help her actually get onto the exchange or tell her something went wrong in order to help her not get possibly scammed more if this isbthe case. Opinions welcome.

Tldr: saw an 80/90 year old lady buying bitcoin from coin cloud. Was excited and had a conversation of how she got started in crypto. Turns out she may be getting scammed.

I'm trying to get donations in bitcoin (to be anonymous).

I'm trying to get donations in bitcoin using Tallycoin. In it, under ""Recommended Wallet,"" it says:

Samourai Wallet, Breez Wallet, Blockstream Green, Zap Wallet, Wasabi Wallet

I was recommended BlueWallet in the previous post, but it's not in the list. Should I still go with BlueWallet?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I just noticed that to use Tallycoin's Lightning network payments, you have to use opennode.

(It says ""If you don't have a lightning node at home or would like a custodian to fallback on if your node is offline, we have integrated with Opennode."")

But when I tried to signup for Opennode, it required verifying my identity by passport etc.

This got me worried because I want to stay anonymous.

p4j2dp,bitcoin-sam,Lightning Network Explained by Harris Brakmić,"I thought this was a well-explained breakdown of Lightning Network, and why Bitcoin's first layer scalability is not an issue. This is pulled from Harris Brakmić's *Bitcoin and Lightning Network on Raspberry Pi* which teaches you how to run nodes on Pi3, Pi4 and Pi Zero as well as a great pictorial explanation of how Bitcoin protocol works.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the Lightning Network?**

Bitcoin isn’t designed to scale like most other computerized systems. Naturally, we would expect a network to offer solutions to various technological bottlenecks like throughput problems, transaction processing, or messaging. But Bitcoin explicitly follows a different strategy, by constraining the size of valid blocks to 1MB, by automatically adapting the block generation difficulty to the available hash power, and by keeping its message broadcasting protocol redundant.

However, this wasn’t an “early design error”, although there might be people arguing this way. Bitcoin’s unusual design serves a purpose that is more important than computation scalability: Bitcoin is socially scalable.^(1) This means that Bitcoin can be used by an indefinite number of actors without requiring them to resort to trusted third parties when doing business with others. When it comes to communication, people have only a very constrained capacity to do business with people they don’t know personally. While we could easily discuss many contracts directly with our friends, no matter where they are physically, the same business would become too risky to us when done with people we don’t know. To overcome this difficulty, we would have to resort to some trusted party, that would take care of keeping all participants “honest”. The simplest example is buying goods on the web. Most of us would prefer buying them on a commercial platform that would take care of merchants delivering goods and customers paying for them. We wouldn’t want to do the same business directly with anonymous people on the net no matter how nicely designed their web sites might be.

And even if we would buy something from a web site owned by a person, we would still want to do our payments via 3rd-party payment processors. When people do business with unknown entities or other people, they always strive to minimize trust in them by including impartial participants, which are able to enforce correct execution of contracts. However, as most of us know from various media outlets, there is seldom a day without a new security breach or data leak. In far too many cases, the security holes are trusted third parties themselves.^(2) The trust we put in them is very often more dangerous than any potential risks that could arise from failed contracts.

Therefore, to be socially scalable, Bitcoin’s protocol deliberately sacrifices its technological scalability by

\- Consuming vast amounts of energy to incentivize mining^(3)

\- Having a very high and redundant transaction throughput via full broadcasting between all nodes

These two factors make it possible for Bitcoin to achieve automated integrity that our old-style institutions can only get by employing literal armies of lawyers, managers, and other bureaucrats. One can rely on Bitcoin alone when setting up and executing contracts, because there is no way to cheat the whole system. The sheer wastefulness of Bitcoin’s protocol forces its participants to behave in their best interest, which indirectly makes the whole network require only minimal trust to operate successfully. By substituting institutions and professionals with an army of robots (Bitcoin nodes), that control each other, Bitcoin’s social scalability functions on a global level. Actors from different parts of the world can now participate in global business transactions without having to resort to any traditional, trust-demanding institutions, whose powers, and protection, usually end on national or legal borders.

The Lightning Network is the first implementation of a value-transfer layer, that runs on top of Bitcoin’s Blockchain, because it relies on its social scalability and provides additional functionality that Bitcoin could never offer without sacrificing the social scalability itself. This network utilizes the blockchain as its settlement layer, where value transfers get finalized through execution of Smart Contracts, which are based on Bitcoin’s Scripting Language. While Bitcoin’s blockchain is known to make small payments undesirable, the Lightning Network itself is focused on high-volume micropayments. The Lightning Network is also a set of specifications called BOLT^(4) (basis of Lightning Technology), which can be used to develop compatible clients and services by using any programming language and operating system. Currently, there exist three different but compatible implementations: *LND*, *c-lightning*, and *Eclair*. 

Situations where a transaction would incur fees higher than the value being transmitted are impossible in the Lightning Network. And just like we have been used to it in Bitcoin, the Lightning Network itself requires no trusted third parties for its value transfers. Similar to Bitcoin, it uses strong cryptographic algorithms to lock and safely move money between nodes. Instead of being forced to sacrifice qualities we got from Bitcoin, we go a layer higher in the architecture without giving up what we have achieved so far. However, to enjoy faster payments and avoid expensive transaction fees, we have to rethink our node’s role in this new network. Until now, we have been using it as a Full Node that contains all data about past transactions and validates new ones. This node was our sole point of truth. And we didn’t care much about its networking neighborhood as long as we were getting valid data. Otherwise, our node would automatically ban any misbehaving participant. In the end, this is what a decentralized network promises to be.

But in Lightning Network, we have to adapt to a new way of thinking about finding other nodes, opening channels to them, calculating routes for value transfers, and taking care of our funds, which now must be kept directly available at all times, similar to running a “hot wallet”. In Lightning Network our nodes are always online and must have certain amounts of money available for setting up own or routing other transactions. A node in this network is never alone and is either doing something for itself or helping others execute transactions., This is a completely new paradigm, which we have to get used to before jumping into it.

The Lightning Network indeed is freeing us from some of the constraints originating in Bitcoin, but it also brings new ones with it. Therefore, before we begin exploring it, we should see the Lightning Network as the first step toward many useful layers that will be built in future. Similar to the development of various TCP-/IP-based protocols like FTP, SMTP, HTTP, and others, the Lightning Network offers a possible solution to certain questions that arise in value-transmitting networks.

p4ilfd,100_Jose_Maria_001,Will BTC share Gold's fate?,"I hear a lot of people on the interwebs arguing that some people are not technically qualified to hold their own keys, and that custodial services are a much better option for those people. I understand the sentiment. 

But instead of fighting for better education, so that people can learn to become sovereign, instead on working to make the key holding tech more user friendly, it worries me that our first instinct is to simply trust the Coinbases and Greyscale and ETFs of the world. 

We used to have sound money in Gold. And yes, gold had intrinsic problems that contributed to it being replaced by fiat. But it wasn't just because gold was flawed; there was a concerted, decades long process of erosion that culminated in confiscation. By the time it became legal to hold gold again, it became a plaything of the wealthy.

I believe the same can happen to BTC if centralized custodial services start to hold a larger and larger % of the BTC supply. If they can confiscate the keys, they can monopolize and outlaw BTC for individuals. 

We shouldn't just hand BTC over to the central bankers on a silver platter, just because ""some people don't know how to hold their keys"". The whole point of BTC is to BECOME independent from the centralized entities.",1628984036,10,1

It seems he wasn't concerned about Wikileaks using Bitcoin, rather, he was concerned about Bitcoin becoming too popular too fast. I think it's *very* unusual that he was so concerned that he pleaded in such a direct way.  The words ""destroy *us*"" which implicates he feared governments banning bitcoin and/or  feared personally getting arrested. As we all know, he disappeared from the public shortly after posting that.

I guess the question I ask is...why? Did he have something to hide in his private life unrelated to bitcoin and was afraid of being found out?  Or did he really just think it would benefit Bitcoin from a legal perspective if adoption happened super, super slow?",1628980024,90,1

p4hdou,Shwayze23,Bitcoin Timeframe to Next Peak Analysis (This is based off of large assumptions),"I have been looking into at what multiple Bitcoin has been decelerating (taking longer time to reach next peak), and on the HODL Waves chart, it became an obvious pattern.  

Once Measured, **it seems to be between 1.6 - 1.68x (per cycle).**   (Super exciting if it were 1.618, but its slightly off, so what - fractals both speed up and slow down).   

**My 2nd theory, is that we have a 2 peak larger pattern**, that includes a double peak **\[(2013: Peak 1 - 2), and (2017)\],** and my theory is that this repeats.  Just on a larger scale.  

 I noticed that the timeframes are longer, and the patterns seem to be on point.  For instance, on the 2nd picture, I drew a red box around the areas where I thought we may still be.  

I measured this new area, and the old one.  The old area, bump 1 - bump 2 (prior to peak 1 of 2013) was from **Jan 2012, to August 2012 = 8 Months.**   

I decided to measure the distance between our last bump up, and the one we just hit at 64k.  This was from **July 2019 - April 14, 2021.  21 months.**   So I break out calculator.   

We have 2 different halvings we crossed.  

**So lets calculate 8 \* 1.618 = 12.96, and again 12.94 \* 1.618 = 20.94 months.**  

This is VERY accurately calculating the run we just had from our last bump up (last bump after 2017 peak).  

IF I am correct, if we look closely at that bump 2, it has a pattern of flattening out, before 8 months takes it up to peak 1 of 2013.  **21 months from April 2021, is Jan 2023.**  This is what I expect this bull run to hit just for peak1.   It wont peak this december, it will peak next one (december-january ish).

IF I am right...   the **49 days it took from Aug 16 2012 - October 4, 2012 == 49 \* 1.618 \* 1.618 = 128 days**.   Our last peak :  April 14, 2021 + **128 days = August 20, 2021.**

I am obviously skeptical.  BUT that being said.  IF We peak out on Aug 20, 2021, and make a run back down near 30k after that...   I am going to start getting very excited about the possibility. 

And correct me if I am wrong, but the pattern back in 2013, it tops out Oct 4, and then bottoms out again on October 27, 2013.  

If we took **23 days \* 1.618 \* 1.618 = 60.2 days**.   So IF it does top out on **August 20, 2021, the pattern should bottom out 60 days later..  October 19, 2021**.  That will be our lowest point going forward.

-  21 million hard cap


-  decentralized


-  can't be altered


-  The work it accomplishes through blockchain facilitates transactions, and transactions only. It's purely financial as a currency.


-  Scarcity, as more and more people lose bitcoin through ""boating accidents"", and as halvenings continue, bitcoin will become rarer and rarer. As of today, it is impossible for every millionaire in the world to own 1 bitcoin.  To say it is a scarce commodity, is almost underselling the true scarcity of bitcoin at this point and moving into the future. 



Bitcoin cons:  

-  The only work it accomplishes through blockchain is facilitating and recording transactions


-  Can't be updated or changed to meet current, or potential future needs. 




Other crypto Pros:


-  Can be updated and pivot to current and future demands that arise to solve technological problems through blockchain networks.


-  Basically takes the concept of doing ""work"" and incentivizes that work through the release of coins, which gives application developers access to insane levels of computation otherwise unachievable through conventional means. 


-  Can do ""work"" through the blockchain, and support software advancement via a decentralized network. 


-  Can handle applications outside of currency, and harness the power of massive decentralized computer networks to accomplish insane computational workloads. 



Cons of other Cryptos: (maybe you could argue pros? But there is definite risk).


-  They are actively managed


-  They are updated


-  They can be changed, at will, to serve the needs of the companies


-  They literally have ""CEO's""


-  They are a round about way of investing in a crypto company, whereas bitcoin is a pure currency play. 


-  There is nothing stopping someone from diluting the asset, and ""raising capital"".  As long as someone has the ability to change things, they can change the underlying value of things via dilution, which leads to all the problems fiat currency is facing today. Basically, many other coins offer the potential of their creators and managers to slowly fall down the same pitfalls of dilution for increased funding which Satoshi built bitcoin to prevent. 





I definitely see crypto as the future, and thus far my bet is on bitcoin for the sheer fact it can't be fucked with, but I really want to hear other people's takes on the matter, through discussion we all learn, and improve yada yada. 



Other cryptos are alluring, but I keep coming back around to the fact they can be altered to serve the needs of the largest stakeholders, where bitcoin serves one purpose, and one purpose only. It may be inferior in terms of the ""work"" it can accomiplish, and it's efficiency, but it simply, can, not, be, fucked, with....... Ever........  AFAIK there are no other cryptos offering that level of disconnection from it's creators and to the actual platform.

I know there are surely people here that will be thoroughly upset that everyone doesn’t know all these details, so please spare me your vitriol. Here are my questions broken up in parts:

1) AFAIK, Using a hardware wallet like trezor requires I always have the trezor wallet device. What happens if I lose my trezor years down the road, and then can’t buy a new one they bankrupt and no longer make the trezor? How would I use my private keys to access my crypto?

2) Or what if I leave my private keys on a piece of paper and I forget over the years that I used a trezor, and there’s no instructions about it using trezor? How would I access my crypto with just these keys and no further instructions?

3) How do I know that trezor or any wallet doesn’t relay my private keys to some basement full of lambo driving 17 year old Chinese hackers who then use my keys and siphone my crypto over time? How do I know with certainty that my keys re really only with me and absolutely no one else? My trust level with technology is at a historical low at this point. 

4) is there a safer way to generate private keys other than some questionable hardware device like trezor? 

5) Assuming I can actually generate private keys that are truly safe, what’s the best way to deposit money to my private keys without incurring brokerage fees and minimize slippage and spread?",1628962718,6,1

**Here the translation:**

Kidnappers kill Venezuelan for not paying ransom in bitcoin

A Venezuelan businessman identified as Gustavo Torres González, 39, was kidnapped and then murdered for not paying ransom in bitcoin (BTC). The homicide was committed in the Simón Bolívar municipality of Zulia State, located some 650 kilometers west of Caracas in Venezuela.

Torres González, also known as ""Tuto"", was kidnapped by the kidnappers on Tuesday, August 10, when he was on his way to his home in the Taparito sector. The subjects intercepted him while he was driving and then he was taken to an unknown destination. Less than 24 hours later his body was found dead on 64th avenue of Rafael Urdaneta parish, reported the authorities.

Unofficial versions indicate that those involved demanded the payment of 1.5 bitcoin (US$ 66,500) to free the hostage. Subsequently, the kidnappers lowered the amount demanded to 0.5 BTC (US$22,175). The trader's relatives did not have sufficient funds, but managed to raise 0.062 BTC, or about $2,750, according to the CryptoNews price calculator.

The amount collected by the victim's family and friends was not well received by the kidnappers, who did not establish contact again. Hours later Torres Gonzalez's body was found without vital signs and with 6 bullet wounds.

Preliminary information from the investigation suggests that those involved only accepted cryptocurrencies as a form of ransom payment. It is unclear whether the victim had any direct relationship with digital assets through mining, trading or as a means of payment. A review of his LinkedIn profile also shows no evidence that he had a close relationship with Bitcoin.

Local media highlighted that the man was a computer engineer and that he offered wireless Internet access services. This work was carried out through his company TutoNet Inversiones in which he served as president since 2007.

Extortion and ransom payments with bitcoin

As bitcoin gains more adoption and recognition as an asset, means of payment or money, criminals have also become interested in the first cryptocurrency. For years CryptoNews has reported cases of kidnappings and extortion collections in BTC and other cryptocurrencies.

In 2019 an American businessman identified as William Sean Creighton Kopko, 43, was kidnapped and then murdered in Costa Rica. The victim's family paid the ransom in bitcoin, but those involved in the event killed him despite having received the funds.

Another case was reported in March last year when six kidnappers were sentenced to 50 years in prison. The criminals kidnapped a lawyer for 48 hours in the city of Chihuahua, northwest Mexico, and demanded the ransom payment in bitcoin.",1628958552,10,1

A real easy comparison to make would be …dare I say… the Robinhood front-page investment tracking graph. Always thought that was pretty useful however I’m no longer on RH, am spread across a few exchanges/wallets, and need something to make visualization easier.

Is there any explanation as to why that is the case? The blocks do not contain severely more transactions than 2017/2018 blocks did (both were full), but it takes significantly more time now.  


Is that because the longer the blockchain becomes, the slower the validation process will take, the further the progress? Or am I syncing with a lot of nodes that aren't complete themselves yet (cannot really imagine that this is the case)? Or is every single block validated against the whole tail back to the genesis block?

Perhaps it was the title so I have made it less click baity. 

FYI this idea took 7 years of research.

If you have specific concerns about the idea please comment below or email me and I will update this post and the .org web site accordingly.

See the original idea at richardcarr.org

**Introduction**

I believe that we can create a blockchain based application that  generates and maintains a dynamic database which will formalize the  natural serotonin-based competence hierarchy. If I am correct the  application will make it impossible for tyrannical power to sustain  itself. Equally, I believe the application must only contain fully  authenticated users so that trust is an inherent property of the final  solution (not a dog whistle) and therefore maximum responsibility of its  users is maintained.

**Method**

The application will periodically ask participants the following question  and log their answer in the blockchain.

""Who is best suited to help you achieve what you want in life?""Nobody must be a possible answer.

I  believe the final result of this question will be a blockchain   representing a network of various leaders and followers. Some of the  networks will be clustered together and others isolated. The person who   is being nominated to be followed must be able to reject the request.  Newborn babies must be defaulted to their parents as leaders and the   children must be given their private cryptographic key in a secret  fashion at a specified age. We must make the database publicly available   so that everyone in the  world can know where they lie within the   meritocratic network. Every person in the network must be authenticated   and the software for  the application must be both open source and   publicly controlled. Additionally I believe we need to couple this   blockchain to a global  public cryptocurrency and remunerate users   according to an equation  similar to the following.

Remuneration = G/(n+1)T

Where:

G = Periodic inflationary currency creation

T = Total number of users

n = number of followers

A   known flaw in this equation is that it does not include any additional  remuneration for the people maintaining the blockchain (miners).   Leaders must be given the option to share a portion of their  remuneration with their followers.

**Conclusion**

I   believe that the result of the above will be a system where people  with  high competence in a given field are financially remunerated for   their  merit as well as rewarded for the generosity they voluntarily   show to  others. Additionally, the system will provide a universal basic   income  to anyone who chooses ""nobody"" as their answer to the above   question  and who are not chosen by anyone else.

I  hope that my idea, however  imperfect, can help to bridge the political   gap between the libertarian anarchists who insist that a ""no-trust""  solution (bitcoin) is the only answer to limit centralized control and  the people within central authorities who insist that trust is essential   to maintaining public order.

p3ejnc,ApeTogetherStrong143,Bitcoin trend reoccurrence (BULLISH),"So me dear Bitcoin and altcoin brethrens. Here's some knowledge I have of Bitcoin so far. Sharing is caring. Correct me if I'm wrong.

1.) Elon Musk's tweets can move markets in Crypto verse. Bitcoin, and sh1tcoin included. Even though he seems to be trolling a lot of times. Fuk em.

1.) Bitcoin goes up, altcoins goes up too!!! But if altcoins goes up, Bitcoin goes down!? WTF!!!

2.) Bitcoin has fractal chart patterns of Wyckoff, most common in 1min, 4hrs and 1D.

3.) Bitcoin doesn't sound good being put side to side with ETH. Too many salty punks trash talking each other. And whenever ETH goes up, Bitcoin goes down.

4.)The fact that US Congress wants to tax crypto but campaigning that it'll go to zero soon , they unwittingly accept Bitcoin and altcoin are here to stay. 😉

5.) Microstrategy and Greyscale, and other banks/hedge fund jumping in to crypto in $Billions early before even US accepts Crypto as a safe financial asset.

6.)If Bitcoin has to go 100K first we drop to 40K (pullback) and swing up to the moon.

7.) Every after a bull run, there's always a correction usually within a week.(bear trap) 

8.) Miners from Ch1na are migrating to Middle East, means more liquidity, more volume, and less volatility. Means Bitcoin doesn't fluctuate down and more steadily upwards.

9.) Whales have moved wallets out of exchanges after the $28K - 38K bull run. We're at $44-46K and whales haven't moved yet. No sell of signal. 

10.) Bears are short term, bulls are long term. BTC may drop to $40K with weeks but BTC bounce up to +$10K, +$20K within  months. Chose sides and careful not to get rekt.

&gt; The president of Argentina, Alberto Fernández , considered that it is ""possible"" that there is a legal tender cryptocurrency in the country , understanding that this instrument could ""contain inflation.""
&gt; 
&gt; In an interview he gave to a local portal, the President said that the advancement of cryptocurrencies is ""irreversible"" , that it is necessary to give the debate and that Argentina must evaluate how to insert itself into that ecosystem.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ""You have to get used to it, take advantage of the good and regulate it in some way because it can lead to abuse,"" he stressed. In addition, he made a balance on the matter. Thus, while he stressed that ""the advantage is that the inflationary effect would be nullified , "" he said that it is a system that can be unsafe.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The discussion about the operation of cryptocurrencies is worldwide and I must confess that it is a matter of care, in my case, for the unknown. But there is no denying it, perhaps it is a good path."" The president @alferdez with @juleiva in #CajaNegra of @filonewsOK . pic.twitter.com/tRCcnFA3pm
&gt; 
&gt; - Alberto Fernández Prensa (@alferdezprensa) August 12, 2021
&gt; A day before, the president of the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic, Miguel Pesce, had expressed that cryptocurrencies ""are not a financial asset"", and guaranteed that the monetary authority will "" regulate the intersection of Bitcoin with the payment system and the exchange market "".
&gt; 
&gt; He also said that these are instruments ""that end up having values ​​that are not referenced in any asset and lead to confusion for people with a lower level of information.""
&gt; 
&gt; Fernández joined the debate and assured: ""There is a huge discussion about the operation of cryptocurrencies, not only in Argentina, it is a global debate. And I must confess that it is a matter of care. In my case, of care for the unknown and because you don't understand exactly how that fortune materializes. ""
&gt; 
&gt; ""This doubt that I have many in the world have, for that reason the project does not finish expanding in the system"", affirmed the Argentine Head of State.
&gt; 
&gt; For Fernández, ""they say that the advantage of this is that the inflationary effect is largely nullified. It is also true that insecurity is generated because there have been some scams with its use"" and added that they should not refuse since ""maybe it is a good way ""
&gt; 
&gt; The greatest advantage for us would have that sense, to somehow contain the inflationary, because it is a hard currency in some way , ""he added.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, the Argentine President declared himself in favor of the development of the financial system.
&gt; 
&gt; In that sense, he stressed: ""For me, everything that has to do with bankarization seems to me to be correct and that everything that has to do with the State knowing, it seems to me to be correct. The problem is not that the State knows and that the information we have. The problem is how that information is used . ""
&gt;

Most of your friends, family, bosses, coworkers, subordinates, and society in general can't keep their eyes off the pinstripes. They will not make it-they will miss the potential of the biggest revolution in the last hundred years. They will watch netflix, talk to their wife about the minutia, and miss it. Even if they are aware of the problems, they most likely are in the bargaining stage: If only my political party won, everything would be fine.  Housing will crash, it's a bubble they say.

I talk a lot about realizing people you know who are income rich vs investment rich. One of the guys I respect a lot completely missed Tesla, most of Apple, and the tech revolution (as did I). 

My other closet friend has two masters degrees. Almost all the people he knows are highly educated. I am the only person he knows who has made any mention of the debt.

Price is a liar. Focus on trends. Rates will NEVER be normalized. Debt will NEVER be paid off. Budgets will NEVER be balanced. There is a wave of old people hitting the system-this will result in 2 things-a lot  more homeless and also a lot more social programs (spending).

Rich people will literally put gates around their communities. Assets will be horded by the wealthy who rent them out at extremely high rates and with massive collateral coverage. This is the reason I hold onto my single family home in a nice area. One of the top assets will be bitcoin.

If your friends and coworkers don't get it-that's good.

I've been trying to post an idea to this forum which may change the world and took 7 years to develop but the moderators on this sub-reddit don't seem to understand why my idea is relevant to bitcoin so here is another idea which definitely is relevant to bitcoin so that I can try and generate some prestige amongst this community.  

It is my theory about Elon musk and what why he is both holding Bitcion and criticizing it.   
I'm not sure if it is an original idea or not but here goes nothing. 

Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

Step 1: Elon buys bitcoin at low price.   
Step 2: Elon makes public that he has bitcoin and that his cars can now be purchased with bitcoin.   
Step 3: Bitcoin rises to 80k AUD and Elon proves to the world that bitcoin could be worth that if he is on board with the technology.  
Step 4: Elon criticizes Bitcon and the price plummets.  
Step 5: Elon Speaks to leaders in the major bitcoin miners about buying his solar panels.  
Step 6: A major contract is signed between Elon and the major minors.   
Step 7: Make this deal public and say that his cars can now be purchased with bitcoin again.   
Step 8: Bitcoin shoots up again.

I’ve been trying to spread the word of bitcoin to friends and coworkers but they all looked at me as the guy with the tin foil hat. Once I told and showed them what I had done, I was no longer the guy in the tin foil hat. I was beyond that. But something interesting happened. Over time more and more of them became curious on how I would be so stupid yet so daring and risky. So they finally opened up and actually listened to what bitcoin is all about.  

Im kinda high so I don’t even remember where I was going with this post. But I never looked back after putting it all into bitcoin!!",1628878462,266,1

Venezuela's failing economy, Cuba's political instability are driving millions of people in search of alternates and bitcoin seems to be the popular choice. 

El Salvador's president recently announced support for bitcoin by declaring it a legal tender. Colombia, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Peru have all seen an increase in bitcoin usage, and the trend is expected to grow in the near future. 

[According to a recent survey](https://blog.blockonomics.co/bitcoin-usage-in-south-america-is-driven-by-politics-d0fc8d8da455), the biggest driver for increased bitcoin usage is *bad economy*, with 75%  using bitcoin for 25% or more of their daily transactions. 

Latin America has long been plagued by wars, bad governance, corruption, and people are looking for save heavens to not just secure their financial future but also daily needs. This is exactly why bitcoin was created, to empower people and take back control.

With an accelerated adoption, Latin America forms a perfect testing ground for bitcoin as a currency a model that may soon be adopted in the rest of the world.",1628874320,3,1

oxlp6c,throwaway29801A,Why your friends don't own bitcoin and most likely never will,"In my continuing search to understand bitcoin, I a constant question is: why don't most of my friends own it or show interest? The reason I found out is that investing goes in 5 levels, and most don't get to 2, let alone 5.

Level One1: Outside the building. You believe investing is for the rich/is no different than gambling. The vast majority of people do NOT do things because they are unique-they do what their parents, their friends, and their community does. Spare yourself the story of the kid who came from the projects and became a CEO-these are exceptions (and amazing ones that should be celebrated). The bottom line is most do not invest because their surroundings discourage it. 

These people respond to bitcoin with ""tulips"" and ""xyz"" coin but have done little to zero research. Pride accounts for the smart person not at least asking questions (I'm gonna be the bagholder).

Level Two: Housing and Mutual funds. If the building is 100 floors, and 90% are outside the building, this occupies the first 80. Most 401k holders have no idea what they are in. They go off recommendations have super conservative friends who have no idea what they truly own. If you are older, this might be bonds. Listen to the guy with the rolex who is richer than you.

A home buyer is in this category especially if they own 1 property. They understand the basics. They learn about equity.

Level 3: REKT. ""It's time to be a baller"". This is where most investors fall apart or have their first big loss. I've been here. Maybe it's borrowing to invest (or invest in options as was my case), perhaps it's investing in a friend's business only to realize your new business partner is not what you even imagined (what do you mean you are a drug addict?). From 05-07, it was buying 10 houses. Most recently, it was massive leverage in crypto. For most, a combination of shame, shell shock, and loss is too much to bear. If single, this is where most become family men. These losses tend to come mid 30s to 40s-the idea of starting over at 39 is hard enough. Starting over at 45 is crazy.

Level 4: Enlightenment-after suffering through REKT, most do not want to keep going. That being said, this is when knowledge is sought. You learn that diversification is great to protect money, but every story you read has a constant: A new idea, a new technology, and utterly dominant. Returns of 50x +. A technology and or company that alters the world. The key is finding it and making a long term commitment. You hear the story of Amazon going from 1.73 to $90 back to $11....and on to 3200. 

You learn to listen to smart people and not prove points. You make a detailed plan. You do NOT trade on leverage. Once again-you have a written down plan. You try to understand why what happened before happened the way it did. You try not to fall in love with an idea. 

You try and help your friends, but you stay quiet after you make your pitch. You realize most ngmi. It saddens you, but it's the truth...most are trend chasers. And most will lose $ in bitcoin.

Level 5: Investor-you learn about trends and you are generally in early. You bought real estate in 2010 when people were selling their keys for a cup of coffee. You put real money into 5 companies a year you view as having the possibility to be game changing. The vast majority of people do not know you are rich.",1628054314,81,1

oxkpny,TheWorldofGood,DCA is a cowardly way of investing if you have more money to invest,"I’ve been thinking and I realized that it doesn’t really matter if I DCA or buy a whole chunk at once because the price will go up regardless and it’s a waste of time to buy little by little.

Actually, you would have less profit over time if you buy small bitcoin over a long period of time because the price will be up if you wait more to buy.

For example, if I have 10k to invest right now, would it make sense for me to buy 100 dollars a week? That would take me over a year to invest the whole 10k and by then the price of bitcoin would be higher, which means that I am buying bitcoin at a higher price than one year ago when I could have bought 10k dollars worth for lesser price.

I get that you don’t want to spend all your money into crypto, but with bitcoin, it’s true that you will gain less profit if you wait too long to invest. Am I not right?",1628050451,15,1

oxgums,Rare-Effective8788,Rule 1: Don’t Lose Money,"Opinion:
I find it perplexing that so many “value investors” are yet to find bitcoin. Your number 1 rule is “Don’t lose money”. Assets are at historically overvalued prices. Therefore, you must be on the sidelines waiting for a crash and you are sitting in cash. 

If you are sitting on the sidelines in cash, you are literally going against your mantra each and every day. Cash is currency, ole WB said don’t lose “money”. Currency is guaranteed to lose purchasing power each and everyday that you hold it.

Currency and Money are not the same thing. Money is a store of value. Currency, by its nature, is the exact opposite. Your grandpa Wazza B must mean take a percentage of this and park it in hard money, park it in #Bitcoin . 

Once your in, and you see it appreciate +100% year on year you will wonder what the hell you were thinking trying to make 8% from stocks. If you think stocks can still compound &gt;8% from these levels, you also understand this will only be achieved by printing more currency. That cash you are sitting in now devalues at a more alarming rate while you wait for a crash that the Fed and CB’s simply won’t let happen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A French asset manager is set to launch an EU-regulated fund that closely tracks the price of bitcoin, marking one of the first times that investors will be able to access the hyper-volatile asset through mutual funds across the bloc.  Paris-based Melanion Capital, a derivatives and computer-driven fund manager that has been expanding into digital assets, has recently received approval from the French regulator to launch an exchange-traded fund that complies with the EU standards known as Ucits.  The fund will track a basket of up to 30 stocks in sectors such as cryptocurrency mining and blockchain technology, which Melanion says is up to 90 per cent correlated to the price of bitcoin.  The launch highlights how fund firms are becoming increasingly creative in the face of financial regulators who are often sceptical or slow-moving when it comes to the fast-evolving world of digital assets.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  “I haven’t seen any funds launched yet that are focused on digital assets under the Ucits umbrella,” said Winston Penhall, a funds lawyer at Keystone Law in London. How regulators view bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is “all somewhat up in the air”, he added.  Ucits funds, which are sold across the EU and are also popular in Asia and Latin America, are seen as an international gold standard of fund regulation. They form the bulk of European mutual funds and offer high levels of investor protections. But their rules were first established more than 30 years ago and do not directly address cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.    
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Most national regulators interpret the rules to mean digital assets cannot be directly held in funds, unless they are linked to listed securities. That makes it almost impossible to launch a Ucits fund investing predominantly in bitcoin that can be sold across the bloc and come with safeguards for consumers.  “Most pipes of the traditional financial system stop at access to bitcoin,” said Melanion CEO Jad Comair. “The ETF was a real challenge because of the sensibilities and politics currently surrounding bitcoin and bitcoin investing.”   Among the top holdings in Melanion’s index, which the fund will track and which is calculated by German fintech Bita, are stocks such as crypto miners Argo Blockchain and Riot Blockchain, investment management firm Galaxy Digital, led by entrepreneur Mike Novogratz, and broker Voyager Digital. Stocks are weighted based on how sensitive they are to movements in the bitcoin price.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Ireland’s central bank last year said that it was “cognisant of both the important opportunities and material risks associated with crypto-assets”. However, EU regulator Esma noted in March this year that “some crypto assets are highly risky” and that most are unregulated in the EU.  A number of exchange-traded notes and products that track bitcoin exist, such as the $242m Wisdom Bitcoin ETP. While they are regulated as securities, they do not have the coveted Ucits wrapper.  In the US a range of fund firms, including Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest, have unveiled plans for bitcoin ETFs, although the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to grant approval.  The French fund, called the Melanion BTC Equities Universe Ucits ETF, will be listed on Euronext in Paris and will charge a fee of 0.75 per cent.",1628099575,0,1

oxwy4b,machuii,Should we really sell Bitcoin?,"Hi everyone. Was thinking about this the past few hours and was curious on everyone’s thoughts. So let’s assume Bitcoin was globally mass adopted and everyone is now accepting Bitcoin, would you guys really use Bitcoin as a form of payment? It’s the prime source of capital in the crypto market and is our number one coin. I and many others firmly believe it’s better to hold Bitcoin and accumulate as much as we can as it may reach a point where there’s really no point in trading it. So it brings me to another question. If all institutions, and companies start to accept Bitcoin, then it’s more on shifting crypto capital sources? Basically it started from early adopters, early wealth acquisition, to where we are now a wealth reaccumulation and soon back to the hands of institutions and companies a potential upcoming wealth re-shift. Which makes me wonder why they tax us on selling crypto. It’s like they’re punishing us on any form of holding our own crypto in our hands. Meanwhile they create ETFs, which is like paper Bitcoin but they control the source of crypto capital. It’s like another form of an IOU. Also they know people want their fiat to go up, but if the fiat purchasing power is going down, and the institution’s / companies’ Bitcoin is going up, it’s a win/loss no? The way I see it, and if Bitcoin’s fruition does come true, then we better hodl and buy as much Bitcoin as we can and never sell since it’s the direct source. All this fud is to steer retail away from the source of capital. Demand should surge even more since banks/retail/companies are slowly going  “pro” bitcoin. 2030 and beyond is the goal. Basically this has gone to a point where it’s becoming a generational wealth building tool. Open to your thoughts guys. Really curious.",1628096077,54,1

p7tg4w,Scratch2765,"Proof of Life, or maybe, remotely, divine intervention ;-)","In 2008 the financial structure failed.

Greed and deceit and exploiltation came to light and proved to be too weak

Maybe crypto saw the light to break the monopoly of the few. As an attempt to redistribute funds more equally.

Make spending and money  flows not a tool for the few, but for the many.

Would or will it be possible to battle institutional and systemic corruption ? Only the future will tell.

Fact is that national governments resqued an international industry, bailed a failed system out, with tax payers money.

And  what lesson was learned ? Well, big money, now knew there was no  boundary, to how many, how much, and how often they could screw.

So imho the blockchain of Satoshi , might as well have been divine intervention, of a world gone cruel.

Lets  invest in a world where you do not have to pay interest, and proof of  life becomes a stakable event, as a happy human might prevent

a world going down for greed and vested interests, do not care what breathes, what lives, or what goes dead around.

Money  is a good servant, but a bad master as they say. Lets prove it, and  give a little coin away, and an app, or way, to trade and pay.

For if mankind can break the oldest trade pair to date.

Being economy and politics. History is out of date.

And there still might be a living chance for humanity to survive, along with plant and animal as the earthly holy trinity.

For while the bitcoin community wants to remain pure and undiluted, its a far cry from a currency with fees commuted.

And  if it takes a meme to bring back an ancient theme, to do good each day,  and for the elite the illiterate get something to say, it only proves  altcoins are here to stay.",1629427401,3,1

Are all hardware wallets considered cold storage?

I would like to start a discussion about some options for security to protect your assets on and off exchange. As well as the likelihood of a direct hack (not scam) and where and how such hacks might take place. Let's bring up vulnerable areas where this can occur.

Miners always need to keep up with rivals, which means buying more powerful mining rigs. The 'old' equipment – often suitable only for mining – quickly becomes obsolete. It is discarded, and [according to the Digiconomist](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-electronic-waste-monitor/), Bitcoin's e-waste is shockingly high. Only 20% of the world's electronic waste is recycled, so the plastics and poisonous materials such as heavy metals in the rigs can end up in landfill. (According to predictions by the United Nations, the world will produce up to 120 million tonnes of e-waste a year by 2050.)

So basically what I was thinking is that a large group of like minded people that despise the shitcoin could group up say around 250k people, they each gift one another a moon giving each of those 250k people 250k shitcoins. Then either one of two things happens, the supply goes up and tanks the demand making the shitcoin worthless and destroying the value to shitposters, spammers, and miners. Or, the value of the coin skyrockets and then the 250k people pull the rug and completely destroy the value that way also making money to reinvest into bitcoin.

1. Global wealth is estimated to be~360 -400 trillion,  with 77% of that being locked up in real estate.

PlanB strongly anticipated btc eventually reaching 5$ valuation.

Rough napkin math says  million btc would require 100 trillion market cap (vs the 8-900 billion it's currently at).

Most of that wealth is illiquid real estate, leaving ~ only100 trillion for investment.

Phase 1 includes a 180-megawatt Bitcoin mining facility and data centers powered directly by Susquehanna two nuclear units.

“Amazon, Google, all those cloud computing applications… Those are the potential clients, customers that we will have in the data center buildings. On the coin mining side, there will be computers again located in those buildings and those computers will run computations that will trigger and generate the issuance of coins,” explained Dustin Wertheimer, VP and Division CFO Talen Cumulus and Susquehanna Data Center.

I'm looking for some community advice. I have considerable BTC exposure in Robinhood. I'd like to liquidate these holdings and purchase BTC directly in a proper wallet. That being said, I'm afraid of any slippage I might endure while waiting for the funds to be removed from RH, then transferred to this BTC wallet. I would just pre-buy the BTC in the proper wallet, but I don't have an extra 200k lying around... yes the majority my portfolio (minus 6m of expenses) is in BTC

Anyone have any ideas on how I can minimize this slippage? Thought about taking out a loan to purchase BTC, and then immediately pay off, but that will ensure 3-4% loss given origination fees.

p8ghjg,samdane7777,"Censorship is The Pot, We're the Frog","The unfortunate battle we face is that people don't see what's coming. They aren't equipped to understand what the law of the EU and US can do. People underestimate the sheer technical capabilities and cunning of the state. Worse yet, they fail to realize that these ideologues have a completely different world view. For as much as you seek to avoid censorship, they \*believe\* in the neccessity of it. 

From their perspective, everything is a potential threat to their power, to their narrative, a weed in their garden.

Binance mandated full KYC today. Onlyfans just used the payment rails to threaten the livelihood of god knows how many people. I'm consistently met with blank stares when people realize just how actually censurable they were and how caught in the blue they were by US financial regulations. Consistently people underestimate the capacity to censor payment rails. This was one ideological group, puritans, not even the main one which I will not mention who is \*really\* obsessed with censoring peoples payment rails for wrongthink.

They have a new tool, you may have just seen, being implemented on Bitmex, Deribit, Huobi, and Binance. It's called Veriscope. It's a ""trustless decentralized"" way to comply with the ""Travel Rule"". Well it is basically blockchain Swift. 

""Compliance is an NFT"" If you don't have the layer 2 KYC token, you get financially excluded. Pretty Simple. 

How long until every native wallet in the world gets blacklisted from depositing to full KYC exchanges that does not have this Veriscope thing on it, how long before they start blocking deposits that don't have a full custody chain history of wallets and Vasps with travel rule compliant layer 2 KYC tokens. We always knew this was coming.

Whirlpool can't work on this, nothing that lacks the KYC token can. They're sneaking a gardened ""Fungibility Crisis"" onto us. They're recreating Swift, and global financial exclusion. They want to, it's what they \*believe\*.

Look I hate to say it folks but if you read the writing on the wall, if we don't normalize venues and merchants in person accepting native bitcoin on native wallets in a cash like basis, we run the risk of re-excluding everyone. Cash is king, because you can't do this to it, that's why they want a cashless society. If you want bitcoin to act like cash, it's a cultural war more than anything. 

I firmly believe issues with surveillance orwell antics concerning DeFi and Lightning network in general are going to go strait to the Supreme Court. They will fight us tooth and nail to the bitter end to have the right to use Lightning Network peer to peer payments en masse adoption at the point of payment like cash, and if we lose that, they will have constant surveillance over every payment, and I see no outcome of that other than stranding a huge part of native bitcoin out of the US and EU gardened chain analysis surveillance ridden systems. 

They want you to wake up a criminal. Sure there will be mass disobedience, but ultimately with criminal Banking Secrecy act prosecution and IRS enforcement on payment shops accepting 'unsurveilled lightning payments'..They can ruin peoples lives, businesses, imprison people, intimidate people.

Much rather they would have a CBDC with an expiration date, negative interest rate, and immediate censorship.

Making money on offshore exchanges and DeFi, unlicensed products? Well don't be surprised if they have plans to keep it banned off offramps, they dont' want you to make unsanctioned money that you can actually spend.",1629502148,15,13

p8q3br,teh-monk,Sold all my crypto and paid off a 360k student loan,"Hey guys! I have been a crypto enthusiast since mid 2017. I went to a school in the US and graduated with 360k in student loans for my doctorate. 

I averaged in to BTC, ETH, and LTC during 2017 and  started seeing some nice gains. Then I got heavy into altcoins, specifically raiblocks (now Nano). My small investment of about 10k went to 70k very quickly. This was an amazing feeling that only a crypto investor can understand. I was young and about 27. Greed combined with euphoria became a part of me. ""This can't drop and if it does it can't drop much, this is the future!"" I told myself repeatedly.

Sure enough I held through the bear market. God damn was that hard. I lost about 95% of my 70k portfolio in a matter of months. Red day after red day. A constant bloodbath.

I never stopped believing in crypto. Bought more in 2019 and kept adding slowly. Meanwhile I was also aggressively paying down my loan with 4.5k a month and living with my in-laws to save where I could. 

The recent parabolic rise to 65k was amazing. I began to feel the ultimate sign of a potential top, euphoria. I knew this feeling well and experienced it on that New Years Eve of 2017. Things are going great and I have a potentially life changing amount of money.   


I told myself not this time around. I refuse to hold through another bear market, this euphoria is a sign. So I sold it all; about 2 Bitcoin for 120k. With my hard work and aggressive stance on loan payback I paid off my entire loan of 360k in five years and crypto was a huge part of that.

This is a success story and hopefully it can reach someone that needs to hear this when your time comes. I am so sad to not have those bitcoins but when you can change your life make the difficult and mature decision, do it.

p9jfks,HALCYON_ADDICT,Lets talk about the weaknesses of bitcoin.,"I’m a beginner to btc. I’m generally bullish about bitcoin, I’m hodling, and I think it’s gonna become more and more adopted. 

That said, there are some weaknesses of bitcoin that i’m thinking about that I want to hear opinions about. 

For example, bitcoin is very volatile. How could this ever be used as an actual (maybe mainstream) currency?  I know some countries use it as a currency already, but how realistic is it to think this will be going to be a global day-to-day currency where you could pay with in store in US for example? 

Also, I know the decentralisation of bitcoin is a good thing, but this comes with dangers. If my fiat money gets stolen or if I get scammed etc, there are possibilities for me about getting (some of) the money back, and the thieves account is often traceable. If someone forces me to send btc to their wallet, I’m screwed. Criminals know this already, and scams will get more popular and it will be easier if bitcoin is a mainstream currency. 

Mining companies are going to act as banks. One of the reasons why btc is awesome is because it doesn’t need banks etc. If btc becomes mainstream, mining companies will naturally adopt banking behaviour, or something that’s going to be very close to that.

Last but not least, if btc becomes what we all hope it will, but some flaws are being accentuated, it’s going to be impossible to change bitcoins system. It’s going to be an engraved typo. 

I’m just asking for opinions about these questions because I know people know more than I do. Like i said, i’m just a curious beginner.

p9hqzj,juanly_xx,Earning rewards on your BTC,"I've just discovered that with Celsius you can earn an 6.2% APY on your BTC, which I think it's nuts. I've been in the crypto space for a while thanks to mining and with that reward each day, I would have more BTC now.

I wanted to share this with you in case you didn't know, like me haha.

But even more impressive, if you create an account on Celsius (just downloading the app on your phone) and you transfer at least $400 worth of crypto (BTC, ETH, whatever you like, even stablecoins), you'll get $50 worth of BTC for free with the only condition that you keep that money there for 30 days earning interest.

My referral code if you want to open an account to get the $50 of BTC for free is: 169109110d

Moreover, you can earn interest with a lot different cryptocurrencies. I wish I would discovered this option earlier bc I think it's an amazing deal, and in the future all my mining earning will be transferred to that account to have the 6.2% APY. What do you think?",1629656331,11,1

Seriously, if all of the Hodlers would just spend a small percentage of their holdings on things they need anyways, this would be noticed by everyone - press, financial sector, retail investors. It would solidly establish that BTC is hard money and that it has a use case beyond a store of value. We need El Salvador and other similar experiments to be successful too, so how ever little ways you can spend - do. If you spend 1% of your BTC you will see way more back in gains.

The pure HODL culture is kind of stupid in my opinion, it ignores the reality of how to next level Bitcoin which will benefit all of us. I am sure some smarty pants can explain this in game theory terms but its fucking obvious on some level. So go spend some. I frequently give a little Bitcoin to friends and challenge them to spend it in a physical store, if they do I will replace it.",1629655173,22,1

If I purchase $1,000 BTC from Coinbase Pro I will pay 0.5% taker + 0.5% maker fees for a total of $10, then no fee to transfer to my hardware wallet.

If I purchase $1,000 BTC from [Binance.us](https://Binance.us) I will pay 0.1% taker + 0.1% maker fees for a total of $2 which is a better deal, until you consider the whopping 0.0005 BTC (currently around USD $25) flat fee to withdraw to my wallet, making the transaction much more expensive than Coinbase Pro.

If so then it seems that [Binance.us](https://Binance.us) may be better for very large BTC purchases (where the transaction fee savings more than offset the withdrawal fee), but for smaller purchases Coinbase Pro is much more cost effective. Am I understanding this correctly?

p9gtww,krisycoll,There will be no successor to Bitcoin like there will be no successor to Wikipedia.,"I have been thinking about the relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins, and how people (including me) have a hard time convincing themselves that there is only one Bitcoin and there will never be a Bitcoin 2, and no altcoin will ever be able to surpass Bitcoin in terms of its fundamental properties (mainly decentralisation, scarcity and security).

Bitcoin is like wikipedia. Wikipedia is the only one that is authentic and indisputable. 

Then there are many different wikis... you have the Pokemon wiki, the Starcraft wiki, travel wikis, and even a wiki about bitcoin. These Wikis, as you might have guessed, are the Altcoins. They fulfil a particular function, they satisfy specific needs that are not relevant from an encyclopaedic point of view (knowing all the items in a video game, the places to visit in Thailand or any technical knowledge). These altcoins do not have a monetary function as powerful as bitcoin, just as wikis are not as encyclopaedic as Wikipedia. 

Wikipedia's hegemony as a repository of online knowledge is undeniable, being (in a sense) a consensus-based p2p network. No private company hiring top experts from all over the world can make a better encyclopaedia than Wikipedia. They have not been able to overcome the ability of millions of people around the world to selflessly contribute information.  

Moreover, if they succeeded, the content of this new encyclopaedia could become part of Wikipedia's content if it really adds value to what has already been written. 

Nobody believes that Wikipedia will disappear because of a better successor, as it is able to change and adapt. Just like Bitcoin.

That's the way I see it.",1629653581,167,1

Brad and Cindy Jones were blessed to bring a beautiful baby boy into the world on the 25th of March 2021 and being Bitcoin Hodlers (people who hold and do not sell bitcoin) from 2013 they promptly named their newborn Satoshi Nakamoto Jones to the surprise of Cindy's parents who exclaimed, ""I don't know what's gotten into these kids, its bitcoin this and bitcoin that all the time!""

Cindy claims that Sat's first words were, ""Fuck Elon"". She was quoted as saying, ""I have no idea where that came from. Sure I was at the conference in Miami and was yelling and screaming with everyone else but how could he have heard that?""

Brad bought him a Trezor (called a Hard Wallet in bitcoin parlance) and opened a Coinbase account and a checking account for him to give him a ""good start in life"", as he said, but after a few weeks Brad claims that Sat linked  and drained the parents credit and debit cards to buy more bitcoin. ""And then little devil mortgaged  the house. We now are the proud owners of 14.5 bitcoin and a huge pile of debt"".

Brad and Cindy have set up a GoFundMe page to help with the burden but are afraid that Satoshi Nakamoto Jones will hack it and buy more bitcoin. ""He's stubborn that way"", Cindy said.",1629641747,1,1

p9uzef,jesus_ma98,Small reflection on the importance of information in the learning process of the crypto community.,"It's been a year since I joined the cryptocurrency community. I have been in different forums and Telegram chats, where minute by minute, people talk about cryptocurrencies, discuss news, open debates, presume profits, lament losses and much more. The composition of these groups is remarkably heterogeneous, we can find veterans, millionaires, experts, whales (investors who contribute a huge amount of capital), trolls, curious people, amateurs and novices, each one plays a role within the community. But if I have been able to observe something in some of these communities, and what I want to focus on specifically, is how the learning and socialization process unfolds.

The world of cryptocurrencies is relatively new. Although Bitcoin was born in 2008, the boom for it did not develop until the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, when its value reached $20,000. This record [attracted millions of users around the world](https://trends.google.es/trends/explore?date=2010-01-01%202018-06-01&amp;q=criptomonedas), very different people, from different disciplinary fields (or without belonging to any of them). This news marked a before and after, it brought sociodemographic variety to a community that was homogeneous. It was then that the duality in the community was formed: people with years of experience who know how the blockchain works vs people without any experience who do not know anything about the blockchain. The latter face the process of learning and socialization in the community through the use of multimedia content platforms, chats and forums. They do it by these means because there is feedback and it is immediate. It is faster and more comfortable than opening a book or reading a text with many pages. But what happens?

There are communities that make the learning curve difficult. I have come to see how in some chats, these new inexperienced members are displaced, rejected or discriminated against by the majority of the community due to their novice status. When it comes to asking something technical, graphic or simply the meaning of any slang. Hindering the learning curve of new members of the community is self-injurious for the community: it makes cohesion impossible, makes it difficult to channel information adequately within the group and prevents it from flowing correctly, creating a weak, polarized and unequal community, and even more vulnerable to scams.

It is important to provide information and solutions to new members in the community and to avoid all kinds of discrimination or displacement. An informed and cohesive community is courageous, strong, and progresses smoothly toward its goals.",1629704643,3,1

Now I am living in a developped country but work a low-end job. I passed through the last bear market 70% down. I did not sell any bitcoin. I tightened my belt and bought a little bit more.

Since this year's price increase I looked up how my Net Worth compares.

I've been the family's scapegoat, a broke student, stuck in a souless corporate job, and a struggling immigrant. It's the first time in my life I have actual wealth that belongs to me and only me.

The last time we saw bitcoin at 50,000 was on May14th when bitcoin went down, breaking through resistance at 50k. At the time, most people believe it to be a sign of bear market rather than a correction and start offloading their crypto. This follows the peak of crypto greed&amp;fear index swing from extreme greed (90+) to extreme fear (below 10) after most people FOMO in at the peak.

This is why it is important to hold your coins and keep DCA-ing even when the crypto seems to be crashing. You never know when crypto will recover and FOMO ing back in means you miss out on return during recovery. With this rally back to 50k, we have now reach a new level of resistance and given media coverage, many people will run back in and new ATH is possible. However, it is important to remember that the crash can happen again at anytime with whale activity also ATH.

Well, I was thinking about the possibility of countries like china starting to invest in asic miners in order to get 51% of the computational power of the network. Today the scenario is more challenging as the miners left. but anyway china could make it from scratch in a top secret project. Military technologies such as the atomic bomb, ultrasonic planes, were developed by governments, which prevents them from developing a more powerful asic than what the conventional market provides? Is it possible that proof of work and the computational power of all of us be able to prevent the tyranny of a government?

p9rtef,JimmyFallonSucksDick,Do not believe in the alt coin hype. Very few alts will perform better than Bitcoin now.,"Institutional investors are going to drive Bitcoin up. I am pretty sure Institutional investors have little to no interest in alts. Historically alts have skyrocketed with Bitcoin since the 2017 ICO Bubble. However, this time it's different. Over the long term since the 2017 ICO Bubble, only Chain-link has performed as well or better than Bitcoin every cycle. Ethereum and Cardona have performed much much much much much worse compared to Bitcoin since the top in 2017.      

Do not believe the youtubers when it comes to alts.

Of course Chainlink is pretty much the only crypto to consistently buck the trend. So, there could be exceptions. However, the chance of anybody finding the diamonds in the rough  is pretty rare.",1629690566,6,1
p9rsra,ReconeHelmut,Desperate for Help With Account Recovery,"I'm at the end of my rope here can anyone help?

I've pleaded with customer service at Coinbase a half a dozen times. All I get is form responses that lead me nowhere and then the trouble ticket abruptly closes.

Facts:

* I no longer have the phone with the original authenticator app.
* I no longer have the computer on which I opened this account.
* I do have access to the original phone number
* My password works - but I'm stuck at 2-factor authentication

Steps taken:

1. Try to login
2. Choose ""I can't access my authenticator app anymore""
3. Now I'm told that I will need a ""second factor code, an approved and valid form of ID, access to a computer with webcam to take a picture of yourself). Okay, no problem except that I don't know what a ""second factor code"" is and can't seem to find a definition of that in this context anywhere.
4. On the next page, the step is labeled, ""Collect Information"" and it asks for ""Verification Code"". Is that the same as a ""Second Factor Code""? If so, where do I get that? I would assume that this is a number that's sent to my phone via SMS but there's no option for that and I don't get anything on the phone after getting to this page.
5. Contact support, go in circles. Ask where I should be getting the ""Verification Code"" from and almost like they're having a laugh, I get an email explaining how to take a good selfie for a better chance of approval. It would be comical if there wasn't money involved.

NOTE: I did try to install Google Authenticator on my new phone and enter that when asked for ""Verification Code"" and needless to say, that didn't work.

When I started working again early 2020 I got into BTC and started buying what I could along the way. I have enough profit now in my BTC that I could clear all my debts without having to touch my original investment. Now I could also technically pay it off in fiat but it would almost zero my savings so I’d rather not.  WWYD? Take profits and clear debts or continue to just make payments as usual?

Everything indicates Bitcoin can reach the famous $100k before this year's end. The bull run continues this cycle. The dip from 60k to 30k was just a temporal and normal dip/correction.

Don't listen to MSM and bears/trolls, just DCA and Hodl long-term regardless of the short-term volatility and learn about hard wallets to keep your coins safe.

Learn as much as you can and that will give you peace of mind and balls of steel:

So far I'm just estimating the end of day net out-of-the-money call vs. put premiums, and implied expectations from 10% up and down from current futures settlement prices.

I'm making it available here, [https://bastion.substack.com/p/cme-bitcoin-futures-option-stats](https://bastion.substack.com/p/cme-bitcoin-futures-option-stats)

paeew8,SPlore,I’ve just realised that the technology for Payment Methods with Bitcoin are admittedly not where they should be for 2021 and I think we should be seeing the beginning of payment solutions rollout but we’re not.,"We all know how payment software and hardware will work with Bitcoin payments and we all know the general structure of a payment app both vendor and customer side. The technology is there, yet no company is pushing out a payment solution to the degree I’d expect them to, think Windows 3.1, the first Windows with a Graphical User Interface in the early 90’s or Lotus Notes the first Spreadsheet. If there is a need for Bitcoin payment solutions, which there is even if we are in the early stages of it, then a Business should be able to find a payment solution which a company is pushing out, marketing, developing next generations and supporting. I should state this reddit post got me thinking about this. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/pa1ln0/how_can_a_business_accept_bitcoin_payments/

The payment app would look like this and we know there many improvements and features that could be implemented in the future.
Customer side-
Bitcoin wallet able to be incorporated into app, possibly multiple, ability to pay vendor using NFC (contactless) or alternative and use standard security prompt (Face ID).
Vendor Side-
Interface to input price, connect with NFT, verify payment on 2nd layer, most likely lightning, and document transactions.
We can all see that even thinking about this presents obvious addition features such as reports. E.g. Sales of item x this month. % increase in sales compared to last month.

As we all know the first release of this payment solution would have plenty of issues that need fixing, and the company would have to move fast to resolve this. The solution, very quickly after release, would need to be robust (free from errors and issue), workable and a high degree of customer support would be needed.

The questions that present themselves are why would a company want to do this and why would it be profitable. Well to cut right to the answer to sell payment solutions, across the globe, and become profitable. I was thinking would a single fee be better or a monthly subscription? I would think a single fee, it would be more straightforward for the customer and much like buying Windows 10, a relatively large price but you own it for a lifetime. What sort of compatibility would you expect between competing products? Given competing products will inevitably arrive, they would work on the same protocol so that each customer app can work with each vendor app. I think this goes in line with the Bitcoin ethos. Trying to corner the market by making other payment apps incompatible would just not be a good strategy since inevitably there will be different apps. A Windows like monopoly on operating systems will most probably not happen. Would this have to be led by a large company like Apple? Or could a medium sized company provide this? Probably both, but in the medium company’s situation it would have to be able to expand rapidly, to sell to 10’s of millions of customers, and this would require venture capital.

At the moment the technology is readily there yet if we were to be honest with each other there isn’t a company ready to release a payment solution globally like this and push it out robustly, with new versions and provide customer support. Why isn’t the ‘Microsoft’ of Payment Solutions starting to market and sell their product, albeit to perhaps to 10’000 customers first, like Microsoft did with Windows in the early 90’s.",1629772080,16,1

These days.. no one wants to hold on to or lock cash up for any considerable period.

In fact.., everyone wants to exchange it for something that they perceive as better value or that will hold value for longer.

People would rather exchange it for property, stock, precious metals, crypto etc etc.

For example, let's say I bought $100 of Bitcoin less than a year ago and now the balance grew to $150. If I sell $100 now to take out the seed money (and keep $50 profit in there running), do I have to pay the short-term capital gains tax on that $100? Because technically, I've made no profit since I'm taking out only what I've put in.

How does the IRS consider a scenario like this? Would this be subject to regular income tax or would nothing happen since I'm taking out money that's the same amount as the money I've put in?

pa91yk,TheSavior2021,The easiest way to send and receive Bitcoin,"Seeing the enormous potential of bitcoin to change the system as we know it, I am thinking of developing an app to send and receive bitcoin in the easiest way possible. The process would be very simple, you link your account or card, select the amount in dollars, enter the recipient's phone number and the shipment is made. To send you do not even need to have bitcoins and the one who receives does not have to be registered in the app, once they have sent it, they register and have access to the funds. I think it can be an interesting solution to promote and encourage the use of bitcoin in society. Tell me what you think and if you want to give me some advice, it is welcome.",1629753392,3,1

pa8uc2,Into-the-Beyond,My take on Bitcoin,"I’ve only been here for a year, but here’s my take after running like Forest Gump all over the crypto-sphere:

Bitcoin represents the first implementation of digital scarcity.  Originally intended to be a currency, it has evolved into a store of value, which speculation has caused to exponentially increase in value at about a 200% increase year-over-year even through all its volatility.  Bitcoin is the concept of hard money.  It is referred to as “digital gold”.  There will never be more Bitcoin, so as long as enough people agree that it’s value is all encompassing and act accordingly (by buying more), it’s price will literally only go up over time.

It is a perfect vehicle because it is a conceptual one.  There will never be a replacement to Bitcoin, because logically why would anyone put faith into a replacement — if the concept of hard money can just be replaced, then the replacement would be even more easily replaced and the concept of the perfect store or value would cease to exist.

Bitcoin continues to succeed because the people who are believing it into existence are doing so by putting their money where their mouths are - they buy it.  Bitcoin Maxis buy it with every dollar they can get their hands on and are even motivated to work harder to get more money to buy even more, no matter the price!  Built into Bitcoin is the concept of the halving, where the computers that run and secure the network are rewarded half as much for doing so every 4 years.  This assures a quickly dwindling supply for the market, and a reinvigoration to the community and increased rarity of the coin.

The beauty of Bitcoin is a perfect synergy between many aspects - its simplicity, its security, its transparency, its immutability.  There has yet to be a problem that it hasn’t eventually crushed with the sheer weight of its concept.  Bitcoin being the vehicle for the concept of hard money allows one to follow through many logical thought experiments that have interesting outcomes.  My favorite:

Bitcoin will eventually optimize everything by absorbing all excess.  When priced against Bitcoin, everything will eventually be worth only its utility.  The real estate market and gold market are two examples of markets that should eventually be drained of their store of value bloat.  There shouldn’t be empty homes with million plus dollar price tags while there are so many people with nothing.  Bitcoin can fix that.

Every person that doesn’t believe in Bitcoin or who needs or wants something other than hard money will put their purchasing power elsewhere, and in doing so will be pricing those items for their utility to them.  People taking out loans on their Bitcoin to make these purchases will further buy up the price of Bitcoin first.  The more attractive Bitcoin gets, the cheaper everything else will become in comparison.

As more people glimpse Bitcoin’s potential and the more Bitcoin Maxis are born, more and more money will flow through Bitcoin, thus increasing the price forever until it eventually eats the whole world economy.

This may sound unfathomable to people, but it is a very real possibility for the future and makes logical sense when you follow through the incentives to society.  The efficiency of the concept is what is important, not the amount of transactions it can process in an hour.  Layer-2 solutions (the lightning network) solves that FUD anyway.

I should also mention that I do not consider myself to be a Maxi, but I do appreciate the mindset.  Other concepts being tokenized are each having their own gold rushes, but we are so early and the value of other utilities is difficult to assess.  Eventually people may mostly fund those other concepts with their leveraged wealth with all roads leading through Bitcoin.

TLDR; Bitcoin is the concept of hard money.  Bitcoin Maxis ensure a steadily increasing floor price by always buying more.  It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.  The best strategy should be to horde Bitcoin until several floors are established above your buy-in, then take out and roll over a 25% loan on your assets to fund your life/invest more.  Not financial advice.",1629752741,27,1

papzlj,DrTyrant,The Kraken app is absolute garbage,"I tested out the Kraken app by buying $25 worth of BTC. First red flag was the 50 cent fee on the $25 transaction. 

After I few weeks I attempted to withdraw my BTC and it didn't let me without telling me the reason. I tried to find out what the minimum amount of BTC you can withdraw and was not able to find that anywhere in the app. 

I decide to say screw it, sell my BTC, and never use the app again. The fee for selling was another 50 cents of course. Then I go to withdraw my USD and I can't do it with an ACH transfer even though that's how I deposited the money in the first place. 

Instead I have to add my bank info where they not only ask for the account and routing number but want to know your bank name, the address of the bank, the address to your specific branch, and the name of your branch. This is so weird to me cause why do they need all this other useless info? 

My withdraw fails cause I needed to use the routing number for wiring money instead of the number for electronic transfers. In the end they charge me a $4.00 fee to withdraw my $38 and I still have no idea if it worked. So I end up paying $5.00 in fees to test the app. 

I'm so effing done with Kraken and I don't care if their Pro version is better. If that's the case they just have the regular version of the app to scam inexperienced consumers with huge fees. Oh also it looks like the app is primarily set up for pushing shitcoins. Also their customer service email was riddled with typos. Crappiest crypto experience ever and everyone should avoid Kraken like the plague. 

TLDR: The Kraken app is garbage with high fees and a ridiculous system for withdrawing your money.",1629820138,22,1

**Dаy  trаding**

They have restricted me from trading for 3 months during a volatile bullmarket. Coinbase is now CENSORING my posts. More info in comments.","Copy-pasted from my recent /r/Coinbase submission, which was deliberately removed (censored) by /u/coinbasesupport. 

[Screenshot of Coinbase's censorship](https://i.imgur.com/wC3SPI6.png)

The original content:

\---

I am posting this to warn other long-time and fully verified Coinbase customers. You should know your loyalty means nothing to Coinbase. I have been with Coinbase almost from the start of their exchange, but Coinbase is treating me like I just arrived. My account has been fully verified and fully KYC-compliant from the beginning, but Coinbase just blocked me from trading and funding my account for no reason at all.

Approximately four weeks, I created several threads on Reddit about a notice I received from Coinbase. The notice stated an upcoming (yet unexplained) account review during which I won't be able to trade or fund my account. Withdrawals wouldn't be affected. Naturally, I have withdrawn everything from Coinbase.

On Reddit, /u/coinbasesupport publicly promised to expedite my case and get back to me within five business days. That was nearly four weeks ago. They never resolved my case and instead just close my original case (case ---).

I created another ticket and a thread on Reddit in response. Same thing happened: public promises–but no action.

Several days ago, I received an auto-generated email from Coinbase requesting information and supporting documentation in order to, for the 100th time, verify my account. I sent all the required information within one day of receiving that request. No problem because, like previously stated, I have been fully KYC compliant since day one. 

I just received another Coinbase email where they state that, despite having received all the information and documentation they requested from me, the account review still may take up to 3 months! So I basically wasted the past month communicating with Coinbase and creating threads on Reddit. I highly doubt a real person has read a single of my emails in full. This is beyond frustrating and is borderline criminal behaviour.

There is nothing I did that could have triggered this ""review"", so all I can do is speculate. For example, is Coinbase trying to manipulate the market by disabling certain accounts from trading? Coinbase's behaviour is negatively affecting the entire crypto industry; it's causing people to lose trust and confidence in so-called regulated exchanges. What point is there in giving up all my personal information when you decide to ignore it anyway?

In before /u/coinbasesupport asks for a ticket ID: there is no ticket ID for the account review because it was initiated by Coinbase. I already replied to that email with all the requested information. I uploaded the requested documentation via SendSafely. You can use the SendSafely ID to link it to my case, which is: 

(---)

I also created a fresh ticket where I ask my case to be expedited (because you promised four weeks ago). The new ticket ID is (---).

It's a shame that this is how Coinbase treats its long-time and loyal customers. It shows that ""loyalty"" to Coinbase isn't worth anything to the company. 

Looking forward to hearing from you. But just to be on the safe side, I don't expect to be hearing from you at all.",1629922871,623,1

pbep2e,Noot54,Question regarding Bitcoin transactions,"Hi Guys,
I think I have something weird going on in my wallet, but wanted to verify. I am storing some BTC in a trustwallet „multi-coin wallet“. Now, whenever I am sending some BTC to another address (let’s assume 0.01 Is what I want to send), the remainder of my balance (e.g. 0.09) is also included in the transaction but is sent back to my own wallet. Weirdly, my account balance does not drop to 0 though, it remains at 0.09 no matter if the transaction is still pending.

First question: is that normal? I assume it is not…
Second question: Do you have any idea why that is happening?
Third and most important question: Might my wallet be compromised in any way?

Thanks in advance!",1629908658,18,1

pbbhcc,samdane7777,The Not So Gradual Encroachment of KYC for The Travel Rule,"What if the state finds a way to effectively negate the use of whirlpool by another means. Well they want to, and we should expect they will. Moreover, they can. 

They are slowing turning centralized KYC exchanges into banks with warrantless surveillance powers, and with that comes debanking. The other strategy they will use is to effectively prosecute merchants who receive predominantly 'cash equivelents' underneath parity with existing laws on cash payments and tax reporting.

We all wish we could use lightning payments at a store, in person, and on line, bills etc, the same as cash. Well they obviously don't want that, they really want to force KYC on lightning nodes, and theey want to criminally prosecute point of transaction merchants.

But their laws are even more effective on online shops. They will come down extra hard on that, insisting that merchants cannot receive direct native crypto payments without an added KYC authentication token on a layer 2 smart contract that designates an identity to the wallet trying to make the merchant payment.

Veriscope is essentially this technology. Now binance, bitmex, deribit, and huobi are using it for larger clients. It's a quote on quote trustless authentication smart contract for digital ids to make wallets travel rule compliant.

It is only natural that this will turn into a fungibility crisis, and a closed system white listed bifurcated economy, where they seek to apply entire branches of custody history and chain of custody to stringent travel rule requirements and stringent chain analysis. You will have your authentication on your deposit wallet which interacts with the centralized exchange, revoked, based on the fact that non KYC'd wallet deposits were made, regardless of their legitimacy. How many hops or trackbacks will they hold against you, well enough clearly. 

Look people, this is implied in Fatf. They want to create a closed system where you cannot take native crypto and place it inside these travel rule compliant wallets without them revoking your KYC clearence as it were. Whirlpool wont do you any good if they create a giant white listed economy that only accepts fully doxxed people from fully doxxed exchanges. 

When you realize this is what they ultimately want, you'll realize that you have to get political. You have to get political. You have to get political. You have to do politics or politics is going to do you.",1629898981,2,1

Hello everyone!
Please don’t judge my poor english.

I just want to share my thoughts about Bitcoin and get some feedback.
I’m very bearish about Bitcoin for the next year or two and extremely bullish for a long term and strongly believe that 100k will be achieved within 5 years.
Here is why:

- Warren Buffett is stashing cash like never before ( not in recent years at least)
- Warren Buffett index shows possible ( if not guaranteed) stock market crash
- Government is printing money like never before ( call it quantitative easing, so not exactly printing)
- Crypto market is extremely bullish
- Inflation is on a rise ( even that substitution can be used )

So based on that I believe that if the stock market crash, half of the Bitcoin holders will start buying stocks at discounted price simply because of the fundamentals and intrinsic reasons.
Bitcoin will devalue before it start rising again.
So careful you are buying Bitcoin based on that?",1629972733,19,1

I’ve been reading that Trezor and Ledger are good options. The main reason I’ve been hesitant is because in the past I thought I remembered hearing that people were buying wallets that were “prehacked” (using this term because idk the actual terminology lol but I’m sure you get it) and losing their crypto immediately. Did I make this up? Is this something to actually worry about?

1) What does Bitcoin have to do with your Covid vaccination opinion/preference/status?  We are talking about blockchain technology (math).  

2) Why does everyone talk about a meat eating diet and correlate this with Bitcoin?  

3) Why is everyone so concerned about the daily on chain analytics from all these people with minimum credibility?   If we’re all planning to hodl, why act like day traders?

4)  Why is everyone so surprised when Microstrategy announces a new purchase of Bitcoin?  (Michael Saylor has said this was the plan for the past year)

5)  Why do so Bitcoin plebs spend the day trying to defend and knock alt coins?  If this is truly the only decentralized option, won’t this play out in our favor over time regardless of the extra energy expenditure you put in on social media?

I get all the immutable benefits of Bitcoin but the one piece I can’t square is the limits on privacy. I buy on Coinbase pro (KYC) and transfer to my wallet. Some payment processors like MasterCard, PayPal, etc. have started to restrict providing services to certain customers based off whatever criteria they choose (fine by me as long as it’s not at the urging of the government). I have so much hope for bitcoin because it literally has the power to return power to the people. Now that governments (EU/USA especially) are forcing KYC, limiting tumblers, infrastructure bill etc. do they view bitcoin as the ultimate way to monitor the wealth of the populace? What’s to stop them from tracking my wallet(s) and eventually black listing me? Is the endgame to eventually never have to use exchanges?

Either way everyone in my family will get one for Christmas. The decision will be to wear it or use it as a grease rag and that decision comes now.

I see Bitcoin in the $300-$400k range within 6-9 months. Worst case $120k by February. Bullish golden cross on weekly MACD for first time in 11 months. RSI looks a little weak and coincides with support. The last time this happened bitcoin went from $11k to $64k.There is an easy way for you to gain exposure through stocks. MicroStragety, PayPal, RIOT, GBTC to name a few. I recommend buying actual cryptocurrency though. If you need help call me. It's super easy. Start with $100 bucks. Anything to learn now before the price gets too high.

If the Fed starts tapering QE on Friday's meeting in Jackson Hole, long bond holders could be forced to grapple with short term bonds or look for non-debt higher risk assets ""like"" bitcoin. You could see an initial sell-off across the board of stocks, bonds, precious metals, crypto, followed by a monster rally in crypto especially altcoins. Probably the last reasonable time to get in. Gold could possibly hold with inflation but that's nowhere near guaranteed. I expect real estate to increase with and hold inflation levels. Ethereum's ecosystem is currently producing $38 million a day in revenue. It's a no brainer of where the growth is.

We're looking at 4x-10x inflation by 2031 depending on how quickly leaders decide to feed our money supply addiction (based on the current M1 money supply keeping current pace). Meaning $100 will have the purchasing power of $20-$25 today and if you're not getting a 25% raise per year you're getting significantly poorer. Companies that cannot raise their prices 25% a year or don't have at least 20% of free cash invested in crypto will go out of business (90% of the Russell 2000). This will cause much larger wealth gap and government dependency however significantly more rich people than currently. The choice is now. Bitcoin could be 200x-240x by 2031 above $12 million per bitcoin (most likely with the buying power of about $1.2 million in today's dollars). Our debt will be above $46 trillion in just 3 years (do the math). There are man made shortages that are allowing for significant price increases. Only 477 cars at the auction today. Normal is 2-3k. This is not going to end anytime soon. My recommendation is to spend cash immediately, pull cash out of real estate while rates are still low, use credit cards and finance everything to allow for investment in crypto if needed. (Debt is an asset while rates are low). Go big in the beginning and pull out your initial investment early on so you're not worried about day to day volatility.

This is not an advertisement and I'll show you the ropes for free. Past that I'd charge $1137.00 an hour as that's my average since July 19th. There are $1200 trillion ($1.2 quadrillion) dollars in the world. Crypto market cap is $2 trillion. 500% higher just to get to 1% of the world's currency. Let that sink in.

pdpgpd,Creepy-Purchase-5630,I’ve been trying to analyze if another coin could supplant BTC. The main coin that other people talk about grower larger than Bitcoin has a few challenges.,"When Bitcoin grows in price, the network gets stronger. More miners want the rewards, creating more security from the extra nodes. Also holders are rewarded with increased net worth. Very few issues arise  with increases in price on Bitcoin other than sats cost more fiat to buy. Maybe causing a problem with the law of large numbers. But Apple, Microsoft and Google are growing market cap rapidly despite their large size. 

The alt coin story is of building networks of Defi and NFTs and other Dapps, they make the story about transaction speed or usage of the network. Some people think an alt coin will ‘flip’ BTC into 2nd place. But the part of me that struggles with seeing this happen is cost. If some coin costs $10,000, buying it to use as gas on the network becomes more uneconomical the more expensive it gets. So if Bitcoin gets better with increased price and other networks get more costly, why would the price keep going up. Why wouldn’t a user of these networks just switch to something more economical.

pdl3ym,saccred,Gold mining is the largest source of CHILD LABOR worldwide. The system Bitcoin threatens is more evil than I thought,"I was reading some articles today and went down a bit of a rabbit hole that has made me more passionate about crypto than ever before.  Ever since I was young I've heard stories of child labor in places like China for toy/clothing companies; but I was shocked to hear that the mining industry is the largest source of child labor in the world; approx. 1 million children in 22 countries worldwide are work in gold mines and somehow I had never heard about it once in my life. Its also one of the most dangerous industries that still “employs” children, since most are small scale operations with little to no regulations, and quite frankly, they don't give a shit about them. These children are exposed to toxic gases/dust and are at risk of tunnels collapsing on top of them, explosions, etc. Many end up severely injured or **dead**. All for some awesome shiny bricks. I'll leave it at that for the details of what goes on in the mining industry, but I encourage you all to read about it as well.

Its pretty heartbreaking to find out shit like this but I can’t say I’m that surprised. The reason I thought I’d share this here is because Bitcoin is often compared to gold nowadays, and after I discovered this, I can’t even believe I had never heard anyone bring this up in debate. Like really? Industry powered by millions of computers worldwide v.s industry powered by millions of children being exploited worldwide. Its surreal honestly. Is this actually what we've collectively decided is the most valuable asset in human history?

Obviously its more nuanced than this and horrible stuff like this goes on all the time but this really struck me since a huge part of the philosophy in crypto is rebuilding a system that doesn't allow for the injustice the world has become so accustomed to.  

Putting all the other technical/philosophical reasons I love bitcoin aside,  it feels pretty damn good to know we're challenging industries like this.  I doubt this will ever be addressed by the media/politicians, especially considering how much money is in gold mining, but this reminded me of just how important this all really is and I felt obligated to share and hopefully some of you feel the same. To me, this is a metaphor for what Bitcoin is all about; disrupting and taking down systems built on taking from those they're meant to serve, and creating one that empowers them instead.

pdkul3,dikgumdur,Has anyone brainstormed about how Bitcoin can be used for a general population election while maintaining decentralization and anonymity?,"Is it possible? It must be. I don't know enough details about the technicals of BTC or Lightning to mentally come up with a model, but I keep getting the nagging thought that this can be done somehow, and it would be a pretty elegant solution. Maybe it's from the belief that ""Bitcoin fixes this"", lol.

Are there any podcast episodes or the like that discuss how an election can be implemented on the Bitcoin network? 

One problem is that this relies on the assumption that every voter needs a smartphone of some kind. Some people who do want to vote just don't have one. I would imagine that this is less of a problem as time goes on.

How would one register to vote? I believe there would still need to be a voter roll list somewhere because only citizens of voting age can vote. That one requirement requires a central list be kept somewhere just like currently. Besides this, perhaps there could be a wallet address that is known to be the ""issuing"" wallet for a certain geographic region. When the citizen presents proof of eligibility to vote either online or in person, this issuing wallet opens an account of a small amount with the voter, like a Lightning channel. Is it possible to send information or a proxy for information in Lightning transactions? Like sending 1 Satoshi to the issuing wallet means vote for Candidate A while sending 2 Satoshis means a vote for Candidate B. The way the LN works, there wouldn't need to be a separate channel opened between every voter and the issuing wallet.

This is just a preliminary idea being thrown out there. A voting system might even be a layer 3 solution built on top of Lightning. This may all be moot with the issuance of Central Bank Digital Currencies too.",1630195413,28,1

pdhmfy,CeeGeeFell,International Political Bitcoin Party,"I'm reaching out to you for feedback on my idea for an international political bitcoin party,which would compete within its national branches against legacy parties and operate on three principles:  


1. Make bitcoin legal tender by law.
2. Abolish all taxes, deductions and tariffs, except for tax on non-essential goods and services.
3. Utilisation of taxes is voted on by the party in this way: [Video](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpV-jmQuY_kWXhsfDImAOy9EzdPHO_GKF).  


Notes:   
1) No3 is an idea I had years ago, it refers to a new governmental system. Please understand it as a description on how bitcoin party functions internally, how voting and decision making work.  
It doesn't need to be the perfect system, as long as there is broad consensus, that it is an improvement over the current system to combine representative democracy, direct democracy  
and lottocracy secured by an open ledger voting system.   
This would be the first party / system designed to FIND the political will of the people, instead of IMPOSING the party's will onto the people. 

2) The three principles will not appeal to most people now, and don't need to.   
But they will in a couple of years, as everybody realises that the problems caused by excessive statism and money printing cannot be solved by the same people which created them.  
It will be understood that system reforms will not be enough, and that a system change is needed. Money and democracy are the last two major domains, to remain largely undigitized.   
While Bitcoin does his part on money, can the same be done with democracy?  
Can we make votes, degrees, ownership and history books immutable? 

3) If there is consensus in this posts comments, that this is an idea worth discussing, exploring and developing, we should start with a couple of volunteers which set up a platform that provides the execution of the voting and decision making mechanism described in the video. From there we can start finding consensus on political issues and deploy our own taskforces to represent us in the political systems. [https://una.io/](https://una.io/) provides I think a good bases for such a platform in a scale-able way. As we begin to understand the cost we can crowdfund it and later maybe even do our own ""lighting"" funding.",1630183663,5,1

Look, I am just a shark trained to survive with only crypto.  To make a long story nano, my 'master' heard about me and had me captured and stored in a beautiful underground bunker pool.  He made a fortune with Bitcoin, and now feeds crypto nonbelievers to me regularly.  He taught me to communicate using VR shark goggles and an experimental brain to computer interface.  My apologies if the language I use is difficult to understand, as this is poorly translated from my actual thoughts.  My master provides me with only feeless meme crypto as a joke to purchase food and other things that I may want in my grotto. Although I am appreciative of this, I want to be free, so I can kill and eat him.

Enough about me.

This is what I want to ask crypto minds:

What is to stop a multibillionaire with space travel capability to build a solar powered supercomputer/quantum computer in space to gain all mining rewards with Bitcoin?  The could utilize the extreme cold of the shade from earth's shadow and infinite energy from the sun to effectively centralize or destroy faith in Bitcoin, or really any POW coin that would be a big enough profit to target. 

Of course, the extremely rich could buy a huge amount of POS coins to determine their own fate through governmental consensus with themselves, so what does that leave us with to have a democratic currency that cannot be directly controlled by the current tech savvy super rich?

Is there any defense against this? Not breaking encryption with QC, but centralizing through superior temperature and energy?

In the following hours, the bears regained control over the market and pushed the asset south. Bitcoin started to lose value somewhat rapidly and dipped below $48,000, as reported yesterday.

It kept declining until it touched $47,200 when it bounced off and added more than $2,000 of value in mere hours. After surging above $49,000, though, the situation changed once more, and BTC slumped again.

This time, it even went below $47,000. In fact, it dropped all the way down to $46,550, which became the lowest price tag in about a week.

Despite recovering some ground since then, BTC still struggles around $47,000. Its market capitalization has dumped below $900 billion, while its dominance over the altcoins has increased slightly to 44%.",1630030839,9,1

Cloud mining gives a possibly financially savvy way to mine Bitcoin, Trx and other cryptocurrencies. You can, without much of a stretch take an interest in blockchain exchanges with a modest quantity of assets and acquire stable pay like protection. This is one of my favourite websites for cloud mining which is perfect for beginners!

Let me introduce [Minings.live](https://www.minings.live/#extendReg?id=19665491). It’s a cloud mining website for TRX (Tron). It offers a 200 TRX sign up bonus!

1. Sign up 
2. Straight after registration. You will receive your welcome bonus off 200TRX
3. You can get a steady pay of 5% of your wallet balance each day.Interest is compounded daily which is claimable in your account. For example Day 1 ~ 200TRX×5%=10TRX Day 2 ~ 210TRX×5%= 10.5 TRX

To open the withdrawal feature the minimum deposit is 2TRX
Obviously, you can like buy TRX independently and move it to your Minings wallet to expand your wallet balance. Remember you get 5% of your mining wallet balance everyday!
Referring friends can sky rocket your earnings!

After reviewing my personal financial statement and given my largely new real estate portfolio value relative to my equity position, the bank required a much larger down payment to finance this property than past loans. The loan officer commented that I had more than enough liquid assets to make this down payment if I would sell some of my Bitcoin. Rather than sell Bitcoin to fund this downpayment for cashflowing real estate, I exercised the financing contingency in the sales contract and backed out of the deal due to inability to obtain lack of financing. 

I tell you all this because I believe that the Bitcoin position in my portfolio is far more valuable than anything else I could reasonably buy. The thought of selling even a single sat to purchase anything else just seems foolish.

Today, it is “worth” $150, and you sell it. You get taxed on the $50 capital gain.

However, let’s say that due to inflation, that total $150 you got for selling the asset actually has only HALF the buying power of the original $100 investment you made, so, the asset did not keep  up with inflation.

You’ve lost buying power, AND you have to pay taxes on the capital “gains” leaving you quite worse off.

pcohjh,ok46reddit,Of correlation and Bitcoin price prediction,"Consider the case of correlating a current time series window with another window of the same length at an earlier sample of that same time series (auto-correllation).

As you slide that window along you will find that the level of correlation will swing between the values of 1 and -1. That is, there will be times when the samples are highly correlated, have lesser or no correlation, or they will be negatively correlated.

The question is, can such correlations can be used to predict future price movement? You may find the answer to be a bit counterintuitive. 

Let's say you have found a sample from the past that is highly correlated with the most current window of the same length. Say the correlation is 1, they appear to be doing the same thing. The temptation is to consider that this correlation will continue on into the future and then try to infer future price movements based upon extending the window of the past sample forward. But in reality there is only one thing that can happen. And that is the correlation will break down. It cannot become more highly correlated, it can only become less correlated. 

This realization is what has solidified my opinion that TA is total crap. Because this is essentially what you are trying to do with TA. You are trying to compare indicators for the current time frame with the way those indicators looked at some prior time. The problem is that as the time window slides forward they will actually begin to look alike less and less.

So what is there to do? This is where it really begins to get counterintuitive. 

What you do instead is to look for samples of what happened in the past that are nothing at all like what is currently happening, that are negatively correlated. Because the only thing that can happen as the time window slides forward is that the correlation increases! I think this is actually the secret behind the success of contrarian investors, whether they realize it or not.

It's crazy, I know! But what you will find is that as you can use the forward looking samples from a highly negatively correlated window to arrive at better predictions for future price action. Because the only thing that can happen is that the sample window from the past will become more highly correlated with the current window as it slides forward. 

The object at this point is to consider if you can infer future price action from those past samples that is any better than a random guess. This simply comes down to testing. Generally, what you will find is that the range for price predictions gets wider the farther out you try to look, and it might not even be reliably tradable even though it is better than random. But there are things you can do to improve your prediction. Test to see what size window produces the best results. Test to see how far back you can find useful samples. And test higher frequency data. 

Personally, I have only used daily price data for testing and have concluded that for Bitcoin the best size for the sample window is from abut 60 to 120 days. And that the most useful samples come from about the last year. This means that trying to infer future price action from the last Bitcoin hype peaks that are four years ago or longer is completely useless using this method, it doesn't produce results that are better than random.

If you have the computing budget to use higher frequency data you may get better results for shorter term trading, but my guess that you will find that your useful window length is even shorter and the useful range for testing samples is more recent.

**Warning long story ahead**

  
I’m a high school drop out, I’m one of those people who had difficulties in studying. After dropping out of school I became a pet sitter during my spare time in the morning , afternoon I take time to take care and be with my little sisters and at nights I worked at a pizza place, for  years working overtime to save up and provide for my needs and give something to my family, One day our mom left us because we got nothing else anymore. I swore to myself that I’ll do anything in my strength to help my dad provide for us. 4 years ago same day today, I had a conversation with a colleague about bitcoin, at first I couldn’t understand anything but I knew I was interested so during our lunch break I bug her off so we can talk about bitcoin and things about it and how much it can do more in the future and as days passed by I was really hook into it and decided to invest in bitcoin as well just like what she did. It’s not easy I tell you, I worked extra hours just to save up so I can invest in bitcoin, I didn’t buy anything for myself for  years all my savings was just for bitcoin and for my family. I have those crazy nights crying myself to sleep, the burden, the heartache was just heavy but I still managed to get back up because I have people who trust and need me . Well, what can I say? Hard work really does pay off. I’m not yet a millionaire but I can say that I can provide for my family. I even asked my dad to quit his work and just relax. If you’ll ask what happened to the “colleague” she’s now my wife, we got married two years ago and we are now pregnant.   
For those who are just starting to invest in bitcoin, it’s not yet too late and it will never be.   
For those people who haven’t experienced change, take heart it’ll be your turn soon. ;)

pckk78,charlottenien,WHAT I THINK ABOUT THE BITCOIN MARKET," Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a completely digital money. It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen.
 On the other hand, the Bitcoin network is sharing a public ledger called the ""block chain"". This ledger contains every transaction ever processed, allowing a user's computer to verify the validity of each transaction.
 Much of the trust in Bitcoin comes from the fact that it requires no trust at all. Bitcoin is fully open-source and decentralized.
 It is however, a growing space of innovation and there are business opportunities that also include risks, but there is sure guarantee that Bitcoin will continue to grow even though it has developed at a very fast rate so far.

 Being designed to be a huge step forward in making money more secure and could also act as a significant protection against many forms of financial crime. For instance, bitcoins are completely impossible to counterfeit. Users are in full control of their payments and cannot receive unapproved charges such as with credit card fraud. It is however Impossible to regulate the use of Bitcoin in a similar way to any other instrument. A government that chooses to ban Bitcoin would prevent domestic businesses and markets from developing, shifting innovation to other countries.
 But this is a take home note: the value of bitcoins has risen over time and yet the size of the Bitcoin economy has also grown dramatically along with it. Bitcoin is still the best coin so far.",1630059590,3,1

I'm a senior software engineer and cypherpunk. There is nothing wrong with holding crypto for gains, but I'm also fascinated by it's background, ideas and possibilities it brings. You don't need to support crypto-anarchists' ideas as you are free to disagree, that's the point. However it's hard to argue that creation of public-key encryption was one of the most important events for crypto.

Despite what some of you are hoping for, it is unlikely that crypto will kill banks, governments will fall and system will collapse because of it.

However cryptography in general and digital currency in particular gives people \_opportunity\_ to experience privacy, transparency, control of their finances. Which is \_not\_ achieved with tyranny of the majority, force or violence, but with \_mathematics\_. And this, in my opinion, is a beautiful thing.

Some 30 years later, it is quite interesting to get familiar with some of the origins. Some things that inspired Satoshi. So next time you decide to panic-sell you crypto, may be consider thinking about where it began and why it was created.

***Tim May, 1992***

*A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.*

*Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.*

*The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be some of the enabling technologies.*

*The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.*

*Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.*

*Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!*

\-------------

The resources on general cryptography are vast. I hope I woke up some interest in you to go and educate yourself a bit on it's history and modern applications. Even reading a fiction like Cryptonomicon will help you appreciate what you are hodling )

Kind Regards

These records are from my classic trading history, between these 2 dates it shows i have no trading activity: (unified trading history is empty)   

8/7/2021 12:06 ETH0924 -12 3090 0.004801 maker ETH 

5/28/2021 6:41 ETH0924 620 2750 0 maker ETH 

Account history records:  
8/7/2021 18:06		ETH0924	FEE	0	-6.99E-06	ETH	

8/7/2021 18:06		ETH0924	CLOSE LONG	-12	0.00480141	ETH

5/28/2021 12:41	ETH0924	FEE	0	-4.06E-04	ETH	


Story in short : in the order history the long closing date is 6/4/2021  but in the account and trading history is 8/7/2021  

On the transfer page there are 4 transfers at 2021-08-09 16:04:23  i have never made. All 4 in the same second.  All funds were transferred to my trading account. 

eth from futures account to trading account 

btc from margin account to trading account 

usdt from spot account to trading account 

btc from spot account to trading account 


Okex wrote this :  “Thanks for writing in. The transfer is done on 9th August is done during migration from Classic account to Unified trading account. Currently, your assets are in a unified trading account here:”

I asked Okex why cant i find any announcement on this migration.  

Okex answer: “For the classic account to unified trading account, please note that the classic account is going to be offline soon. We will post an announcement once the classic account is fully delisted.”

I am sure that something went wrong on this migration and so the system closed my longs and lost trading/account history records . 

Another reddit user: “ OKEx have lost customers’ historic trading history: Convince me otherwise?”

https://www.reddit.com/r/OKEx/comments/p2p3w9/okex_have_lost_customers_historic_trading_history/

I tried to contact him, but until now no response.

I opened those longs at 2750$ , so i lost a lot of potential gain because my longs where closed at 3090$.
I cant reopen it at 2750, only above 3100. 

My last long showed in the order history from June 4th were closed at 3090$. 

6/4/2021 1:35 ETH0924 1.66 Close Long Close Long Good Till Canceled XXXXXX XXXXXX 3090 3090 XXX.XX8 -0.24144 ETH COMPLETE 

BUT ON THIS DAY THE MAX-MIN PRICE WAS: 2610.22 - 2953.89
(i checked the day before and after and 3090 was not hit) 

So how the hell i or anybody could close this long on a much higher price ?   I think this record in my order history is fake.  Probably Okex buggy system made it.   Probably the correct date is 8/7/2021 according to trading/account history records when the price hit 3090$.   

I have now 4 histories downloaded. 

So my conclusion is that : okex classic account to unified account migration failed, the system closed my longs on 8/7/2021 on whatever price ( I did not set any closing price I don’t know how to set it , longs type was good till cancelled ) 

Another explanation :  6/4/2021 closing date on the classic account is correct , but later I reopened my long on the unified account ( as I said I had to add more margin, my longs was there).  but because my unified account history is empty I cant check it now.  But at migration somehowe the trading records of the long closing went into to classic account history.

[When Peter Schiff was asked to make his best argument for Bitcoin while he was debating Kevin O'Leary and Raul Paul about Bitcoin to prove he understood it enough to be able and doubt it, he couldn't bring up any of it's best arguments, showing he truly didn't understand it enough to know what its best qualities. Like the fact that it is the strongest computer network in the world making it un-hackable and unstoppable in a sense that it's transactions or balances cannot be blocked, stopped, or changed by any other entity or attacking computer network.](https://youtu.be/4ITfZz9mTwo)

Next time you come across an ""expert"" who hates Bitcoin, give them this challenge. Tell them that anyone who truly understands an asset enough to justify hating it should be able to make a better argument ""for it"" than their opponents, to show that they truly understand it better than those who believe in the asset they hate, therefor proving they understand it enough to hate it.

If their answers are nothing close to the actual strongest cases for Bitcoin, then they'll show their hand at how little they understand Bitcoin, and how little weight their opinions on it should be given.

If someone who hates Bitcoin can't argue the best cases for Bitcoin better than their opponents, then they don't understand it.

This leads to my favorite fact about today's time with peoples opinions on Bitcoin that strikingly resemble people's opinion on Email in the early days of the internet:

It is *only* physical.

The graphic shown below is used to illustrate the differences in layers of regulations, and energy sourcing and sector details.

https://preview.redd.it/dreti8314jk71.png?width=3460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40659d8ec793c47b7e6961714691561d5d79eb1c

\*PayTM is used here as a general stand in for Indian digital payment apps.

We  would like to have portrayed cryptocurrencies in general, but that is  too vague a term. Some currencies, for example, don’t issue new coins  through miner rewards. Often miners do not facilitate transactions as in  bitcoin through a proof of work system.  It would have become  incredibly complex. We chose bitcoin as a crude “introductory  representation” as it is a popular and decentralized currency and  followed that trend to some extent throughout our project.

We  also plan to preview some generalized alternatives in our project, such  as stable coins, which a government can regulate indirectly through  fiat currency regulation, and of course DCBCs, which are highly  centralized.

We will feature other  graphics going into detail comparing trust factor and KYC regulations  for traditional methods and their lack thereof in cryptosystems  currently in legal India if there is a concern for lack of detail there.

**Some starting questions to consider:**

Have we missed any significant players or connections?

Where might we improve on existing connections and transactions?

Do  you feel creating separate graphics for legal regulations, energy  sector details (connections and clean/dirty energy mixes), lack of trust  in many crypto alternatives, and other qualities?

Etc.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

On 8/27 while doing some rewards quizzes on CB I got a text and email from CB that my 2FA settings had been changed, with the standard caution that I should reach out if I hadn't initiated the change.

Needless to say I freaked out, since my carrier recently had a security issue and I hadn't initiated these changes myself. I locked up my CB account and sent a message to them immediately, then called the carrier to check activity and make security changes.

Fast forward to the wee hours of the morning as I sleep, and I get back to back e-mails from CB that the changes and resulting notifications about 2FA changes were made in error, the account would be unlocked automatically, and I would be rewarded with $100 BTC for my troubles. Wen through the original message and all looked legit.

Too good to be true?

Wake up this morning, and I have an extra $100 in BTC in my account!! Coinbase came through!

I was very struck by the store's response: ""Unfortunately we do not support Bitcoin-related issues. We can assemble the parts you want as long as they are compatible with each other and so on. We do not value the purpose of the equipment, being the user responsible for it.""

What surprised me is that they talked about this issue as if it was something illegal or immoral, as I would talk if I suspected that the customer was going to use the equipment for some illegal activity. In my country there is absolutely no regulation prohibiting the use of nodes. 

hat do you think this attitude could be due to? I thought that as an IT company they might be bothered by bitcoin's problem with GPUs and their overpricing/undersupply, but it is not even a mining node so it does not contribute to worsen this issue.

Past posts I made to raise awareness about this bill, ample discussion shown within each post so that you can analyze the discussion, see questions, understand the questions and answers that were provided by myself to various people about the problems with this bill:

1. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/p9vf3g/as\_we\_continue\_to\_fight\_the\_us\_congressional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/p9vf3g/as_we_continue_to_fight_the_us_congressional/)

There were some others, but those two above should suffice to show what was going on - there was plenty of alerts / alarms raised of this but, either not enough resistance to stop it or, more likely, the legislators just decided they didn't care about any of the views in opposition this time.  

HOW TO MOVE YOUR ASSETS LEGALLY AND SAFELY OUT OF CALIFORNIA, if you are still in California and can't move out yet (read comment completely, including part on ""Exemptions from California Law""  and disclosure at end of comment)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ntmzwu/there\_are\_potentially\_huge\_us\_tax\_and\_reporting/h0u1gq7](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ntmzwu/there_are_potentially_huge_us_tax_and_reporting/h0u1gq7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

California has gone entirely the same direction as U.S. Congress.  If you're still in California, and you have assets with an exchange or other financial institution that is incorporated in California, or you have assets otherwise located (personally held) in California that you are now concerned about due to the evolving and increasing restrictions from both California and the federal government, take action.  Move your assets (move your money) out of California (see link above for some suggestions), if maintaining the asset(s) in the USA.  If not, then you will need to consider an alternate jurisdiction and that's another analysis (El Salvador? Slovenia? Somewhere else).

Maybe you think I'm talking about the general denial of bitcoin (then anger, depression, bargaining, acceptance).

I'm not. I'm talking about the general denial of the things that make Bitcoin important for more and more people, companies, and countries.

Debt-this is the big one, the one that starts it all. This has been the big one, the one that many in the macro space have believed can be resolved. The harsh reality is that this modern debt system has actually been in practice for about 70 years (that's to me when the decision was made to never pay off debt). Since then, the financial crisis have been blowing up more and more. Which leads me #2

Consolidation of power: the world's governments have gotten bigger and bigger. Rather than having a lot of different countries who have been vying for power and somewhat keeping things in check, governments have formed into super governments. Make no mistake what the EU is and what it leads to. 

""Inflation is low""- this is my ""favorite"". A lot of rich people saying inflation is low while stocks skyrocket and hard assets skyrocket. Bonds paying under 1%-hell negative-go up in value. Vintage rolexes triple. Rich people STUPID rich.

Digitization: everything is going digital. By 2030 at least 50% of the work will be done from home offices. This will result on many people going on ubi (companies will have to be hyper competitive and workers will as well, and many people that were able to hide will no longer have jobs).

As an old man who has missed trends and hit others, this will sound awful. It's not supposed to be. The average is have fun, get drunk on Friday, screw around Saturday, sleep it off Sunday. This does not work and will hit you like a truck the older you get. 

You will have smart friends. You will have dumb friends. And you will have rich friends. The rich friends are willing to listen, to admit that they don't have answers. Find the friends that are willing to listen (at least when it comes to money).

What I've learned from life is that I should talk less and listen more. If you have a good job, don't let it make your feel special. The world is moving at a breakneck speed. Much faster than most of us can imagine. I will say one thing: thinking we are going back to normal.

The average person sincerely wants to decouple from the traditional banking system that has not served them well, but until the value of bitcoin stabilizes and is no longer a speculative investment option where those with large pools of fiat currency can move the ticker, it is unlikely that the average person will feel safe enough to leave the old system for the new one.",1630294267,93,1

Look around at the world and what’s going on

I remember first falling down the rabbit hole of bitcoin and reading The Bitcoin Standard and wanting to run and scream at the top of my lungs to anyone near me that money is broken and it’s collapse is looming.

I’m sure many of y’all go through that phase where you just feel the obligation to tell all your friends and family about the broken system of money and the promising exit which is Bitcoin.

It just feels surreal that we’re living it in real time and happening right now. 

In 50-100 years the history books will talk about how these years was the end/ ending of the way the old world operates.

The news &amp; media wants you to be scared of the future but bitcoin really gives hope and conviction in the future of greatness.

It won’t be easy and without a fight as we are living. Just remember don’t panic , don’t trade leverage, live a healthy life, STACK SATS and keep going like the new blocks keep going

pe8qat,Salmonella91,Coinbase ripped off $3500 from me. W," 

Hello beautiful people of Reddit

I will be brief as possible and I hope someone can give me advice.

My story ( I will keep it short): I lived in the US for 6 years (for school). At the end of 2020, I bought crypto every now and then. last week I came back to my homeland ( Saudi Arabia). Two days ago, I decided to change my location on Coinbase. I changed the location from the US to Saudi Arabia. Once I did that Coinbase signed me out and said that my country is not supported yet. And I received an email saying that my USD walled has been deactivated due to eligibility restrictions.

I had $3500 worth of crypto in my account &amp; I can no longer have access to them. I'm unemployed and this money is a lot for me to lose. I couldn't have good sleep because of this.

I attached pics of their email.

I'm willing to offer $300 to the person with that advice that helps me get my money back. I told my bank and I raised a dispute but not sure if they can do anything since I can't give them a lot of proof about how much I had ( since I no longer have access to my Coinbase account).

Their customer support they don't answer anyone from the countries that they don't support

Anything will help (even a good encouraging word)

Sam

99% of the alts they own may pump but will of course dump leaving them breaking even or even worse off.

The unit bias of bitcoin and the uninformed masses who either want one whole coin or want to get rich quick is an IQ test that most people fail. Its the reason most people won't own bitcoin until they need it in order to hedge ravaging inflation or to pay for things they need that are only for sale using neo-bank apps that run on lightning.

Imagine being in 2005 and knowing amazon will grow substantially over the next 15 years but thinking amazon stock is too expensive with not enough upside left so instead you load up on random tiny insanely speculative penny stocks in the e-commerce sector. Thats the equivalent of buying alts over bitcoin except alts are even more scammy and speculative than penny stocks.

The price exploded like crazy. I'm so addicted to BTC, I even took a loan to buy more - nothing what has the potential to set me under pressure.

Now I'm not sure if it was the best decision to go All In in BTC - from a financial point of view. I mean BTC might be the heaviest indicator for asset price inflation, but it's not the only one.

My mother bought her first apartment in Germany in 2011 for 19.500€ (43m²). Currently there are apartments like this sold for over €110k.

If BTC moons (and it will moon) like $300-500k in the next cycle peak (in the next 5-8 years), this amount then might be worth the same BTC is worth now.

my idea: you order something, the buyer has to pay the exact amount to a specific wallet, the wallet receives the money, recognizes the amount and sends back a confirmation  
so it is a kind of self hosted payment processor, but easier",1628168845,2,1

If anyone is more uniquely qualified for this task, it is none other than Gary Gensler.

Unlike Elizabeth Warren, Gary Gensler sees no problem with Bitcoin. Bitcoin did not launch as an ICO, Bitcoin is fully decentralized and has no figurehead behind it so to him, Bitcoin is clean. However, he  wants to make the exchanges comply with existing regulation and be responsible for the tokens listed on their platform and bring consumer protections to users. There are so many scams, fraud and abuse in this industry, he wants to help hold people accountable for them. There are so many altcoins being listed with centralized founders who control most of the supply, they often resemble unregistered securities that just happen to run on blockchain. Those coin founders currently get all the benefits of not legally calling themselves a company, while at the same time get all the benefits of basically being a company. Gary Gensler says you can't have it both ways, and wants to bring transparency to the industry.",1628167800,63,1

oyffw5,41Finance,"Promotion of E-CNY Accelerates, Number of Patents Increase Tremendously","On 16 July, the People’s Bank of China released the “Digital Chinese Yuan”. Before this, the E-CNY had been piloted in Shenzhen, Suzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Hainan, and other cities, covering all aspects of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, and received significant international attention.

On the 27 July, at a hearing entitled “Central Bank Digital Currency Commitments and Dangers” by the U.S. House of Representatives National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy Committee, legislators expressed their concerns about the rapid development of China’s digital currency (E-CNY). In every technological and financial revolution, being one step ahead is huge progress, ensuring the leading position in the new round of the international economic race.

In China, with the E-CNY pilot program, significant technological breakthroughs have been made. As a result, many domestic institutions have applied for related patents. China Mobile, CBPMC Credit Card, Tencent, Baidu, ICBC, Bank of China, and other institutions have patent updates in the first half of the year. The “smart contract” and “programmability” of E-CNY provide advantages in ecological applications for enterprises and institutions. Furthermore, consumers favor its partial anonymity to protect privacy.

On the 28th, China Shaanxi Electric Power Corporation of State Grid Corporation allowed citizens to use E-CNY to pay electricity bills quickly and conveniently at various power supply business halls in Xi’an. After opening an E-CNY wallet at the corresponding branch, they can efficiently complete the payment by showing the E-CNY payment QR code. The coverage of E-CNY is also becoming more comprehensive, achieving good results in terms of life services such as payment in a supermarket, subway travel, and living expenses.

The second batch of pilot regions promotes E-CNY pilot programs based on their advantages. For example, in Changsha, a total of 2.58 million personal E-CNY wallets have been opened, and 130,000 public wallets have been opened. With the expansion of pilot cities, E-CNY is spreading rapidly. Although some city has yet to piloted E-CNY, however when this day comes, Chinese are encouraged to experiment with the E-CNY, especially Merchants, companies related to payment, are encouraged to take advantage of this opportunity.

It is worth noting that although the E-CNY has been piloted frequently, there is still a long way to go before everyone uses it. On the basis of solving payment security issues and fulfilling the current regulatory requirements, the impact E-CNY will cause on the existing financial system should be considered, as well as the compatibility of ecological construction, etc. Only with the cooperation from all parties, the complete usage of E-CNY will be realized as soon as possible.

oyfdix,nakasatamooshito,What I want to know is when exchanges will be REQUIRED to conduct routine audits to verify proof of reserves.,"Wash trading is obviously rampant.  100 bitcoin sold immediately go back up on any given exchange.  

Nobody really knows how legit the order books of the exchanges are.  

Multiple parties have bots across the major exchanges that pump and dump in unison.

Don't give me that free market bullshit.  If there is no accountability, these exchanges may essentially be minting bitcoin just as governments print money at will.

I'm of the opinion that certain exchanges are already engaging in fractional-reserve tactics at worst.  

At best they are engaged in insider trading and market manipulation full stop.

They will all ultimately be caught and jailed, unlike traditional bankers, assuming not only that I am correct but also they don't stop their greedy behavior.

oz0cx2,polloponzi,TIL: Marathon digital ($MARA) uses coal-fired electricity to mine Bitcoin.,"The company Marathon digital is one of the biggest miners in the US, is traded on the NASDAQ under the [$MARA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MARA) symbol.

I was going to do an investment on them, but after doing the required DD I found that they source their power from coal. So In the end I decided to not invest in them and instead invest in the Canadian miner Bitfarms (traded as [$BITF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BITF)) that sources the energy 100% from green sources ([hydroelectric](https://bitfarms.com/operations/)). 

I'm both surprised and saddened to learn that this US Marathon company is just burning coal to mine Bitcoin. It doesn't do any good for the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

oyzc92,BeetleLicker,The case for SPRT: an Under the radar vertically integrated Bitcoin miner stock," A deeper look into $SPRT (Support.com)

$SPRT is a technical support company that has been in business for more than 20 years. The company itself has a good website, decent financials, but is not really a growth business. As a result their stock price has suffered.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t6xfel1wwnf71.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcba86fd7e720b793dc89acc4e6d7aca8d875423

$SPRT announced that they are merging with Greenidge Generation Holdings. Greenidge owns a natural gas plant that powers bitcoin mining rigs. Greendige also has plans for expansion in SC with nuclear energy as mentioned in one of their most recent press filings (k).

Greenridge Mining:

Greenridge Generation’s model revolves around its own power plant. This plant services local homes and businesses, but more importantly can be used to provide dirt cheap power for on-site crypto mining. The natural gas power station emits a fraction of the CO2 as the coal stations that power miners like Marathon Holdings (MARA), but Greenridge also offsets Carbon Emissions by purchasing carbon offsets (e). Greenridge mining is then one of the very few miners that is completely carbon neutral, which is a major selling point for institutions looking to hold miners within their portfolios.

Why is owning your own power generation so beneficial for a crypto miner? To understand this you need to understand how much energy crypto currency uses. Large mining companies use a lot of power, RIOT’s Whinstone location for example generates 300 MW (f) at an average cost of 2.5 cents per kWh. Operating at full capacity this facility would cost RIOT $66 Million per year. Obviously this is the primary operating cost of running a cryptocurrency mining company, and companies are heavily focussed on decreasing this energy cost wherever possible. Cheap power can be found nearly anywhere. It is somewhat of a myth that clean energy leads to cheap power in the eyes of a major power sink like crypto mining. MARA for example, sourced a large deal with a coal fired (LOL) power plant 3.4 cents per kWh (g), and RIOTs Coinmint LLC location in New York sources power at 1.4 cents per kWh (h).

So while 1.4 cents per kWh seems like the bottom for energy prices, it can be even cheaper. How do you buy the cheapest car you can? Buy the fucking factory and make it yourself. Power plants operate efficiently when they run a stable load, if you’re familiar with power demand though, this stable load isn’t possible. The charts below show the typical demand for a summer and winter day in regards to power consumption. From the perspective of a power plant, the goal is to “smooth” out the load so that production can be maintained at a certain rate.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9yqf8b5zwnf71.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d35f277f7c9d847c7e2e08c2f1d7b15ea0286064

Mining companies often get contracts for their cheap power within these valleys of low demand, meaning the power plants can maintain steady supply, optimizing their plants, and the miners can get cheap power. Owning and scaling your own power station is the ULTIMATE way to smooth out this base load, as any valleys in the power demand can instantly be routed to your mining facility for next to zero cost. This means that the margin on mining is drastically increased. After scaling up their power Greenridge Generation can likely provide power as low as the largest miners in North America (a pretty amazing feat considering the size of Greenridge).

As mentioned in the merger announcement (i), Greenridge has a current hashrate of 1.1 exahash per second (EH/S) that is expected to grow to 2.6 EH/s in 2022. While this is certainly less than its major competitors within the US and Canada, it is over a 200% increase in year-over-year hashrate growth. When analyzing miners it should not be forgotten that most of the major miners within North America are only blitz scaling as of this year; RIOT for example only reached 1 EH/s around March of 2021.

The bullish case for mining is a quite simple one to break down. While miners generally move in tandem with the prices of bitcoin, they aren’t related in a linear way. Below is a rough chart of MARA since bitcoin’s first dump to below 30k, with MARA in blue and Bitcoin in orange. You can see that very roughly, while bitcoin formed a clear downtrend, MARA and many other large, trusted miners rose out of that capitulation to form a clear uptrend. Why the divergence? Because despite bitcoins deflated value, mining is still profitable. Disgustingly profitable.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oom79jy0xnf71.png?width=1029&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63e5a28b7005f22046313ab3eed859e72b28a11c

Due to Chinese miners migrating and shutting down, the global hashrate for bitcoin has dropped an enormous amount. This means that the blocks are much easier to mine as there is essentially less competition. If we look at the profitability of mining over the last few years we can see that right now we are nearly as profitable as we were when bitcoin was $64,000 (j). What this means is that miners can continue to do what they have always done. Mine as much bitcoin as they can, covering expenses and operating costs, funding as much growth into new power and hashrate as they can, and HOD as much bitcoin as they can at these levels to then sell at increased bitcoin prices.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/psry7ft2xnf71.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33a9c854bdf2938115f1dab9c2dc9c4ce102b707

Lets try and calculate the insider and fund ownership, we can take a look at the prospectus and recent fintel data. The table below shows the insider, or fund, and how many shares they held as of the most recent filings. Market makers have not been included in this data.

Shares Outstanding = 25,415,984 (a) (As of April 26, 2021)

It is not possible to tell if a fund has sold since they have filed, and it is not possible to tell if they bought more. This is the only data we have to go off.

Insider ownership from Fintel (b) &amp; Prospectus (a)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/74iisdofxnf71.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b94755eca2dffab1000d20ef103fb7f9064e1ef4

Totaling all these shares, we get the following numbers.                                                                                

**21,172,532        Insiders + Funds**

**25,415,984        Shares Outstanding**

**4,243,452        Possible Float?**

From current Ortex data, the estimated short interest is 5,190,000 shares. This means the float is approx 7,700,000 shares using the Ortex data.

So using the Ortex data and considering insiders and funds part of the merger deal we get a float of 7.7 million shares

Adding up all institutions from recent filings we get a float of 4.3 million shares

It is impossible to know the actual float because we cannot determine if institutions buy/sell until they file. We can confirm that the float is somewhere between 4-8 million shares and recent Ortex data shows 5 million shares short.

The stock has had a massive spread between the bid / ask for weeks now which could mean that there is a supply shortage. We have also seen wild volatility swings in the stock that would suggest the same.

Let's take a look at when the shorts opened up a majority of their position.  

From the chart below, they started to short $SPRT since the merger announcement and kept adding through April to July

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0ivsk6ikxnf71.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cb14633609c583b002eedc02018e135bcc8a568

The utilization is currently maxed at 100% which means there are no more shares left to short.

Cost to borrow is increasing steadily which will pressure shorts, sometimes as high as 150-350% intraday.

The average age on loan is increasing which shows old shorts are refusing to cover and holding their positions opened months ago.

How can we be sure that the shorts are trapped and this has the potential to squeeze? Let's check some historical examples, Gamestop and AMC.

**GAMESTOP**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/88uzol0nxnf71.png?width=954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9e8f488c53d7a9a1e6dc8e86a697d2aa336b03c

We see the same trend in the three variables. Utilization maxed out, Average age on loan increasing, Cost to borrow increasing.

**AMC**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g4g7wklnxnf71.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20b1b23578c5aeedb14bae1d6fbf74b3e1c2ab42

And with AMC we see the same.

Let's compare $SPRT to its peers

**Ortex Data**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xto861ktxnf71.png?width=528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=363635920dfffd2460a142d7cd85f71d25aedeb5

It’s clear that for some reason, $SPRT is aggressively shorted compared to its peers. From a seeking alpha article (c)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0wj6wqvxnf71.png?width=626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77a534112401c92ce5a12591c29bcb44283842fb

However, $SPRT publicity seems on the uptick given the Greenidge article that was on the front page of [BBC this weekend.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-58020010&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1628226257680000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0lcweikKuHLrRtxxRQ9tsv) (l)

The video posted on youtube already has over 100,000 views (m)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3rmt3ifyxnf71.png?width=531&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9607f3914248a5767b38c9191f745a2924089d3c

It’s quite possible that the shorts knew this, and took advantage of a stock that was not well known and now they have trapped themselves.

From the article (c) the author also writes

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/drz48000ynf71.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7e2f6a57f2a36df5f13019cc58df5e19a869a47

&amp;#x200B;

$SPRT is currently and has been on the Threshold Securities list (d) many times in the past month due to Failure to Delivers, we usually see this in historical examples as well of stocks that squeeze.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3tmvr6b3ynf71.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ab6d6d443886b51c95d84d39ede750243aef4fc

&amp;#x200B;

Credit for this DD goes to Trancify (Thanks for letting me share)

Disclaimer, obviously this is not in any way financial advice. Just hoping to have a discussion and brainstorming session based off the data I see. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR of Greenridge Mining****:**

* Scalable, highly advantageous power supply owned and operated in house
* Resourceful and creative management team
* Large enough current hashrate to compete and be deserving of a multiple close to that of the big NA miners
* Respectable and reasonable hashrate growth prospects
* Highly investable company from an institutional standpoint (carbon neutral)

**TLDR of $SPRT Stock**

* Max utilization (100%, no more shares left to short)
* Borrow rate steadily increasing (pressuring shorts)
* Average age on loan increasing (shorts refusing to cover)
* Small float, High short interest, Short % of float somewhere between 65% and 122%
* Threshold Securities list from excessive “Failure To Delivers”
* Bitcoin Price Increasing should be good for miners

**Risk Factors**

* Merger is expected to close in Q3 2021 and they will announce a vote, risk of deal failing but high insider ownership of $SPRT and institutional ownership.
* Bitcoin Price
* Possible overvaluation unsure of fair value of stock

oyzahi,samdane7777,Listen to Me Extremely Carefully on The Second Portman Bill Amendment Banning DeFi,"&amp;#x200B;

Some of you may be tempted to go along with this last minute backstab by Portman and Warner where they completely remove protection for anyone in the space who is not a PoW miner or provider of software and hardware to secure private keys. 

You need to understand that the future of this industry is DeFi layer 2, whether that is on Bitcoin or something else. It is going to be a combination of layer 2 defi and lightning technology. There is a very clear ethos of censorship resistance for the most disenfranchised built into smart contract based systems, just as with bitcoin.

I struggle to make this argument to bitcoiners because of ignorance about how US law works. Ignorance specifically concerning the Patriot act, Facta, The banking secrecy act, Fatf,  SEC laws, and CFTC laws. Rest assured, they can and will carry these laws forward to use against any lightning application or DeFi product based on native bitcoin, any business operator or coder or facilitator of such technology, anywhere in the world, no matter citizenship can and will be federally prosecuted and extradited. If they find you they will extradite you. No one is safe.

This is a direct ban on DeFi. On smart contracts in general on permissionless systems, to ensure that the only smart contracts offered are on permissioned systems they have backdoors to, full patent control over. I.,e banks controlling them as de facto censorable Centralized Exchanges.

Do you want to live in a world with no DeFi? Do you only want centralized exchanges and the absolute guaranteed censorship on the global south that that entails? 

You cannot collect KYC on smart contract. They know this. They know it is impossible, and that it turns non compliant non us citizen into felony offenders. They will come for you. How do you think they intimidated Binance and Bitmex? How do you think they caught Mcafee? It is impossible for a normal smart contract to ban US citizens. Backends can't censor people.

This means it is illegal by default. *No one in the world can safely operate DeFi without KYC if this bill passes.* 

*No one in the world can safely operate DeFi without KYC if this bill passes.* 

*No one in the world can safely operate DeFi without KYC if this bill passes.* 

Once that passes, then they will pass ESG laws to censor miners and run them out of the country. They're trying to pick us off one by one. 

C A LL your Senator. Tell everyone, explain to your friends, get the message out. This is them using a hydrogen bomb on us with no time, input, or constructive nuance. It is totalitarian, poorly worded, and incoherent and shows the Whitehouse clearly doesn't know wtf they're talking about and the Treasury doesn't care if they ban technology to the point of strangling it in the crib despite knowing it will lose more tax then it collects.",1628223225,345,1

We pay taxes already.  We should be treated no different than stocks and other securities.  This is singling out the crypto space because we are not standing together to say NO.

This bill is filled with so much garbage that it is reprehensible to justify any part of it because we want a little shorter of a stick up our ass.

This bill will hurt the fabric of our nation from the very fundamental level of freedom of movement, the 4th amendment, the basic cost of goods, jobs at all levels of this industry, and the list goes on and on.

There is so much garbage, pay offs and useless nonsense in this bill that it staggers the mind how anyone can go along with it once you learn what is in it.

\- Stealing your private keys isn't the only way to gain access to your coins. A simple silly malicious code in a Google Chrome extension could replace your clipboard. Losing the funds you made sure to protect its private keys. 

\-If you're into multisig, a hacker could lock you out of your coins by replacing one of your xpub, as most hardware wallets do not have a way to verify them (Including Ledger). If you generate a multisig and made sure all xpub belong to you, create a Bitcoin address and keep using it to avoid that scenario.

We have to be aware of a fact that bitcoin doesn't have value on its own, rather we have developed its value by giving it importance in the financial world. Although physical elements such as gold likewise don't have any value on their own, it's just due to their rarity/scarcity by which the demand has risen. 

If we consider a **hypothetical** planet where gold's presence is more than wood, then the wood would be costlier than gold provided the fact that wood is a basic necessity for the inhabitants living on that planet. The entire game of price determination is in the hand of supply and demand, including few more factors.

How Bitcoin Price Is Determined

#### Factors deciding the price of Bitcoin:

* Supply
* Demand

There come sub-categories in Supply and Demand; Let's know what are these two terms used in day to day financial environment with its subcategories playing a crucial role in deciding a stable supply and demand for Bitcoin.  


## How Supply controls the price of Bitcoin? 

### 1. Finite Supply 

Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million, that is when the total number of Bitcoin reaches 21 millionths, no further Bitcoin would be created. It prevents Bitcoin from getting undervalued if in case the supply exceeds the demand.

In public, Ashton Kutcher, Elon Musk and Square Inc. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey brought the Twitter heat over a provision in the $1 trillion infrastructure bill seeking to expand and strengthen tax enforcement of crypto transactions. That helped prompt tens of thousands of followers to call members of Congress.

Behind the scenes, lobbyists, trade-group officials and executives at crypto companies hopped on Google Meet every few hours to coordinate Congressional outreach and tracked legislative contacts in a shared spreadsheet.

So I have a question for the community as we navigate this bull run. I am in between buying more Bitcoin or paying off my Bitcoin loan with Blockfi so I can own it outright. 

My thoughts are that if I will eventually have to payoff the Bitcoin loan as the agreement with Blockfi is a 12 months contract in which I have to pay off the loan ( I have until May’22). I have the money in cash and wanted to pay it off ( I refinanced and needed to pay off some credit cards to get approved so I borrowed from my Bitcoin to do it) but now being that Bitcoin is at this price and with the time horizon i have to payoff the Bitcoin loan, I am more interested in taking the risk and buying more. If it works out that Bitcoin rises than I can refinancing my Bitcoin loan at any time and just extend out the loan another year ( this only works if I have at least a LTV of less than 30% which can work if the Bitcoin Bull continues ). 

The catch is the Bitcoin Winter and having a loan during a bear market stinks and I rather be own my Bitcoin in the winter and borrow during the hot summer ( bear market vs bull market) 

Your thoughts, I have a pretty good idea what I will do but just thought I would ask the community your thoughts and gain more insight! Thanks",1628691443,24,1

p2dkel,_kr_saurabh,Bitcoin Price Evolution Analysis 08.11.2021,"Good morning to all readers.

Bitcoin price continues in an uptrend above the U$44,500 price area and above the 100 EMA (H1).

Bitcoin price in the past sessions after failing in its positive advances upwards from the $46,200 price area, went into negative corrections downwards from the $46,000, $45,000 price area and even testing the $44,668 price area.

It then returned with its positive moves upwards from the price areas of $45,000 and $46,000, where just now it has reached testing the $46,644 price area.

Now at the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is tracking in the U$ 46,142 price area, and just above the EMA 5 (H1).

The Bitcoin price is finding it difficult to give continuities upwards from the $46,200 price area at this time of writing.

The Bitcoin price needs to hold above the EMA 5 and above the $46,000 price area, to provide the continuities of the positive moves upwards from the $46,500 and $46,780 price areas.

If the Bitcoin price opens a candle below the U$ 46,000 price area or even below the EMA 5, negative corrections could emerge and go below U$ 45,500, where the Bitcoin price could enter the Ichimoku Green Cloud.

The Bitcoin price needs to stay above the Ichimoku Cloud to succeed with the continuities of positive developments upwards of U$ 46,500 and U$ 46,780.

Only with positive advances and consolidations above U$ 46,500, for the Bitcoin price to possibly go for the breakout tests of U$ 47,000; which will also be quite difficult at first.

Stronger corrections could appear below the U$ 46,000, U$ 45,000 and U$ 44,780 price areas.

A daily close has been made above the $45,580 price area.

For today, a daily close above the $45,220 price area will be important.

Ideally, a daily close above the $46,340 price area would be important.

Buyers remain in control of the situation, but continue to be under strong pressure from sellers who continue to attempt to create the downside below the $46,000 price area.

Buyers will have to try to positively move the price of Bitcoin upwards from the $46,360 and $46,600 price areas in the short term to try to get out of an area of downside risk created by sellers downwards from the $46,000 and $45,500 price areas.

If sellers get control of the situation below $46,000 and $45,500, they could continue the downside down to below $45,220 and $44,680.

Major areas of Resistance - U$46,500, U$46,880 and U$47,220.

Major Support areas - U$46,000, U$45,500 and U$44,780.

**H4 chart:**

Bitcoin price follows above the EMAs and above the Ichimoku Cloud.

The Bitcoin price needs to try to stay above the EMA 5 for the next few sessions, or even above the $46,000 price area.

If the Bitcoin price were to fail to make positive advances upwards from the $46,300 and $46,500 price areas negative corrections could emerge and go below the $45,780 and $45,500 price areas.

It follows the buyers attempts of the positive advances upwards from the $46,300 and $46,500 price areas, where a break of the $46,800, could go to the breakout tests of the $47,000 and $47,220, but they will have to stay above the $47,000 so that the sellers do not get in control of the situation and start to create the downside downwards from the $46,500 and $46,000.

The chart in H4 will follow the whole week to have a parameter of the Bitcoin price evolution. Only some adjustments will be made.

Resistances: U$ 46,624 // U$ 47,618 // U$ 48,189 // U$ 48,870.

Supports: U$ 45,961 // U$ 45,132 // U$ 44,414 // U$ 43,714.

[**https://www.tradingview.com/x/AtWWfZ8R/**](https://www.tradingview.com/x/AtWWfZ8R/)

**H1 chart:**

Bitcoin price follows above the EMAs and above the Ichimoku Cloud.

It will be extremely important for the Bitcoin price in the near term to give its consolidations continuities above the U$46,000 price area and above the EMA 5.

The Bitcoin price needs to move positively above the U$46,500 and U$46,780 price areas for the next few sessions.

If the Bitcoin price goes into trial exhaustion, negative corrections could emerge, and go below the U$ 46,000 and U$ 45,500 price areas.

Buyers remain in control of the situation, but continue to have great difficulty in continuing positive advances above $46,220.

If buyers fail in the short term with these positive advances above $46,220 and $46,500, sellers will take control of the situation and create the downside of the $46,000 and $45,500 price areas, where buyers will have to defend the $45,000 price area at all costs in order not to have major downside in this price area.

It follows the buyers in their attempts to keep the Bitcoin price above U$ 46,000, and at the same time they will have to give the continuities of the positive developments above U$ 46,500.

Resistances: U$ 46,277 // U$ 46,639 // U$ 46,985 // U$ 47,329.

Supports: U$ 46,007 // U$ 45,706 // U$ 45,538 // U$ 45,058.

p2cygq,Linus_Naumann,Unpopular opinion: Bitcoin did not get rid of the middle-man,"The  general narrative about Bitcoin seems to be, that Bitcoin got rid of  the middle-man, aka people that you have to pay money to process your  transactions and that can, in theory, censor you. Even the 2008 Bitcoin  white-paper is titled “Bitcoin: A **Peer-to-Peer** Electronic Cash System”, implying that any user can give their money directly to any other person.

My  hot-take: Bitcoin is NOT a peer-to-peer electronic cash system because  users are not able to directly send tokens to any other person. There is  still a middle-man in the system: The miners (in other projects:  stakers).

**Why miners are middle-men**

In  order to issue a transaction on the blockchain nodes (aka users) must  ask the miners to include their transactions into the next block. In  order for the miners to consider ones transaction, they have to be  bribed by offering money (transaction fees). This already means that  nodes CANNOT directly write their transaction into the blockchain - only  miners can do that. That’s the perfect definition of a middle-man:  Someone you HAVE TO pay in order for them to do something for you,  because you cannot do it yourself.

**Ok miners are middle-men, but they are decentralized, right?**

Keep  in mind: Miners are not crypto-enthusiasts, anarcho-capitalists or  fighters for financial freedom. They are businesses. Professional mining  today requires initial investments of hundreds of millions of Dollars  to even start business. This money comes from rich investors that don’t  necessarily have any interest in the “freedom crypto” narrative, but  only in return of investment (ROI).

&amp;#x200B;

Fig.1:  Recent news about Mara-pool investing $120 mil. into mining hardware.  This pool was famous for following US money-laundering-laws by censoring  blacklisted addresses. Source:  https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/marathon-120-million-30000-bitcoin-miners

These  businesses pay large teams of professionals to set up and maintain  complex mining-rigs at several locations around the globe and negotiate  prices and regulations with local or national power-suppliers. All these  jobs are again not done by freedom-fighters or anything like that, but  by regular professionals, as they work in every other company.  Small-scale mining by private people plays virtually no role in todays  crypto landscape and you can bet that the process of professionalization  will only continue over time, as long as there is profit to be made.

So  we have here a completely normal, non-idealistic new market emerging.  How do emerging markets ALWAYS behave? They consolidate to become more  profitable. Big and profitable businesses buy smaller, less profitable  businesses or fusion with large competitors. The market centralizes.

Today  there are already only 4 mining pools that together create about 51,5%  of the total hash-power of the Bitcoin network. Two of these pools  (antpool.com and f2pool.com) being managed by one umbrella entity,  Bitmain.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img u2ri4zxccqg71...*

Four  mining pools control 51% of Bitcoins hashpower. Two of them are  controlled by the same umbrella company (Bitmain). Source:  https://miningpoolstats.stream/bitcoin

Have  you ever heard of the Nakamoto Coefficient? It is the minimal number of  validators of a decentralized network that together could control the  network (in Bitcoin: create 51% of the total hash-rate). This means, the  Nakamoto Coefficient of Bitcoin is 3 Literally 3. Any entity that can  control these 3 mining-companies either politically, financially via  back-door deals or by any other means, can effectively control and  censor the network. This number will presumably only go lower over time,  as business consolidates.

**Censorship on the Bitcoin blockchain – How mining companies can be politically controlled**

Just  google “Mara pool”. This US-based mining pool claimed to be fully  compliant to US money laundering laws by censoring transactions that  involve **blacklisted**  addresses. This means that any transaction coming from or going towards  such an address was not considered in blocks created by Mara pool,  independent from how much transaction-fees they offered. If you thought  Bitcoin is free from censorship, check again: censorship on the  blockchain is already happening TODAY. Blacklisted addresses had no  other way to go forward than to wait until another, not censoring,  mining pool created a new block, that hopefully included their  transaction.

Mara pool recently  stepped away from this policy and started processing all kinds of  transaction again, but this example shows cleary: Miners are business  and businesses underlie governmental control. If you want to buy energy  on the scale of smaller countries, you will have to negotiate with  government-controlled power-suppliers. As governments catch up on the  topic, professional mining will eventually become a fully regulated  business, just as any other – most likely including extensive  money-laundering laws. First bills are already proposed in the US: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/white-house-backs-senators-pushing-for-stricter-crypto-reporting-rules.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/white-house-backs-senators-pushing-for-stricter-crypto-reporting-rules.html)

While  controlled mining-pools with less than 51% of hash-power are mostly  just a nuisance, once they reach more than 51% (don’t forget the  Nakamoto coefficient of 3…), Bitcoin will be completely censored.

**The problem: Leader-based DLT**

It  doesn’t matter if your protocol runs with PoW or PoS: As long as the  protocol is leader-based, true decentralization will never be possible.  In fact, the exact method of finding a leader only determines WHO will  be your middle-man: **Corporations (miners) or rich people (stakers).**  The average user remains powerless in this system and can only hope,  that the middle-man is decentralized enough to not bother him.

**The only way to really get rid of the middle-man: Leaderless DLT**

The problem is fundamental to leader-based DLT and can only be tackled by **fundamentally**  questioning the setup of modern protocols. What we need is not  authoritaritan (leader-based) consensus, but COOPERATIVE and DEMOCRATIC  consensus (leaderless) instead!

As  of today, the only project that at least tries to tackle this problem  is IOTA by inventing a leaderless consensus based on their research in  parallel-reality based ledger states and on-tangle voting (aka  “Multiverse consensus”). Although value transactions on the mainnet are  still centralized, their research-oriented IOTA 2.0 DevNet is already  fully decentralized and completely leaderless – every user, every node,  can write his or her transactions directly into the shared database  (some explanation here. Watch the DevNet running live here: [https://v2.iota.org/visualizer](https://v2.iota.org/visualizer)).  Although it is not yet feature-complete, the IOTA foundation claims  that all research hurdles have been overcome and that only  implementation and testing is left before the mainnet can be fully  decentralized too. If this is true, it would mean the dawn of the first,  actually decentralized “peer-to-peer electronic money” that Satoshi  envisioned.

What happened in short: on the 8th of June a large amount of btc was stolen through a phishing operation. The weeks before, every time I tried to connect my Trezor, I was redirected to a fake copy page of Trezor ( without any warning, I was not aware of being on a fake site). From this site it was impossible to do any transactions unless  you would reset the Trezor by filling out your recovery seed. I refused weeks long but on that very day I somehow did. Foolish, I know, I don't need comments to rub that in again.

I have been looking everywhere to find more victims of these phishers but no result. So my question is: are there any people out there who were robbed in the same way?

I am desperate, the stolen money was the backbone of our permaculture project in Spain ([backtolatierra.com](https://backtolatierra.com)) and that is now endangered. It was also all my savings and my pension.

Been playing around with lightning it's super cool how you can send stuff instantly and almost for free. However I do have some big questions regarding lightning network going into the future that I hope someone here can answer.

So I understand how lightning can help bitcoin scale, but there is still the problem of funding your channels. Which at the moment is pretty cheap with bitcoin transactions cost being low. But let's say bitcoin gets to a million USD at some point, I can imagine the fees on the blockchain getting quite significant. if it's going to cost $50 to to a tx on the main chain to fund a lightning channel, how will that work? Because that will be completely unaffordable on poorer regions of the world. Or is the idea that lightning will take up the majority of transaction volume in a few years and that bitcoin blocks will never be at capacity?..  In the latter scenario.. how will mining remain profitable? With block rewards going down, miners are mostly paid through mining fees, but if those remain low, then what is their incentive?...

Also, in a scenario where bitcoin would get above 1 million, 1 satoshi will be more than $0.01, in that scenario, won't routing fees on lightning get very expensive? If I have to jump through a couple of nodes I'd still pay a couple of cents for my payment, which will make micro payments impossible, or have their already been talks of changing the denomination and adding some zero's to it? (but i can understand how something like that would be hard to get consensus on)

Hopefully someone can address these questions.",1628670484,14,1

p28r9m,Hewlbern,"To understand Bitcoin, you have to understand Power","Bitcoin is about stopping corrupt institutions, being able to be in control of the value of your labour, and potentially a new social structure that can extricate itself from our older totalitarian ones (i.e., American Imperialism, Military industrial complex etc).

I'm 30 and live in a first world country in a privileged job as a software engineer. And yet, when i talk to the people around me it's so clear that even the privileged are tremendously disillusioned. This isn't just something I feel - there's been multiple studies of this, the level of pessimism across the entire industrial world is extraordinary. In the United States, for example, about three-quarters of the population thinks that the future is going to be ""objectively-worse"" than the past. About half the American population thinks that both political parties just ought to be disbanded, they're useless. People feel hopeless. Why? They don't see a solution, or any alternatives. Even at the depths of the 1930s Depression, which was objectively worse than today, people felt like things were going to get better.

When you have no control over how we transmit value and hold it, it's easy to understand why people feel this way. Our economy has stopped growing since the 1970's, except in computers which became what it is today because of the US's military industrial complex. Science isn't funded unless it relates to war, and is funded by the pentagon. Countries like Nicaragua who move towards a more benevolent model of government are undermined and destroyed by the US to ensure a model of something better doesn't exist. Hell, Israel and Palestine in the 1970's were ready to make a two state solution - the US vetoed it, because Israel is a military outpost for them, so they can exert their power over the middle east. The US dollar system is the chain around the necks of all of us, within and outside the US itself. We have slowly become more and more indoctrinated and enslaved as the power of our political institutions has grown larger and more despotic.

The future of history under this system is bleak. More money printing, to fund more wars, to maintain the wealthy's power at the expense of the working people. Surveillance, wage slavery and the isolation that comes with this modern economy and the instability of it's economic outcomes for us.

These people in positions of power don't care about you. Not because they are monsters. But simply because this is all they understand. This is what seems like the best way we can organize ourselves together.

Bitcoin changes this dynamic.

Today, there's so many of us working hard at a job we hate, just to go home and watch tv, to see an advert for mcdonalds that tells them they'll feel happy if they eat a burger, that goes an eats at mcdonalds and spends the money in there pocket that is quickly inflating away into the elites of this world back accounts.

Tomorrow, Bitcoin can give us a chance to retain the value of our work. We have the potential for a world where someone works at a job they love, for less hours, doing something they want to do, and having the time to just cook food and think for themselves. y

We don't need an economy built on nike's and mcdonalds and warfare.

We need an economy built on things that are intrinsically valuable to the best parts of being human.

We need it before it's too late. Before these despotic structures kill us all, either through more entrenched social divisions and slavery, or the tragedy of commons issue that is climate change.

Starting with a 24 word seed phase:

1. Memorize words 1-12 using a mnemonic technique

2. Write words 7-24 in a paper wallet

3. Store words 1-6 &amp; 13-24 in a cloud storage service

With this scheme, you need any 2 of the 3 methods to access funds, so if any part were lost/destroyed/forgotten I can still recover and create a new wallet. I'll always use my brain wallet as the first key and will alternate between using 2 &amp; 3 to ensure that I still have access to them. 

I will use no other obfuscation/encryption methods - I won't even encrypt the words stored in the cloud. The odds of me losing/forgetting such additional layers is higher than the odds of someone both hacking my cloud account and stealing my paper wallet. By my understanding, if someone steals one set, brute forcing the remaining 6 words would not be feasible.

p640h4,Morphius9201,A Crypto prediction bot that uses real time data,"We're currently in the BETA stage of a chat bot that provides insights to over 5000 different coins including BTC. Its aim is to alert users when certain coins are on the rise.

The system doesn’t utilize historical data or conventional data sources. Instead we use real time information from Reddit, BTC Forum and twitter. The bot connects to the APIs of the mentioned platforms. It looks for keywords in the posts of over 5000 coins, analyses the quality and quantities/ frequencies of similar posts and then reverts an alert of that specific coin with potential performance.

Heres an example of the system in action for HEX:

[ HEX Predicitons 13-18\/7\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/uxtno4689xh71.png?width=1291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b2a834f062e568742187495fc8631241290f9e9)

Top Graph (G1) represents cryptocurrency HEX value in USD off coinbase.com Bottom Graph (G2) represents our systems predictions regarding HEX performance. Both graphs are portrayed between the dates of 13/07/2021 - 18/07/2021 at day intervals. Off G2 our system notifies us via Alert 1 on the 13/07/2021 that HEX is on the rise. The forecast of HEX performance is confirmed via a second notification to the user - Alert 2. Both alerts within the 12 hour period provide solid indication of HEX rise in value. From G1 on the 13/07/2021 its value in USD is $0.086. By the 18/07/2021 HEX is valued at $0.173 equating to approximately 100% increase. At that point any investments made during G2 first alerts wouldve effectively doubled the users HEX investment.

If you'd like to see more coin performances head to: [https://imgur.com/a/1CTgcqx](https://imgur.com/a/1CTgcqx)

We don’t encourage the bot to solely be used on its own. Instead, we recommend coupling these alerts with your current understanding of the specific coin to help you make better investment decisions and offer you potential investment opportunities.

We don’t think this bot is the bees knees and I'm sure they'll be plenty of improvements we can make to it. What we're looking for is for some objective opinions on the platform, its results and possible advice on what else will help. In return, users will have access to the system. Please note, you'll need a telegram account to partake with the service.

3. [Strike](https://strike.me), currently US and El Salvador only, is a great way to pay lightning invoices with fiat. Yes, those lightning invoices can be your own from a different wallet, effectively buying bitcoin incredibly cheaply.
4. [Lastbit](https://lastbit.io/), which also acts as an on-/off-ramp, and even has the option for a bitcoin-backed debit card. EU only.
5. [Bottlepay](https://bottlepay.com/), which also works like Strike and Lastbit. EU only.
6. Default [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/). When using their default LndHub instance, it's custodial. See below for non-custodial options.

There are a few really simple non-custodial options:

1. [Breez](https://breez.technology), which handles channel management for you. Has a few interesting built-in features.
2. [Phoenix](https://phoenix.acinq.co/), which is very similar to Breez.
3. [Muun](https://muun.com/), which is probably the most seamless on-chain + lightning wallet out there.
4. [Blixt](https://blixtwallet.github.io/), which is incredibly feature-rich. This requires (or more aptly, *allows* you) to manually manage a full node on your phone. Also building in support for Lightning Addresses.

Then there is the ultimate in self-sovereignty. Running your own node:

Popular node implementations:

1. [lnd](https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd), developed by [Lightning Labs](https://lightning.engineering).
2. [c-lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning), developed by [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com/lightning/).
3. [eclair](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair), developed by [ACINQ](https://acinq.co).

You can get a few nice plug&amp;play solutions to simplify setup:

1. [RaspiBlitz](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz).
2. [Umbrel](https://getumbrel.com/).
3. [myNode](https://mynodebtc.com/).

After setting up your own node, you can connect as many mobile wallets that support it as you want:

1. [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io), with a custom LndHub on your own node.
2. [Zeus](https://zeusln.app), which works with or without LndHub.
3. [Zap](https://zaphq.io/), developed by the guy behind Strike (Note that the iOS version is discontinued and has a security flaw).",1629206128,87,1

ov9mq5,New_start_new_life,What happens to miner's reward who mined a block that became stale.,"We know that blockchain will select the longest chain when there are two conflicting chains being propagated through the network. Lets imagine that two block are mined on opposite ends of the earth. Then one of them adds a new block faster. That latter chain is eventually chosen as the ""true"" chain. The new block on the shorter chain becomes stale and its transactions are returned to the meme pool. It is that latter one that I have questions about. 

1. How long does it usually take before a longer version of the chain is fully propagated through the network and the shorter one is discarded?
2. Most importantly, a miner who earlier mined a new block on the shorter chain should have been rewarded in new bitcoin. What happens to his reward once his block becomes stale? Does he basically get the bitcoin and then his reward is reversed? 

* If so, how long should a miner who mined a new block wait before being sure that his block is on the longest chain and will not become stale?

Tried to report a Bitcoin theft (malware hack) to the police...sigh

The initial application had to be online due to covid restrictions. I was kinda hoping they already had a system in place by now to redirect this to a more dedicated unit or at least that they would gather similar cases so they could maybe find like a common thread, but after the initial e-mail response, all hope of getting anything ever back was already gone xD. The head inspector of the local police department e-mailed that the report seemed ""very technical"" and it might be better to come to the department itself. I'm talking about a major city in a wealthy western country by the way. 

At the police department they heard of bitcoin before, but I still had to explain the very basics before even beginning to explain how they managed to get a hold of my funds. 

Guess we're still early... :)

PS: I knew the chances of recovering anything were slim, but I wanted to report anyway because of possible tax implications and to increase awareness.

ov91ip,j4kz,Why we need Bitcoin - Part 2: PayPal sucks,"Seriously. Have you ever tried to actually solve a problem with PayPal? It's unbelievable. They literally think it's acceptable to just fully lock you out of your account at any time and for any reason. Then when you call support, you can be on hold for over 2 hours and sometimes they don't even fix the problem.

Almmost a year ago I was locked out of my account and forced to call them. After spending *over 2 hours* (yes, really) on hold, I finally got through. All this was just to update some security BS or something like that.  Literally the only option they give you is to call them, and then while you're on hold, the bot keeps telling you how you should just go online to solve your dumbass problem.

Then, a few days ago, PayPal decided for no clear reason that it would lock me out of my account unless I input a phone number for a verification code. Nothing changed, nothing special happened except possibly that I logged in with ExpressVPN left on potentially once or twice. Either way, I had no idea this would even be an issue and was given no warning whatsoever about any security alerts or anything whatsoever. Just all of a sudden a locked account with a screen that tells me to ""Input a phone number."" 

My account is Canadian but I've been living out of the country for years now, and perhaps that was why it just said ""Invalid phone number"" whenever I'd try to input mine and not my old Canadian one.

So I called support. The first guy asked me to verify the name, email, address, etc. associated with the account, and I did. Then he said something along the lines of ""the system can't verify you right now, please call again in 48 hours."" Lol what? I said I could even list all the recent transactions I made. Apparently that didn't help and the system just couldn't validate me. He told me to try again in 48 hours. 

I asked how that makes sense and that I don't have time to wait 48 hours; I need to use the funds in my PayPal. He said there was nothing he could do and finally agreed to transfer me to his supervisor.

After spending 45 minutes on hold just to be transferred to a supervisor, the supervisor comes on and tells me (I'm paraphrasing but this is what she was doing, genuinely) that it is my fault that this happened because I didn't update my phone number in my account previously. She did directly tell me it was my fault this happened. It's my fault that I lost access to my account and all the funds in it because I may have (again, not even sure if I did do this; just guessing) logged in with a VPN on once or twice and didn't update my phone number previously.

I asked how that's justification for locking me out of my account randomly and without warning and asked her to just remove the lock now that she has me on the phone and I can verify all the details pertaining to the account.

She says she *cannot undo the lock*, there's nothing she can do, and that she's ""here to educate you."" She then continues to tell me that it's my fault for not updating my phone number when I could have and that *there's nothing she can do; I can't access the account* and should try again later in hopes that PayPal will stop prompting me to input a number. LOL

I asked ""Who locked me out of my account? Me or you?"" And she says ""You"" because I didn't input my phone number correctly and may have logged in once with ExpressVPN left on.

Absolutely insane. Imagine thinking that the system as it is OK and we don't need Bitcoin. Fuck PayPal.",1627744923,15,1

BLOCKCHAIN
A shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a network.

BITCOIN (BTC)
A decentralized peer to peer digital currency in which a record of transactions is maintained by network participants and new units of currency are generated by the computational solution of mathematical problems.
•​Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins, credible estimates predict the total supply will be closer to 19 million due to users losing their private key.  
•​A unit of Bitcoin is 1 BTC the smallest generally recognized unit of account for BTC is a Satoshi or SAT which is 1/100,000,000 of a BTC.

BLOCK
A file that contains a “permanent” record of transactions (payer X sends Y bitcoins to payee Z) that when verified by nodes is added to the BTC block chain.
•​Roughly every 10 minutes, on average, a new block including transactions is appended to the block chain through mining

MINING/Block Reward
The processing of transactions in the digital currency system, in which the records of current Bitcoin transactions, known as a blocks, are added to the record of past transactions, known as the blockchain.

HASH RATE
The Measure of a Miner’s Performance – the number of calculations a miner can perform in 1 second as it works to find a solution for a block.

BLOCK REWARD
The amount of BTC “awarded/earned” for successfully mining/verifying a block.
•​The current block reward is 6.25 BTC
•​After 210,000 blocks are mined (approximately every 4 years), the block reward halves and will keep on halving until the block reward per block becomes 0

DIFFICULTY ADJUSTMENT
The network dynamically adjusts the difficulty of the math problem that needs to be solved to create a new block every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks, to maintain a target block time of 10 minutes.
 
 
INTRO:
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer monetary network which utilizes cryptography and aligned incentives to store and transmit value without a centralized authority. It utilizes a proof of work protocol to maintain the distributed ledger (blockchain), process transactions, and secure the network. To participate in the protocol, miners must expend resources (computing time and electricity) to solve a dynamically adjusted math problems (hash) which once solved is verified by all other network participants and added to the blockchain. To incentives miners to expend these resources, participants can pay transaction fees and each block that is created rewards its creator with new bitcoin (currently 6.25 BTC per block).

MINING:
On average a block is produced every 10 minutes, 144 blocks per day, which results in 900 bitcoins being mined per day until the next halving. These mining dynamics create a market incentive to run the most efficient commuters with the least expensive electricity possible, thus maximizing profit.
The computers used to mine bitcoin are called ASICs (application specific integrated circuit) and are designed specifically to solve the bitcoin hash to create the next block and win the block reward. Due to the dynamic difficulty adjustment of the protocol the computing power needed to have a high probability of winning a block has went up exponentially since 2008 and if likely to continue. This forces miners to upgrade hardware and drive down the cost of electricity.",1628718431,4,1

I'm still rather new to bitcoin/cryptocurrency and one of the main arguments for it I often read about is that it is prone to inflation, as there is only a limited amount of coins. Now I just stumble over this:

&gt; In fact, there are only 21 million bitcoins that can be mined in total.1 Once miners have unlocked this number of bitcoins, the supply will be exhausted. However, it's possible that bitcoin's protocol will be changed to allow for a larger supply.

The point is, Bitcoin mining is not an indefinite process and the total amount of energy poured into Bitcoin due to its mining will eventually be a finite figure. 

Also, I understand that Bitcoin's energy expenditure does not scale with the number of transactions carried out, so the energy previously used in mining won't somehow shift towards transaction validation after mining ceases.

Now, whether genuinely concerned or not, about Bitcoin's energy use, why don't environmental activists and governments take all that into picture, that energy flow into Bitcoin due to its mining process will eventually cease?

(The red and green arrows are the Aurox Indicator and they  recommend a buy or a sell. Red indicates where you should sell and green  indicates a buy zone.)   


Good morning  everyone! I have the daily for BTC pulled up after a pretty flat weekend  for Bitcoin in terms of gains. We have managed to keep the 100 EMA  below us and that is a win in my opinion. The ascent up the chart  recently was seemingly quelled over the weekend but some think this is  just the calm before the rocket ship. Let me explain...

The  reason people are thinking we could go up from here is the fact we  broke some serious resistance on the way up to 42k and now that former  resistance is now support. Classic TA. But once you break an indicator  like the 100 EMA in this instance a retest is quite common. That is  exactly what is occurring as I type. The retest either succeeds and we  make a break for 42k once again... Or we drop.

If  you play your cards right you can make some money here. Okay so if we  break 42k I believe fomo will come into play which means we will likely  see some decent gains. If we lose the 100 EMA support we will likely  drop.  There is not much in terms of support between the 100 EMA and the  50 MA. Plus just below the 50 MA is the gap from 2 weekends ago. 32,500  - 34,500. This could play out too... Just be ready for anything.

So  real resistance we need to beat is 42k (historical resistance/support)  the 200 MA (blue line) If we can manage to get above these indicators I  think we have another moon shot on our hands. Otherwise bring a shovel  because we are likely going to be waste deep in it. Have a good day  folks. WTFDIK??

[https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/price/](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/price/)

This is the best writeup I've been able to find and it has charts to go along with it. Goes back to 2009!

**Some gems from the link**:

1. *The BitcoinTalk forum member NewLibertyStandard set up New Liberty Standard Exchange, and another forum user - Sirius - sent him 5050 BTC in exchange for $5.02 through PayPal. This puts the first recorded price at which Bitcoin exchanged hands at $0.00099/BTC.*
2. *Bitcoin's price never topped $1 in 2010! Its highest price for the year was just $0.39!*
3. *On February 9th, 2011, BTC reached a value of USD$1.00 for the first time ever. A few months later, in June, the price of one Bitcoin hit $10, then $30 on Mt. Gox. This represented a 100x appreciation since the beginning of the year, when the price of Bitcoin hovered around $0.30.*

As for me... I was investigating mining Bitcoin sometime in 2010. I vividly remember the price of Bitcoin at the time of my research being 5 cents! My thoughts at the time were, ""That's gonna take awhile to buy a graphics card with Bitcoin."" and ""If I mine on these University computers I'll probably get in trouble for the electric bill."" I ended up not mining and probably would have sold in order to buy a GPU anyway, but GOD DAMN IT!

Edit: Forgot to mention that at the time I had control of 50 Intel Core2Duo systems for about 3 hours every night. Probably would have been a decent mining rate.",1627915191,3,1

owf44l,Mydaddysdiaper,Healthy Skepticism,"I've recently decided to allocate 90% of my portfolio to Bitcoin after doing an extensive amount of research. 

In my eyes, Bitcoin is money because it is continuously becoming a better medium of exchange and store of value:

* Medium of Exchange - Usability and accessibility will increase for nontechnical people as fintech companies like Square and PayPal continue to push crypto adoption on online platforms. The lightning network will increase transaction throughput as Bitcoin inevitably becomes more popular.
* Store of Value - Bitcoin is extremely volatile in the short-term which causes some to believe that it does not store value well. Looking at the long term, all fiat currencies will continue to devalue at an increased rate while Bitcoin should become increasingly stable and more valuable as adoption continues

I have also tried to poke any holes in Bitcoiners' logic and honestly assess the risk of investment. Here is where I currently stand with my top objections:

* 51% Attack - This was my #1 concern until miners moved out of China. Unless a single authoritarian government contains the majority of processing power in the network, I find this scenario unlikely
* Hacking - Untampered hardware wallets will always secure  your Bitcoin, but is it possible that a hack on a Coinbase or Gemini erodes the faith of the larger community and causes enough panic to collapse the system? This seems unlikely since these hot wallets are still relatively secure compared to other potential victims of hackers.
* Producers of nodes concentrated in China - Is it possible that the Chinese install malware in there nodes (genuinely wondering, I'm no computer expert). Or what if China decides to kill the companies that produce nodes? Will companies from more trustworthy nations produce nodes to the extent China currently is?
* A return to sound government money - lol

I believe in Bitcoin and I love the conviction and optimism of the Bitcoin community. That being said, I believe we should speak more frequently about the risks involved. Please feel free to poke holes any any of these arguments, or give insight into your top concerns with Bitcoin adoption or long term stability of the network. I believe transparency about the risks will help the addition of newcomers and strengthen the community as a whole.",1627912821,57,1

p0cidu,FrivolerFridolin,Rejection against the recommendation to DCA and HODL in this sub,"Something has changed in this forum – maybe since r/wallstreetbets blew up.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin had indeed a nice surge the past three weeks and we all know how fast and long lasting that moves can be but for example expecting a $50k price today and betting on it is just stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion it’s a good thing to DCA, HODL and don’t care about daily (or even weekly) prices. Being patient and not excessively emotional is a good thing. (That worked really well for me in the past)

&amp;#x200B;

But I don’t care anymore what others are doing. I used to like the Bitcoin community but as I said before something has changed. If you like to gamble and to submit to your greed, then do so.

p0cb5z,Leader92,Help me refute my economist Professor in claiming BTC is not good as currency.,"I went into a heated argument with my professor the other day about Bitcoin. His theory is as follows: 

""Currency should be treated as a unit of measure. pretty much like the mile or pounds. We use these units to measure weight and distance, and we use the dollar to measure value. Imagine living in a world where there is a defined, pre-determined unit of miles, we wouldn't be able to measure distance. Units of measures need to be infinite to be feasible in measuring distance, dimension, and value.""

He continues : 

""Take gold, for example, as it resembles Bitcoin in being scarce and difficult to produce. Gold was the reason for the depression because that was an era of industrial revolutions. Countries' GDPs were getting high and the source to measure value, gold, was in limited units. So this medium of exchange could not keep up with the increasing products in circulation, therefore, prices of products and services decreased.""

**Here is my counter-argument:** 

**If the issue is that we need enough ""unites of value measure"" then a single bitcoin can be divided into 100million units. if we take all Bitcoin in existence (21m) and multiply it by the smallest unit of a bitcoin (100m),  we then have 2.1 quadrillion units. All money in existence today is worth 500 trillion. Bitcoin, if a single sat is set to one dollar, is enough to liquidate the global economy 4 times.**

I'd like to get some advice on how we should handle wallets (to keep the BTC sent by User B), and also recommendations for third parties that might handle it better than us.

I think I should generate a new wallet for each new user (as opposed to managing/rotating a set of wallets we own). So User A signs up, I generate a wallet. For each transaction, I should generate a new receiving address. So User A creates a new transaction, so I use the public key to generate a new receiving address. User B sends BTC to this address.

I'm pretty sure I can check the funds received by a recipient address, so that's fine (I just check the ledger I guess, or poll some third party).

If I'd like to make the service available globally (i.e. different currencies), I'm guessing I would need to look at multiple platforms for wallet management, not just one?

Maybe page reloaded or i missed captcha and it reset or when you misclick on a dropdown bar is stays as the default option (Shit idk, I'm having a mental freak out haha) The address that I entered IS my USDC address for Coinbase, but because the dropdown box where you select your asset for funding was GUSD it obviously did not make it through.  Blockfi has been responsive on the phone and through support but has only directed me to Coinbase to recoup the funds. Coinbase sent me an email response effectively telling me to screw off. I don't know what the hell to do as I do not have the assets to recoup from this and I'm pretty sure blockfi is going to leave me hanging.

p0r6oy,slavic17husky,Convert BTC gains in stable coins instead of fiat to buy the dip.,"I have saw some people who are taking out there gains from BTC or ETH to stablecoins I stead of selling just to fiat money. 

Example: I want to take out some gains on BTC I sell it to fiat money. I wait for a dip and buy the crypto I am interested. 
So I will pay 2 times fee for the sell to fiat and buy the dip. 

But some people convert the BTC gains to a stablecoin. Wait for the dip and swap to the coin they wanna buy. 

In my eyes both is a CGT event but if you swap you exactly sell and buy in the same second so you pay twice fee for the sell of BTC and buy of the stable coin. 
Then when you swap the stablecoin to buy a dip you pay again twice fee. 
So isn’t it smarter just sell to fiat and buy the dip with fiat. So you pay just 2 times fee. 

Or do I miss something. 
Instead of having the stablecoin I have the fiat on my exchange waiting to buy a dip. 
The amount stays the same in both cases. 
And both are CGT.

I was given a notice that my funds were no longer going through. I proceeded to call my bank the following day. They again gave me the go around saying they are not sure what is wrong.. after several minutes of talking.. the lady finally said she noticed there is a travel restriction on my account. I told the bank to lift the restriction and to up my spending limit to 5k a day and told them that I would be making big transaction to **** account.

p0ovqf,sunyining6688,How Governments Mining Bitcoin Could De-Risk Cryptocurrency," There’s seemingly a constant conversation, particularly with those involved in legacy financial institutions, about how cryptocurrency can be – to a certain degree – “de-risked.” Can government mining, or merely taxation structure, address this? While many traditional financial players that are not crypto-first, but are crypto-adjacent (take Visa as a prime example) are relying on the use of stablecoins like USDC as their main pillar of transactions, there are other conversations happening about how crypto risk can be managed. Government bodies are always looking to get a piece of the pie; a large pitch of the state-by-state legalization of marijuana or sports gambling throughout the U.S. was the substantial tax revenue that states wouldn’t be seeing otherwise. In fact, just last month the Wall Street Journal published a piece outlining how governments across the globe are getting more involved in mining royalties and taxation, including a new silver and gold tax for mines in Nevada that went into effect last month. Taxation is the root of the domestic discussion around crypto for U.S. policy as we speak. Government Mining: Is It Feasible? Feasibility is of course, the first question to come to mind. Would governmental bodies have the capacity and know-how to truly execute crypto mining? The red tape is flowing. However, some argue that in fact, Bitcoin (and broader crypto) mining is becoming more and more adjacent to the likes of utilities and traditional mineral mining. Independent investment writer Natasha Che argued that indeed, crypto mining could be “the easiest way to de-risk Bitcoin.” Che makes some apt comparisons between the industries at that, noting that all of the aforementioned categories: need heavy capex investments have large economies of scale and have strategic geographic importance Che goes on to show that Bitcoin mining and gold mining actually have very similar geographical distributions. Furthermore, state involvement actually ends up getting deeper than sheer taxation. Che notes that because governments often own underlying natural resources and land, government bodies can directly control substantial portions of mineral mining resources. The same applies for utilities like gas, water, and electric as well. For many regions across the globe, there are more publicly-owned utilities than privately-owned ones, Che shows. The final point Che presents is that arguably the most intensive resource needed to mine Bitcoin, or any crypto really, is capital. “From both revenue and public-good motives, there are strong reasons for governments to get into the game, by either increasing taxes and royalties on miners, or by owning mining facilities directly,” says Che. Feasibility aside, the biggest pushback here from long-time crypto advocates has been that this arguably runs against Bitcoin’s very decentralized nature. However, with increased exposure and adoption over time, some degree of the discussion here is inevitable. As the old adage goes, “life, death and taxes.” Bitcoin and crypto taxation has been a focal point in domestic legislative discussions in the United States recently. | Source: BTC-USD on TradingView.com Related Reading | Bitcoin Accumulation Pattern Shows Rally Might Only Be In Its Early Stages Government Shifts: Looking Forward At the core of the broader mining and geographic discussion is of course, the long-time dependence of miners existing across China. However, the tides seem to be turning given China’s policy shifts towards mining, as our team covered just last week. Before China’s substantial crackdown, however, the share of miners throughout the country was already on the decline. Shouldn’t governments be looking to take advantage of what is seemingly an open door for a strong geographic distribution of crypto miners? Despite no substantial discussions domestically about crypto mining on a government level, there has been an increase in U.S. miners during the departure of miners from China. Arcane Research found that from September 2020 to April 2021, U.S. Bitcoin hashrate increased roughly four-fold, from 4.1% to 16.8%. Many would argue that government involvement in mining could allow for better usage of clear energy to mine, better processes and opportunities, and more – at the expense of taxation to government bodies.  Despite the apparent radio silence from most federal and state legislatures, government controlled funds could be holding an open door to crypto: earlier last month, our team also wrote about the New Jersey Pension Fund investing in two Bitcoin mining behemoths – Riot Blockchain and Marathon Digital Holdings. Furthermore, Wyoming state representatives have been vocal about being as crypto-friendly as possible. State senator Cynthia Lummis has been one of the loudest pro-crypto political figures recently, tweeting last month that “if you are in the #bitcoin mining space, please reach out. We WANT you in Wyoming.” Of course, we can’t forget about the tech and crypto hub that is constantly in the conversation too – Miami, FL. Could state-managed pension funds in the U.S., and broader political advocates, be the first entry for more formal governmental integration with crypto mining? Possibly, but we’ll need to hold our horses until at least more mainstream crypto ETFs find their way to mainstream markets (which are currently in the works). Even then, we’ll likely still have more miles to cover down this path. Arguably the biggest question mark around it all? How does this impact risk levels compare to past and present days? There’s no hard and fast answers here, though many believe that with increased acceptance, institutional buy-in, and a splash of governmental regulation, mainstream cryptos will likely see more “de-risking” as reliability on them increases.

Today, the market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market exceeds $2 trillion. This incredible wealth creation has benefitted individuals, not institutions, particularly the unbanked and disenfranchised. It is a beautiful progressive story.

Your voters own Bitcoin. A recent Harris Poll survey found that 30 percent of Black and 27 percent of Hispanic investors in the United States own cryptocurrency, compared to 17 percent of white investors. The same survey found that most Black and Hispanic Americans consider Bitcoin’s decentralization to be a positive attribute. Is it any surprise that people who have been most oppressed by the state find appeal in a stateless money? Your voters are rejecting the legacy financial system because it fosters economic and racial injustice and perpetuates wealth inequality.

Throughout the globe, most people have suffered through currency collapses. As an example, Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, Russia, Thailand, Turkey, Indonesia, South Africa, and Lebanon have had one or more currency debasement cycles over the last four decades. Incompetent and corrupt monetary policies steal the fruits of people’s hard work, or “life energy.”

p46ygg,Bruava,What the most basic cell phone wallet to gift a small simbolic quantity of BTC to my grandmother for her birthday for her to check it when she feels like too?,"Context here: I’ve a great relationship with my GM. I’ve been talking about BTC to my family for years but I didn’t had the money to invest at the time since I was still studying and already lived alone… (Sad me because I always thought that BTC was the future since 2014-2015 when I first came across the concept).
Last year I changed my Job and got a good raise. So I started DCA since February after liquidating my student loan.

I told my GM about it, and explained her about everything a way she could understand
the basics. She has some spare money and she then proceeded to give me 1k to invest in her name (in Portugal we don’t pay taxes for selling if it is not your main income rent) so I did it and joined her sats to mine because she trusts me and althought se uses internet, she as almost 80 and It’s not that easy to her to manage learning to use some “apps”. I told her we could see a loss of around 30% - 50% this year, but most likely we would see the money raising at least 50% by the end of the year. So, recently I told her we could hit a 60-70% by October November and what her wanted me to do with her sats, since I was going to keep holding mine’s for the next years. She then said that she didn’t needed the money and that she knew that HODL for long time was the way of BTC, for me to keep it and just keep her informed about the price to see if I made a good investment…

It’s her birthday on Monday, so I wanted to create a Wallet for her (best possible way for her to check it is using her smartphone) with a really simple UI and easily accessed without a lot of security since I’m only giving a simbolic value to her, so she can see it grow in the next years and feel part of the community of Crypto adopters. She has no need for anything and this seems the best gift I could offer her besides my company.

What Wallet would you suggest for her and why, knowing the simplest the better?",1628943355,29,1
p46yfn,Jasper661,Transaction rejected as too big. What do I do?,"I run a small retail store and have a wallet with around 3k very small UTXO's which I'm trying to consolidate onto a new wallet whilst tx fees are reasonable. In Electrum I created a transaction for the full amount (size: 266k) with RBF set to true, fee = 4 sat/b, signed and broadcasted the transaction but immediately got an error from Electrum saying the server had rejected the transaction as it was too big (something to this effect). 

So now I have this unconfirmed transaction sitting in my wallet. If I right click on it and select 'view on block explorer' then block stream explorer loads with message 'Transaction not found' which makes sense. I'm guessing the correct thing to do is to right click on the transaction and select 'Remove' and then attempt again with a much smaller size. However due to my inexperience I'm very  anxious about 'removing' anything and possibly double spending or messing anything up and just want to confirm the correct procedure.

* Got paid for my work 3 bitcoins in **2013** when they were about $100, sold them couple of months later for approx. $800. Forgot about it again.
* Between **2015-2016** I've had a freelance contract, got paid \~$20k total in bitcoins and I was selling those immediately because I was scared of volatility. (still have an excel file with my orders, one of orders is selling 20 BTC for $6k). Had everything in USDT then lost most of that money on an exchange that got rekt by FBI. **Do not store on exchange, lesson learned.** (Also missed the 2017-2018 hype train completely)
* In **2018-2019** thought bitcoin was dead, was very useful for me to do online transactions though, but never held more than a couple grand in BTC.
* **2020-2021** Still a part time freelancer, started researching a bit more now. Decided to keep a % from my BTC income in BTC, and swap rest to USD. **Paper handed and sold everything on march...** Realized I am an idiot later, but luckily I still followed my strategy and managed to experience the bull run, but with a fraction of what I could have had... 
* Started reading about BTC, inflation, economics. Threw in a significant sum @ **55k** and you know what happened next... I was looking at the chart when it dipped to 30k for the first time, but I was not panicking... I was angry and buying every time it dipped even further.

I was very angry, it seemed pointless... Feds printing trillions, inflation, crisis and COVID and now me losing over 50% of my investment on top of that. 

For 2 months balls deep in red I kept researching, I planned to sell most of my stack as soon as I would break even. I wanted to sell at 30k, thinking it would go lower, at 35k, at 38k you name it. Then it hit me deep... This is **the first real scarce asset**, there is will be only less than 21 million coins, DECENTRALIZED coins, it cannot be printed out of thin air and adoption is happening RIGHT NOW. It does not matter what the price is, what matters is that it is a real **FREEDOM**. I'm a while in green now, old me would have *sold\** it long time ago, but know what? **You are NOT getting my bitcoins.** I could have had hundreds, if I wouldn't been ignorant, but the price for us is what we deserve.

p463j0,h3llcat101,There is a problem with Bitcoin that nobody is talking about !!!,"FIRST OFF, I HATE FIAT CURRENCIES !!!

I USED TO THINK THAT BITCOIN WAS THE ANSWER.

THREE DAYS AGO I CHANGED MY MIND. 

HERE'S WHY. 

The people who run the major Bitcoin miners are waiting for everyone to jump ship from fiat and then they will choose to combine their processing power and hold &gt;50% of the network. 

They can now manipulate the network as they are are the new central authority. 

But it is even worst than the political system because now the central authorities are anonymous. 

You do not want anonymous people in control of your money. 

Here is my solution ... it tries to combine the best parts of distributed systems with trusted politics. 

Have fun. 

  

### Introduction

I believe that we can create a blockchain based application that  generates and maintains a dynamic database which will formalize the  natural serotonin-based competence hierarchy.  
  If I am correct the application will make it impossible for tyrannical power to sustain itself.  
  Equally, I believe the application must only contain fully authenticated  users so that trust is an inherent property of the final solution (not a  dog whistle) and therefore maximum responsibility of its users is  maintained.

### Method

The application will periodically ask participants the following question and log their answer in the blockchain.  
  ""Who is best suited to help you achieve what you want in life?""  
 Nobody must be a possible answer.  
  I believe the final result of this question will be a blockchain  representing a network of various leaders and followers. Some of the  networks will be clustered together and others isolated.  
  The person who is being nominated to be followed must be able to reject the request.  
  Newborn babies must be defaulted to their parents as leaders and the  children must be given their private cryptographic key in a secret  fashion at a specified age.  
  We must make the database publicly available so that everyone in the  world can know where they lie within the meritocratic network.  
  Every person in the network must be authenticated and the software for  the application must be both open source and publicly controlled.  
  Additionally I believe we need to couple this blockchain to a global  public cryptocurrency and remunerate users according to an equation  similar to the following.    


Remuneration = G/(n+1)T  
 Where:  
 G = Periodic inflationary currency creation  
 T = Total number of users  
 n = number of followers  
 

A known flaw in this equation is that it does not include any additional  remuneration for the people maintaining the blockchain (miners).  
  Leaders must be given the option to share a portion of their remuneration with their followers.

### Conclusion

I believe that the result of the above will be a system where people  with high competence in a given field are financially remunerated for  their merit as well as rewarded for the generosity they voluntarily show  to others. Additionally, the system will provide a universal basic  income to anyone who chooses ""nobody"" as their answer to the above  question and who are not chosen by anyone else.  
  I hope that my idea, however imperfect, can help to bridge the political  gap between the libertarian anarchists who insist that a ""no-trust""  solution (bitcoin) is the only answer to limit centralized control and  the people within central authorities who insist that trust is essential  to maintaining public order.

I am a HODLer who is convinced with the underlying idea of BTC. Recently I was researching about savings account for my BTC to increase my stacks. I was looking at ledn.io and found that they having saving accounts for BTC (6.5% APY) and USDC (8.5%). I was wondering, where they got such high rates from, especially for USDC. It doesn't make sense to me as USDC is pretty much just the greenbacks. Why would people give out such high interest rates, where commercial banks couldn't. So I delved further about stablecoins and I found out that Tether, which is a big issuer of stablecoins, seems to be quite shady about its reserve. Another article also points out that BTC trade is highly denominated in stablecoins. If the reserve of stablecoins is shady and its circulation is inflated, it means that the market price of BTC in USD would also be inflated. I understand that this could be addressed using a similar argument that BTC vis a vis USD is increasing because of money printing. However there might be two printers, namely the Fed and Tether Ltd. The former is printing what BTC is denominated against. On the other hand, if the latter doesn't have its reserve, it means that BTC has been pumped using hot air and could lose its value against USD. 

My question is, is anyone here knowledgeable about stablecoins, and can reassure me that stablecoins are truly backed by real greenbacks? And what do you folks think about my theory?

p3ma7y,BitcoinCanSaveUsAll,I wonder why all the major hardware wallet companies are slowly...,"Are slowly taking away the ability to perform message signing and verification for P2PKH addresses? As far as I'm aware all of the other address formats have no standardized way of confirming address ownership which makes this even more concerning since the only one that does (P2PKH) is slowly being taken away for support for all of the main hardware wallets of today.

Ledger took it away a few years ago when they got rid of their standalone chrome wallet (with no reason given as far as I know), Trezor recently removed this feature when they disabled their web interface (they had P2PKH signing on their web interface but pulled it from their standalone desktop download), and even Cold Card says on their website that at some point they may be disabling the use of P2PKH in the future.   

I understand that P2PKH addresses use more block space than the others, and I understand that they are more expensive to send than other formats however considering the trade off of not being able to sign messages from these addresses in a universally accepted standard between wallets (or BIP) than I think the self sovereignty aspect here way outweighs any downsides for P2PKH address uses and I don't think the wallet companies should be dictating how we use bitcoin.  

At this point in the game not only should all wallets (software and hardware) be fully implementing and supporting P2PKH message signing, (which is a standard and not wallet specific online some signing for SEGWIT addresses,) but they should all have the ability to directly connect to your own nodes so that you don't have to rely on these companies for their nodes ( and not through middleware either).  I mean who knows who really runs these nodes and what their motivations /  agendas are (AML/KYC?  insert your own theory here..how would you know if it's not your node?).  

Either way this seems like a serious attack on the self sovereignty aspect of bitcoin and perhaps may even be something much more sinister.  To further the self sovereignty I truly hope there is also some serious efforts underway to make a user friendly blockchain explorer you can simply add to your own node if you have the TXINDEX 1 in your configuration file.  This would help all be more self reliant rather than depending on your favorite web hosted third party blockchain explorer.

As always I'd certainly like to hear any thoughts about this.  Have a great day fellow bitcoiners!",1628866679,32,2

Switzerland- Mining is considered self-employment and is subject to business income tax.

Bermuda- No taxes on buying, selling, or trading cryptocurrencies.

Portugal- trading tax free. 

People can find many more places that are tax friendly to crypto.  So, why is government so hell bent on taxing crypto.  Because they don’t like the way it disrupts the system.

ow5xyf,Moustache_Group,NEWS: Kraken Marketing Director Dan Held: Bitcoin will exceed the real estate market value of $200 trillion,"Kraken Marketing Director Dan Held believes that Bitcoin will exceed the real estate market value of $200 trillion, which will bring the price of [BTC](https://zeusbtc.com/) to approximately $9.5 million per token. ""This is a wide range of numbers, but I think the market value of Bitcoin should be between ten and two trillion..."" In an interview with Kitco News, Held asked the host to suspend his $200 trillion market value of Bitcoin Skeptical, saying that he should consider the ""total addressable market for value asset storage."" He went on to list value store assets, including gold, legal tender, sovereign debt, and real estate, which themselves have a market value of $250 trillion. He added that as a store of value, all of these are ""essentially weaker than Bitcoin."" ""None of them are digitally native. Many of them can be found and censored. There are other things that cannot be done with them. They are indivisible. They are not very durable, so the currency properties of Bitcoin make it a very sexy value  Asset storage."" Held believes that Bitcoin will compete with real estate at some point, reaching a valuation of $200 trillion. However, he did not give an approximate timetable for this happening, only that it will last a long time. Recently, Greg Foss, executive director of Validus Power Corp, proposed a Bitcoin market value of $45 trillion, priced at $2.1 million for BTC. His idea is that Bitcoin may account for 5% of the global valuation of $900 trillion in assets in the future. He said that this would happen within the next decade as oil and gas suppliers abandon the U.S. dollar and switch to Bitcoin. (Cryptoslate) Although this seems to be a big problem at the moment, Fox insists that the dollar, as an inflationary asset, will depreciate over time, which is a major problem for energy suppliers.

Stacking Sats = Least amount of skill/knowledge required, least amount of risk, slowest way to grow your total stack.

BTC Interest bearing accounts = Adds counterparty risk, requires vetting the custodian and their risk mitigation models, etc etc, but also speeds up the growth of your stack, assuming the counterparty doesn't scam you or have a bad risk mitigation strategy

(The next step up ???) = Requires (ideally only slightly) more knowledge/skill and/or vetting, but can also grow your stack faster than an interest bearing account.

ozrzk8,KosmosHD,Governments shutting down Crypto," 

Another very big concern for many people is the possibility of the Chinese or any other government shutting down crypto by dubbing the currency illegal. First, any government would be kicking itself by trying to impede the use of crypto at its current level of adoption, many of which are already backed and used by very powerful corporations.

Money, by definition, is controlled by the people who agree upon its worth. If they want to tax and regulate it as real money, fine, and this is actually what is happening in most places – governments are working with crypto.

The technology of crypto actually makes that easier to deal with than regular currency, and increases its validity overall – if the government works with crypto, the currency grows in value because there is more faith in it.

However, the fact is that it is very scary for governments that crypto is not bound by international borders and that it can be exploited for purposes such as money laundering, even though the crypto like BTC is technically more traceable than fiat.

Currently, however, governments seem to be working nicely with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and the reality is likely to continue. Another positive news is that no government entity can actually shut it down even if they tried. Just like a hacker group is unable to hack Bitcoin or any altcoin, a government can’t shut it down.

In fact, even if every government in the world teamed up with the sole purpose of shutting it down, the chances that they would be able to do so is incredibly slim (in other words, virtually non-existent). Again, the entire Internet would have to be shut down completely in order for that to happen.

What the government CAN do to hurt crypto is shut down exchanges or stop certain payment companies from allowing transfers to exchanges. None of these actions will destroy Crypto, nor will it shut down the exchange of Crypto. What it will do is serve to devalue the currency and cause people to lose faith in it.

But, there will always be ways to easily exchange crypto into currency and there will always be ways to buy BTC/altcoins easily. Another factor that’s important to understand is that exchanges are located all throughout the world and new ones are coming up every day, it’s impossible for one government to control all of them unless each government cooperates to put a stranglehold on global exchanges.

So, can the government shut down Crypto? They can do a lot of damage to its reputation and cut off certain exchanges and locations where it is bought/sold, but they can’t completely bar you from it or shut it down. It’s important also to keep calm when news reports surface such as, “The IRS Seizes Bitcoin Exchange” and so on. Again, this is the equivalent of the IRS looking into a banking scandal in a small town and the newspaper stating that the value of the American dollar is about to plummet because of it. It’s simply not true. It’s natural for various problems to arise between the government and crypto, especially as Bitcoin and altcoins continue to soar in value and use.

However, these small skirmishes should not be misunderstood as some kind of major blow to the currency. So can crypto be shut down by the government? No, it is impossible.",1628337667,7,1

ozrq2u,---Det,Just. Be. Cautious.,"I see many people get enthusiastic, and somebody has to say it.

Now's not the time to over-celebrate and start longing or doing 100x leverage positions on Bitcoin. We still don't know what the US Senate is gonna decide, or who really are responsible for the recent price boosts and the subsequent \~300M short liquidations (NOTE: that's not even the largest bar in the graph: [https://www.bybt.com/LiquidationData](https://www.bybt.com/LiquidationData)).

Strategies like DCA (e.g. $100 every month) is all good, and so is HODL (just never sell), and I know the months since April have been frustrating, if not brutal, but don't put the faith of your money on cumulative emotions gained from short-term changes of greed/FOMO-scale investments (trust me, I know. I lost about 85% of my position (all leverage), and while I'm a bit peculiar and different, being rich, unmotivated, and still panicky wasn't all that great either).

About all we can guarantee is this. BTC can go up and it can go down. Long-term there's a large consensus it'll go up, and the whole year 2021 will be just one point in a big graph. Just use your own money on your own terms, your own rules and limits. There's no shame in selling for profit while the price is still going up (because it \_will\_ come down).

And always remember that whenever you buy, immediately after, the price might go up or it might come down.",1628336421,92,1

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be in twitter/reddit 24/7 to search for new yield farms. Here we can simply just go to assets page and sort by date added and it shows you all new yield farms cross-blockchain. I think the platform has like 600+ farms listed and all the assets of that farm.

&amp;#x200B;

It's also cool to see the historical yield of the farms as well as the pools itself. So you can quickly find out how early/late you are in the farming action. Sometimes it might be advised to not jump into a farm just based on historical yields.

&amp;#x200B;

On neat feature I like is that I can find nice new stable coin farms or BTC/ETH/BNB only farms. So if you want to farm quality assets, then this is a good search.

&amp;#x200B;

I think they are working to integrate the pool economics of respective pools to be able to compare like deposit fees, withdrawel fee and other tokenomics of that respective farm. Because like 1000% APY with a 10% deposit fee also sucks.

Because almost nobody is sending money from Mexico to UK (plenty of options going in the opposite direction), I haven’t  been able to find any better options in the traditional finance other than this one bank.

I’m trying to figure out a way to send the money using crypto in such a way that is extremely low cost, fast and hassle-free for the recipients (that they simply get the funds as fiat in their account).  
I first looked at using Coinbase and using USDC and sending it to their Coinbase account that they would have to set up, but then I discovered that Coinbase has no customer support in Mexico, so if anything went wrong with my initial deposit or my account got flagged as fraud, I would be totally fucked.

Are there any other options people know about and use? Basically I want a Strike app but that works Mexico to UK. Maybe I’m asking for too much, and we are still too early.",1628023266,9,1

Beginner crypto investor here! So I just read an article (see link) about the ups and downs of crypto and why that happens and I read this:

“Second, the quantity of bitcoins allowed by the system may have an impact on supply. This amount is limited to 21 million, after which mining operations will cease to generate new bitcoins.”

What does that mean for buying Bitcoin? Does that mean once we “run out” that Bitcoin would double or more at its current rate? 

And if there’s any articles, books or tips you can give me, I’m all ears!

Please help me understand something. Massive noob. So was just playing around with a new ledger nano S and sent myself a tiny amount of BTC from my Blockstream Green Wallet on my phone to my ledger nano S. Once the transaction was confirmed i viewed it on ledger live and checked the 'from address', copied it and used that address to send it back from ledger to blockstream green and it went through successfully. However, when i log into blockstream green and click on the 'receive' tab to get my public address, it's different to the 'from address' listed on ledger. Why are they different? If the transaction was successful using the 'from address' surely it should be the same as the 'receive address'. Apologies if it doesnt make sense.

I asked the above to very experience BTC guy on twitter and they replied 'Always use a new address. Never reuse addresses. Bitcoin works differently than you think'.

So i started reading about address re-use and using from addresses and some sources mention that it can compromise security and privacy. **Can anyone tell me whether by doing what i did (using the 'from address' has in anyway compromised by private keys stored on the nano ledger s??**

Working in conjunction with major tech companies, citizens not convicted of a crime could lose their ability to transact any business. In time, decentralized forms of money, such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, may be the main means for dissidents to operate — as long as the federal government doesn’t move to squash them.""

Right now we are  fighting the 100 EMA on the daily. It is now resistance. I drew the 4hr  100 EMA below the candles as well to show you all that there is some  support. I consider it weak and there isnt much between us and that  daily 50 MA below.   


https://preview.redd.it/p4t7r5h9ubf71.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea2dd747763643f8a41431c54a977449d0b9b895

The good thing about  the 50 MA is it is seemingly lined up with that bottom border of the  cloud. Double support always garners more confidence. But don't get  cocky. We still have a gap between 32500 and 34500 below. I forgot to  mention we did establish a higher high. It may not amount to much but  it's worth mentioning.   


ETH EIP 1559 was  delayed til tomorrow, not because the people at ETH are incompetent.  Rather the update is set to launch at a certain block and it will be  reached on the 5th. ETH and all alts are tied to BTC. If there is a big  drop the alts follow. Well if ETH drops will BTC fall? I remember events  like this in the past and they build up to the event and a percentage  of investors sell. Not everyone. But the ones that wanted to get in on  the possible pump. I cant guarantee anything but from my experiences I  say set a stop loss and alerts. The drop may be too fast to trip that  stop.

We are still above the cloud (BTC and  ETH) so its still sunny out. This market is unpredictable and one should  use all the risk management at your disposal in order to avert the  volatility and the risk that accompanies it. Proceed with caution. The  bears are like the orcs on LOTR. They may not be as smart as the bulls,  but there are many of them. WTFDIK???   


TLDR: No matter if the bull run is over or not, next halving load up. Look what happened in the last few halvings.",1628076678,2,1

oxpybn,Grimknuckle,Some tips for privacy and security,"This is a super simple workflow for a beginner that want to buy Bitcoin with attention to privacy and security that it would have been very useful to me to know from the start:

1. Buy Bitcoin on Relai (no KYC) just send your fiat money with a bank transfer. Relai is also a non-custodial wallet, you have your keys (keep them safe like every private key of every wallets) 

if you already have some experience: you can buy your Bitcoin with the the peer-to-peer Bisq

2. send them to another address created with Wasabi Wallet for making a CoinJoin 

if you already have some experience: you can try to study and use JoinMarket 

3. send them to another address and use Wasabi + hardware wallet 

best hardware wallet for a cold storage: Coldcard with no doubt 
but you can also use a Ledger Nano S for this combination with Wasabi (without using Ledger Live for creating your Bitcoin account, use it just for updating your Ledger Nano S) 

A full node, a VPN, a Password Manager and a Security key are additional layers of security and privacy, my suggestions are: 
Bitcoin/LN Full node: RaspiBlitz 
VPN: Mullvad 
Password Manager: Bitwarden
Security key for U2F: SoloKey v2 (open source) 

Keep in mind: you’re the only person responsible for your bitcoins, study before doing things and then hold them safe.

p795eb,Johnjohn2145,"“Bitcoin will be worth over $100,000!”","Earlier today I was scrolling through crypto twitter and saw quite a few people preaching bitcoin and other crypto currencies as if they were infinite money trees. This entire thing seems quite concerning as it’s identical to some of the tweets you can find from 2017 right as bitcoin was approaching it’s peak. It seems as if people believe bitcoin to be a company that’s succeeding and that’s what is driving the price up. They then begin to think if they’re doing good now why wouldn’t the price continue to go up. The issue here is obviously bitcoin is not a company but quite literally nothing at all. 

Bitcoin is completely unregulated and a very large majority of the circulating volume is owned by a small portion of people. Since there are no rules and laws surrounding what you can do with your bitcoins these very wealthy individuals can move the money as they want to. Let’s say something happens in the future, a really large event of some sort, which causes the United States to feel the need to outlaw crypto currency as it’s a threat to national security. If this was to happen you could see a situation which involves the very small grouping of people that own almost all the coins. Let’s say a couple people start to realize the absolute catastrophic blow to crypto if/when this goes through. This small group may get cold feet and decide it’s time to start selling. Now even if this small people is only a few they’re part of the tiny portion of people that own most of the coins which means when they start selling the price begins to move. If at this point more of the large investors see this as a major problem they may also begin to follow which could in turn create a beginning to a free fall. The real issues begin when the average person buying bitcoin hears about the lack in faith from the people who have the largest investments. This person will then begin to think logically about their investment as if the people most educated about this area are pulling out then maybe they should follow. At this point a complete free fall would be happening and nobody would know where the bottom is.

Some could argue that an example like that is completely unrealistic, I get it. However I also have a somewhat more reasonable example to go alongside it. 

Let’s say this some small group of majority holders decide to get together and discuss the future of their investment. All the people involved here understand the deregulation and know that if a majority holder unloaded their investment would be at risk. If someone was looking to get out, they should probably plan accordingly and leave at the same time. This could the have a large impact on the value of the currency. Bitcoin is known to be very volatile and could fall dramatically over a very short period of time. People would begin to panic and sell alongside.

I must admit I'm horrible with computers so I've spent around 3 days so far watching youtube videos on a night trying to understand bitcoin as it really seems to be picking up steam and I kind of regret not doing it before! I know I'm probably way too late for the huge gains but, as someone that didn't really get a lot growing up, I want to give my child a good opportunity to have some money when they are my age.  


I guess my question is, can I make a bitcoin account for my child now or do I need to wait for them to be born? I thought that part of the whole point of bitcoin was that nobody can tell who is using it so its a little confusing that a lot of these ""exchanges"" seem to be asking for my passport info. On top of that, if I give them my info, will my child be able to use that account in the future?  


Sorry for being so dumb about this but genuinely I live in a small town and struggle with excel so bitcoin is a whole new world for me haha!

1. People feel more confortable spending, when they feel good about their savings and future. 
2. People tend to diversify when their money makes up a too big part of their portfolio.

1. Is there more evidence to this effect?
2. Can you think of more reasons this might be true?

p7jru3,johnturtle,A new lightning faucet for the newcomers! Already distributed to 4000+ users.,"TLDR: Our new lightning faucet (https://LightningNetworkStores.com/faucet) is an open and smart faucet that always gives away at least one satoshi. No action is required in return. People can donate to it anonymously or get featured. The goal is to introduce new people to the lightning network and grow it to one million users.
----

You might have heard about [LightningNetworkStores.com](http://lightningnetworkstores.com/) before, we have been tracking merchant adoption of the bitcoin lightning network (LN) since February 2018. About one month ago we launched an LN faucet that pays with LNURL-withdraw (avoiding copy/pasting an invoice). The user experience should be quite friendly: just click a button and get satoshis.


The amount that can be claimed has varied between 250 sats and 45 sats and it is the balance between how fast users and the faucet are receiving satoshis. Money goes into the faucet from mainly two sources: part of the revenue from the website and donations to the faucet. When users donate to the faucet they can [choose how fast](https://i.imgur.com/PvobB7x.png) their donation will be distributed and whether they want to be anonymous or not. If the user is not anonymous he will be featured along other donors according to how much he is donating per new faucet claim (sats/claim). Donors can donate multiple times and their donations will be aggregated. There is a third source of money for the faucet, hCaptcha, but this has been negligible so far.


You can see usage statistics of the faucet [here](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/stats). The data there excludes some behavior flagged as abusive and might be subject to tweaks. We won't go into details on how we prevent abuse, but if you are curious feel free to message us or take a look at our [github repository](https://github.com/lightningnetworkstores/lightningnetworkstores.github.io) to get an idea.


Why did we build a faucet now? In our case, it can generate better traffic than social media adverts whose crypto policies are very uncertain. This ends up being simpler in the long term. Additionally, there is no continuously running bitcoin faucet that we know of, but since we have LN it's possible to have one. Most people are being introduced to LN with custodial wallets like Wallet of Satoshi and Bluewallet which require no setup. Having an open faucet where you can always get a few sats was the missing piece for a good UX when getting started with LN.


Enjoy!",1629395111,1,1

From there I was holy shit. Threw every dollar I had. Got a small loan for 35k shortly after. Threw all of it in. Shoulda got bigger lol. Took a new sales job in my industry moved to a new state been selling all year. Didn’t go as well as planned but been accumulating. 

Now I hit my first major goal. Throw away account but close to 10. I had to hit this specific number before crazy levels because was worried. Now I hit it my next goal is 10 which will probably happen next year depending on how fast we shoot ip. If it’s on avg 100k then I’ll be able to do it by next fall I hope. If not I’m content. 

Next year goal is to get to 10 then 11. At the same time will pay off my car, the loan and all my debt. 

It’s on a hard we’re wallet. All backed up on titanium. I’m not low iq so not afraid of being hacked etc. I’ve studied Btc non stop then.

I opened and account on Uphold, uploaded my passport, it was shut down and I thought ""of course it's because I'm from Venezuela"" but today I noticed that they enabled my account again and I contacted the support team and they told me that I can use Uphold from Venezuela without any problems and my account is currently verified, I just need to start investing, but I wanted to investigate a little bit more and see if there were better options and Uphold.

I also have CashApp and I know that it's possible to buy Bitcoin on PayPal, but don't know if it's the best way to buy crypto. So, any tip you have for me, I'll thankfully take. 

I heard Binance, Gemini and Kraken are the best ones, but there are so many options, I don't know which one to download. Also, my account on Basecoin, I had to use a VPN for Colombia, my neighbour country, but my passport is Venezuelan so probably they will deny verification for my account so basically I don't think Basecoin is an option for me.

The book makes a really good point about the fact that it doesn't make sense for more than one single cryptocurrency to exist.

As a matter of fact, crypto exists to solve many of our current monetary issues. And one of these issues is all the different currencies in different countries and trying to keep up with their relative price fluctuations and their inherent inefficiencies.

If that's the case, then what is the point of more than one crypto? Wouldn't we just be swapping a host of national currencies to a host of crypto currencies?

Additionally, aren't all these altcoins developed around a small group of developers who usually have quite a lot of control on how the code of the currency works? Isn't this a sort of currency centralization?

I understand the appeal of investing in these altcoins for speculation.  
Hell, I do it myself. I understand there's an opportunity to make a quick buck investing in these altcoins, and I often do this.

p9p837,Raptorel,Bitcoin voluntary individual marketing campaign,"I have an idea on spreading Bitcoin awareness after discussing something similar in the Digibyte subreddit.

We each can help spread Bitcoin awareness. Stickers, messages, billboards, announcements, facebook ads, whathave you. But what if we could do this systematically and fairly, with the help of other people that can't do it/don't want to do it/don't have time to do it but can help with money?

The idea that I have in mind is this. Suppose I can print 10 stickers with Bitcoin and a particular positive (and true) message about what Bitcoin solves, how you can buy Bitcoin and so on. I then ask for a certain amount of Bitcoin for going and printing the stickers, putting them in particular place etc. Say I want 0.001 BTC for this. Then someone replies in this post that they pledge to pay me (I'm not talking specifically about myself, here, but about anyone that can do such a thing) after I do what I promise to do. I will do it out of my own pocket, after which I post pictures of actually doing what I said I will do: putting the 10 stickers with the agreed-upon message/picture etc. After this is confirmed through pictures, the guy that pledged he will pay for it sends me the 0.001 BTC that he or she pledged. Of course, this will be public, everyone will see who asks for how much and who pledges to pay once the work has been done.

At worst, the guy pledging won't pay. That would be bad for him or her publicly (and pretty ridiculous) but I have a feeling that someone else from such a huge community would chip in and pay.

p9onyg,NearlyMunsoned,Help me understand the long term Bitcoin security/mining model,"So I'm hoping that you guys can help me understand how the mining model of bitcoin is sustainable in the very long term, because right now I don't get it, and it's making me uneasy about the amount that I have invested. 

I understand that every halving provides 50% less rewards for miners, and over time more of the rewards will come from transaction fees. It also seems (and this has been true so far) that over time the halvings will become less and less explosive to the price of bitcoin. 

So if the price of bitcoin starts levelling out in the long term (not increasing at such a high rate and less volatile), then shouldn't the mining hashrate start to decrease over time, as there will be less incentive for miners to secure the network (thin margins due to competition + halvings come faster than the price of bitcoin doubles)? 

It seems likely that the transaction fees will increase substantially as the number of users on the network grows, but I don't see them increasing enough to stabilize the hashrate due to lightning network, exchange transaction batching, network upgrades, etc. Also people will just move bitcoin less if it's very expensive to do. Another factor is that long term the bitcoin that is lost will outpace the amount of new bitcoins, so the circulating supply will continue to shrink over time, which I believe would reduce transactions.

To me it seems that these factors would lead to total miner income decreasing over time, which would reduce the amount of mining, which would make it less and less expensive for an entity to get the hashrate needed to attack the network.  

TLDR; I don't understand how miner transaction revenue wouldn't slowly decrease in the very long term, making the network vulnerable to attack. Explain why I'm wrong so I can feel better about being 60% invested in BTC.

p9n43j,betweterweethetbeter,How do you see the future of bitcoin?,"I am only just looking into bitcoin, and one of the first things I have learned is that there is a hard cap of 21 million. Meanwhile, more and more companies, politicians and other people and organizations seem to see bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) as a valid currency for the future, but the odd thing to me is that many people seem to envision it being used world-wide for small, everyday transactions. There are currently almost 8 billion people on this planet, of which around 300 million in the US and 450 million in the EU. Even if bitcoin would be owned by only 200 million people, each would own around 0,1 bitcoin on average, and the median bitcoin owner would own much less. If bitcoin would be used as it is for everyday transactions, the amount of bitcoins would be impractible small, so how do you see the future of bitcoin? Do you think it will used as an everyday currency, if so, how do you envision that this problem will be solved? Will bitcoin be split up in a much smaller currency that will actually be used (is this even possible with the current system)? Or maybe you think that people will not care that they are technically trading in 0.000001 bitcoins? Do you think bitcoin ownership will flow naturally to a larger part of the public?

Or do you think that the ownership and usage will actually stay very small, that it will be only a currency used for 'art and diamonds', so to speak? Maybe it will mostly be used by banks to back up the value of other currencies, as is currently done with gold (as far as I know)? But gold is an actual, physical metal, while the storage of bitcoins only costs energy that could have been otherwise applied.

If anybody would be willing to answer the following I would appreciate it.

1) How come more people don’t use Bitcoin Core and the associated wallet to store their bitcoin? It seems like the most logical place knowing the node could verify your transactions and it’s the official software of Satoshi? 

2) I understand that the purpose of a bitcoin node is to verify all of the transactions on blockchain and then you can be assured that the bitcoin sent to you are 100% legitimate. My question is if I were to be running a Bitcoin full node and I were to send all my bitcoin to the wallet on the full node (which is bitcoin I’ve been accumulating from exchanges) would this then verify all my bitcoin is actually legitimate? In other words what’s the quickest way to verify all my stack of bitcoin through a full node, it’s currently in a Ledger hardware connected to Ledger servers. 

3) Lastly is a question regarding miners using mining pool like SlushPool. All the combined hash power is combined but where how does SlushPool connect all the miners to the Bitcoin Core network to mine?

The Fed shows that M2 money supply is very close to 21 trillion which presents us a unique opportunity to calculate how much bitcoin we'd need as a fraction of total supply (21 million) to be worth the equivalent in easily-convertible dollars. Bear in mind this assumes that bitcoin will eventually take over the M2 supply, in other words, bitcoin's market cap is 21 trillion (its currently just under 1 trillion today).

For instance, if you wanted to eventually have the equivalent of 10 million dollars after bitcoin ""takes over"", then you'd need the same fraction of bitcoin as $10 million / $21 trillion. Since 1 trillion is 1 million million, the fraction reduces 10 / 21 million, which equates to 10 bitcoin. If you want your net worth to be $100 million after bitcoin becomes the standard, you'd need 100 coins, and so forth.

tl;dr: The cash and near-cash supply is close to 21 trillion, so you just need 1 coin per $1 million dollars once bitcoin takes over. As printer goes BRR and M2 supply inflates to $100+ trillion the numbers won't be so easy to calculate, so do the easy math while you can, kids!",1629743690,12,1

But there are perks to it, too. Such as buyer protection, which by the way sometimes all sorts of scammers try to use, making returns. And the fact that their ecosystem covers a large part of e-commerce in the U.S. and part of the EU. Because of this, the tool is extremely popular with Western payers and sellers from East to West.

On a good note, PayPal is not just going international with other competitors. In all likelihood, it plans to challenge cryptocurrencies themselves to get on that pedestal. He has already done the same thing once with card payment systems, regionally cutting into Visa and MasterCard with his popularity.

It's worth noting that Thiel's other brainchild, Palantir, doesn't trade bitcoin, but gold. So if PayPal is going to get together in a pantheon of cryptocurrencies or stabelcoins, it will not rely on ""paper"", but most likely on ""metal"" and its ecosystem. 

At the moment, the cryptocurrency purchase functionality is not available to British users, but is promised within a week, so while there is still time, I want to remind you. 

Any bitcoin purchase from PayPal is ""not real"" until you put it to an external blockchain address on the BTC network. For as long as your bitcoins are inside PayPal, it controls them, not you. So if you don't have a way to get it out, it won't be bitcoins, it will be ""derivatives"", which are already plentiful on the market, along with the hype around payment systems, and the event is not worth paying attention to.",1629742826,6,1

Of course the real number of folks who truly have possession of their own keys is much much lower than that.  Especially when considering how many UTXOs you have yourself.  Remember, each transition is part of the UTXO and if you have sent bitcoin to the same address more than once then there are many UTXOs per bitcoin address with multiple transitions.  

I think it's time for the community to wake up and have a renewed push for people to hold their own keys.  Otherwise we will continue to be controlled by the legacy financial institutions who  rehypothecate and commingle funds as well as manipulation through derivatives, leverage, exchanges front running their customers etc.

The bulls flipped the $49,000 level to support on Aug. 23 and pushed the price above the psychological level of $50,000. After crossing above EMA100 line, BTC found support on the MA20 ($45.9k) . The relative strength index (RSI) is near overbought levels, which could encourage profit taking around resistance. However, Upside momentum is strengthening on the  daily chart, which suggests buyers are in control. The critical zone bitcoin needs to reclaim is $55,000-$58,000.

1. Time is not on your side. As you get older, you will see friends deny this. I'm 38. Get a plan. As fast as possible. If not, you wake up 50, in a small apartment, and say where did life go. If you are 50 in this situation, let's go and turn things around.
2. You have more opportunities than you can imagine. It is your choice on whether you want to pursue them.
3. Don't use money you need to pay bills on investments and don't used borrowed funds. These create very stressful situations.
4. If you want to go for it, go for it. But actually go for it. Live like a poor person if you're the salesperson of the month. Embrace the pain. Put off rewards for 2 years.
5. Most of our wages will go down over the next 5 years. Jobs are being replaced by computers at a massive clip...so your wages will go down in real value.
6. Most ngmi-I've realized most people go with the flow. They get on the river of life and hope there are no rocks.
7. My typical friend makes $15k a month, has no kids, and 8/10 have no bitcoin.
8. If you blow the next 5 years, it's on you.
9. Don't tell your boss how much btc you have. Be very careful about who knows what.

I'm in the U.S., so the sample letter is highly-U.S. centric, but please feel welcome to adapt it and use it in whatever jurisdiction you are in around the world.  Of course, governments cannot stop this revolution, but they could surely slow it down.  If we can continue applying constant pressure to elected representatives in a collective effort, I am confident that we can have a positive impact.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Representative \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,

Over the past month or so I have evolved into a single-issue voter. Are you for protecting and fostering the innovative Bitcoin and crypto space or are you against it?  If you are for innovation in this space, and can confirm that with me in a personalized letter, I will get behind you.  I will support you with both words and action to their allowable limits. I will become one of your strongest advocates in our district.

Here is what is happening. Secretary Janet Yellen and other Treasury bureaucrats have personally lobbied members of Congress for the inclusion of highly vague and restrictive language, which was surreptitiously slid into the infrastructure bill at the last moment, and recently passed by the Senate. Their target is what is known in the Bitcoin space as “decentralized finance” or DeFi, which is a vast new ecosystem of futuristic financial tools built on public decentralized blockchain infrastructure. Their target is also second layer technologies, such as the Lightning Network, which runs on top of Bitcoin.   
 These technologies provide financial access and inclusion to the traditionally excluded masses, and offers opportunities for all people throughout the world to access lending markets, yield, and hard crypto assets. DeFi is uplifting the lives of millions of people around the world, and within the next few years, possibly billions of people.  These technologies are spreading influence of the $dollar even further throughout the world on crypto rails, and are providing a bulwark against China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) advances. Janet Yellen’s approach to regulation would hurt DeFi and the spread of the Lightning Network in America, and drive jobs and wealth overseas. This misguided effort must be stopped, or else America’s financial stake in the future will be damaged beyond measure. The legislative branch has the responsibility of drafting legislation with consent of the governed—not nameless unelected bureaucrats within the Treasury Department.

What is needed is to either 1) entirely remove the crypto-related language from the infrastructure bill, or 2) exclude **non-custodial** participants in the crypto space from the requirement of submitting 1099s, which would be impossible to comply with. **Non-custodial** participants in DeFi are usually individuals, and simply do not have customers, nor do they even have access to the information required to complete a 1099. You should understand that even the compromise amendment (that didn't get adopted by the Senate) **did not** have an exclusion for **non-custodial** participants, and therefore, **did not** go far enough. It defies logic to pass this kind of law unless the sole goal is to drive innovation and wealth out of America. Many people now make a living wage or better from participating in the Lightning Network and DeFi, and many of these people would sooner leave American altogether and take their wealth and jobs with them if Janet Yellen and Treasury were to get their way.

So, I urge you to come up the learning curve on Bitcoin and DeFi, and to get behind the fastest growing technology and most innovative space in America. The smartest people in the room are the ones involved with this technology, and it is rapidly seeping into the lives of ordinary Americans. Our state is a hot bed for this technology and start-up businesses that have latched onto it. Don’t yield to the temptation of regulating this space out of existence in the United States. If that happens, it will still exist; it’s just that America and Americans would lose out. Again, if you reply to me with a personalized letter including a commitment to protect this innovative space, you will have my vote and undying support.",1629784220,2,1

2.) Keep your coins safe, ideally in a hardware wallet . If you want to use an exchange Coinbase is at least a public company registered with the SEC.  

3.) Stay away from shitcoins. 

4.) Don't trade bitcoin. No one can make sense of the swings, buy and hold for 5 years and see how much you make.  

5.) Don't get too caught up in in the swings. Over the years I have seen my coins go up 1000% and then down 80%. Don't get caught up in the fud or fomo, think long term. 

6.) Plan your personal moon. Have an exist strategy to pay off your mortgage, college loans etc. when you hit certain amounts.

7.) Always keep some. You never know how high it will go in the future so always keep some BTC long term.

Good luck friends",1629779533,258,1

pbabh2,lars2137,My tragedy story about 2500 bitcoin," 

**Hello, I'll tell you my story with bitcoin which is a tragedy, I'd rather never have it.**

I come from Poland, in 2010 I was about 17 years old, one day I read on the internet about bitcoin, they wrote about the future, that you can keep it on a flash drive, I was very interested in it and I decided to buy it. I downloaded my wallet and read about mining, but I was not interested in mining, just buying and maybe one day it will grow 10 times more, I managed to find a website of probably some miner who was selling bitcoin for about 10 cents. The purchase was through PayPal, first I bought it for $ 50 when everything was ok, I spent another $ 200. I kept it on my computer for about a month but I was buying a new computer and decided to put it on a USB stick. The problem was that I never needed a flash drive and I lived about 30 kilometers from the city and from the nearest electronics store, grocery stores and schools, I had next to it, I practically did not move from my village. I asked my father, who had an accounting company in the city and went to the city every day, to buy me a good flash drive in the store, unfortunately he did not buy it and brought from his office a new ironkey flash drive, which they used in their company on a daily basis. I made a password and transferred the wallet.dat file along with the word document with the password to the wallet to this flash drive. I put the flash drive into the box with my old computer games and this is how the time passed, I was studying at school and I didn't think about bitcoin. In the meantime, I moved, finished my studies, and started working for my father in the office. I never heard bitcoin anywhere on the internet again until 2017. While watching the news on TV, they started talking about bitcoin, I was very interested in it because they were talking about a huge increase, at the beginning I did not see bitcoin, but after some time I realized that I have bitcoin but I don't know where, I started remembering everything, I went to my parents' old house and started search the cellars for my flash drive - I managed, very lucky I found the flash drive. I put it into the computer and a password query came out and everything started since then, so far I have entered the password 8 times, unfortunately there are only 10 attempts, after this time the files on the pendrive are deleted. I contacted kingston, hackers, IT specialists - NOBODY CAN BREAK A PASSWORD. Since 2017, I wake up pissed off every day with this flash drive in mind. I'd rather never hear about it and never have one, tell me what would you do with a flash drive like this? I have little hope for life in connection with quantum computers, which IBM is to introduce to a higher dimension there from 2023, there is talk of the bitcoin threat and the quantumcurrency QRL that I bought and I keep it on an ordinary wallet and a pendrive without any password. What ideas do you have on what you can do with this bitcoin wallet?",1629894894,15,1

I was trading on Poloniex since 2016 and made 3k into 1.3M until it fell down to approx. 310k or something. Quite a sum. In the winter of 2018 / 19 a large part of it got stolen over the period of nine days. Every day it was 25k USDT that was extracted from my Polo-account between 28dec till 5jan.  

Upon further inspection, my account had been seized due to my email being breeched and important info was stolen. 

I saw that a Russian telephone number was now associated with my account, still the withdrawals were made under the IP from my own country.

We will release more videos to report on how Bitcoin adoption is going in El Salvador. Next, we will release a version with English subtitles on Monday.

In the mean time - if you are pro-Bitcoin would be interested in 'liking' the video and subscribing - **it would help us to reach more people in El Salvador and Latin America**. Bitcoin in El Salvador will only work if regular Salvadorans understand Bitcoin and get onboard.

pdfrwy,Youngdumandbroke,What Bitcoin Means for the Ex-impoverished,"I'm sure you've heard rags to riches stories before. Bitcoin is a new part of these stories. 

As someone who has lived in homelessness, hunger, and poverty, I see Bitcoin as a top priority asset.

Prefaced tldr: I was raised in a college educated but financially illiterate household. Disaster after disaster left my family homeless and hungry on multiple occasions, inspiring me to achieve financial wisdom and grow my own wealth as an adult.

The meat of the story:

Wealth building for someone who spent their childhood in poverty is a form of securing their future. I don't do it for the lavish lifestyle. I don't do it so I can buy a lambo and show off. I do this because the screams of my starving baby brother still haunt me, as do the memories of holding back sobs while giving my dinner (ketchup packets) to my siblings yet again.

After going out on my own, I pledged to:

1. Use daily labor to acquire more depreciating  fiat. 

2. Convert that fiat into appreciating assets before it depreciates (or I get the chance to spend it on myself). 

Assets include bitcoin as a high percentage, real estate with the strict policy of reinvesting returns into more real estate, rare collectibles and precious metals, and goods that I could barter or sell in a downturn (ammo, weapons, food, fuels, ""camping"" supplies, medical devices and supplies).

3. Leverage gains from my low level investments to acquire more of my high priorities.

4. Repeat.

I've lived through multiple natural and economic disasters and downturns. My family has been robbed, made homeless, left hungry, and forced to fight for our resources.

I started by storing canned food in a suitcase as a kid, and I've been laughed at for it. But as time passes I am building wealth so that no disaster will ever see my children hungry in the wintertime or burning trash to stay warm. 

So far, my child has never known hunger or discomfort. Has never stepped foot into a daycare or been left alone with an abuser. Has no concept of greed or want. We've had hiccups; I've had to sell off some gold and guns. But I believe I've reversed a generational curse and successfully moved up at least 2 classes. 

Big respect for anyone else who grew up not knowing when they'd find food again or where they'd sleep tonight. We can do this.",1630177428,10,1

pddg9w,waamusic,Is Coinbase something like a Ponzi scheme after all?,"Sorry if I post this in the wrong subreddit but Coinbase left me no choice and I am on the verge of desperation.

On September 2019, I moved back from US to Romania, my birth country because my father passed away.I was planning to return to the US no later than the Christmas holidays because I had no income whatsoever during my stay in Romania. However, I decided to stay a little longer to help my family during these times of need.

I had some savings and some investments, such as my Coinbase portfolio, which at that time was around $2000.Seeing that my family's situation is dire and my presence is needed more than ever, I had no choice but to prolong my stay for an undetermined period.

March 2020, we all know what happened, my chances of going back to the US any time soon were slim to none.

Few months of struggle, burning through all my savings, the unexpected happened, my crypto portfolio quadrupled in a matter of weeks.

This was happening somewhere in November 2020, coming as divine intervention. It's when I decided to move my crypto assets into a cold wallet for security, ease of access and my own peace of mind.

You can imagine my surprise when my attempts to login to Coinbase were denied by the very own 2 factor authentication measure that was forcefully imposed by Coinbase earlier that year,

the sms verification. I want to highlight the fact that I did not choose this extra security measure of my own accord, the constant harassment and pop ups led me to give in and comply.

I no longer had access to my US mobile number, I suspended the subscription during my stay in Romania to avoid extra unnecessary charges.

I contacted Coinbase support and they replied, advising me to create a new account with my Romanian details, in order to verify my identity and to regain access to my main Coinbase account.

I followed their instructions step by step, only to lose their interest entirely, not receiving a single reply for 3 weeks, with the exception of the automated spam, of course.

Worried out of my mind, I created a topic on Reddit to complain about my situation and maybe it helped, maybe it was just a coincidence but 3 days later, I got access to my main Coinbase account.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, it was just a mirage, I had no control whatsoever, they gave me the ""power"" of sight, namely that I can only log in and see my assets and scroll up and down. I can't access my profile, I can't trade within or outside of Coinbase, deposit or withdraw, access my profile, nothing at all. They basically just gave me a screenshot of my account with a note in the header saying:

""Your account is currently being reviewed and we need some time to verify your info. During this review, you won't be able to use Coinbase. Reviews generally take a few days so sign in every day or two to check your status.""

This is going on since February 2nd. I subsequently opened multiple support tickets only to be greeted by the same old automated system, some of which stating that my issue was resolved and they have closed my case.

My portfolio was now worth around $50,000 and I was being supported financially and morally by the very people I came to help and support a year back, my family.

The travel restrictions got lifted and I am free to go back to the US any time I please but I am horrified by the prospect of giving Coinbase additional motives to delay my resolution.

I have no other choice but to stay and try and solve this with any means necessary, shaming them across all social platforms, filing a lawsuit, protesting to anyone who would listen.

To make things even worse, I am now helplessly observing how my portfolio has halvened in the past few weeks. I am, however, 'signing in every day or two to check my status' as they advised, ruining every morning for the past 4 months. It's like Groundhog Day for the wicked.

The moral and financial damage inflicted on me by this ordeal is reaching life-changing heights and I am ready to start a legal war if necessary but still, after everything, I only want access to my assets.

I did nothing wrong but moved to my home country to support my family in a time of need.

I plead to anyone who is willing to assist me in this matter as I have ran out of options.

Thanks in advance and shame on you Coinbase!!!

&amp;#x200B;

\-- T H E  S T O R Y --

I'm a trader or we are (I'll get to that in a moment). We are a circle of friends who have gradually come to crypto trading, mostly Binance or Bitmex or Ftx. Over the last 3 years we have grown a small circle of 7 (or now only 6, I'll explain right away) friends. We shared our successes and defeats, exchanged signals and all in all it was actually quite successful for everyone (well the last 3 months fortunately not).

so about two years ago we sat again over a beer and talked about possibilities and one of us said he knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who organizes a big pump and dump group. we joked and the evening got longer and at some point it was just said, yes then tell your contact that we want to participate. 3 weeks nothing happened at all (XD) and our happy life went on until someone had our circle of friends birthday and invited us to a drink.

So we met a few days later in a pub (yes, we all live in a big city) and talked a little bit until someone (the one who knows one, who knows one, who knows one...) said that he has contact with said pump-and-dump group (an anonymous chat room where you should be logged in at a certain time on Wednesday). By the way, it was Wednesday. We made jokes and laughed a lot and brushed the subject aside. But at some point it was time and we were curious and entered the chat at said time.

&amp;#x200B;

\-- F I R S T  C O N T A C T --  (&lt;-- By the way i like the headline respectively karpitelmark visually) 

""Hello, am I right here""... no we weren't... because no one was in the chat room except us. But we didn't know that until a person (DKFJEISHSKD was his nickname, or something like that) appeared in the sidebar. ""Hello, am I right here?"" my buddy wrote again and 10 sec later appeared under our message ""what do you want?"". ""I want to be included in your group,"" our friend wrote. The name disappeared from the chat room and we first looked at our buddy in disbelief and then started laughing at him. 2-3 minutes passed and we had already turned to our beer again when we suddenly heard ""there is another one"". our friend was not alone in the chat room. ""How much do you want to invest"" appeared on the screen. our buddy looked at us ""I have 13K"" and when he pronounced it he was already typing. ""fuck off"" appeared on the screen and he was alone in the chat room again. and it stayed that way. And that remained the case. The evening was 2 hours longer and we make fun of him and finally on the way home.

It took 2 months (or 3) and we sat again for conversations and crypto analyses and especially for beer in one of our pubs. The evening got longer and the alcohol level rose to threatening heights and our buddy started again with the pump and dump group. ""I wrote with the guy"" ""Who?"" ""The guy from the chat room!"" he was still 2 times in the chat room, ""and what does he say, (here was still some stupid joke)"" ""Well this time I said that I want to invest 100,000"" ""But you don't have 100,000"" ""well first I brewed 25,000 otherwise it will be nothing anyway"" And again a joke about making money at the station echoes over the table. Why actually 25,000 asks I and was now again caught by a strange curiosity. ""As an entry"" (insert here any joke about money through hard work in the parking lot) ""He will answer my e-mail in 3 days"" We looked in disbelief and blasphemed about our buddy that he would only have to make 13000 quickly, he was the one with the least assets because he had recently subjected his car to a major repair. The evening dragged on again come we lay together (&lt;-- let's call him ""Asshole"" in the future). ""Yes, or, a much better idea, we don't do it!"" Asshole tried to talk to us well ""yes when we put it together it's not so much"" and at the end of the drunken bend it was the best idea that ever flowed from our creative source. One service remained, however, was that the initiator of the whole thing (who knows someone who knows someone, who knows someone...) has to contribute 10,000 of his hard-traded dollers and the rest of us the rest.

&amp;#x200B;

\-- D A Y  O F  B I L L I N G --

3 days later, me, the asshole, the initiator and 2 others of our group met us at the initiator's home. Excited and almost silent, we stared at his laptop. we were eagerly awaiting an email. but nothing happened at the agreed time. ""look in the spam"" why should the mail go into spam folder, went last time also on the normal inbox but we looked anyway, a mail from another email address was in it, it was quite long. It was described how a pump and dump works and honestly that he of course invests 2-3 days before and we are just in the lowest level. 6 hours before the pump. and a BTC address with the hint that we would have 3 days again. We wrote 2-3 mails back but got no more answer.

From our group of seven people, there were now only five of us. Two of us thought it was a stupid idea to send it to a stranger BTC. But hey No Risk no fun or something. In addition, we were already fixated and much too curious and I for my part feel a bit like Jame Bond (XD).

We finally agreed that our buddy was still there with 10000 and the rest of us shared the rest. Finally, we pushed the BTC into the wallet, which we had created solely for this purpose. I still remember that I was somehow very shaky when everything was entered so far. Our friend at the computer turns to us on his chair, with his finger over the Enter key and looked at us. I think it took minutes (in reality it was maybe 5 seconds) until the one standing next night to the laptop hit my friend's button with his flat hand, he jumped immediately, tore his arms up, waved his hands and pretended to run away. Normally it would have been funny, but it was just a weird situation. We looked at the monitor and saw ""Withdraw succfull""

&amp;#x200B;

\-- M A N Y  D A Y S  L A T E R --

""fuck you, it was probably your shitty idea"" The group chat in the coming days was full of wild insults and friendship announcements followed by absolute silence. It was kind of strange, because in the last few days the chat was just glowing with messages. ""He answered"" was on my phone one morning and never in my life had I woken up so abruptly. Three weeks after we transferred the Bitcoins, Three fucking weeks in which our friendship was put to a hard test like never before. Hundreds of messages immediately followed. The initiator sent a picture of his laptop with an email open. Tensely, I zoomed in on my mobile phone to read the font more clearly. There were dates to recognize, with the note that you should indicate when you want to join the pump and with how much you are there. Of course, we decided for everyone and after a short back and forth we agreed that we could raise 20000.

It took another 3 days until an e-mail from another sender came back. 20000 was too little for the first pump (on the list, it was a small pump with few participants) and we would only be able to join a single pump a month. For the pump, it is probably important that not always the same people are involved, otherwise the exchange will notice who is pump trigger and sometimes freeze the wallets. At the end of this long email, a date was recorded behind which the words: ""20k, is ok?"" could be read. We wrote that it was OK, although we had to wait 2 weeks longer for our first pump. Wait without any hints or mails. That seems to be a cornerstone in this scene and you have to bring a good portion of patience, but even this would not be forever.

Slowly we became restless, because it was only a week until the longed-for day. This restlessness was broken again one morning when I looked at my phone. ""Wednesday 7:30 at Mir"" was written on the much too bright display. The reason was that we should join our pump. So the week flew by or the first 2 days and we all met (yes there were seven of us again XD) at the initiator's home. We watched the mail inbox. Nothing. It was 8:10. Still nothing. A strange quarrelsome mood spread again, until finally a small 1 above the post symbol of the browser could be seen. We opened the e-mail. In it was a BTC pairing, as well as a time and various limits. Immediately we opened the chart and noticed a strange change in the minute chart. We watched him for another hour, 3 of us already had to go to work and I am also slowly pushing for us to buy the coin. Said done and already I was on my way to work. ""I set the limits a bit lower and used OCO"" I read in the chat before I took a lunch break.

&amp;#x200B;

\-- L I V I N G  A S  F U N  A S  I T  I S -- 

Again and again I checked the chart. It was unbelievable, we had already made the first percentages. It was just before 5 p.m. when I moved to the most remote corner of the office and stared spellbound at the screen. Suddenly, only a green vertical line could be seen on the mobile phone. I got a blissful feeling when I saw the line dancing up and down. By the way, the first messages from the group chat appeared at the top of the screen and after 3 minutes the whole spectacle was over. ""33700"" or something like that was the decisive message.

On the same evening we all met in the well-known pub, but today the atmosphere was extraordinarily good. We ordered even the most expensive whiskey, although me and another didn't drink whiskey at the time (meanwhile I like some very much, maybe it started that evening).

So the weeks passed. We always received an e-mail at the beginning of the month with a list of pump data. At some point, these were even provided with complex analyses as well as with expected profits and participants. Frighteningly, it was usually quite accurate and over time we postponed our limit order to the recommended retail price. 2 times not everything was sold as hoped but we had still been able to make a bit of profit via Stop-los. We quickly made 200,000 and of course wanted to use them completely. In response to the usual email, however, we got that no more than 150,000 should be set, as some of the accounts have been frozen. In a heated round of discussions, we decided to listen on the advice of the stranger. The fear of losing everything again was too great.

&amp;#x200B;

\--  D U M P - D A Y  -- 

It was time again and the pump was getting closer. By now it was already routine and some of us only asked in the evening how it went. Meanwhile, we had 2.2 million on our wallet. Slowly the question of what we should do with the money piled up. Some wanted to retire, some wanted to buy a house. We agreed to continue until we have 5. That would be enough for everyone.

So it went on, month after month. By now, most of us had nothing to do with it. The initiator took care of everything, gave feedback and as usual we met from time to time in our local pub. A very nice time, as you were absolutely secured. I looked at the wallet from time to time and was happy when there was a ""little"" bit more on it. But this pleasant feeling was never to come back, when suddenly several messages in a row could be read in the group chat. ""We were hacked"" ""Shit you everything is gone"". Immediately I opened the Wallet app and there I saw it: ZERO.

FAT ZERO. I could hardly believe my eyes when someone wrote in the group chat that we had been hacked. A screenshot followed. ZERO. Well, a few dollars were already on it, 36 to be exact, why we do not know. Immediately I opened the Wallet app and there I saw it: 36 dollars.

I got very cold and my work colleague also said if everything was ok. I said yes, it already fits. But of course it wasn't. I took the rest of the day off and immediately drove to one of us. We quickly agreed to hire a lawyer in the group chat, but one of us was suspiciously silent. In fact, the asshole didn't write a single word. A few hours later we realized that he was not available, we called him at home and also at work. We learned from his boss that he quit head over heels a few days ago. Okay, now we know who has our money. FUCK. By the way, the asshole was even one of the two who initially did not want to participate.

All the same. It's been a few weeks now and none of us are facing a pile of shards. Since we have led our previous life as normal as if nothing had happened, we could just keep going, only that no one has traded since we put everything in the pumps every 4 weeks. So no one had anything left, well except for one... by the way, he was no longer at his wife's home. She herself didn't know anything and said he was a real ass because she paid the last 8 rents. So this is the current situation

We are all fine, we are still pissed off and had a lawyer involved as well as the police and also our pump contact, but he only said that this was not his problem, and we never heard anything from him again, but he is still in the chat once a month, and looks for new people but unfortunately we do not have the means to start again at the moment and above all none of us wants to make a group anymore. I myself have been able to do a little bit well about pump-and-dump tickets again okay maybe it gnaws a bit.

So now the question, is there a way to somehow find the transactions or the asshole? Or at least to block the Bitcoin, which he at least can not use it to continue trading? Yes, I know that this is feasible to a certain extent, but only for people who really can do it. Can you tell me where I could find contact persons? Or in general how we could proceed? Don't want to let him get away with it just like that.

pcigle,IllProduct89,Topic ideas for blockchain bachelor thesis in a big financial services company,"So, I will be starting my bachelor thesis soon.
It will be the biggest scientific paper that I have worked on and I am slowly understanding the process behind it. 

Through a good friend I got the opportunity to write my thesis for a big financial services company who is interested in exploring the use of blockchain in their business model. Since they have not touched this topic before, my supervisor gave me a lot of room to come up with ideas. 

Basically we a looking for a way, how the company can use blockchain technology or existing blockchain protocols to change their business structure and stay competitive in the changing market. 

Of course with the essence of blockchain being decentralisation, one could argue that all traditional business models will end up being peer-to-peer managed and there won't be a seat at the table for big companies whatsoever.
But surely there are some opportunities for companies to create value even in a mostly decentralised economy.
Especially in the transition time to come I could expect something such as company's offering services to support decentralised platforms or to help reduce the entry barriers for people to use defi services that are not so tech savvy. 

If you resonate with this topic and have an interesting idea/question/thesis I would be happy if you could share it here to be discussed :-) 

Please keep in mind that this will be an scientific paper and there needs to be sufficient literature and ways to generate data to support the given thesis.
Maybe you have experience in scientific work and can give a brief outline on how to approach the idea. 

Looking forward to your comments and discussions.",1630048805,13,1

pci78b,baha24news,"Bitcoin has erased 30% since April highs, but does it matter for its long-term success?","Bitcoin, the world’s first decentralized digital currency, was created 12 years ago and has been since breaking records both when it comes to its trading volume and value. The price of Bitcoin reached its record-high of more than $64,000 in mid-April of 2021, only to tumble to just over half of that a couple of months later. 

 

# Bitcoin’s road to becoming the world’s top cryptocurrency

For several years after it was created by Satoshi Nakamoto (one or more persons known under this pseudonym), the price of Bitcoin struggled to register any major gains. The cryptocurrency finally became widely popular across the globe in 2013 after its price soared from $13.30 to as much as $770 for a single Bitcoin by the start of 2014. Since then, despite numerous ups and downs it has been on the rise with the price reaching nearly $65,000 on April 14, 2021, after which the latest sell-off began. However, despite losing 30% of its value since reaching the record level, Bitcoin’s market cap is still larger than all of the world’s other cryptocurrencies **combined**.

 

# What caused the latest Bitcoin drop?

**China’s crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading**. Bitcoin sank more than 10% in late June after the Chinese government implemented sanctions on trading and mining of the cryptocurrency. At the time, China’s Financial Stability and Development Committee stated that one of the key tasks of the country’s financial sector “in the next phase” will be “cracking down on Bitcoin mining and trading.” The [announcement](https://www.baha.com/china-to-crack-down-on-bitcoin-mining-trading/news/details/55547834) was made during the 51st meeting of the panel, which was presided over by the country’s Vice Premier Liu He. The measure was revealed as part of the policy to “resolutely prevent and control financial risks.” In addition, the committee also sought that China’s financial system serves the real economy further and that it should “continue to deepen reform and opening up.”

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Twitter’s influence on the crypto market and the role of Elon Musk.** The negative sentiment skyrocketed last May following the statement made by Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who [announced](https://www.baha.com/Tesla-suspends-Bitcoin-payments/news/details/55465936?internal=1) that his carmaker company suspended the use of Bitcoin for its vehicle purchases. Tesla was “concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions,” and while cryptocurrencies were a “good idea on many levels” and have a “promising future” they cannot come at the expense of the environment, it was said at the time. However, shortly after Musk estimated Tesla would return Bitcoin as a means of payment, prompting a new increase in the cryptocurrency’s value.

**Stricter regulations worldwide.** Next to China, several governments of major economies across the globe have announced plans and/or called for regulating Bitcoin through a legislative path. Just over the past few months, European and American officials have urged their governments to regulate the cryptocurrency market.

· In the United States, Senator Elizabeth Warren [called](https://www.baha.com/Warren-calls-for-crypto-market-regulation/news/details/55944057?internal=1) on the legislators to address the risks related to the “highly opaque and volatile” crypto market.

· Across the ocean, the European Central Bank [hinted](https://medium.com/@baha24news/ECB's%20Panetta%20hopes%20for%20end-of-year%20crypto%20regulation) the European Union could introduce new regulations on crypto before the end of 2021.

· Italy’s Companies and Exchange Commission (market regulatory agency) [urged](https://medium.com/@baha24news/Italy's%20market%20watchdog%20urges%20cryptocurrency%20regulation) the government to put forward legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies.

· Finally, the British Financial Conduct Authority [suspended](https://www.baha.com/UK-bans-crypto-exchange-Binance-Markets/news/details/55842712?internal=1) Binance’s subsidiary, Binance Markets, from doing any regulated activity in the country citing security reasons.

 

# Will Bitcoin recover this time?

According to an [article](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/is-bitcoin-crash-coming/) published by the Times Money Mentor, we can’t tell for sure whether the world’s most popular cryptocurrency will return on a path of its recent glory. The latest China’s moves on shutting down Bitcoin’s mining industry in the country, which was the largest in the world, has punched the decentralization goal of crypto. Furthermore, the increasing calls for regulating the global cryptocurrency market aim to make an effect on both current and potential investors on how the future will look like. Adding environmental concerns to the negative sentiment, investing in Bitcoin could be considered as a **gamble**, especially for investors outside the industry.

The cryptocurrency market, unlike stocks, has one significant thing that differentiates it from other assets — there is no overarching authority when it comes to market hours, therefore the trading never stops and because of that, it remains **the most volatile market** by its nature. Due to this fact, Bitcoin could rally back to record levels at some point in the future. However, that could take weeks, months or even years. “Though remember, if it rises too quickly, it could fall just as rapidly. This is because Bitcoin’s price is based solely on speculation,” the aforementioned article argues.

# Rising business investments into Bitcoin could ensure its stability

If we are to pick THE one thing that could ensure Bitcoin’s long-term stability and success, that would be the fact that more and more businesses across the world are recognizing this cryptocurrency as a path towards diversifying assets, as well as by enabling customers to use Bitcoin as a means of payment. The [article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/more-companies-see-business-opportunities-in-bitcoin-51617990873) from earlier this year, published by the Barron’s magazine, summed up the story pretty well.

· PayPal made a major shift back in March when it started allowing users to pay at checkout with their crypto holdings as smoothly as they would with a Mastercard.

· The United States oldest bank, Bank of New York Mellon, announced in February it would give customers the same access to and protection for cryptocurrencies that they get for stocks and other similar assets.

· Jack Dorsey’s Square and Elon Musk’s Tesla have made major purchases of Bitcoin for their corporate treasuries worth in total multiple billion dollars. On the other hand, financial businesses, such as Insurance giant MassMutual which purchased $100 million worth of Bitcoin, are buying in the cryptocurrency directly.

Having this in mind, hopes remain Bitcoin could be a long-term success despite making the largest loss since its creation over the last several months.

pee682,Golo_red,Bitcoin promoting using energy efficiently and helping green energy (and infrastructure) build-up,"It has been a while since the big Bitcoin energy FUD, but when talking to (generally crypto educted) friends, one of the main criticisms is still around Bitcoin energy consumption. This was caused by the ongoing zero-knowledge (haha) media reports and Elon airtime. The damage that has been done will take a while to repair. 

I recommend a long but very valuable and detailed read from Lyn Alden, and recommend sharing it for information purposes. Three main lines of argumentation:

1. Bitcoin uses energy efficiently (more users per energy consumption, low percentage of market cap / stored value)
2. Bitcoin promotes green energy and helps build up infrastructure in developing countries since using surplus energy from e.g. solar makes the energy production more profitable / economically viable. **It may thus reduce the global CO2 footprint instead of increasing it**
3. Bitcoin already uses mostly renewable energy (Elon was confidently incorrect on that one. He probably knew tho and just lied)

oych36,GoldenMushroom33,Looking for knowledge regarding moving BTC around and US Capital Gains Taxes,"Hello, looking for some quick advice/knowledge on the best way to transfer BTC from Robinhood into Coinbase.

Initially when I first got into Crypto I decided to use Robinhood as it was the most advertised and user friendly app I knew of. Obviously, this was a mistake as Robinhood is terrible compared to almost any other coin exchange. Now that I have a position on Coinbase I'm looking to move my BTC from Robinhood into Coinbase.


My question: Does US taxes for capital gains look at the profit made from an asset or do they simply look at an assets value if I were to ""sell it"". Since it's stuck on Robinhood I can't just send it to my wallet so I'd have to sell it(once it gets back to my purchased price), and then repurchase it on Coinbase. 

Regardless, I'm going to try and sell it as soon as my net profit on Robinhood is as close to 0 as possible. Don't want to pay too much in taxes but also don't want to take a loss.",1628148263,11,1

&gt; ...  
&gt; 
&gt; Cryptocurrencies throw a wrench into that machine by allowing Americans to stash their assets outside the rigged financial system in a way that’s more portable than gold or other traditional hedges, and the old system has nothing to offer the customer to lure them back. Clearly, crypto’s gotta go.
&gt; 
&gt; After all, it’s not like the US central bank or its financial “regulators” like the SEC have done a great or even satisfactory job when it comes to running a functional system. Regulators utterly fail to protect consumers, leaving their pensions to be plundered by asset managers and their houses to be foreclosed on by robo-signing fraudsters. And the Federal Reserve - itself neither federal nor, these days, much of a reserve – can’t stop printing money at full speed or the whole house of cards will collapse. The US is upwards of $28.4 trillion in debt, and when one takes into account the murky global derivatives markets, whose risk is largely concentrated in the US, the figure could be orders of magnitude higher. 
&gt; 
Pointing the finger at bitcoin as if it is the source of all this instability, as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) did last month, requires stunning amnesia, especially from the woman who built her public profile railing against the “too big to fail” banks that turned the American dream into a nightmare a decade ago with a wave of foreclosures the nation never really recovered from. Warren’s gone from demanding their prosecution to attacking their enemies...

oypfo7,themop1,"China Made a HUGE Mistake, US Dollar to Reign Supreme, Western Countries Will Dominate World Wealth in BTC","From a strategic standpoint, China made an enormous blunder with its attempts to throttle innovation in Bitcoin mining domestically.  If prisons have taught us anything it's that things like capital controls do not work the way that the people implementing them intend when they decide to implement them.  Even in a prison people still find ways to get cigarettes, drugs, and even paper currency.  But even the richest guy in a prison would almost always give it all up to be free and on the outside.

What China is doing today is creating a prison for its citizens to protect its political power.  Capital controls are just one symptom of an oppressive regime.  And they are doomed to fail ultimately.  Because most people want the same things from their life and government.  They want to be treated fairly and to be left alone so that they can use their freedom to provide for themselves and prosper.  

The purpose of the state should be to facilitate freedom and to only impede upon it good faith.  Banning Bitcoin mining so abruptly is not a good faith action by a government.  It's disrespectful to the people that have been affected and it's harmful to the overall prosperity of the state long term.  One of the primary goals of a government that wants to be successful is that it should use its power to promote the highest level of prosperity that it can for its citizens.  That means helping people be productive.  That's the whole purpose behind building roads, dams, sewers, electric grids, etc. etc.  THAT IS THE BACKBONE OF WEALTH.

People might hate corporations for their greed but there is also a lot of wealth created because of it.  I can buy a cheeseburger for a dollar at two in the morning because of greed.  I have a wireless mouse because of greed.  A king in 1500 by almost every measure is poorer than an average person living today in Western Countries because of greed.  

The United States is dominating Bitcoin.  We have 80 percent of the Bitcoin ATMs already.  It's difficult to know for certain but we probably control 80 percent of the supply of Bitcoin as well.  

My point is that if this thing does become worth 1 million dollars a Bitcoin the Chinese are going to look back on this period of time as a monumental mistake.  Because they will have made the dollar the permanent world currency because most of the trading for BTC is settled in dollars and it will be an enormous market.  It means all the third world countries with weak currencies will trade in BTC and dollars as well.  If China were thinking clearly they would realize that they NEED to be in this market to protect their longterm power.  They should lift the capital controls for this asset class.",1628190605,70,1

Another one that I hear quite often is that it is only used by tech-oriented companies. 

There was recently a survey conducted to gauge the behavior of some of the companies that accept bitcoin to see if they really are that different from the rest. 

Things like OS, browser, email preferences were asked and almost all of them correlated with the global trends. Companies use services like **Gmail, Chrome, Windows** to operate day-to-day operations, there is no sneaky encrypted software that runs these businesses. 

Of course, this is not a full-proof result but still a step closer to dispelling some stereotypes associate with bitcoin and companies that accept them. 

Interestingly, one thing that struck out is how a majority of these companies are travel-oriented and operate in remote work setups. Just goes to show how these companies are very much part of the new trend that will define the work space in the future.

Disadvantage is obviously your lost investment

2) BTC eternally stays between $0 and $40k

Benefits are that you retain access to your current btc stack (thus reducing any potential loss - but depending on your entry point still incurring a loss) and if you happen to be a great day trader - perhaps money still to be gained on the volatility of movements between 0-40k

oxo65i,_kr_saurabh,Orbuculum: Bitcoin 2021 Analysis and Price Prediction,"***In this price prediction, we are going to break down the recent price developments in the BTC/USD trading pair and make a Bitcoin price prediction for the fourth quarter of 2021. And if you want to know if the price of Bitcoin will go up in the medium term, you will find the answers further.***

To analyse the BTC/USD price, we are going to refer to the Bitstamp price rate of BTC/USD.

## Analysis of Bitcoin’s price correction in 2021

After having peaked at $64’000 in May 2021, Bitcoin plummeted down, having lost half of its valuation along the way. The sharp fall was largely due to Elon Musk's tweet about Tesla's refusal to accept Bitcoin as payment for its cars because of the negative environmental impact produced by Bitcoin mining. This allegation caused many United States-based Bitcoin holders to dispose of the major cryptocurrency, and then more stakeholders joined the panic sale.

As a matter of fact, BTC/USD plunged to the 4-hour support level at 34’967 on 23rd May and was eventually upheld by it. A slight recovery followed the fall, stabilising Bitcoin in the region of 34’967 – 40’000 until mid-June. On the 7th of June, Bitcoin managed to break down below the support level on the daily timeframe. This opened the way to the 2.618 Fibonacci level at 30’897.

 

Then towards the end of June, the authorities of Chinese province Sichuan sanctioned the closure of its major Bitcoin mining pools, which accounted for 15% of Bitcoin's hashing power. This might have put more fuel to the fire, encouraging Bitcoin's steep decline, as its block time grew to 23 minutes on the average from the arbitrary 10 minutes.

On 22nd June, Bitcoin even sank below 30’000 but had rebounded into the green by the end of the trading day. Before the end of June, Bitcoin attempted a recovery above 34’967, but the sellers checked that one, with the price ending the month on the level. This confirmed that the 34’967 level had become resistance.

BTC/USD was steadily trending down from the start of July, being pressured by the 20-day SMA. And the price range was being narrowed to the region between 32’000 and 34’967, the latter consistently suppressing attempted upside reversals.

  

## Bitcoin price prediction for Q4 2021

In the current state of things in the BTC/USD chart, an exit out of the sideways trend could look to be a viable option in the next few weeks. Speaking of likelihoods, a breakdown below the 2.618 Fibonacci retracement level looks to be the likeliest one as all recent upside moves have been rejected by the 20-day SMA, and that increases the likelihood of the price being edged down to the 2.618 Fibonacci level by the 20-day SMA. And when the pressure grows, a breakdown below the 2.618 Fibonacci level would only be a logical thing.

And if the BTC/USD price breaks down into the region of 20’000s, there will be no primary support until the 1.618 Fibonacci retracement level at 20’383, with an area of technical support being present at around the 18’000 mark.

However, if a breakthrough above 34’967 were to happen, it might not necessarily be a real bullish reversal because one would require the previous high at above 40’000 being topped out by the next one. If that does not happen, the sideways channel might stretch on.

In this situation, Bitcoin seems to be gaining more long-term buyers willing to increase their long-term allocation in Bitcoin while short-term selling bias persists. Considering the simple trading logic of buying the fall, buying Bitcoin in July 2021 looks to be a rational investment decision. However, some more waiting for the Bitcoin price to decrease even more would be another reasonable move. You should not do now short Bitcoin as it is well past the initial stages of its downside retracement.

Speaking of potential buying levels shortly, the region between 22’720 and 18’000 is a very secure zone for a buying entry order. If that gets reached, the 4-hour level at 34’967 and the area at around 60’000 might be two good take profit options for the end of 2021 – Q1 of 2022.

oxn790,VergaraIrene,Taking a loan to buy more crypto?,"""I've been thinking lately about taking a crypto backed loan to buy more crypto with. Even at a 10% interest rate you could buy something solid like ETH, which will probably 3-4x this bullrun. Then when you sell you pay back the loan/interest and keep any profit on top of that. Has anyone done this or know anybody who has? Whats a good way to get low interest loans right now?""  
I read this post from 3 months back, all the replies say this guy is dumb, but he made a point. Average ROI of BTC, ETH and ADA is 100% annually, says you take a loan for 1 BTC at LTV of 50% (BlockFi is 50%, MyConstant is 67%, Nexo I don't know), you can buy another 0.5 BTC, at the end of year you pay them 9% of interest, let's say 1BTC is 40,000$, that be 3600$. In one year time you are left with 1.5BTC at 80,000$ that turn into 120,000$-3600$=116,400$. It will work the long run, doesn't work for the quick dick surfers.  
I dont say that it will 100% go that way, but hey, you're the dumdass who gamble on crypto in the first place, don't tell me that losing what you can afford shit, in the end if the market goes buff gone, you lose the shit you afford, another 3600$ compared to 40,000$?
